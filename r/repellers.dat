[...] Strange attractors occur in both {{continuous}} dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some discrete systems (such as the Hénon map). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a Julia set, which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets {{can be thought of}} as strange <b>repellers.</b> Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a fractal structure, and the fractal dimension can be calculated for them.|$|E

60|$|It {{was true}} {{that one of those}} beastly <b>repellers</b> was sneaking about off the cape, accompanied, probably, by an {{underwater}} tongs-boat. But as neither of these had done anything, or seemed likely to do anything, the British cruiser should be attacked without loss of time.|$|E
30|$|Marotto {{extended}} Li-York’s theorem on chaos from one-dimension to multi-dimension through {{introducing the}} notion of snap-back <b>repeller</b> in 1978 [33]. Due to a technical flaw, Marotto redefined a snap-back <b>repeller</b> in 2005 [34]. Marotto’s theorem shows {{that the presence of}} a snap-back <b>repeller</b> is a sufficient criterion for the existence of chaos. Let us describe {{the notion of}} snap-back <b>repeller</b> and Marotto’s theorem.|$|R

60|$|About {{three o'clock}} the signals between the <b>repellers</b> became very frequent, and soon {{afterwards}} a truce-boat went out from Repeller No. 1. This was rowed with great rapidity, {{but it was}} obliged to go much farther up the harbour than on previous occasions, in order to deliver its message to {{an officer of the}} garrison.|$|E
60|$|The <b>repellers</b> {{had never}} been vessels of great speed, and their present armour of steel strips, the lower portion of which was {{frequently}} under water, considerably retarded their progress; but each of them was taken in tow {{by one of the}} swift and powerful crabs, and with this assistance they made very good time, reaching their destination {{on the morning of the}} second day.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} a truce-boat again {{went out}} from Repeller No. 1, and rowed to the fort, where {{a letter to}} the commandant was delivered. This, like the other, demanded no answer, and the boat returned. Later in the afternoon the two <b>repellers,</b> accompanied by the crabs, and leaving the steel net still anchored in its place, retired a few miles seaward, where they prepared to lay to for the night.|$|E
60|$|Near by {{lay a cable}} boat, and {{constant}} communication by way of France was kept up between the officers of the American Syndicate and the <b>repeller.</b> In {{a very short time}} communications were opened between the <b>repeller</b> and London.|$|R
60|$|The Lenox now put on {{a greater}} head of steam, and as she was in any case a much faster vessel than the <b>repeller,</b> she rapidly {{increased}} the distance between herself and the Syndicate's vessel, so {{that in a few}} moments hailing was impossible. Quick signals now shot up in jets of black smoke from the <b>repeller,</b> and {{in a very short time}} afterward the speed of the Lenox slackened so much that the <b>repeller</b> was able to come up with her.|$|R
5000|$|The Man <b>Repeller</b> also covers {{topics such}} as current events, lifestyle, and feminism. According to Medine, she never {{intended}} the Man <b>Repeller</b> to focus just on personal style, but also on social commentary. [...] "Man repelling" [...] {{has been described as}} not being focused on repelling men, but allowing women to dress for themselves. According to the essay [...] "The Man <b>Repeller</b> and Rejection of the Male Gaze," [...] man repelling is focused on constructing a feminine identity and presentation centered around women's perceptions of themselves.|$|R
60|$|The {{commencement}} of active hostilities had been precipitated by this Syndicate. In England preparations were making by day an by night to send upon the coast-lines of the United States a fleet which, in numbers and power, would {{be greater than}} that of any naval expedition {{in the history of the}} world. It is no wonder that many people of sober judgment in America looked upon the affair of the crabs and the <b>repellers</b> as but an incident in the beginning of a great and disastrous war.|$|E
60|$|All the {{way from}} the American coast to the Bermuda Islands, the great Adamant blazed, thundered, and roared, not only because her {{commander}} saw, or fancied he saw, an American vessel, but to notify all crabs, <b>repellers,</b> and any other vile invention of the enemy that may have been recently put forth to blemish the sacred surface of the sea, that the Adamant still floated, with the heaviest coat of mail and the finest and most complete armament in the world, ready to sink anything hostile which came near enough--but not too near.|$|E
6000|$|It was now {{generally}} {{admitted that}} one of the Syndicate's crabs could disable a man-of-war, {{that one of}} the Syndicate's <b>repellers</b> could withstand the heaviest artillery fire, and {{that one of the}} Syndicate's motor-bombs could destroy a vessel or a fort. But these things had been proved in isolated combats, where the new methods of attack and defence had had almost undisturbed opportunity for exhibiting their efficiency. But what could a repeller and half a dozen crabs do against the combined force of the Royal Navy,--a navy which had {{in the last few years}} regained its supremacy among the nations, and which had made Great Britain once more the first maritime power in the world? ...|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} snap-back <b>repeller</b> for maps in R^n was {{introduced}} by Marotto [19] in 1978. Obviously, Definition  3 is given in general metric spaces, which {{is an extension of}} Marotto’s definition. In terms of Definition  3, the snap-back <b>repeller</b> given by Marotto [19] is regular and nondegenerate.|$|R
60|$|The crabs might disable some men-of-war, the <b>repeller</b> {{might make}} her {{calculations}} and discharge her bomb at a ship or a fort, {{but what would}} {{the main body of}} the navy be doing meanwhile? Overwhelming, crushing, and sinking to the bottom crabs, <b>repeller,</b> motor guns, and everything that belonged to them.|$|R
60|$|The {{effects of}} the {{discharge}} of the motor-bomb astonished and even startled those on board the <b>repellers</b> and the crabs. At the instant of touching the button a hydraulic shock was felt on Repeller No. 1. This {{was supposed to be}} occasioned the discharge of the motor, but it was also felt on the other vessels. It was the same shock that had been felt on shore, but less in degree. A few moments after there was a great heaving swell of the sea, which tossed and rolled the four vessels, and lifted the steel protecting net so high that for an instant parts of it showed themselves above the surface like glistening sea-ghosts.|$|E
60|$|On shore, in the forts, and in {{the city}} no one for an instant {{supposed}} that the terrific phenomenon which had just occurred was in any way due to the vessels of the Syndicate. The <b>repellers</b> were in plain view, and {{it was evident that}} neither of them had fired a gun. Besides, the firing of cannon did not produce such effects. It was the general opinion that there had been an earthquake shock, accompanied by a cloud-burst and extraordinary convulsions of the sea. Such a combination of elementary disturbances had never been known in these parts; and a great many persons were much more frightened than if they had understood what had really happened.|$|E
60|$|This great {{ship had}} been {{especially}} fitted out {{to engage in}} combat with <b>repellers</b> and crabs. As far as was possible the peculiar construction of the Syndicate's vessels had been carefully studied, and English specialists {{in the line of}} naval construction and ordnance had given most earnest consideration to methods of attack and defence most likely to succeed with these novel ships of war. The Adamant was the only vessel which it had been possible to send out in so short a time, and her cruise was somewhat of an experiment. If she should be successful in raising the blockade of the Canadian port, the British Admiralty would have but little difficulty in dealing with the American Syndicate.|$|E

30|$|We {{can easily}} {{conclude}} that z {{is a regular}} and nondegenerate snap-back <b>repeller</b> from Lemma  1. Hence, Lemma  1 can be summed as a single word: ‘a regular and nondegenerate snap-back <b>repeller</b> in R^n implies chaos {{in the sense of}} both Devaney and Li-Yorke’. For more details, one can see [20, 21].|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} British ships came in sight, {{the four}} crabs cast off from <b>Repeller</b> No. 11. Then {{with the other two}} they {{prepared}} for action, moving considerably in advance of the <b>repeller,</b> which now steamed forward very slowly. The wind was strong from the north-west, and the sea high, the shining tops of the crabs frequently disappearing under the waves.|$|R
60|$|The two crabs now {{took the}} steel net from its {{moorings}} {{and carried it}} up the harbour. This was rather difficult {{on account of the}} islands, rocks, and sand-bars; but the leading crab had on board a pilot acquainted with those waters. With the net hanging between them, the two submerged vessels, one carefully following the other, reached a point about two miles below the city, where the net was anchored across the harbour. It did not reach from shore to shore, but {{in the course of the}} morning two other nets, designed for shallower waters, were brought from the <b>repellers</b> and anchored at each end of the main net, thus forming a line of complete protection against submarine torpedoes which might be sent down from the upper harbour.|$|E
60|$|During {{this morning}} there {{arrived in the}} offing another Syndicate vessel. This had started from a {{northern}} part of the United States, before the <b>repellers</b> and the crabs, and it had been engaged in laying a private submarine cable, which should put the office of the Syndicate in New York in direct communication with its naval forces engaged with the enemy. Telegraphic connection between the cable boat and Repeller No. 1 having been established, the Syndicate soon received from its Director-in-chief full and comprehensive accounts of what had been done and what it was proposed to do. Great was the satisfaction among the members of the Syndicate when these direct and official reports came in. Up to this time they had been obliged to depend upon very unsatisfactory intelligence communicated from Europe, which had been supplemented by wild statements and rumours smuggled across the Canadian border.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the captain}} of the Craglevin {{perceived}} the approach of the repeller he was much surprised, but he did not hesitate for a moment as to his course. He signalled to the transport, then about a mile to the north, to keep on her way while he steered to meet the enemy. It had been decided in British naval circles that the proper thing to do in regard to a repeller was to ram her as quickly as possible. These vessels were necessarily slow and unwieldy, and if a heavy ironclad could keep clear of crabs long enough to rush down upon one, there was {{every reason to believe that}} the [...] "ball-bouncer," [...] as the <b>repellers</b> were called by British sailors, could be crushed in below the water-line and sunk. So, full of courage and determination, {{the captain of}} the Craglevin bore down upon the repeller.|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{before the}} sailing of <b>Repeller</b> No. 11, the Syndicate had {{received}} news {{that one of}} the largest transatlantic mail steamers, loaded with troops and with heavy cannon for Canadian fortifications, and accompanied by the Craglevin, one of the largest ironclads in the Royal Navy, had started across the Atlantic. The first business of the <b>repeller</b> and her attendant crabs concerned these two vessels.|$|R
60|$|This net, {{which was}} {{intended}} to protect the <b>repeller</b> against the approach of submarine torpedoes, which might be directed from the shore, was anchored at each end, two very small buoys indicating its position. The crabs then falling astern, <b>Repeller</b> No. 1 lay to, with the sunken net {{between her and the}} shore, and prepared to project the first instantaneous motor-bomb ever used in warfare.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain of}} the Craglevin was a very {{different}} man from the {{captain of the}} Adamant. He was quite as brave, but he was wiser and more prudent. He saw that the transport had been captured and forced to lay to; he saw that the <b>repeller</b> mounted two heavy guns at her bow, and whatever might be the character of those guns, there could be no reasonable doubt that they were sufficient to sink an ordinary mail steamer. His own vessel was entirely out of his control, and even if he chose to try his guns on the spring armour of the <b>repeller,</b> it would probably result in the <b>repeller</b> turning her fire up on the transport.|$|R
6000|$|Another {{event of}} a {{somewhat}} different character was the occasion of much excited feeling and comment, particularly in the United States. The descent and attack by British vessels on an Atlantic port {{was a matter of}} popular expectation. The Syndicate had <b>repellers</b> and crabs at the most important points; but, in the minds of naval officers and {{a large portion of the}} people, little dependence for defence was to be placed upon these. As to the ability of the War Syndicate to prevent invasion or attack by means of its threats to bombard the blockaded Canadian port, very few believed in it. Even if the Syndicate could do any more damage in that quarter, which was improbable, what was to prevent the British navy from playing the same game, and entering an American seaport, threaten to bombard the place if the Syndicate did not immediately run all their queer vessels high and dry on some convenient beach? ...|$|E
