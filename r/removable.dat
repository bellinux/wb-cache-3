5|$|The G2 {{comes with}} either 16 or 32GB of non-expandable storage, and {{includes}} a non-removable 3000 mAh battery. The Verizon Wireless model of the G2 offers support for Qi wireless charging. Unlike the models released in other countries, South Korean models of the G2 have a <b>removable</b> back cover, a MicroSD card slot for expanded storage, and a <b>removable</b> 2610 mAh battery.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Airborne Command {{requested}} a version with <b>removable</b> trails. A prototype was tested, but in 1943 {{the project was}} dropped as unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|In RNA synthesis, the 2'-hydroxy {{group is}} {{protected}} with TBDMS (t-butyldimethylsilyl) group. or with TOM (tri-iso-propylsilyloxymethyl) group, both being <b>removable</b> by treatment with fluoride ion.|$|E
5|$|The final {{prosthetic}} can {{be either}} fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or <b>removable,</b> where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment {{is attached to the}} implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is <b>removable,</b> a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{conclusion was}} reached in Hardman v. Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary (1986), where graffiti, although eventually <b>removable</b> by action of rainfall, was actually washed {{away by the}} local authority, incurring expense, was held to be criminal damage.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>removable</b> roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially {{resemble}} those of hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just deep enough to take an anti-tank mine. When not in use, the sockets were filled with a wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E
5|$|Debian {{releases}} live install {{images for}} CDs, DVDs and USB thumb drives, for IA-32 and x86-64 architectures, {{and with a}} choice of desktop environments. These Debian Live images allow users to boot from <b>removable</b> media and run Debian without affecting the contents of their computer.|$|E
5|$|Fixed {{pairs of}} mine rails were mounted above the stern and each pair could carry five Bréguet B4 mines. These could be {{extended}} using <b>removable</b> section stowed between decks to carry another thirty mines if necessary.|$|E
5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally <b>removable,</b> though some may be permanently attached to the teeth. Gold grills {{can be made from}} 10-karat, up to 24-karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{offered the}} enemy fast routes to their {{objectives}} and consequently they were blocked at strategic points. Many of the road-blocks formed by Ironside were semi-permanent. In many cases, Brooke had these removed altogether, as experience had shown {{they could be}} {{as much of an}} impediment to friends as to foes. Brooke favoured <b>removable</b> blocks.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 {{was fitted}} with {{detachable}} hatches and <b>removable</b> coverings to aid and ease maintenance and overhaul. The designers avoided welding parts wherever possible, preferring moulded and cast parts instead. Large airframe segments were interchangeable {{as a complete}} unit, which increased speed of repair.|$|E
5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by <b>removable</b> wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with <b>removable</b> road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
5|$|In hip hop culture, a grill (most {{commonly}} referred to as grills), also known as fronts or golds, is a type of jewelry worn over the teeth. Grills are made of metal and are generally <b>removable.</b> They began to be worn by hip-hop artists in New York City in the early 1980s, and upgraded during the '90s in Oakland. They became even more widely popular during the mid-2000s due to the rise of Southern hip hop rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip hop attained.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Pacific Fleet in 1943. She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage. They included the installation of special propellers with <b>removable</b> blades and the strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure. The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The West and East Wing {{date from}} the 1860s and are built from brick and stone. They had a lines of gun positions, each {{designed}} to hold a heavy gun and a crew of up to 12 men. The positions were protected by granite-fronted casemates and wrought-iron shields, and, with <b>removable</b> window screens, doubled as living accommodation for the crews. Small magazines were positioned behind the lines of casemates.|$|E
5|$|The Wii launch package {{includes}} the console; a stand {{to allow the}} console to be placed vertically; a round, clear stabilizer for the main stand; a Wii Remote; a Nunchuk attachment; a Sensor Bar; a <b>removable</b> stand for the bar; an external power adapter; two AA batteries; a composite AV cable with RCA connectors; a SCART adapter in European countries (component video {{and other types of}} cables are available separately); operation documentation and (in Europe and the Americas) a copy of the game Wii Sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{latest version}} of BitLocker, first {{included}} in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, adds the ability to encrypt <b>removable</b> drives. On Windows XP or Windows Vista, read-only access to these drives can be achieved through a program called BitLocker To Go Reader, if FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT filesystems are used. In addition, a new command-line tool called manage-bde replaced the old manage-bde.wsf.|$|E
5|$|The type-B plug has a near square {{cross-section}} {{with the}} top exterior corners beveled. As part of a <b>removable</b> cable, it inserts into an upstream port on a device, such as a printer. On some devices, the type-B receptacle has no data connections, being used solely for accepting power from the upstream device. This two-connector-type scheme (A/B) prevents a user from accidentally creating a loop.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also <b>removable.</b> A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, {{one for the}} driver and his assistant, and two others for the crew. The rear cargo area contained storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. The windshield could fold forward and was also <b>removable.</b> A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various <b>removable</b> alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Antony Gibbs & Sons {{may have}} {{intended}} to employ Great Britain only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger {{service to the}} Australian gold fields following the discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851, but she found long-term employment on this route. For her new role she was given a third refit. Her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail-plan altered to a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a <b>removable</b> propeller, which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.|$|E
5|$|EF-84E: Two F-84Es were {{converted}} into test prototypes, to test various methods of air-to-air refueling. EF-84E 49-2091 {{was used as}} a probe-and-drogue test aircraft. The probe was mid-span on the port wing. Production aircraft with probes (<b>removable)</b> had the probe fitted to the auxiliary wing tanks. EF-84E 49-2115 {{was used as a}} FICON test aircraft with a B-36 host. EF-84E 49-1225 and EF-84E 51-634 were test aircraft for the ZELMAL (Zero-length launch, Mat landing) experiments version for point defense, used the booster rocket from MGM-1 Matador cruise missile.|$|E
5|$|HTC One {{variants}} were unveiled {{for release}} in China in late-April 2013 with HTC TD101 802w for China Unicom, HTC TD101 802d for China Telecom, and HTC TD101 802t for China Mobile. Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a <b>removable</b> back cover, exposing a microSD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that {{it was able to}} include an SD card slot in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take up as much internal space as that of the international models.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force as an {{interceptor}} aircraft. It {{was the first}} jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF. From the outset {{it was clear that}} the type had exceptional performance, being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber. The Hunter also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records. The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time, enabled by features such as its <b>removable</b> gun pack, pressurised fuelling system, and easy handling in flight.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a <b>removable</b> rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|The Virtual Console service allows Wii {{owners to}} play games {{originally}} released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64, Sega's Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega Mark III/Sega Master System, NEC's TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine, SNK's Neo Geo console, Commodore 64 and arcade games. Virtual Console games are distributed over broadband Internet via the Wii Shop Channel, and are saved to the Wii internal flash memory or to a <b>removable</b> SD card. Once downloaded, Virtual Console games can be accessed from the Wii Menu (as individual channels) or from an SD card via the SD Card Menu. There is also a Wii homebrew community, dedicated to creating and playing content unendorsed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|The combi model, the 747-200M, {{could carry}} freight {{in the rear}} section of the main deck via a side cargo door. A <b>removable</b> {{partition}} on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck. The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.|$|E
5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks {{where they are}} available. Most HTC One models come with either 32 or 64 GB of internal, non-expandable storage—unlike the international model, the Chinese and Japanese models include a microSD slot and a <b>removable</b> back cover. Its internal components are arranged in a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the motherboard) positioned towards the back. This internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E
5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium {{in the military}} sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other <b>removable</b> vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|E
5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, <b>removable</b> media, etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, one on each side, that opened to the outside. The windshield could fold forward and was also <b>removable.</b> A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with <b>removable</b> loading ramps, cable rollers {{to act as}} pulleys, and a {{reinforced}} tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E
5|$|While {{considered}} compelling {{by critics}} for a mid-range phone {{due to its}} display quality and its optional use of stock Android beneath the default Facebook Home overlay, the HTC First was panned by critics for its poor camera and lack of <b>removable</b> storage, and was also affected by the similarly underwhelming reception faced by the Facebook Home software. AT, the exclusive U.S. carrier of the First, only reportedly sold over 15,000 units of the device, while both ReadWrite and Time named it among the biggest failures in the technology industry for 2013.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have <b>removable</b> interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E
