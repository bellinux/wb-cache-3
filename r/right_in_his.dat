A former teammate, Dick Tidrow, and the manager of the Double-A Shreveport Captains, Jack Hiatt, offered the job to Smith, who gladly agreed, since it was <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hometown. Smith still held this job with the Giants as of 2009.|$|E
5|$|The power Sejanus {{attained}} in {{his capacity}} as prefect proved Maecenas <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> prediction to Augustus, that it was dangerous to allow one man to command the guard. Cassius Dio notes that after Sejanus, no other prefect except Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, who commanded the Guard under Septimius Severus, would rise to such influence. Following his death, the Guard began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody role in the Empire. They assassinated emperors, bullied their prefects or turned on the people of Rome. In AD 41 Caligula was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard. The Praetorians placed Claudius on the throne, daring the Senate to oppose their decision. In the late 1st century, a calculated uprising of Praetorians against Emperor Nerva, led by Casperius Aelianus, forced Nerva to adopt the more popular Trajan as his son and successor.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{historian}} Oleg Sokolov {{posits that}} Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic {{victory for the}} French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time {{none of this was}} apparent to either side. Sokolov adds that the decision to not commit the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon's finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. Digby Smith calls Borodino 'a draw' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> decision to not commit the Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy, the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century, when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, {{although}} Ahlquist was <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ″one transmitter – two receptors″ postulate, he erred in {{the identification}} of the transmitter with adrenaline. There is an additional qualification. For many responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, the ATP co-stored with noradrenaline (see above) is a cotransmitter. It acts through purinoceptors. Lastly, Ahlquist failed to adduce the selectivity of all antagonists known at his time for the α-adrenoceptor as an additional argument.|$|E
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
25|$|On March 25, 1864, Forrest {{commenced}} his attack. He met Colonel Stephen G. Hicks at Fort Anderson {{and demanded}} an unconditional surrender. Knowing that Forrest's main objectives were to obtain supplies and horses, Hicks declined. For the most part, Hicks was <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> assumption that Forrest would not assault the fort, but Confederate colonel Albert P. Thompson, {{a native of}} the area, did briefly attempt to capture it before being killed with 24 men from his unit. Forrest held the city for ten hours, destroying the Union headquarters, as well as the buildings housing the quartermaster and commissary. Forrest also captured a total of 200 horses and mules before withdrawing to Mayfield. Following the raid, Forrest granted furlough to the Kentuckians under his command so they could secure better clothing and mounts. As agreed, every man reported back to Trenton, Tennessee on April 4.|$|E

25|$|One of Clay's clients was his father-in-law, Colonel Thomas Hart, {{an early}} settler of Kentucky and a {{prominent}} businessman. Hart {{proved to be}} an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature. Clay's most notable client was Aaron Burr in 1806, after the US District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss indicted him for allegedly planning an expedition into Spanish Territory west of the Mississippi River. Clay and his law partner John Allen successfully defended Burr. Some years later Thomas Jefferson convinced Clay that Daveiss had been <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> charges. Clay was so upset that many years later, when he met Burr again, Clay refused to shake his hand. Clay's legal career would continue long after his election to Congress, and in the 1823 Supreme Court case, Green v. Biddle, Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first amicus curiae.|$|E
25|$|It {{happened}} {{fortunately for}} the Duke of Brunswick, that the Count of Schwerin died in 1228, and that on his death-bed he had directed {{that he should be}} set at liberty. The Duke of Saxony, who claimed a joint <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> detention, refused at first to comply with the dying request of his friend, but when allowed to take possession of the Castle of Hardsacre and other states, as a security for the payment of his ransom, he was permitted to leave his prison. Otto reached Brunswick in September 1228, and was received by his vassals with every mark of respect and attachment. He renewed and confirmed the various charters granted by his ancestors to the city, and greatly enlarged its privileges; while his uncle, the King of Denmark, bestowed as a boon upon the citizens the liberty of trading in his dominions, without paying customs or any other dues.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Strachan {{wrote that}} it is a cliché that the armies marched in 1914 expecting a short war, because many {{professional}} soldiers anticipated a long war. Optimism is a requirement of command and expressing a belief that wars can be quick and lead to a triumphant victory, can be an essential aspect of a career as a peacetime soldier. Moltke (the Younger) was realistic about the nature of a great European war but this conformed to professional wisdom. Moltke (the Elder) was proved <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 1890 prognostication to the Reichstag, that European alliances made a repeat of the successes of 1866 and 1871 impossible and anticipated a war of seven or thirty years' duration. Universal military service enabled a state to exploit its human and productive resources to the full but also limited the causes for which a war could be fought and Social Darwinist rhetoric made the likelihood of surrender remote. Having mobilised and motivated the nation, states would fight until they had exhausted their means to continue.|$|E

[...] Rudolf Simek agrees that Hlín seems to appear as another name for Frigg in Völuspá, and that in skaldic poetry Hlín was a well-known mythological figure by the 10th century.

500|$|Shakespeare is also {{careful to}} make the {{distinction}} that Prospero presents himself as a rational, and not an occultist, magician. He does this by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax. Sycorax {{is said to have}} worshipped the devil and been full of [...] "earthy and abhored commands". She was unable to control Ariel, who was [...] "too delicate" [...] for such dark tasks. Prospero's rational goodness enables him to control Ariel where Sycorax can only trap him in a tree. Sycorax's magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible, where Prospero's is said to be wondrous and beautiful. Prospero seeks to set things <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> world through his magic, and once that is done, he renounces it, setting Ariel free.|$|E

500|$|Even {{more trouble}} {{followed}} Parliament's {{passage of the}} 1773 Tea Act.

500|$|George Harrison {{purchased}} the 33-acre Friar Park estate, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in January 1970, and soon afterwards composed [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)" [...] {{as a tribute}} to the property's original owner, an eccentric Victorian lawyer and horticulturalist named Frank Crisp. Harrison included the song on his All Things Must Pass triple album, released in November 1970, by which time he had begun incorporating into his new compositions some of the homilies and aphorisms that Crisp had inscribed around the property, 70 or more years before. A four-line verse beginning [...] "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass" [...] particularly resonated with Harrison, who eventually used it in his 1975 song [...] "The Answer's at the End". It similarly took Harrison several years to turn two inspirational lines of verse from carvings in the house's drawing room into song lyrics. These lines provided the repeated verse in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong": [...] "Ring out the old, ring in the new" [...] – which he took from the carving {{to the left of the}} fireplace – and [...] "Ring out the false, ring in the true" [...] – from the one to the <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison credits English poet Lord Tennyson as the original source for these lines.|$|E

500|$|In 1981, Christgau {{stated that}} {{although}} few critics agreed with Goldstein {{at the time}} of his negative contemporary review, many later came to appreciate his sentiments.

[...] He notes: [...] "In the sixties rock and roll began to think of itself as an 'art form'. Rock and roll is not an 'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts." [...] The musicologist John Kimsey cites the preservation of authenticity as a guiding tenet of rock music and suggests that many purists denounce Sgt. Pepper in that respect, accusing the album of [...] "mark a fall from primal grace into pretense, production and self-consciousness." [...] In his opinion, detractors regard the LP as less a breakthrough and more a [...] "break with all that's good, true and rocking". According to Christgau: [...] "Although Sgt. Pepper is thought of as the most influential of all rock masterpieces, it is really only the most famous. In retrospect it seems peculiarly apollonian – precise, controlled, even stiff – and it is clearly peripheral to the rock mainstream". In Moore's estimation, [...] "because its cultural impact was so large, it was simply being asked to do too much." ...|$|E

Soviet riflemen quickly defeated the Romanian troops defending the town {{and most of the}} surrounding region, being reinforced by the Corps' second echelon consisting of one airborne and one rifle divisions before any enemy reaction. Meanwhile, the 42nd Guards Rifle Division captured the town of Pașcani, situated [...] west of Târgu Frumos and defended by the Romanian 6th Infantry Division. At the same time, forward detachments of Bogdanov's 2nd Tank Army advancing east of the town attempted to reinforce Trofimenko's infantry fighting in the Târgu Frumos region, but were unable to do so due to German defenders. The German Eighth Army reacted promptly realizing the danger to its main defenses west of Iași, by moving Hasso von Manteuffel's Panzergrenadier Division Großdeutschland towards Târgu Frumos. Elements of the division were ordered to launch a counterattack from the south of the town as soon as possible. Attacking {{during the rest of the}} day, that small German force managed to seize and hold only a foothold in the southern part of the town. However, by this time two divisions of Goriachev's 35th Guards Rifle Corps reached the region and added their weight to Trofimenko's southward thrust. By nightfall, three divisions leading 35th Corps advance passed Târgu Frumos and established a salient [...] to [...] deep within the Romanian defense line south and southeast of the town.|$|E
