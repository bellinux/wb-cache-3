5|$|The <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this <b>reason,</b> <b>I,</b> like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
25|$|For some <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> am {{portrayed as}} the one who is evil in formulating {{policies}} that people disagree with. I consider myself a casualty, one of the many casualties of the war on terror.|$|E

25|$|My name is Sam Tyler. I had an {{accident}} and I woke up in 1973. Am I mad, in a coma, or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. Now, maybe if I can work out the <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> can get home.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing {{for me at the}} time. The <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E
25|$|The <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E
25|$|Chester County native Jesse W. Fell asked Abraham Lincoln for an autobiographical {{narrative}} in 1858. Lincoln initially refused, but eventually wrote a 606-word account, explaining that “there {{is not much}} of it, for the <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, {{that there is not}} much of me.” Fell sent this sketch to his friend Joseph Lewis in West Chester. Lewis embellished on the short account and published the biography in the Chester County Times on February 11, 1860. The first published biography of Lincoln, it was circulated in newspapers across the U.S. and was considered crucial in securing the Republican nomination by Lincoln himself. The building that it was written in is today known as the Lincoln Building.|$|E

The play enjoyed a successful initial run in 2008, and a similarly successful rerun in 2014. Tony Roper wrote the play to highlight the passionate but good-natured support of Celtic fans during the UEFA Cup campaign, stating [...] "The <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> wrote this was not to celebrate Celtic not winning the UEFA cup, the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> wrote the play was to celebrate Celtic supporters' way of not winning the cup." ...|$|E

In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> changed my mind was because I was scared of it.

500|$|The cover quickly drew {{criticism}} for highlighting a dark {{period in the}} character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time.
