5|$|Alonso <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> {{the grass}} at turn one again on lap 15, which {{resulted}} in him falling further behind Hamilton. Three laps later he made a similar mistake at the same turn, resulting in him sliding across the grass {{for the third time}} in the race. This caused him to drop back to fourth as it allowed Massa to go round the inside of Alonso into third.|$|E
5|$|Samakh was {{regarded}} by both Allenby, the British {{commander of the}} Egyptian Expeditionary Force, and the German General Otto Liman von Sanders, commander of the Yildirim Army Group, as a key strategic point. The town controlled the most direct road to Damascus on the Ottoman lines of communication and the Palestine Railways which <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> a series of bridges across the Jordan River from Deraa.|$|E

5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|At 3:55am on December 9, 1981, in Philadelphia, {{close to}} the {{intersection}} at 13th and Locust streets, Philadelphia Police Department officer Daniel Faulkner conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle belonging to and driven by William Cook, Abu-Jamal's younger brother. Faulkner and Cook became engaged in a physical confrontation. During the traffic stop, Abu-Jamal who was driving his cab in the vicinity, observed the altercation, parked, and <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the street toward Cook's car. Faulkner was shot from behind and in the face. He shot Abu-Jamal in the stomach. Faulkner died at the scene from the gunshot to his head.|$|E
5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E

Judah {{had trouble}} landing punches effectively against Green {{for the majority}} of the fight, but in round ten, he knocked Green down with a left hook. Green beat the count, but Judah then <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the ring and sent Green down to the canvas with a right hand, forcing the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the street to tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} in the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers heard the story, he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would get in trouble. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E
5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were clutching to be searched – caused the driver not to allow them back on the coach. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E

5|$|Captain Murray {{then took}} Levant {{on a cruise}} to hunt for French or American vessels off Cadiz. While {{pursuing}} this task in June 1779 he <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the Spanish battle fleet, comprising 32 ships {{of the line and}} two frigates, heading south towards an unknown destination. Spain was still nominally a neutral power and after a brief exchange of pleasantries the Spanish fleet left Levant unmolested and continued on its way. Murray immediately set sail for England to report that the Spanish were at sea, pausing off Land's End on 17 July to capture the French privateer La Revanche. Levant finally reached Portsmouth in late July but by this time Murray's news of the Spanish fleet was out of date; Spain had already declared war on Britain and her fleet had reached Gibraltar to commence an extended siege.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
5|$|King Charles I {{attempted}} to enclose and sell {{two thirds of}} the Chase, as part of a wider attempt to raise revenue for the Crown from the sale of Royal forests. The attempts to enclose the lands, used as commons, resulted in riots, part of a pattern of disturbances that <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the disafforested royal lands. In 1633, the Court of Exchequer Chamber of Charles I decreed the rights of the public to {{two thirds of the}} lands on the Malvern Hills, and rights of Sir Cornelius Vermuyden and his descendants, and the Crown, to one third (quoted in the preamble to the Malvern Hills Act of 1884). By that time, Malvern had become an established community and the major settlement in the Malvern Chase.|$|E

5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> England, {{from the}} Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, his sons, {{and other}} Confederate {{soldiers}} encountered Union Army cavalry along Grassy Lick Run south of Romney on April 24, 1862. Parsons carried a double-barreled shotgun, {{and proceeded to}} fire his weapon at the Union forces at close range. As Parsons made his escape from the Union Army forces, he saw his son fired upon as he <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the road, and supposed he had been killed. He traveled {{to the home of}} a Mr.Hott, and told him of the news of his son's possible death. Parsons became pale and was helped down from his horse by Hott's sons, so he would not fall. According to Hott, Parsons died moments later.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps Simpson's {{most ambitious}} project was the laying of a {{submarine}} cable between Cape York and New Guinea. A cable laying ship, the SS Mernoo, was chartered, and two old cables that <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the Bass Strait were lifted and re-laid across the Torres Strait in October 1943. When the land connections were completed in December 1943, it became possible {{to send a}} message all the way from Melbourne to Port Moresby. Simpson, who was on an inspection tour of New Guinea, was on hand for the receipt of the first message. In November 1944, he visited the front in the Netherlands, Belgium and France, returning to Australia via the United States and Canada.|$|E

5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The walls had {{at least}} five gates, {{typically}} positioned near angles in the city wall, although, judging from the location of Roman roads, {{it is possible that}} another two Roman gates may also have existed. The gates linked to the network of major roads that <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> Kent. The Riding Gate, which took its name from the red bricks with which it was built, had two protective towers and a pair of entrance arches for pedestrians and carriages, as probably did Burgate. The Worth Gate, the London Gate and the Queningate had simpler entrance arches. A sequence of square towers protected the walls, and at least one additional wall tower was constructed following the Saxon invasion of Britain in 367.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it <b>ran</b> <b>across</b> his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
