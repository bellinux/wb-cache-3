5|$|Since 1778, this taxon {{has been}} <b>recombined</b> {{numerous}} times into different genera and subgenera. Nearly {{a century after}} Born's description, in 1877, the Swedish naturalist Otto Andreas Lowson Mörch proposed a new combination and transferred this taxon to the genus Cassis and subgenus Semicassis. In 1944, the American malacologist William James Clench <b>recombined</b> the species as Phalium (Semicassis) granulatum, and five years later the Brazilian naturalist Frederico Lange de Morretes <b>recombined</b> it as Semicassis granulatum. American malacologist Clifton S. Weaver reallocated it in the subgenus Tylocassis in 1962, though American malacologist R. Tucker Abbott <b>recombined</b> it as Phalium (Tylocassis) granulatum six years later. American malacologist Andrew C. Miller <b>recombined</b> it as Phalium granulatum in 1983, and German malacologist Kurt Kreipl <b>recombined</b> it as Semicassis (Semicassis) granulata in 1997. The currently accepted combination, Semicassis granulata, was proposed by New Zealand paleontologist Alan Beu, based on paleontological data.|$|E

5000|$|Electrons which diffuse {{from the}} cathode into the P-doped layer, or anode, become what are termed [...] "minority carriers" [...] {{and tend to}} <b>recombine</b> there with the {{majority}} carriers, which are holes, on a timescale characteristic of the material which is the p-type minority carrier lifetime. Similarly, holes diffusing into the N-doped layer become minority carriers and tend to <b>recombine</b> with electrons. In equilibrium, with no applied bias, thermally assisted diffusion of electrons and holes in opposite directions across the depletion layer ensure a zero net current with electrons flowing from cathode to anode and <b>recombining,</b> and holes flowing from anode to cathode across the junction or depletion layer and <b>recombining.</b>|$|R
30|$|At low intensity, {{excitons}} tend to {{be highly}} localized and cannot be separated, so they <b>recombine</b> radiatively.

Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.

5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then <b>recombined.</b> By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5|$|The Cliffords {{successfully}} <b>recombined</b> {{the former}} Vieuxpont estates by 1333, {{and were able}} to controlled the Eden valley through their castles at Appleby, Brougham, Pendragon and Brough. Robert Clifford controlled Brough by around 1308 and improved the defences, rebuilding the east wall and constructing a new hall, alongside his apartments which were located in a new circular tower, called Clifford's Tower. These apartments may have been similar to those surviving at Appleby Castle, also built by Robert.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{algorithm}} for {{the measure of}} local and global contrast in digital images. It applies locally, at various sub-sampled levels, a simplified computation of local contrast based on DOG and finally it <b>recombines</b> all the values to obtain a global measure. The proposed method comes from the modification of a previous algorithm with a different local measure of contrast and with a parameterized way to <b>recombine</b> color channels. As new approach we propose the idea of <b>recombining</b> the channels following measures taken from the image itself. Preliminary tests and results are presented and discussed...|$|R

The system allows to represent individuals of the search space and genetic variation operators in a coherent way as graph-programs differing only in the operator set. Seven variants of meta-evolution are tested on three real-world classification problems. The most complex variant consists of three meh-levels where graph-programs on meta-level 1 <b>recombine</b> individuals of the search space (base level), graph-programs on meta-level 2 <b>recombine</b> programs on meta-level 1, and programs on meta-level 3 <b>recombine</b> programs on meta-level 2 and themselves.

Each frame had been taken using a different color filter: blue, green and violet, with exposure times of 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds respectively.

5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus <b>recombined</b> at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Elmer Riggs {{published}} {{a study that}} described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the Grand River Valley near Fruita, Colorado, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age {{to those of the}} Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described Brontosaurus. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus ajax, Riggs realized that the holotype of A.ajax was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since Apatosaurus was the earlier name, Brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus. Because of this, Riggs <b>recombined</b> Brontosaurus excelsus as Apatosaurus excelsus. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to Apatosaurus, Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to A.excelsus.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be <b>recombined</b> into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly <b>recombined</b> together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E
