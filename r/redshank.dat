5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, <b>redshank,</b> tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted <b>redshank,</b> common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted <b>redshank,</b> curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, <b>redshank,</b> curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting avocet. Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing, common <b>redshank</b> and sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers. Eurasian spoonbills, ruffs and black-tailed godwits are present {{for much of the}} year, and a pair of little egrets bred {{for the first time in}} 2010â€“2012.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{competition}} for a limiting resource {{on the population}} dynamics of competitors is usually assumed to operate directly through starvation, yet may also affect survival indirectly through behaviourally mediated effects that affect risk of predation. Thus, competition can affect more than two trophic levels, and we aim here to provide an example of this. We show that the foraging success of <b>redshanks</b> Tringa totanus (L.) foraging on active prey was highest {{in the front of}} flocks, whereas {{this was not the case}} for <b>redshanks</b> foraging on inactive prey. Also, when foraging on active prey, foraging success in a flock decreased as more birds passed through a patch, while overall foraging success was not lower on subsequent visits to the same patch. Thus, <b>redshanks</b> foraging on active prey suffered from interference competition, whereas this was not the case for <b>redshanks</b> foraging on inactive prey. This interference competition led to differences in activity: <b>redshanks</b> attaining a lower foraging success had a higher walking rate. Greater activity was associated with wider flock spacing and shorter distances to cover, which has previously been shown to increase predation risk and mortality from sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (L.). We conclude that behavioural adaptations of prey species can lead to interference competition in foraging <b>redshanks,</b> and thus can affect their predation risk and mortality through increased activity. This study is one of the first to show how interference competition can be a mechanism for behaviourally mediated indirect effects, and provides further evidence for the suggestion that a single species occupying an intermediate trophic level may be simultaneously top-down controlled by a predator and bottom-up controlled by a behavioural response of its prey...|$|R
50|$|This new marsh, {{together}} with another, {{designed to be}} managed as a brackish marsh with lagoons, now forms an RSPB reserve. Freiston Shore is home to pied avocets, common <b>redshanks,</b> ringed plovers, northern wheatears and marsh harriers in spring and summer. In the autumn and winter migrating waders such as common <b>redshanks,</b> ruddy turnstones, dunlins, and waterfowl such as dark-bellied brent goose and Eurasian wigeon, can be seen.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common <b>redshank,</b> Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, <b>redshank,</b> sandpiper and godwit.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common <b>redshank,</b> dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as corncrake, hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet their energy budget animals must often {{increase}} their risk of predation, either through their choice of foraging location or by decreasing anti-predation behaviours, which are incompatible with foraging. I investigated the starvation-predation risk trade-off in <b>redshanks</b> overwintering {{in the area of}} the Firth of Forth in Scotland over different spatial scales. On a small spatial scale, where <b>redshanks</b> foraged in an area where risk of attack was high I investigated the role of competition for food and decreased individual vigilance within groups and how this related to predation risk, additionally I looked at the relative roles of individual variation in time spent exposed to risk and variation in anti-predation behaviours on individual survival time. On larger spatial scales of 100 s of meters and over several kilometres, I considered how choice of overwintering site was affected by predation risk, profitability and population density. Time available to feed increased with increased group size, allowing <b>redshanks</b> to compensate for increased competition and allowing large groups to form, thus decreasing individual predation risk. Individuals that spent less time exposed to attacking predators survived for longer, however individuals constrained by cold weather to spend long periods exposed to risk could increase their survival through increased intake rates and vigilance. On an intermediate spatial scale <b>redshanks</b> selected overwintering sites based on profitability rather than risk, and only used less profitable site when population density was high. On a large spatial scale <b>redshanks</b> increased their use of less profitable sites in warmer weather, but did this without increasing their risk of predation. Overall this suggests that across most spatial scales <b>redshanks</b> can minimise their predation risk by their choice of foraging location, but when forced by weather conditions or competition to be exposed to attack, capture reducing behaviours also reduce predation ris...|$|R
50|$|Adenostoma sparsifolium, <b>Redshanks</b> or less commonly, Ribbonwood, is a multi-trunked tree or shrub {{native to}} dry slopes or {{chaparral}} of Southern California and northern Baja California.|$|R
50|$|The {{summer months}} bring {{breeding}} birds to the wetland areas and saltmarsh. The RSPB are also {{creating a new}} area of wet grassland to attract breeding lapwings and <b>redshanks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The island's bird life is {{particularly}} rich in waders such as curlew and <b>redshank,</b> found at The Ouse and Veantro Bay, and gull and tern colonies on the rockier shores and cliffs. pintail, shovellers and whooper swans are regular summer visitors, {{and there are}} also breeding populations of shelducks, hen harriers and bonxies. There is an introduced population of red-legged partridges. Otters can be seen at the Ouse, Lairo Water and Vasa Loch, and at various places around the coast along with common seals and Atlantic grey seals. There are plans to build a hide to allow visitors to observe seals without disturbing them. Shapinsay and Hoy are the only two larger Orkney islands that lack the Orkney vole (Microtus arvalis orcadensis). Wildflowers abound in the summer, and the lichen Melaspilea interjecta, which is endemic to Scotland, is found in only three locations, including Shapinsay. In addition to the RSPB reserve at Mill Dam there is a Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve at East Hill in the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, <b>redshank,</b> great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the bird}} species spotted here in winter include greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, {{northern}} pintail, northern shoveller ducks, sandpipers, plovers, terns, gulls, osprey, painted stork, Asian openbill stork, glossy ibis, black-headed ibis, western reef egret, little egret, intermediate egret, great egret, greenshank, common <b>redshank,</b> spotted <b>redshank,</b> godwits, pied avocet, Eurasian curlew, spot-billed pelican, stints, peregrine falcon and common kestrel.|$|E
40|$|The main {{tenet of}} Hamilton's â€˜selfish herd theoryâ€™ for the {{evolution}} of group living is that individual risk of being killed upon attack by a predator is greater when relatively far from conspecifics. Here we examine the role of spacing using video analysis of encounters between <b>redshanks,</b> Tringa totanus, in flocks on saltmarsh, and sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, surprise hunting from adjacent woodland. Targeted <b>redshanks</b> were 35 % (approx. 5 body lengths) more widely spaced than their nearest non-targeted neighbours, controlling for proximity to the hawk. Although targeted <b>redshanks</b> were also twice as slow to escape, the effect dropped out of a model containing spacing, which alone accounted for twice as much variation as escape delay. <b>Redshanks</b> were more tightly spaced on the riskiest side of the flock, suggesting they attempted to compensate for the greater risk, while birds on the edges of flocks were more widely spaced than those in the centre. Our analysis controls for most of the confounding effects associated with the edgeâ€“centre comparisons that are normally used in similar studies and provides strong support for spacing-dependent differential predation risk in the wild. In general, we suggest that positive selection for tight spacing when prey are stationary is largely due to domains of danger, but that this also leads to positive selection when prey are mobile because of predator confusion...|$|R
50|$|Shaggy falling shanks or {{ribbons of}} bark {{are one of}} the strongest {{characteristics}} of the Adenostoma sparsifolium tree, hence the common names. <b>Redshanks</b> are closely related to the more abundant Chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum).|$|R
50|$|The {{rocks of}} Filey Brigg {{as well as}} the {{intertidal}} zone attract numerous species of birds, such as oystercatchers, <b>redshanks</b> and purple sandpipers, which visit the shoreline in nationally significant numbers during the winter.|$|R
25|$|The {{area is a}} {{haven for}} seabirds such as fulmar, petrel, cormorant, shag, <b>redshank,</b> {{guillemot}} and razorbill, while the weathered rock formations host a number of plants including sea spleenwort, hare's-foot trefoil, vernal squill, sea fescue and frog orchid.|$|E
25|$|Otters have {{recently}} recolonised {{the upper reaches}} of the river, however the water vole is now confined to a few isolated populations. Notable species of invertebrates include uncommon mayflies. There is a diverse breeding bird community including lapwing, snipe and <b>redshank.</b> Wildfowl such as mallard and mute swans may also be seen, along with yellow wagtail, sedge warbler, reed warbler and reed bunting.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the winter}} {{migrants}} seen here are greater flamingo, Kentish plover, lesser sand plover, Pacific golden plover, grey plover, common sandpiper, curlew sandpiper, Eurasian curlew, osprey, little stint, Temminck's stint, black-tailed godwit, common <b>redshank,</b> greenshank, common tern, little tern, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern, Caspian tern, brown-headed gull, Pallas's gull, slender-billed gull, painted stork, openbill stork and grey heron. Thousands of Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, northern shoveller also use the backwaters.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} the village is a natural {{landscape}} that is rich in grassland birds like plovers, godwits and <b>redshanks.</b> There are also many flower rich banks including spearwort, water and field mint, ragged robin and marsh thistle.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{location}} and length, {{at low tide}} the site is a haven for local seabirds to access the rich mud of the Menai Strait, allowing close viewing of oystercatchers, <b>redshanks,</b> curlews, little egrets and the occasional cormorant.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} months {{juvenile}} marsh harriers {{can be found in}} the reedbeds, along with greenshanks, spotted <b>redshanks</b> and ruffs which {{can be found in the}} muddy margins. Cuckoos are also a popular bird seen in {{the summer months}}.|$|R
25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the bean goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the common goldeneye. Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the white-tailed eagle and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being common ringed plover, ruff and spotted <b>redshank.</b> Other common birds are the common gull, Arctic tern and sparrows.|$|E
25|$|The acid {{soils and}} peat bogs are {{unsuitable}} for earthworms so species which usually feed on earthworms such as moles {{and the common}} shrew are absent on the moors. The pygmy shrew survives by eating the insects and spiders {{that live in the}} heather. Lapwing, curlew and <b>redshank</b> breed on the moors and there are sandpipers along the streams. Wheatear and golden plovers inhabit grassier patches on the moors and ring ouzels live in stony areas. Red grouse, which feed on young heather shoots, are abundant. The heather is burned in strips by gamekeepers and farmers to encourage new heather growth to feed the grouse. Grouse shooting is part of the moorland economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, <b>redshank</b> and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E
25|$|At Greylake the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has {{a reserve}} {{covering}} , where birds including curlews, lapwings, snipe and <b>redshanks</b> {{can be seen}} in summer, with Bewick's swans, golden plovers, shovellers, teals and wigeons arriving in the winter.|$|R
50|$|These birds {{resemble}} common <b>redshanks</b> {{in shape}} and size. The upper parts, underwings, face and neck are grey, and the belly is white. They have short yellowish legs and a bill with a pale base and dark tip. There is a weak supercilium.|$|R
50|$|They {{are wary}} and noisy birds which will alert {{everything}} else with their loud piping call. Like most waders, they feed on small invertebrates. <b>Redshanks</b> will nest in any wetland, from damp meadows to saltmarsh, often at high densities. They lay 3-5 eggs.|$|R
25|$|Huxley {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} to spend {{a year at the}} Naples Marine Biological Station where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating sea squirts and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds such as the common <b>redshank</b> (a wader) and grebes (which are divers). Bird watching in childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the great crested grebe, later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.|$|E
500|$|To {{the south}} lie Teal Pool and River Pool, created in 1983 when an earth dam was {{constructed}} {{between the two}} in order that Teal Pool retained water to provide habitat for dabbling duck species, which generally include common teal and mallard. [...] River Pool is a larger expanse of water popular with wading birds, especially <b>redshank</b> and greenshank.|$|E
500|$|The [...] Chard Reservoir, {{around a}} mile {{northeast}} of the town, is a Local Nature Reserve. It is used for dog walking, fishing and birdwatching, with a bird hide having been installed. Species which are spotted regularly include herons, kingfishers, cormorants, grebes, ducks and also {{a wide range of}} woodland songbirds. Others include the great white egret, cattle egret, and spotted <b>redshank.</b>|$|E
50|$|The grounds contain large {{woodland}} and a wetlands {{nesting site}} populated by swans and common <b>redshanks.</b> There {{are a number}} of woodland, wetland and parkland walking trails. Dogs are welcome into the grounds (on leads), in Morgaston Woods and the Organic Parklands (under direct control).|$|R
50|$|The <b>redshanks</b> {{were usually}} armed alike, principally with bows (the short bow of Scotland and Ireland, {{rather than the}} longbow of Wales and England) and, initially, two-handed claymores or Lochaber axes. English {{observers}} reported that some Highlanders fighting in Ireland wore chain mail, long obsolete elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{designated}} an SSSI for its overwintering waders and wildfowl, and for its diverse saltmarshes. It has internationally important overwintering <b>redshanks</b> and nationally important numbers of dark-bellied brent geese, shelducks and black-tailed godwits. The estuary also has three nationally rare plants and a nationally rare mollusc.|$|R
