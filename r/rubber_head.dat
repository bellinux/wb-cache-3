5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the <b>Rubber</b> <b>Head.</b> Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E
25|$|Triffids later {{appeared}} in the 1981 BBC serial, {{in which they are}} portrayed much as described in the book. Designed by Steve Drewett, the triffids were operated by a man crouched inside, cooled by a fan installed in its neck; the 'clackers' were radio-controlled. The gnarled bole—based on the ginseng root—was made of latex with a covering of sawdust and string, while the neck was fibreglass and continued to the floor, where it joined with the operator's seat. The plants were surmounted by a flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>head,</b> coated with clear gunge. After the end of the production, one was displayed for a time in the Natural History Museum in London, where Drewett had once been employed. Some inferior copies of the props were later used in a cocktail party sketch in an episode of Alexei Sayle's Stuff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sketches}} featured [...] "Doctor Hewson" [...] (played by Steve Vizard), who was {{an amalgam}} of the Fourth Doctor and the then-Australian Federal Opposition Leader, Dr John Hewson; Lylo (played by Marg Downey), based on Leela; a rubber alien, who after removing his <b>rubber</b> <b>head</b> was revealed to be the recurring character [...] "Bruce Rump" [...] (spoof of Bruce Ruxton); Davros {{with the head of}} then-opposition MP John Howard; and a disembodied voice called [...] "Time Lord Malcolm", who had lost his trousers (former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser famously appeared in an American hotel lobby sans trousers in 1986). Davros was also towing a crude imitation K-9.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{versions}} of the Clawful figure. One uses the [...] "bumpy legs" [...] mold used with other figures such as Buzz-Off. The second version uses the standard Evil Warrior 'claw' leg mold.

50|$|Though Dunlop {{was late}} {{to move into}} the {{manufacture}} of car tyres Lord Montagu of Beaulieu persuaded Du Cros to buy a French Panhard & Levassor. Impressed, Du Cros obtained the rights to sell Panhard & Levassor cars in Britain and Ireland and the colonies.

2500|$|In 1902, Méliès {{began to}} {{experiment}} with camera movement {{to create the illusion}} of a character changing size. He achieved this effect by [...] "advancing the camera forward" [...] on a pulley-drawn chair system, which was perfected to allow the camera operator to accurately adjust focus and for the actor to adjust his or her position in the frame as needed. This effect began with The Devil and the Statue, in which Méliès plays Satan and grows {{to the size of a}} giant to terrorize William Shakespeare's Juliet, but then shrinks when the Virgin Mary comes to the rescue. This effect was used again in The Man with the <b>Rubber</b> <b>Head,</b> in which Méliès plays a scientist who expands his own head to enormous proportions. This new experiment, along with the others that he had perfected over the years, would be used in his most well-known and beloved film later that year.|$|E
2500|$|In late February, over a {{month after}} Donohoe died, Gardaí held a press {{briefing}} at the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) Headquarters in Harcourt Street, Dublin City. There was a renewed appeal for information made, and two replica exhibits of evidence were shown to the media for the first time. A precision panel beating hammer with a black rubber handle, a red painted section and a soft <b>rubber</b> <b>head</b> was found at the scene, and police asked the public for help in tracing its origins. Similar mallets are used by panel beaters or mechanics repairing motorcycles. Also, a distinctive green [...] "Cosatto" [...] high-backed children's car booster seat carrying a [...] "Little Monster" [...] motif {{as well as a}} graphic of a monster was in the car when it was stolen. The child car seat - suitable for babies and young children - cost €119 to buy, and may have been dumped, offered for sale or given as a gift as investigators believe was taken out of the stolen vehicle before it was used in the killing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{running backs}} coach for Vanderbilt before {{accepting}} the head coaching position at Oklahoma in 1932, Lewie Hardage played football {{as well as}} baseball for the Commodores. During his tenure at OU, he developed a lightweight football uniform consisting of foamed <b>rubber</b> <b>head</b> gear, knee pads and shin guards along with pants that ended three inches above the knee. This gear weighed approximately eight pounds, half of what the old style had weighed. He also built OU's fastest all-weather football field in his time. For much of his tenure at OU, Hardage suffered from sickness that resulted from accidentally swallowing a poison tablet his mistook for a headache tablet. Only 12 players attended spring practice in 1932, but running back Bill Pansze kept the Sooners up 3-0 {{for the first half}} of the season. A knee injury in the Texas game took Pansze out for the remainder of the season and severely slowed the OU running game. [...] "The same wolves who had harassed Ad Lindsey, began to yip at Hardage's heels" [...] because of the Sooners' poor running and blocking. Hardage was fired as head coach of the Sooners after the 1934 season. His final record at OU was 11-12-4.|$|E
25|$|Sylvester McCoy {{was joined}} by Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison and Colin Baker, with {{the first and the}} second Doctor being {{represented}} by <b>rubber</b> <b>heads,</b> because both actors had died by then, in Dimensions in Time, the programme's 30th anniversary 1993 charity special in aid of Children in Need. Except for the mannequin versions of Hartnell and Troughton, no two Doctors are shown on screen at the same time. (This story was a crossover with EastEnders).|$|R

50|$|Cowboy polo is a {{variation}} of polo played mostly in the western United States. Like regular polo, it is played in chukkars (periods) with two teams on horses who use mallets to hit a ball through a goal. It differs from traditional polo in that five riders make up a team instead of four, western saddles and equipment are used, and {{the playing field is}} usually a simple rodeo arena or other enclosed dirt area, indoors or out. Also, instead of the small ball used in traditional polo, the players use a large red rubber medicine ball and use mallets with long fiberglass shafts and hard <b>rubber</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R

50|$|L'homme à la tête de {{caoutchouc}} (The Man With The <b>Rubber</b> <b>Head)</b> is a 1901 silent French fantasy film {{directed by}} Georges Méliès. It was filmed in 1901 and released later that year.|$|E
50|$|The film is {{also one}} of many Méliès works {{featuring}} living body parts becoming detached {{from the rest of the}} body. Other examples include The Man with the <b>Rubber</b> <b>Head,</b> The Infernal Cake Walk, and The Melomaniac.|$|E
5000|$|Known as [...] "the Hammer", after MC Hammer, {{he had a}} {{group called}} Hamburger 1 with which he caught some attention. But his success came with Gumeni Glavi (<b>Rubber</b> <b>Heads)</b> when their debut album sold over 120 000 copies in 1994 which is equal to a four times {{platinum}} certification from BAMP (Bulgarian Association of Music Producers). Their second album Second-Hand Tires didn't sell as well. After these two albums in 1997 Dj Dido D {{was introduced to the}} group and the albums that followed were instant classics in Bulgarian Hip Hop. The albums were called For More Money and For Even More Money. After their success, Gumeni Glavi performed over 200 concerts in Bulgaria but after disputes within the band they split up and Sha began his solo career.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rubber-sleeved headed stud shear {{connector}} is flexible {{shear connector}} used in steel-concrete composite structures. In this work, nonlinear finite element model has been developed to simulate the failure process of the shear connector under shear loading. The stress distribution, deformation, crack propagation and failure mode were analyzed. The material nonlinearities of <b>rubber,</b> <b>headed</b> stud, concrete were considered in the material model. The rubber was assumed as a perfect material with no defect, and a modified reduced polynomial form of strain energy including an energy limiter and a new constant was introduced into the user material subroutine VUANISOHYPER-INV of ABAQUS software. Damaged plasticity model was used to model the concrete material. A tri-linear elastic-plastic curve was used in stud material model. Comparing the results obtained from the finite element analysis with those from push-out test, good agreement is highlighted in the capacity, ductility and failure mode of rubber-sleeved headed {{stud shear connector}}...|$|R
25|$|Most five-piece kits, at {{more than}} entry level, also have one or more effects cymbals. Adding cymbals beyond the basic ride, hi-hats and one crash {{configuration}} requires more stands {{in addition to the}} standard drum hardware packs. Because of this, many higher-cost kits for professionals are sold with little or even no hardware, to allow the drummer to choose the stands and also the bass drum pedal he/she prefers. At the other extreme, many inexpensive, entry-level kits are sold as a five-piece kit complete with two cymbal stands, most often one straight and one boom, and some even with a standard cymbal pack, a stool and a pair of 5A drum sticks. In the 2010s, digital kits are often offered in a five-piece kit, usually with one plastic crash cymbal triggers and one ride cymbal trigger. Fully electronic drums do not produce any acoustic sound beyond the quiet tapping of sticks on the plastic or <b>rubber</b> <b>heads.</b> The trigger-pads are wired up to a synth module or sampler.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the local}} success in Buffalo, {{many of the}} members {{relocated}} to Hollywood, California. In 1987, while working at Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard, they reformed the band, and quickly became a fixture in the Hollywood underground scene. Their first Los Angeles show was at The Central (which later became the Viper Room on Sunset Blvd), playing a show organized by Sylvia Massy, who would later produce two of their albums. In 1988, Bill and the band met GWAR, and an instant friendship was formed over their mutual love of costumes and props. After the initial meeting, Green Jellö decided to ditch their uncomfortable and dangerous papier maché/chicken wire costume heads {{in favor of the}} more user friendly foam <b>rubber</b> <b>heads</b> that GWAR had been making. They garbage picked cushions from abandoned Hollywood couches and carved their new characters such as [...] "Shitman" [...] (a giant, walking corn-filled poop monster), [...] "Cowgod", [...] "Rock n Roll Pumpkin", and [...] "Satan's Ham". The band's live show became an over-the-top adventure in absurdity, now consisting of usually 20 members onstage.|$|R

Pierce was always reluctant to use latex appliances, favoring his technique of building facial features out of cotton and collodion, or nose putty. Pierce eventually started using latex appliances, most notably a rubber nose for Lon Chaney, Jr. in The Wolf Man (1941) (the edges of the appliance are clearly visible through most of the film), and a <b>rubber</b> <b>head</b> piece for Boris Karloff in Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and Son of Frankenstein (1939).|$|E
5000|$|Modern handles, more {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "shafts," [...] are made of hollow metal. They are usually octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip.

The open end of the hollow shaft must be covered with tape or a plug ({{commonly referred to}} as the [...] "butt" [...] or [...] "butt end" [...] of the stick), usually made of <b>rubber.</b> The <b>head</b> of the stick is usually attached to the shaft with a screw to keep it in place.|$|R
5000|$|The Mbila (plural [...] "Timbila") is {{associated}} with the Chopi people of the Inhambane Province, in southern Mozambique. It is {{not to be confused with}} the mbira. The style of music played on it is believed to be the most sophisticated method of composition yet found among preliterate peoples. The gourd-resonated, equal-ratio heptatonic-tuned mbila of Mozambique is typically played in large ensembles in a choreographed dance, perhaps depicting a historical drama. Ensembles consist of around ten xylophones of three or four sizes. A full orchestra would have two bass instruments called gulu with three or four wooden keys played standing up using heavy mallets with solid <b>rubber</b> <b>heads,</b> three tenor dibinda, with ten keys and played seated, and the mbila itself, which has up to nineteen keys of which up to eight may be played simultaneously. The gulu uses gourds and the mbila and dibinda Masala apple shells as resonators. They accompany the dance with long compositions called ngomi or mgodo and consist of about 10 pieces of music grouped into 4 separate movements, with an overture, in different tempos and styles. The ensemble leader serves as poet, composer, conductor and performer, creating a text, improvising a melody partially based on the features of the Chopi tone language and composing a second countrapuntal line. The musicians of the ensemble partially improvise their parts. The composer then consults with the choreographer of the ceremony and adjustments are made. The longest and most important of these is the [...] "Mzeno" [...] which will include a song telling of an issue of local importance or even making fun of a prominent figure in the community! Performers include Eduardo Durão and Venancio Mbande.|$|R
