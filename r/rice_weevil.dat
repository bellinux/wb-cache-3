50|$|Adult <b>rice</b> <b>weevils</b> {{are able}} to fly, and can survive {{for up to two}} years. Females lay 2-6 eggs per day and up to 300 over their lifetime. The female uses strong mandibles to chew a hole into a grain kernel after which she {{deposits}} a single egg within the hole, sealing it with secretions from her ovipositor. The larva develops within the grain, hollowing it out while feeding. It then pupates within the grain kernel and emerges 2-4 days after eclosion.Male S. orzyae produce an aggregation pheromone ((4S,5R)-5-Hydroxy-4-methylheptan-3-one) to which males and females are drawn.

50|$|The {{maize weevil}} (Sitophilus zeamais), {{known in the}} United States as the greater <b>rice</b> <b>weevil,</b> is a species of beetle in the family Curculionidae. It {{can be found in}} {{numerous}} tropical areas around the world, and in the United States, and is a major pest of maize. This species attacks both standing crops and stored cereal products, including wheat, rice, sorghum, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, peas, and cottonseed. The maize weevil also infests other types of stored, processed cereal products such as pasta, cassava, and various coarse, milled grains. It has even been known to attack fruit while in storage, such as apples.|$|E
50|$|Early {{detection}} of infestation is difficult. As S. zeamais larvae {{feed on the}} interior of individual grains, often leaving only the hulls, a flour-like grain dust, mixed with frass is evident. Infested grains contain holes through which adults have emerged. A possible indication of infestation is grain, when placed in water, floating to the surface. Ragged holes in individual grains, similar to damage caused by the <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> and granary weevil, may indicate infestation. In large stores of grain, an increase in temperature may be detected. The most obvious sign of infestation {{is the emergence of}} adults. One study recorded, 5 weeks after infestation, the emergence of 100 adults per kg per day.|$|E
50|$|The adult female weevil bores {{a hole in}} a grain, nut, or seed, and {{deposits}} an egg, {{usually one}} egg per individual grain. She seals the hole with a secretion. The larva develops while feeding on {{the interior of the}} grain, and then pupates. It usually leaves the grain completely hollow when it exits as an adult. The wheat weevil can live on acorns, and may have used them as a host before agriculture made grain plentiful. The <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> can live on beans, nuts, grains, and some types of fruit, such as grapes. Several other Sitophilus use the acorns of oaks such as bluejack oak (Quercus incana) and moru oak (Q. floribunda).

In Sierra Leone, up to 28 % of rice seed can be damaged by <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> in the six months storage period. The use of chemical insecticides to control this insect is not practical for traditional farmers. Some tribes use pepper powder (Capsicum spp.) as a seed protectant.

The efficacy of the ethanolic and the water leaf crude extracts on the repellency, insecticidal activity, grain weightloss protection, and growth inhibition of <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> progeny was assessed. The ethanolic extracts affected rice weevils higherthan the water extracts. The extract toxicity on <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> adults and larvae compared as kitchen mint > kaffir lime >mintweed. The highest repellent efficacy, 24 h, of the ethanolic extract was from kaffir lime with EC 50 of 13. 23 mg/ml or 3. 4 fold of the control and of the water extract was from kitchen mint with EC 50 of 19. 04 mg/ml or 3. 6 fold of the control. Riceweevils were totally ridded within 20 days by kitchen mint ethanolic extracts. All extracts highly protected over the grain textureand the loss of grain weight, and inhibited the growth of <b>rice</b> <b>weevil</b> progeny. The treated grain weight loss was approximately 2 % in 35 days and 16 % in 49 days. The progeny emergence was inhibited ranging from 55 % (water extract) to 89 % (ethanolicextract).

Methods: Leaves were collected and dried crude aqueous extract of Catharanthus roeus leaf was done with Soxhlet’s extractor in distilled water for 8 hrs. Extracts were concentrated using rotary evaporator (BUCHI B- 850) under reduced pressure at 60 ºC.

Six trials were conducted at the Pine Tree Research Station (PTRS) and the Rice Research Extension Center (RREC) to examine the response of rice plants receiving different insecticide-seed treatments and urea-nitrogen rate combinations.
