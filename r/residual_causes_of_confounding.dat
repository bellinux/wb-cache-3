The recent {{discussions about the}} characteristics of bedding material, bed sharing and associations with smoking are examples of the scrutiny given to accidental deaths.

40|$|An {{expression}} that separates biotic and abiotic {{controls on the}} temporal dynamics of the soil moisture spatial coefficient of variation Cv(?) was explored via numerical simulations using a mechanistic ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. Continuous soil moisture spatiotemporal dynamics at an exemplary hillslope domain were computed for six case studies characterized by different climate and vegetation cover and for three configurations of soil properties. It was shown that abiotic controls largely exceed their biotic counterparts in wet climates. Biotic controls on Cv(?) {{were found to be}} more pronounced in Mediterranean climates. The relation between Cv(?) and spatial mean soil moisture inline image was found to be unique in wet locations, regardless of the soil properties. For the case of homogeneous soil texture, hysteretic cycles between Cv(?) and inline image were observed in all Mediterranean climate locations considered here {{and to a lesser extent}} in a deciduous temperate forest. Heterogeneity in soil properties increased Cv(?) to values commensurate with field observations and weakened signatures of hysteresis at all of the studied locations. This finding highlights the role of site-specific heterogeneities in hiding or even eliminating the signature of climatic and biotic controls on Cv(?), thereby offering a new perspective on <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> results reported across field experiments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{determining}} the location of single-phase-toground faults of ungrounded distribution systems based on residual voltage distribution. The possible faulted line segment and fault location are determined by comparing the phase angles of faulted phase voltages against a faulted phase reference angle, and the faulted phase voltages are determined as {{the difference between the}} fault <b>caused</b> <b>residual</b> voltage <b>of</b> all phases and the shunt <b>caused</b> <b>residual</b> voltage <b>of</b> un-faulted phases. The method determines the fault location solely based on the voltages and currents measured during the fault, and associated series impedance and shunt impedances of line segments. It does not require any measurements or information for the load demands and pre-fault conditions. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

30|$|One key {{aspect of}} the {{repeatability}} problem is the discrepancy between target altitude and actual altitude.

This <b>causes</b> something <b>of</b> a <b>confounding</b> problem in our approach, as it might be that poor repeatability in, e.g. apparent resistivity, is caused by the inability of the pilot to fly at that target altitude consistently, rather than because the target altitude is simply higher or lower. We thus performed an initial analysis on the data set to investigate the relationship between the variability of the actual altitude at the different target altitudes.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of the recent reductions in the Earth's biodiversity {{can be attributed to}} direct human impacts on the environment. An increasing number of studies over the last decade have reported declines in amphibian populations in areas of pristine habitat. Such reports suggest the role of indirect factors and a global effect of human activities on natural systems. Declines in amphibian populations bear significant implications for the functioning of many terrestrial ecosystems, and may signify important implications for human welfare. A wide range of candidates have been proposed to explain amphibian population declines.

This research {{was carried out}} on cold-rolled stainless steel (SS) 304 plates, which were deformed to 0, 34, 84, and 152 % reduction in thickness. The tests were conducted using Vickers method.

40|$|We study a model {{where one}} target {{variable}} Y is correlated with a vector X:=(X_ 1, [...] .,X_d) of predictor variables being potential <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> Y.

40|$|When {{estimating}} {{the association between}} an exposure and outcome, a simple approach to quantifying the amount <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> by a factor, Z, is to compare estimates of the exposure–outcome association with and without adjustment for Z. This approach is widely believed to be problematic due to the nonlinearity of some exposure-effect measures. When the expected value of the outcome is modeled as a nonlinear function of the exposure, the adjusted and unadjusted exposure effects can differ {{even in the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> (Greenland, Robins, and Pearl, 1999); we call this the nonlinearity effect. In this paper, we propose a corrected measure <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> that does not include the nonlinearity effect. The performances of the simple and corrected estimates <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> are assessed in simulations and illustrated using a study of risk factors for low birth–weight infants. We conclude that the simple estimate <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> is adequate or even preferred in settings where the nonlinearity effect is very small.

40|$|AbstractConfounding is a {{major concern}} in epidemiology. Despite its significance, the {{different}} notions <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> have not been fully appreciated in the literature, leading to confusion of causal concepts in epidemiology. In this article, we aim to highlight the importance of differentiating between the subtly different notions <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> from the perspective of counterfactual reasoning. By using a simple example, we illustrate the significance of considering the distribution of response types to distinguish causation from association, highlighting that confounding depends not only on the population chosen as the target of inference, but also on the notions <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> in distribution and confounding in measure. This point has been relatively underappreciated, partly because some literature on the concept <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> has only used the exposed and unexposed groups as the target populations, while {{it would be helpful to}} use the total population as the target population. Moreover, to clarify a further distinction between confounding “in expectation” and “realized” confounding, we illustrate the usefulness of examining the distribution of exposure status in the target population. To grasp the explicit distinction between confounding in expectation and realized confounding, we need to understand the mechanism that generates exposure events, not the product of that mechanism. Finally, we graphically illustrate this point, highlighting the usefulness of directed acyclic graphs in examining the presence <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> in distribution, in the notion <b>of</b> <b>confounding</b> in expectation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A general {{criterion}} for integer ambiguity searching is derived in this paper. The criterion {{takes into account}} not only the <b>residuals</b> <b>caused</b> by ambiguity parameter changing, but also the <b>residuals</b> <b>caused</b> by coordinates changing through ambiguity fixing. The search {{can be carried out}} in a coordinate domain, in an ambiguity domain or in both domains. The three searching scenarios are theoretically equivalent. The optimality and uniqueness properties of the proposed criterion are also discussed. A numerical explanation of the general criterion is outlined. The theoretical relationship between the general criterion and the commonly used least squares ambiguity search (LSAS) criterion is derived in an equivalent case in detail. It shows that the LSAS criterion {{is just one of the}} terms of the equivalent criterion. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the behaviour of the two components of the equivalent criterion...|$|R
40|$|Background Malunion of the {{clavicle}} with shortening after mid shaft fractures {{can give}} rise to long-term <b>residual</b> complaints. The <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> these complaints is as yet unclear. Methods In this study we analysed data of an earlier experimental cadaveric study on changes of shoulder biomechanics with progressive shortening of the clavicle. The data was used in a musculoskeletal computer model to {{examine the effect of}} clavicle shortening on muscle function, expressed as maximal muscle moments for abduction and internal rotation. Findings Clavicle shortening results in changes of maximal muscle moments around the shoulder girdle. The mean values at 3. 6 cm of shortening of maximal muscle moment changes are 16 % decreased around the sterno-clavicular joint decreased for both ab- and adduction, 37 % increased around the acromion-clavicular joint for adduction and 32 % decrease for internal rotation around the gleno-humeral joint in resting position. Interpretation Shortening of the clavicle affects muscle function in the shoulder in a computer model. This may explain for the residual complaints after short malunion with shortening.
