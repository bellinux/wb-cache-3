50|$|In {{some legal}} systems, {{perfection}} {{of a security}} interest requires notice {{to be given to}} a relevant third party. This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other chose in action, notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund. Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known rule in Dearle v Hall. Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an equitable charge over that debt to B, and then grants a second equitable charge over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X.

50|$|Melitaea ornata, {{the eastern}} {{knapweed}} fritillary, is a butterfly {{in the family}} Nymphalidae. The species rank of Melitaea ornata (type locality Guberlya, Russia) was only very recently recognised by two research groups independently (Russell et al., 2005; Varga et al., 2005). They {{realized that there was}} an unrecognised species in Europe under the name of M. phoebe. The separation of this cryptic species was based on larval morphology from the fourth instar onwards. M. phoebe larvae have a black head capsule while the larvae of this recently recognised Ponto-Mediterranean species have a brick-red head capsule (Russell et al., 2007). The separation of the two taxa was also supported by the results of enzyme electrophoresis study (Pecsenye et al., 2007). Based on these observations, the name M. telona Fruhstorfer (type locality: Jerusalem, Israel) was taken into use for this species. In a recent molecular study, the M. phoebe group forms a monophyletic clade within the subgenus Didymaeformia (Leneveu et al., 2009). Although that study provided important results regarding the systematics of the genus, the members of the phoebe species group were poorly represented, and the need for a detailed examination of this group remained. One of the important results was the corroboration of the species rank of M. telona and the suggestion that the taxon punica (type locality: Lambessa, Algeria) may represent a separate species from both M. telona and M. phoebe. Another recent study on the morphometry of genitalia in males and females of the phoebe species group provided additional information (Tóth & Varga, 2011). An analysis {{of a large number of}} specimens from the Palaearctic showed that Melitaea telona is not restricted to the Ponto-Mediterranean region since several new localities were found, including the Orenburg region (Russia), northern Iran and the easternmost border of Kazakhstan. Since the name ornata described by Christoph in 1893 (type locality: South-Urals, Russia) is older than the name telona, the authors began to use M. ornata as the valid name for this species following the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority.</b> Recently, it has also been indicated that M. telona sensu stricto from Israel and M. ornata are different taxa (Tóth et al. 2014). Previous morphometrical studies have already revealed small differences in the genital structures of the males (Tóth et al. 2013; Tóth and Varga 2011) but the authors interpreted the difference as a well-pronounced intra-specific difference. In contrast, molecular data clearly showed that the two taxa are genetically distinct from each other. Based on the results of the analysis of seven genes, Tóth et al. (2014) concluded that M. telona is not a subspecies of M. ornata but a species in its own right.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{institutions}} {{for the creation}} and transmission of knowledge as efficient resource allocation mechanisms. By looking at Science and Technology it develops a two way classification. Science, is a non market allocation mechanism, where knowledge is treated as a pure public good and where the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> provides an incentive scheme for disclosure. Technology, is a market allocation mechanism, where knowledge is treated as a private good and where patents and copyrights preserve property rights.

40|$|A {{rearrangement}} of Orders, Suborders, Families, and Subfamilies is essayed {{for those}} Sarcodina of the Superorder Lobida, as {{included in the}} Subclass Cyclia, Class Hydraulea, within a classification for the Sarcodina based on mechanisms of movement. The genera in-cluded are listed with the designation of each familial group; but the families are not given names. The problem of naming families, using those within the Lobida as examples, is discussed, with emphasis {{on the need to}} use logic, whether or not the International Rules of Nomenclature provide for or permit it. An example is given of the confusion sometimes occurring due to impedance of logic by the rigidity of rules. Some other difficulties are considered. It is concluded that the extension of the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Priority</b> to include names of family groups imposes a rigidity of mental behavior which is often counter to logic in the naming of families, especially new ones based on new approaches and/or new data. It is further concluded that the <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Priority</b> cannot be supported by the authors for any familial group or higher taxon. Since the time of Ehrenberg (1830, 1832) and Dujardin (1841) it has been known that: 1) Certain lobose amebas form gran-ule-filled cylindrical pseudopods; 2) others form bubble-like eruptive granular or non-granular ones; 3) still others form nonerup-tive blunt bulges rather than pseudopods; and 4) yet others form fanlike clear waves and clear conical round-tipped pseudopods.

40|$|Abstract: The paper reviews stomatal types {{observed}} in 500 species of angiosperms besides those {{described in the}} literature and deals {{with the problems of}} their structure, delimitation, nomenclature and classification. In view of the varied definitions available in the literature for subsidiaries, stomatal types and, the definition and delimitations being variously interpreted by different workers, a modified definition for the subsidiaries and stomata is presented. In accordance with the international code of nomenclature for plants, the names of the stomata widely in use are retained (<b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority).</b> They have been presently classified as pericytic, desmocytic, paracytic, diacytic, anisocytic, anisotricytic, isotricytic, tetracytic, staurocytic, anomocytic, cyclocytic and a good number of varieties under each type are presented.
