However, Zhang Fan claimed that he was ill and remained behind in Pengcheng (彭城; around present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu). He sent Zhang Cheng to meet Cao Cao instead. Cao Cao appointed Zhang Cheng as a Counsellor <b>Remonstrant</b> (諫議大夫).|$|E

25|$|In February 196, {{acting on}} the advice of Xun Yu and Cheng Yu, Cao Cao sent Cao Hong west to fetch Emperor Xian but was blocked by Dong Cheng and Yuan Shu's {{subordinate}} Chang Nu (萇奴). In August 196, Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang and received Emperor Xian. Two months later, he relocated the emperor to his own base in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), where the new imperial capital was established. Emperor Xian appointed Cao Hong as a Counsellor <b>Remonstrant</b> (諫議大夫).|$|E
25|$|In 214, {{after the}} warlord Liu Bei {{seized control of}} Yi Province from its provincial {{governor}} Liu Zhang, he appointed Yin Mo as an Assistant Officer of Education (勸學從事). In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han, after which he designated his son Liu Shan as the Crown Prince. Yin Mo, who was appointed as the Crown Prince's Coachman (太子僕), tutored Liu Shan in the Zuo Zhuan and Confucian classics. Liu Bei died in 223 and was succeeded by Liu Shan, who appointed Yin Mo as a Counsellor <b>Remonstrant</b> (諫議大夫) in the Shu imperial court. Around 227, when the Shu chancellor-regent Zhuge Liang garrisoned military forces in Hanzhong {{in preparation for a}} series of campaigns against Shu's rival state Cao Wei, Yin Mo was appointed as an Army Libationer (軍祭酒) under Zhuge Liang. In 234, after Zhuge Liang's death, Yin Mo returned to the Shu capital Chengdu and held the position of a Palace Counsellor (太中大夫). He died on an unspecified date. His son, Yin Zong (尹宗), inherited his legacy and became an Academician (博士) in the Shu court.|$|E
2500|$|Jacobus Arminius [...] (October 10, 1560 – October 19, 1609), the Latinized {{name of the}} Dutch theologian Jakob Hermanszoon {{from the}} Protestant Reformation period, served from 1603 as {{professor}} in theology at the University of Leiden. He wrote many books and treatises on theology, and his views became the basis of Arminianism and the Dutch <b>Remonstrant</b> movement.|$|E

2500|$|The Union of Utrecht had {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} conscience, {{but this did}} not imply freedom of worship. Except for the Dutch Reformed Church, public worship by other denominations was usually restricted with more or less severity, and membership of the privileged church {{was supposed to be}} a prerequisite for holding public office (though this rule was often honored in the breach, even as far as Catholic office holders in the Generality Lands were concerned). This policy of supremacy of the Public Church was, however, never enforced consistently, either in the different parts of the country, or over time. In general, a policy of de facto toleration predominated, even when legal prohibitions were in force. This went against the grain of the Calvinist diehards, who constantly insisted on official suppression of competing faiths, going back to the Contra-Remonstrant controversy of 1618. Their <b>Remonstrant</b> opponents had come to defend religious toleration after their own suppression, and though <b>Remonstrant</b> regents had been ousted at the time, this political point of view remained in favor with the Holland regents, unlike their colleagues in most other provinces. The debate continued to flare up from time to time. The flap over the Holland public prayers was just one of many instances. What makes it interesting is that such debates were usually not over doctrinal matters, but in a sense about [...] "public order." [...] Also, they tended quickly to widen to debates over unsettled constitutional matters, like the provincial-supremacy claim of the Holland regents.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{translation}} of the Bible into Esperanto was a {{translation of}} the Tanakh or Old Testament done by L. L. Zamenhof. The translation was reviewed and compared with other languages' translations {{by a group of}} British clergy and scholars before its publication at the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1910. In 1926 this was published along with a New Testament translation, in an edition commonly called the [...] "". In the 1960s, the [...] tried to organize a new, ecumenical Esperanto Bible version. Since then, the Dutch <b>Remonstrant</b> pastor Gerrit Berveling has translated the Deuterocanonical or apocryphal books in addition to new translations of the Gospels, some of the New Testament epistles, and some books of the Tanakh or Old Testament. These have been published in various separate booklets, or serialized in , but the Deuterocanonical books have appeared in recent editions of the Londona Biblio.|$|E
2500|$|In 214, {{after the}} warlord Liu Bei {{seized control of}} Yi Province from Liu Zhang, he {{appointed}} Du Qiong as an Assistant Officer in the Consultation Bureau (議曹從事) of his administration. Following {{the end of the}} Eastern Han dynasty in 220, Du Qiong cited works of divination to urge Liu Bei to declare himself emperor, which Liu Bei did in 221 and established the state of Shu Han of the Three Kingdoms period. After Liu Bei died in 223, Du Qiong continued serving under Liu Bei's son and successor, Liu Shan. During Liu Shan's reign ( [...] 223–263), Du Qiong held a number of positions, including Counsellor <b>Remonstrant</b> (諫議大夫), Left General of the Household (左中郎將), Minister Herald (大鴻臚) and Minister of Ceremonies (太常). When Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, died in 234, Liu Shan ordered Du Qiong to bring an imperial edict of mourning to Zhuge Liang's tomb and read it out.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Statement of Principle, most contemporary <b>Remonstrants</b> {{write their own}} declaration or profession of faith when they {{become a member of}} the community. The brotherhood did express at three times in their history the faith they share in a confessional statement, in 1621, 1940 and 2006. <b>Remonstrants</b> however, being a non-creedal denomination, consider no confession to have indisputable authority.|$|R
50|$|Leading {{influences}} among Arminius' followers (now called <b>Remonstrants)</b> were Arminius' {{close friend}} and Roman Catholic-turned-Reformed pastor Jan Uytenbogaert, lawyer Hugo Grotius, and a scholar named Simon Episcopius.

50|$|A {{large share}} of Sir William's {{attention}} while ambassador was taken up with the controversy between the Gomarists and the <b>Remonstrants</b> (Arminians). He continued the policy of Sir Dudley Carleton, and supported the rigidly Calvinist Gomarists against the <b>Remonstrants.</b> This was for political reasons, and otherwise Boswell was an ally of William Laud. He took a close interest in the émigré English churches in the Netherlands, and in 1633-4 helped John Paget intrigue against John Davenport. Charles I ordered Boswell to back Edward Misselden, influential in the Merchant Adventurers, against John Forbes. In 1638 Boswell had a prosecution brought against John Canne. He was now poised against the Gomarists, and worked together with <b>Remonstrants</b> to combat Scottish Covenanter propaganda.|$|R
