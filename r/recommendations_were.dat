5|$|O'Brien {{was also}} {{equipped}} with four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy {{had called for}} two anti-aircraft guns for the O'Brien-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> followed for O'Brien {{or any of the}} other ships of the class.|$|E
5|$|The TSB made nine {{recommendations}} {{relating to}} changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.|$|E
25|$|The UK and WHO <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> 2HREZ/4HR; the US <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> 2HREZ/7HR.

5|$|The state faced a $400million revenue {{shortfall}} when Jones took office. Shortly after his election, Jones created the Quality and Efficiency Commission to study ways to streamline state government. Among the enacted <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> refinancing state bonds at lower interest rates, cutting the state workforce by 2,000 employees (mostly through attrition), and spurring local economic growth through tax incentives. By {{the end of}} Jones' term, the state enjoyed a $300million budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{recommended}} Savige for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for the Salamaua {{campaign in}} October 1944. A year later, he recommended Savige for a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath {{for the campaign}} on Bougainville. Both <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> turned down by the Labor government. Following {{the election of the}} coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to the newly elected Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Savige was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) in the King's Birthday Honours on 8 June 1950. In 1953, he travelled to London to represent Legacy at the coronation of Queen ElizabethII.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, the NTSB made four further recommendations, three {{measures}} to avoid fatigue affecting {{the performance of}} air traffic controllers, and one to prevent controllers from carrying out non-essential administrative tasks while aircraft are taxiing under their control. Although these <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> published {{during the course of}} the NTSB's investigation into the accident to Comair Flight 5191, they were in part prompted by four earlier accidents, and the board was unable to determine whether fatigue contributed to the Comair accident.|$|E
5000|$|The Board's <b>{{recommendation}}</b> <b>was</b> unanimous. [...] The Board's <b>recommendation</b> memos <b>were</b> heavily redacted—their actual <b>recommendation</b> <b>was</b> redacted.

50|$|The current EC <b>recommendation</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in 2003 as 2003/361/EC. It replaced an older definition from 1996. The new <b>recommendation</b> <b>was</b> brought into effect for R&D tax relief purposes on 1 January 2005.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{to report}} by March 2006, the group {{presented}} its {{report to the}} Government in November 2006. They recommended that a civil partnership scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and cohabiting couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to same-sex couples {{would be open to}} constitutional challenge. They also recommended a legal presumption of partnership for couples which have lived together for three years, or have children together. No <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the Government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should await the Supreme Court appeal in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|Jones's <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> {{immediately}} {{accepted and}} put into practice. A series of new batteries aligned on a roughly north-south axis facing west towards the harbour was constructed, including Jones', Civil Hospital, Raglan's, Gardiner's, Queen Victoria's, Lady Augusta's, Prince of Wales and Cumberland batteries. Further batteries and fortifications were constructed around Rosia Bay near {{the south of the}} peninsula and Windmill Hill was strengthened around its entire perimeter, with Retrenched Barracks at its north end blocking access to the higher ground behind. The sea wall in the town was straightened and strengthened with the building of two new curtain walls, Prince Albert's Front and Wellington Front. Defensive breakwaters were constructed in front of both to prevent an armoured enemy ship ramming the walls.|$|E
5|$|Nobel-laureate William Vickrey is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the father of congestion pricing, as he first proposed it for the New York City Subway system in 1952. In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by Maurice Allais, Gabriel Roth who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose World Bank recommendation the first system was put in place in Singapore. Also, it was considered by the Smeed Report, published by the British Ministry of Transport in 1964, but its <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> rejected by successive British governments.|$|E

50|$|In UNESCO usage, a <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> {{a formal}} {{international}} instrument {{accepted by the}} member states of UNESCO (UNESCO, 1981). As is generally the case with international instruments, the <b>Recommendation</b> <b>is</b> soft law, that is, {{the enforcement of the}} norms and standards within the <b>Recommendation</b> <b>is</b> through the force of moral persuasion. There is, however, potential for individual governments to translate the Recommendation into hard law, through individual legislation.|$|R

5|$|Schuster {{also took}} part in law reform after Lord Sankey decided {{to set up a}} Law Revision Committee in January 1934 which {{consisted}} of Sankey, Schuster, four judges, five barristers, one solicitor and two academic lawyers. The committee produced 86 reports from 1934 to 1939 on a variety of subjects, and many of their <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> made into legislation after negotiations with the Home Office. Although the Law Revision Committee fell into disuse after this it was re-formed as a permanent Law Commission in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Borders Railway {{bill was}} debated in September 2005 and a motion {{supporting}} {{it was passed}} with 102 in favour, none against and one abstention. On 9 May 2006, the bill committee published its final report supporting the project with two recommendations: a station had to be provided at Stow and the line had to be completed to its full extent, i.e. as far as Tweedbank. These <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> accepted by the Scottish Parliament in the final debate on the bill on 14 June 2006. The bill was carried by 114 votes to one.|$|E
5|$|The CLR {{bill was}} {{one of more than}} a dozen tube railway bills {{submitted}} to Parliament for the 1901 session, To review the bills on an equal basis, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor, but by the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Among the committee's <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> the withdrawal of the CLR's City loop, and that a quick, tube route from Hammersmith to the City of London would benefit London's commuters.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} that both {{adults and children}} reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. A reduction to below 5% of total energy intake brings additional health benefits, especially in what regards dental caries (cavities in the teeth). These <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> based on the totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars intake and body weight and dental caries. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{investigation}} {{lasted from}} May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along party lines. Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged price fixing by U.S. Steel and censured President Theodore Roosevelt {{for his role}} in U.S. Steel's purchase of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. The minority report, authored by Republican Augustus P. Gardner, absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Though his <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|The first {{stone was}} laid down on 15 June 1670, {{and the initial}} stages of {{construction}} were supervised by Valperga himself. The fort received a skeleton garrison in June 1674, although it was still incomplete. In 1681, the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh proposed some changes to the design of the fort, and these <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> implemented. The barracks, chapel and other buildings within the fort were constructed in the 1680s and 1690s, and the fort was officially declared complete and armed in May 1698.|$|E

5|$|The last plank in Patton's {{education}} platform was {{the improvement}} of adult education. This issue allowed him {{to work with a}} political foe, Republican senator David L. Williams, who had been pushing for additional resources for adult education since 1997. In 1998, Patton personally chaired a task force on adult education, and 18months later, the task force's <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into a bill sponsored by Williams. The bill, which increased and equalized funding and tied continuing funds to successful performance by individual adult-education programs, passed both houses of the General Assembly unanimously. By 2003, the number of adults completing their GED rose by 17percent, and the number of GED recipients who matriculated to college rose from 13percent to 18percent.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} support for {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it {{was little more than a}} skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|Using Mendeleev's {{nomenclature}} for unnamed and undiscovered elements, roentgenium {{should be}} known as eka-gold. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called unununium (with the corresponding symbol of Uuu), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it element 111, with the symbol of E111, (111) or even simply 111.|$|E
