5|$|Sweden's {{weak economy}} had {{suffered}} {{during the war}} and was now in a deep crisis. Charles assembled the Riksdag of the Estates in October 1680. The assembly has been described {{as one of the most}} important held by the Riksdag of the Estates. Here, the king finally pushed through the reduction ordeal, something that had been discussed in the Riksdag since 1650. It meant that any land or object previously owned by the crown and lent or given away— including counties, baronies and lordships— could be recovered. It affected many prominent members of the nobility, some of whom were ruined by it. One of them was the former guardian and Lord Chief Justice Magnus De La Gardie, who, among many other Estates, had to return the extravagant 248-room Läckö Castle. The <b>reduction</b> <b>process</b> involved the examination of every title deed in the kingdom, including the dominions, and it resulted in a complete readjustment of the nation's finances.|$|E

40|$|Beach erosion has {{recently}} been recognized as accelerating due to changes in sediment sources from rivers. This {{can be considered as}} <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> of river deltas. In this paper, the formation and <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> of river deltas are first investigated theoretically by introducing the non—uniformity of longshore sediment transport into the equation of continuity of shoreline change. Theoretical solutions to shoreline changes in the formation and <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> are derived from the simplified governing equations using the concept of one—line theory. By numerical results of the solutions, shoreline changes in the formation and <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> are well explained. Secondly, experiments both on the formation and <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> were carried out. The theoretical results of the processes compared favorably with the experimental ones, indicating that the processes can be well explained by specifying the predominant parameters. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. TG/DTG {{was applied}} to study the overall {{kinetics}} for the reduction of pyrolusite by the mixture of cellulose and lignin, two major components of biomass. The respective <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> can be described by a new empirical equation based on the JMA equation, and the apparent activation energy is 38. 66 kJ·mol- 1 and 38. 91 kJ·mol- 1 for the reduction of pyrolusite by cellulose and lignin, respectively. Overall <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> of pyrolusite by the mixture of cellulose and lignin are the partial overlapped <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> of pyrolusite by cellulose and lignin. This overall <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> can be simulated by the summation of the respective kinetics by considering their mass-loss fractions...|$|R
40|$|Depth-resolved, Doppler-broadening {{positron}} spectroscopy {{has been}} used to study structural properties of semiconducting glasses. Bismuth-and lead-doped, silica and germanium glasses with five different compositions were studied. Conducting surface layers in these glasses were obtained by reduction in hydrogen atmosphere. Depth scanning with a slow-positron beam allows to follow the temperature and time evolution of layers modified during <b>reduction</b> <b>processes.</b> However, while <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> in inner layers (below a few tens of nm) are clearly seen in changes of the Doppler-broadened positron-annihilation line, the near-to-surface changes are more complex and not fully understood. We prove that the positron spectroscopy can help in optimising technological questions of <b>reduction</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Under this view, beta {{reduction}} {{corresponds to}} a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional beta conversions until {{there are no more}} applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this <b>reduction</b> <b>process</b> may not terminate.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the <b>reduction</b> <b>process</b> takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer {{can be reduced to}} the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.|$|E

30|$|Various schemes {{have been}} {{proposed}} to reduce the OOBE of OFDM-based CR systems. They can be classified into two categories: the time-domain schemes and the frequency-domain schemes. The time-domain schemes include filtering [8], windowing [9 – 11], etc., where the OOBE <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> are carried out after the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). The frequency-domain schemes include carrier cancellation (CC) [12], constellation extension (CE) [13], precoding [14 – 18], etc., where the OOBE <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> are carried out before the IFFT.|$|R
40|$|Sandwich-type phosphomolybdates {{with general}} formula K-n[Ln(III) (PMo 11 O 39) (2) ], where Ln(III) = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb and Dy, were {{prepared}} and characterized by several techniques. The crystal structure of Sm(PMo 11) (2) and Gd(PMo 11) (2) were studied {{and showed that}} they crystallise in a P 2 (1) /c space group. All Ln(PMo 11) 2 revealed four Mo-based electrochemical <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> with very similar E- 1 / 2 values (approximate to 0. 5, approximate to 0. 3, approximate to 0. 02 and approximate to- 0. 1 V) for all the Ln(III) atoms. The two more positive <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> correspond to pH independent one-electron <b>reduction</b> <b>processes,</b> whereas the two more negative processes correspond to pH dependent two-electron <b>reduction</b> <b>processes.</b> Electrolysis at two different potentials, 0. 1 V - related to the two one-electron <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> - and - 0. 3 V - related to the two more negative two-electron <b>reduction</b> <b>processes,</b> confirmed the electrochromic properties of the Ln(PMo 11) (2) species: their original yellow coloured solutions turned blue, corresponding to the appearance of four new electronic bands in the near UV-Vis-near IR region. These electronic bands were tentatively assigned based on their molar absorption coefficients (epsilon) and absorbance (Abs) variation {{as a function of}} electrolysis time: bands A (lambda(max) approximate to 855 - 870 nm) and B (lambda(max) approximate to 670 - 695 nm) were assigned to Mo-V -> Mo-VI intervalence charge transfer transitions, band C (lambda(max) approximate to 525 nm) to d-d transition due to d(1) configuration of the reduced addenda atom (Mo-V) and band D (lambda approximate to 310 - 315 nm) to an O -> Mo-V charge transfer transition (CTT). The emission features of the Eu(PMo 11) (2) and Tb(PMo 11) (2) samples reveal broad emission in the UV/vis spectral region resulting from d-d transition transitions. The Eu(PMo 11) (2) also display the typical Eu 3 + D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (0 - 4) transitions, when excited through the O -> Eu-III and O -> Mo-VI CCTs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reduction</b> <b>processes</b> and methane {{emissions}} {{have been}} observed in six rice fields along a sand-clay-silt gradient for one growing season. Variations in <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> occurred by depth and upon field draining, as well as among fields of differing soil sand content. Analysis at four 2. 5 cm-intervals revealed that greater microbial activity appears to be occurring {{close to the surface}} of the soil, and decreases with depth. This may be due to greater substrate availability through decomposition of organic matter from roots and dead plant material at that location. Also, it was observed that the re-entry of oxygen upon field draining decreases the amount of reduction occurring, as well as the levels of methane emitted. In this study, greater amounts of emitted methane were measured from the sandy soil extreme. <b>Reduction</b> <b>processes,</b> however, were found to be similar in both clayey and sandy soils...|$|R

Such volume-reduced platelets are normally transfused only to neonatal and pediatric patients, {{when a large}} volume of plasma could overload the child's small circulatory system. The lower volume of plasma also reduces the chances of an adverse transfusion reaction to plasma proteins. Volume reduced platelets have a shelf life of only four hours.|$|E

Antoine Lavoisier recognised phosphorus as an element in 1777. Bone ash was {{the major source of}} phosphorus until the 1840s. The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product. Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort.

Their interpretation is in relation to density (6. 5 - 7. 4 g·cm- 3), sintering temperature (1120 and 1200 °C), heating and cooling rates (10 and 50 °C/min), carbon addition (0. 5 / 0. 6 / 0. 8 %), and type of sintering atmosphere (10 %H 2 -N 2, N 2), respectively. The progress in <b>reduction</b> <b>processes</b> was evaluated by the relative change in oxygen and carbon contents and related to resultant fracture strength. Higher sintering temperature (1200 °C) and low density (6. 5 g·cm- 3) result in a relative decrease of oxygen content by more than 80 %. Higher cooling rate (50 °C/min) eliminates re-oxidation during cooling. The reducing ability of the nitrogen atmosphere can be improved by sintering in a graphite container.
