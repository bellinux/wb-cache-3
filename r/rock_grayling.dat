40|$|Observations on Upper Red Rock Lake {{during periods}} of ice cover in the winters of 1994 - 1995 and 1995 - 1996 {{indicate}} that the lake became severely deficient in dissolved oxygen during the first winter but not the second, and that the distributional behavior of Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus. differed markedly between the two winters. During the first winter, dissolved oxygen declined to very low concentrations, generally about 0. 5 to 0. 15 ppm, in midlake and other sampling locations by mid to late January. Dead invertebrates and fish (suckers, Catostomus sp.) were seen at two locations where holes were drilled through the ice for habitat measurements. Two radio-tagged Arctic grayling remained in two small areas with higher oxygen concentrations of about 2. 6 to 10 ppm throughout the period of ice cover. These apparent oxygen refugia were located off the mouths of two major tributary inlets, Red <b>Rock</b> Creek and <b>Grayling</b> Creek. In contrast, oxygen concentrations remained relatively high, generally above 5 ppm, beneath ice cover through the winter of 1995 - 1996. Radio-tagged fish located by telemetry during this second winter—four Arctic grayling, seven cutthroat trout, and two burbot—remained widely distributed through the lake. Differences in oxygen concentrations beneath ice cover appeared related to conditions which favored greater growth of macrophyte vegetation during the preceding summer and fall, and effects of snow and ice cover on light penetration during winter...|$|R
