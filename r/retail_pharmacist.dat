40|$|Purpose – Barriers {{to entry}} and entry {{deterrent}} strategies are widely discussed {{elements of the}} strategic literature and help define the attractiveness of an industry. The channel structure of the pharmaceutical industry, {{in part because of}} the level of regulation applicable to it, has the potential for idiosyncratic strategic behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to explore the applicability of traditional approaches to entry barriers and entry deterrence in the Australian retail pharmacy industry facing the threat of a major entry by examining the perceptions of incumbent <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> regarding the strength of potential barriers to entry into the industry, and their likely response to entry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses both qualitative and quantitative methodology to categorise potential barriers to entry in terms of their perception by incumbent players. More than 20 in-depth interviews are conducted with a range of stakeholders and 132 <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> completed questionnaires. Findings – The paper suggests that this industry is relying on barriers which, while arguably effective, are outside the industry's control, and do not justify the apparent complacency among <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> Practical implications – This research is of significant managerial relevance since it demonstrates that the incumbents are unprepared for potentially devastating impacts if supermarkets or other new competitors were to enter the market. Originality/value – The authors propose and utilise a novel framework for entry barrier analysis which includes the perceived locus of control for each entry barrier. The contribution of the paper is therefore in its treatment of the traditional arena of entry barriers and deterrence. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Pharmacy in South Africa changed {{dramatically}} the past decade. Legislative changes include the amendment of The Pharmacy Act in 2003 allowing for nonpharmacists to own pharmacies. This {{opened the door}} for national chain stores to change their business model by including a dispensary in their retail service offerings. The regulation of medicine prices impacted the profitability of the pharmacy industry. This caused a double edge sword to retail pharmacy – not only do they need to compete with national supermarkets on front shop products, their products, namely scheduled medication also are regulated in dispensaries. In an environment of rapid change and shortened product and business model lifecycles, the future profit streams from existing operations are uncertain. Businesses need to consistently seek out new opportunities and therefore firms may benefit from adopting an entrepreneurial orientation. Entrepreneurial orientation of <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> operating in corporate and independent pharmacies’ might play a role in survival of pharmacy business as a professional services provider for which a fee may be charged.

40|$|Abstract Background Limited {{evidence}} {{exists on the}} effectiveness of external diabetes support provided by diabetes specialists and community retail pharmacists to facilitate insulin-prescribing in family practice. Methods A stratified, parallel group, randomized control study was conducted in 15 sites across Canada. Family physicians received insulin initiation/titration education, a physician-specific ‘report card’ on the characteristics of their type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) population, and a registry of insulin-eligible patients at a workshop. Intervention physicians in addition received: (1) diabetes specialist/educator consultation support (active diabetes specialist/educator consultation support for 2 months [the educator initiated contact every 2 weeks] and passive consultation support for 10 months [family physician initiated as needed]); and (2) community <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacist</b> support (option to refer patients to the pharmacist(s) for a 1 -hour insulin-initiation session). The primary outcome was the insulin prescribing rate (IPR) per physician defined as the number of insulin starts of insulin-eligible patients during the 12 -month strategy. Results Consenting, eligible physicians (n[*]=[*] 151) participated with 15 specialist sites and 107 community pharmacists providing the intervention. Most physicians were male (74 %), and had an average of 81 patients with T 2 DM. Few (9 %) routinely initiated patients on insulin. Physicians were randomly allocated to usual care (n[*]=[*] 78) or the intervention (n[*]=[*] 73). Intervention physicians had a mean (SE) IPR of 2. 28 (0. 27) compared to 2. 29 (0. 25) for control physicians, with an estimated adjusted RR (95 % CI) of 0. 99 (0. 80 to 1. 24), p [*]=[*] 0. 96. Conclusions An insulin support program utilizing diabetes experts and community retail pharmacists to enhance insulin prescribing in family practice was not successful.

40|$|Independent retail pharmacy, {{representing}} {{a type of}} retail SME significantly influenced by its professional role, faces stark marketplace challenges today. Research has found that marketing in SMEs is strongly influenced by resource constraints and by the attitudes, skills {{and knowledge of the}} owner/manager. ‘Innovative marketing’ is a specific construct in the literature that models (APT- Assimilation, Prediction, Transformation) the characteristic marketing activities of SMEs. Utilising a qualitative research strategy and case study design, this research explores the marketing response of independent retail pharmacy in Ireland in 2014, contributing {{to our understanding of the}} marketing activities of this particular sector. It finds that the professional role of the <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacist</b> has a multifaceted influence on the marketing response of independent retail pharmacies. While location/place and price centred strategies are evident, a marketing strategy, termed NATCALEX, that combines an emphasis on the local expert care of the owner/manager pharmacist within a national retail brand, is favoured by an increasing number of owners. The formation of strategic alliances (Assimilation) from 2007 has led to this strategy. From these groups Prediction based marketing activities led to the emergence of the NATCALEX marketing strategies. The most physically obvious marketing activities today are Transformative, utilising all elements of the marketing mix, most notably, branding.

40|$|Problem: The Smart Open Services for European Patients (epSOS) the {{exchange}} of electronic Patient Summaries and ePrescriptions between selected member states of the European Union (EU). This project basically solved the ‘communication’ or message transfer problem. However, it encountered a serious ‘delivery’ problem: the safe dispensation of a medicinal product noted in a prescription from a given country by a <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacist</b> in another country. The reason for this was that the specified medicine could in many instances not univocally be identified – the same name may identify a product with a different active ingredient, or the product with identical composition may carry a different name in the other country. If the prescribed medicine had not been authorised for marketing in the other country, information on its attributes may not be available. This rendered dispensation by the pharmacist impossible, even where substitution would, in principle, be allowed and possible. Objectives: This paper reports on the goal, activities and achievements of the openMedicine project towards development of a digital solution and its implementation to meet this identification and the resulting delivery challenge. European-wide and cross-Atlantic endeavours to enhance pharmacovigilance {{by being able to}} match adverse event reports filed under different drug names which provide, however, for the same active ingredient(s) were developed upon. And the need for and benefits of being able to trace for clinical purposes, e. g. the longer-term treatment with the same active ingredient, even when the name of the prescribed medicine changed several times, were explored. Methodological approach: The openMedicine project was funded by the European Commission (EC) on behalf of member states to analyse this European-wide problem. Work benefitted from the epSOS project and work by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the USA Federal Drug Agency (FDA), and standard development organisations (SDOs). Reviews of white and grey literature, reports, regulatory documents, standards and other documents were undertaken. An online survey of 160 experts in all EU member states contributed empirical evidence. Work gained from discussions within an Expert Council representing core players and stakeholders in Europe and North America, and regional workshops across the EU and at the FDA. They also contributed towards validation of results. Results: The fragmentation of national markets for medicinal products lies {{at the root of the}} identification problem. About 600, 000 different products are marketed across the Union, but even in a large country like Germany only ca. 50, 000 are readily available. The great flexibility of marketing authorisation holders to provide different names for the same or equivalent products in different countries adds to this identification challenge, and naming issues related to legacy products complicate it further. – Options to identify medicinal products in a prescription are analysed, like noting a package code, the brand name of the product, the specification of an active substance only, or of a subset of similar products, from which the pharmacist has to choose. The EU-wide adoption of the International Standards Organisation’s (ISO) Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) suite of standards, as already under way by EMA and FDA for pharmacovigilance purposes, is proposed. Through globally agreed coding of packages, medicinal as well as pharmaceutical products, substances, dose forms, and other identifying attributes as needed, the identification as well as partly the ‘delivery’ problem can be solved. This will require linking to a central data base maintained by EMA, and the synchronisation of national as well as commercial medicinal and pharmaceutical product data bases with it. The full solution of the delivery problem will, however, also depend on the introduction – in countries where this is not yet allowed – and the relaxation respectively harmonisation of national substitution rules. Of course, if no equivalent product is available, delivery will fail – or require import from another country. Conclusions: Implementing digital infrastructures facilitating the univocal identification of medicinal products in regulatory and clinical contexts will generate long-term benefits for patient safety, pharmacovigilance, and positive socio-economic impacts for all key players. Harmonising the identification of medicines in regulatory processes as well as clinical documents is well on its way, but a European approach towards common processes for validation of contents, error mitigation, of linking from central hubs to national and regional levels, updates and mappings to other systems will require intensified cooperation of all stakeholders in years to come...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to evaluate the possibility of transferring the Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) model developed in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector into the pharmaceutical sector and to propose an adapted model for the German market. The German pharmaceutical market is consolidating distribution channels and demand power is shifting towards pharmacies (Hofmann, 2013 a). The manufacturers` aim for differentiation requires being closer to patients and pharmacists. Therefore, they increasingly do business directly with pharmacies (Insight Health, 2013). Wholesalers are caught between the strong supply power of manufacturers and increasing demand power of pharmacies (Hofmann, 2013 b). Exploratory research was undertaken using the case study method to consider how the ECR model from FMCG can be adapted for the pharmaceutical wholesale business. A single case study was considered as different wholesalers would not participate due to their competitive market and because I am an employee of the case company (Celesio AG). The study was conducted in the German subsidiary (GEHE Pharma). Semi structured interviews with key account managers from FMCG and pharmaceutical manufacturers, Celesio AG management board, GEHE Pharma management and <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> were conducted. Additional data were generated linked to participative observation during manufacturer meetings between GEHE Pharma and pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as from secondary and internal documentary material. Findings suggest that several similarities between the FMCG market and the pharmaceutical market exist. No aspect was found which would not allow implementing ECR principles into the pharmaceutical market in Germany. The model is adapted according to {{the research}} findings. The adjusted model considers that the pharmaceutical market shows more complexity in terms of the market actors. In this market three main participants exist: pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical wholesalers and <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> Whereas in the FMCG market the ECR model incorporates the relationship directly between FMCG manufacturers and grocery retailers; no wholesaler is considered in that model. Therefore, the adapted model needs some adjustments for the pharmaceutical wholesale market, which are presented in the research.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. The South African {{healthcare}} {{industry has}} undergone numerous changes {{over the last}} two decades in both the public and private sectors. These changes have influenced the regulatory landscape of both sectors with the aim of improving accessibility to healthcare services and providers, and making healthcare more affordable for the South African public. The South African government introduced the Medical Schemes Act No. 131 of 1998, in response to issues faced in the medical scheme industry. The act allowed for a board of trustees to regulate medical schemes in their governance (McIntyre, Thiede, Nkosi, Mutyambizi, Castilo-Riquelme, Gilson, Erasmus & Goudge, 2007). The main aim was to ensure medical schemes were able to maintain solvency levels and maintain benefits offered to beneficiaries. The pharmaceutical industry saw legislative changes governing the pricing of medicines, generic substitution of medicines and open ownership of pharmacies. The researcher aimed to provide the medical scheme industry with valuable insight into the challenges experienced by pharmacists, when processing and submitting claims for medical scheme members and their beneficiaries. The intention was to enable the medical scheme industry to improve service quality and efficiency in provider relationships, and customer relationships. The research consisted of qualitative and quantitative research methods. A focus group interview consisted of the initial phase, producing qualitative data. The researcher utilised the qualitative data to construct an online questionnaire, which he then sent out through email, to a larger group of <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in KwaZulu-Natal. The majority of <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> who participated in the research had a limited knowledge of all medical schemes and the different options available in South Africa. The majority of pharmacists in both groups were of the opinion that the redesigning and simplification of computer programmes, utilised for submitting prescriptions, would improve efficiency in service delivery.

40|$|Version anglaise d'une tribune publiée dans le Cercle les Échos [URL] {{pharmacist}} missions {{go further}} than simple distribution or administration of drugs: improving {{the health of}} patients by using the most appropriate pharmacotherapy, maximizing the contribution of pharmacists from the health care team, integrating care and pharmaceutical services in all health care areas and now/more recently contributing to form a government policy that integrates these healthcare models and payments into health care benefits. The Hospital Patient Territories bill ensures that <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> “contribute to primary care {{and participate in the}} cooperation between health professionals" and provide them with the “role of general pharmacist towards certain patients” (art. 38). From simple advice to admitting someone in an emergency room, including basic primary care, the pharmacist uses his health care professional skills to serve the patient while referring to their GP. He can also suggest benefits designed to encourage the improvement or upholding of someone’s health. The transition from collective doctors to an individual doctor based on personal needs will accelerate the transformation of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Achieving {{acceptable}} {{response rates}} from {{health care providers}} via postal questionnaires is an ongoing challenge. The use of monetary incentives {{is one of the}} most effective strategies for increasing response rates. However, the effect and cost of such an incentive on retail pharmacists’ response rates has not been well studied. Methods: A sample of 700 pharmacies was selected at random from the electronic Yellow Pages in NSW Australia and mailed a brief survey regarding pharmacotherapies and advice for smoking cessation. Half of the sample was randomly allocated to receive an offer of an US$ 14 gift voucher. Results: The response rates were 65. 9 % for the voucher group and 53. 5 % for the no-voucher group. The odds of response from the voucher group was 1. 68 (95 %CI = 1. 23, 2. 30) times greater than for the no-voucher group. The cost per additional respondent was US$ 67. 95. The incentive also reduced follow up costs by 10 %. Conclusions: A moderately sized monetary incentive is able to achieve a significant increase in response rates for <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> thereby reducing potential bias in the sample...|$|R
40|$|This study {{documented}} what <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> and {{operators of}} patent medicine shops prescribe for childhood diarrhoeas in Borno State {{in the northeastern}} part of Nigeria. Data was generated {{by a combination of}} open and confederates survey of 135 pharmacies and patent medicine shops in the state. The study found that retail pharmacies and patent medicine shop operators, in the overwhelming majority routinely prescribe drugs, particularly, antibiotics, for both watery and bloody diarrhoea. Very few of the pharmacists and almost none of the patent medicine shop operators prescribed any form of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for watery diarrhoea. There was very high discrepancy between what respondents told interviewers they usually prescribe and what was actually prescribed to confederates in their facilities. It is suggested that the non-prescription of ORT by the majority of facilities could be accounted for by pharmacists' permissive attitude to the norms. This permissive attitude was generated by the profit motive and reinforced by mothers' expectations. The study conclude that more operators can be made to prescribe ORT by instituting incentives for those who prescribe and overt sanctions for those who do not. retail pharmacies prescription childhood diarrhoeas ORT...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the awareness and attitude of the pharmacists working in the retail pharmacies toward the national adverse drug reactions (ADRs) system activities in Iraq. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a validated self-administered questionnaire was used in this study. The questionnaire was delivered to <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> (RPs) practicing in Baghdad during the study period (4 months). Results: Of the 200, only 176 pharmacists responded to the survey (response rate of 88 %). The total number of usable responses was 123 (61. 5 %). The survey findings revealed that 79 pharmacists (64. 2 %) were not aware of the Iraqi spontaneous reporting system (SRS). The restriction factors which dropping the ADRs reporting among RPs were identified. These include lack of knowledge in the way of reporting (n = 41; 33. 3 %), the unavailability of reporting forms (n = 88; 71. 6 %), and unawareness of where these reports should be sent to (n = 88; 71. 6 %). Conclusions: The study showed that the RPs in Baghdad have a very positive attitude toward ADRs but unfortunately; they are not familiar with the Iraqi SRS. The study findings emphasize the serious need for special education programs to promote ADRs reporting among RPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} which type of pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising would be the best marketing strategy for pharmaceutical companies to use. The main argument was that one-to-one marketing in the forms of print media and the Internet was the best strategy over mass media marketing in the forms of television and radio. The study researched various literary sources on the different marketing strategies which facilitated in examining the positive and negative aspects of each. One hundred surveys were distributed to medical personnel and pharmaceutical prescription consumers in both the Bay Area and San Luis Obispo County. Participants were asked various questions in order to determine DTC advertising preferences and reasons for these preferences. In addition, a series of specialized and elite interviews were preformed with three <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacists</b> in the Bay Area in order to gain insight on medical professional view of DTC advertising. Results showed that the best method for DTC advertisements is one-to-one marketing through magazines and websites. Through this method consumers can be targeted by pharmaceutical companies. In addition these advertisements offer clear information that a consumer can understand and retain. If consumers can retain information about a DTC advertisement they have a better chance of purchasing the medication...|$|R
