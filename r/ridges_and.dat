5|$|The {{observed}} {{surface of}} Ariel {{can be divided}} into three terrain types: cratered terrain, ridged terrain, and plains. The main surface features are impact craters, canyons, fault scarps, <b>ridges,</b> <b>and</b> troughs.|$|E
5|$|The second main terrain type—ridged terrain—comprises {{bands of}} <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> troughs {{hundreds}} of kilometers in extent. It bounds the cratered terrain and cuts it into polygons. Within each band, {{which can be}} up to 25 to 70km wide, are individual <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> troughs up to 200km long and between 10 and 35km apart. The bands of ridged terrain often form continuations of canyons, suggesting {{that they may be}} a modified form of the graben or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses, such as brittle failure.|$|E
5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, <b>ridges,</b> <b>and</b> protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} {{a thick layer of}} regolith, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called ejecta blocks, several of which have been observed on the surface.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{study on}} the effects of three unary and binary micro-catchment {{mulching}} methods including film mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch plantation, film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch film-mulching plantation <b>and</b> film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch film-mulching straw plantation on growth of corn and different precipitation years was conducted in allusion to the low and unstable yield of corn in the western Liaoning province of China and in comparison with the traditional plantation model. Under the condition of this experiment, through film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch film-mulching plantation <b>and</b> film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch plantation, the time for seedling emergence of corn was shortened and the emergence rate of corn was increased. Through film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch film-mulching straw plantation, the time for seedling emergence of corn was prolonged and the emergence rate of corn was increased in median water or dry years, but the emergence rate of corn was reduced in the high flow year. By contrast to traditional plantation model, film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch film-mulching plantation <b>and</b> film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch plantation boosted the increase in plant height and leaf area of corn and promoted dry matter accumulation in the early period of growth while the growth was slow, the plant height, leaf area and dry matter accumulation was always at he minimum value through film-mulching <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> ditch straw mulching plantatio...|$|R

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} pure water ice with an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface {{is composed}} of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover {{about a third of}} the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.|$|E
5|$|In pre-contact times, natives {{traveling}} up Mauna Kea {{were probably}} guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as {{no evidence of}} the latter has been found. It is possible that natural <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.|$|E
5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the {{two teeth}} is 11.2mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E

5|$|One Ferugliotherium tooth {{is thought}} to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost {{rectangular}} and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows {{on the side of the}} tooth, and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> separated by furrows. LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E
5|$|Oviraptorid eggs {{appear to}} have been 17cm (6in) long on average, and the most {{complete}} eggs found with MPC-D107/15 are thought to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14 to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The eggs are nearly identical to some that have previously been found in Mongolia, and have therefore been assigned to the oofamily (egg-taxon family) Elongatoolithidae. The eggshells are relatively thin, between 1and 1.2mm (0.03and 0.04in), and their outer surface is covered by <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> nodes that rise about 0.3mm (0.01in) above the shell. The micro-structure of the eggshells could not be properly studied, as the calcite has been heavily altered and re-crystallized.|$|E
5|$|The Matanikau River area {{included}} a peninsula called Point Cruz, {{the village of}} Kokumbona, {{and a series of}} <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> ravines stretching inland from the coast. Japanese forces used the area to regroup from attacks against U.S. forces on the island, to launch further attacks on the U.S. defenses that guarded the Allied airfield (called Henderson Field) located at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal, as a base to defend against Allied attacks directed at Japanese troop and supply encampments between Point Cruz and Cape Esperance on western Guadalcanal, and as a location for watching and reporting on Allied activity around Henderson Field.|$|E

5|$|The Northwest Power and Conservation Council {{divides the}} Kootenay River {{watershed}} into six biomes: aquatic (rivers and lakes), riparian zones, wetlands, grassland/shrubs, moderately wet forest, and dry forest. The forested zones extend through the alpine and subalpine {{reaches of the}} watershed, while grasslands dominate the low terraces and plateaus surrounding the river, especially in the Lake Koocanusa area and the Montana-Idaho portion of the watershed. In the Canada portion of the watershed, an alpine meadow ecozone occupies most of the high <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> valleys of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is located}} on the Cumberland Plateau, atop Lookout Mountain. On the summit of Lookout Mountain, the waters of Daniel Creek and Bear Creek cut gorges through the rock, {{converging}} to form Sitton Gulch Creek. The flat-topped mountains of the Cumberland Plateau are significantly different from the narrow Armuchee ridges beyond nearby Chickamauga Valley to the east. From a geological standpoint, Lookout Mountain is transitional between the flat-lying sedimentary beds of central Tennessee, and the <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> valley to the east, which display more intensive folding and faulting. Most of the canyon's rock formations consist of sandstone; shale layers below the sandstone are marked by pine trees.|$|E
5|$|The steep-sided, {{symmetrical}} stratovolcanoes in {{the region}} were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent. Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes, depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs, which are added to its slopes to create the stratovolcano. Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich volcanic rock called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> rock outcrops of more resistant materials.|$|E

5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. There are very few flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|Bathymetry is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E
