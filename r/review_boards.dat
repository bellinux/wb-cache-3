5|$|Following his resignation, Overton had {{no contact}} with the military. This {{continued}} for several decades until Overton reconnected with fellow West Point graduate Lieutenant General Charles G. Cleveland, and he discovered the Air Force had established Air Force <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> Agency to review incidents and determine if individuals had been unfairly denied medals. In the meantime, Overton became a successful businessman, owning and operating several companies.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 National Historic Preservation Act, {{which created}} the National Register of Historic Places, {{empowered}} individual states to create <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> to function {{with the state}} historical preservation officer. Illinois did not create its historic preservation program until the early 1970s, {{under the direction of}} the Illinois Department of Conservation. The Department of Conservation dispatched field surveyors to all Illinois counties to find anything that might qualify for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed {{in a string of}} cases {{limiting}} the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The Gideon v. Wainwright decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in Escobedo v. Illinois, to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning. And, in 1966, Miranda v. Arizona federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to juveniles in the following year's in re Gault (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric {{research}} is, by {{its very}} nature, interdisciplinary; combining social, biological and psychological perspectives in attempt {{to understand the nature}} and treatment of mental disorders. Clinical and research psychiatrists study basic and clinical psychiatric topics at research institutions and publish articles in journals.

25|$|In {{medical and}} {{scientific}} research, asking subjects {{for information about}} their behaviors is normally strictly scrutinized by institutional <b>review</b> <b>boards,</b> for example, to ensure that adolescents and their parents have informed consent.

These sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional means.

5000|$|Once {{a person}} is found not criminally {{responsible}} ("NCR"), {{he or she will}} have a hearing by a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> within 45 days (90 days if the court extends the delay). A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is established under Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code and is composed of at least three members, a person who is a judge or eligible to be a judge, a psychiatrist and another expert in a relevant field, such as social work, criminology or psychology. Parties at a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> hearing are usually the accused, the Crown and the hospital responsible for the supervision or assessment of the accused. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is responsible for both accused persons found NCR or accused persons found unfit to stand trial on account of mental disorder. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> dealing with an NCR offender must consider two questions: whether the accused is a [...] "significant threat to the safety of the public" [...] and, if so, what the [...] "least onerous and least restrictive" [...] restrictions on the liberty of the accused should be in order to mitigate such a threat. Proceedings before a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Often the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> will be active in conducting an inquiry. Where the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is unable to conclude that the accused is a significant threat to the safety of the public, the <b>review</b> <b>board</b> must grant the accused an absolute discharge, an order essentially terminating the jurisdiction of the criminal law over the accused. Otherwise the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> must order that the accused be either discharged subject to conditions or detained in a hospital, both subject to conditions. The conditions imposed must be the least onerous and least restrictive necessary to mitigate any danger the accused may pose to others.|$|R
25|$|In 1974 Congress {{passed the}} National Research Act {{and created a}} {{commission}} to study and write regulations governing studies involving human participants. Within the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) was established to oversee clinical trials. Now studies require informed consent, communication of diagnosis, and accurate reporting of test results. Institutional <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> (IRBs), including laypeople, are established in scientific research groups and hospitals to review study protocols and protect patient interests, to ensure that participants are fully informed.|$|E

The aftershocks of this study, {{and other human}} experiments in the United States, led {{to the establishment of}} the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research and the National Research Act. The latter requires the establishment of institutional <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> (IRBs) at institutions receiving federal support (such as grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts). Foreign consent procedures can be substituted which offer similar protections and must be submitted to the Federal Register unless a statute or Executive Order requires otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Many groups mobilized in Harlem in the 1960s, {{fighting}} for better schools, jobs, and housing. Some were peaceful and others advocated violence. By the early 1960s, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) had offices on 125th street, and acted as negotiator {{for the community}} with the city, especially in times of racial unrest. They urged civilian <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> to hear complaints of police abuse, a demand that was ultimately met.

25|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} in 1982, he {{significantly}} reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E
25|$|Pawlenty {{oversaw the}} repeal of the Profile of Learning Kindergarten through 12th grade {{graduation}} requirements and sought to reinstate them during his governorship. Renamed the Minnesota Academic Standards, they were guided by Department of Education commissioner Cheri Pierson Yecke. The bill's first draft raised several concerns by the education <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> including the amount of content, age-appropriateness, and a European-centric view of the social sciences portion. Yecke revised and expanded material based on the response. Even as both Legislative houses passed the Academic Standards bill, her confirmation as commissioner was rejected by the DFL majority Minnesota Senate. She was seen as an outsider coming from Virginia and became unpopular for having pushed the academic reforms during a tight budget session as well as her critical look of Minnesota schools. In her confirmation hearing, DFLers also noted concern over her conservative viewpoints.|$|E
25|$|Peterman {{became the}} third Democrat to be {{appointed}} by Governor Christ to lead a state agency when he was appointed on February 8, 2008 to head the Department of Juvenile Justice. Due to term limits, {{he would have been}} ineligible to run again for the House. He replaced Walter A. McNeil, who had been appointed Secretary of the Department of Corrections. Peterman said it was important to seek rehabilitation of youthful offenders and to avoid their incarceration. His prior experience with Juvenile Services Program Inc served him in preparing for the position, as did his service on the House Juvenile Justice Committee. In 2005, he sponsored a bill to create the Council on the Social Status of African-American Men and Boys. He said he would accomplish his goals by such measures as authorizing local <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> and councils to redirect first-time offenders to community-based punishments. He also pledged to staff all detention centers with registered nurses and make sure public defenders were provided to children at their first hearings. In accepting the position, he was required to resign from JSP. In August 2008, he fired twelve juvenile detention officers accused of using a state computer to watch pornography, while asserting that no children had seen the pornography.|$|E
