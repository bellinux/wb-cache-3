40|$|Summary. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} diets of high productive cows. Production conditions of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> can be variable, affecting the quality of feed. Objectives of the investigation was to study chemical composition and nutritive value of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> produced by short-term heat treatment (HTRC) and cold-pressing (CPRC) of rapeseed. In addition, the effect of treatment temperature of rapeseed on protein degradability and ruminal kinetics was studied. Rapeseed was processed at 100 °C for 15 - 20 minutes. In production of CPRC, temperature reached up to 60 °C. Protein degradability of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> was studied by the in sacco method. Chemical composition and nutritive value of CPRC were significantly different from these of HTRC. In CPRC, the content of crude protein, crude fat, metabolizable energy, metabolizable protein in dry matter was 336 g/kg; 187 g/kg; 13. 99 MJ/kg and 103 g/kg, respectively; ruminal balance was 174 g/kg. As to HTRC, these values were 349 g/kg, 111 g/kg, 12. 96 MJ/kg, 161 g/kg and 105 g/kg, respectively. CPRC had significantly higher content of crude fat and metabolizable energy (P< 0. 0001); in HTRC, the content of metabolizable protein was significantly higher (P< 0. 0001). Ruminal degradability of HTRC protein was slow. Heat treatment of rapeseed decreased effective protein degradability by 35. 8 %. The content of metabolizable protein in <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> increased by 1. 5 times (58 g per kg dry matter).

40|$|The use of biodiesel, {{especially}} of Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME), has recently {{increased in the}} European countries. This gives rise to an increasing amount of after production residues. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> is the main residue of the RME production process, and may become available in large amounts for energy recovery. Since <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> contains high levels of alkali metals, it may cause bed agglomeration, deposit formation and corrosion upon combustion in fluidized beds. This paper presents the fate of alkali metals formed during co-combustion of coal and up to 25 % of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> pellets in a 12 MW Circulating Fluidized Bed Boiler at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden). Standard fuel analyses combined with sequential leaching and SEM/EDX, showed the alkali entering the boiler. Gaseous emissions, bed samples, fly ash and deposits were analyzed in order to monitor the alkali metals distribution. Gaseous alkali chlorides were measured upstream from the convective pass at a flue gas temperature of 800 oC using an In-situ Alkali Chloride Monitor (IACM). In the same location, deposits were collected on a deposit probe fitted with rings for SEM/EDX analysis. Re-circulated bed material was analyzed as well.

The crude protein (CP) {{content of the}} pea and field bean cultivars ranged from 244 to 279 and from 320 to 347 g/kg dry matter (DM), respectively. The concentrations of several essential amino acids in protein decreased as the CP content increased.

40|$|Rapeseed {{contains}} 40 - 50 % {{oil that}} can be extracted by pressing and possibly subsequent extraction. The residue, <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake,</b> normally contains 10 - 25 % oil, but rapeseed meal subjected to extraction only contains a few percent oil. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal {{can be used as}} animal feed, fuel, biogas substrate or fertiliser. If the extracted oil is used as a vehicle fuel it is normally transesterified to rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and then glycerol is produced as a by-product. Glycerol can be used for animal feed, fuel, biogas substrate or in the chemical industry as a raw material or additive in several products. The main purpose of this work was to evaluate how <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal, together with glycerol from transesterification of rapeseed oil, could be used in different applications, and to calculate their economic values in these uses. Used as a ruminant feed, current rapeseed cultivars can provide the entire dietary protein requirement. Up to 10 % of the feed or concentrate mix for pigs, poultry and horses can comprise rapeseed feed. For piglets and horses, the palatability may limit the amount fed. The amount of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> fed is restricted by its oil content. Normally, ruminants can manage 5 % fat and horses about 2 % fat in concentrate, and pigs 5 % and poultry 1 - 1. 5 % fat in the overall diet. Glycerol can be an energy component of the feed mix. Cattle, sheep and pigs have been successfully fed a mixture containing 5 - 10 % glycerol, and poultry a mixture containing 5 %. Glycerol works well as a binding agent in feed pellet manufacture, with an admixture of 2 - 3 % giving a more solid pellet. Glycerol is hygroscopic and absorbs water from the air if too much is added to the feed mixture. This impairs feed storage qualities. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal may be incinerated, but produce an ash with a relatively low melting-point, causes sintering and deposits to form in the furnace. The amount of ash is rather high, about 6 %. The high nitrogen content (4 - 6 % of dry matter) gives high nitric oxide emissions, often 2 - 3. 6 times the emissions of fuels deficient in nitrogen. The high oil content in <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> gives it a comparatively high heat of combustion. Glycerol is difficult to incinerate alone, but can be incinerated when mixed with disintegrated solid biofuels such as sawdust or wood shavings. It would probably act as a binding agent in solid biofuel pellets or briquettes. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal {{can be used as a}}n organic fertiliser, with 4 - 6 % nitrogen, 0. 4 - 2 % phosphorus and 0. 3 - 1 % potassium. Organically bound nitrogen is released slowly. Glycerol has no value as a fertiliser unless it contains potassium residues from the catalyst (about 0. 6 %) used for transesterification, and possibly also phosphorus residues (about 0. 16 %) from the phosphoric acid that may be used to neutralise the catalyst. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake,</b> rapeseed meal and glycerol are very suitable for anaerobic digestion. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal are nitrogen-rich media that may cause too high a content of ammonium nitrate in the biogas reactor. The oil in <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> may cause other substrates such as farmyard manure to give a higher gas yield. There are similar observations of methane gas yield increasing when glycerol is digested together with protein-rich media. Glycerol can be used as a carbon source in biogas processes. The plant nutrients in <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal are more easily available after biodigestion. The economic value of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake,</b> rapeseed meal and glycerol has been calculated on the basis of the replacement value of barley and soybean meal for feed, forest wood chips for incineration, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for fertiliser, or sales of electricity and district heating from a large farm-scale biogas plant. Rapeseed by-products were most valuable when used as feed, followed by use for combustion and biogas with a high gas yield. They were least valuable when used as fertilisers and for biogas with a low gas yield. The world market values of barley, soybean meal and feed fat (rapeseed oil) had a large influence on the value of the by-products and on the gas yield etc. from the biogas plant. The price of forest wood chips and fertilisers had a smaller influence on the results, since these products had a lower initial value. Domestic animals can by far consume all the <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal {{that can be}} produced in Sweden. Dairy cows can consume large quantities. Much larger quantities of glycerol can be consumed by domestic animals than can be produced through transesterification of rapeseed oil of Swedish origin. This means that the glycerol from a considerable proportion of imported rapeseed oil could be used for feeding purposes. There is nothing that limits the amount of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake,</b> rapeseed meal and glycerol that can be used for combustion or as fertilisers, other than their economic value in these applications. Glycerol may have added value if it can be used successfully as a binding agent in feed pellets, biofuel pellets or briquettes. It is only possible to digest a limited proportion of the potential production of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal in domestic biogas plants. However, there is no problem with digesting the possible production of domestic glycerol and more in existing biogas plants. Furthermore, the glycerol may have added value because it can increase the methane gas yield from other substrates during co-digestion. Future studies should examine in detail the properties of glycerol as a binding agent in production of feed pellets, biofuel pellets and briquettes. The properties of glycerol as a carbon source for production of biogas when co-digested with other substrates should also be investigated. There is also a need for plant breeding of the rapeseed to decrease the content of anti-nutritional carbohydrates and proportion of husk in the seed. This would allow larger amounts of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and rapeseed meal to be used in animal feed, mainly for monogastric animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of making bioplastics out of oil cake from Crambe Abyssinica, Brassica Carinata and Brassica Napus (Rapeseed) was studied {{in order to}} produce added value for these by-products. The materials were hot pressed and extruded at 100 ˚C using glycerol as a plasticizer. Pressing without plasticizer produced brittle materials. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the hot pressed sheets. Ball milling of the oil cake did not result in improved properties of the pressed sheets. As the three plants all have semi-drying oils, a siccative was added in different concentrations to crosslink the oil and add to the matrix of the bioplastic. Sheets were pressed after preheating the materials 0 h, 2 h or 6 h. Sheets were also pressed from granulated extrudate with different concentrations of siccative after pre-heating for 0 h or 2 h. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the pressed sheets. Pre-heating before pressing had a larger impact than siccative concentration on the properties of crambe and carinata sheets. Siccative concentration had larger influences on the properties of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> sheets. Carinata and <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> were easier to process than crambe as they flowed better. Carinata sheets and extrudates were more flexible than crambe and <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> sheets and extrudates.

40|$|Rapeseed is the {{traditional}} name of a large winter or spring annual oilseed crop from the Brassicaceae family, and is related to mustard, cabbage, broccoli, among others. As {{one of the leading}} oilseed crops, rapeseed is primarily grown for its oil content.

This co-stream is an excellent feedstock for nutritionally valuable components such as protein, and bioactive compounds such as phenolics and peptides, not only for livestock but also for human consumption. The mentioned bioactive compounds have been found to possess potential health benefits and skin-repairing properties and thus may play an important role not only in the cosmetics but also in the treatment or prevention of many diseases.

The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and growth performance were measured untill 60 kg BW was reached, and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the colon, as well as the weight of the liver, kidney, heart, and thyroid, were recorded. The main differences between BRC and YRC were found in higher content of fat and protein, lower amounts of fibre and glucosinolates (Gls), and higher ATTD of fibre in YRC. Protein and AA SID, ATTD of nutrients, total SCFA colonic concentration, and growth performance did not significantly differ. The chemical composition of the three YRC was not uniform, the greatest differences were found among the amounts of Gls. The relative weights of the thyroid and heart were greater in pigs fed BRC than in YRC and SBM diets. Thyroid weight was positively correlated with dietary progoitrin, alkenyl Gls, and total Gls, whereas heart weight was positively correlated with progoitrin and alkenyl Gls. It was concluded that winter yellow-seeded rapeseed is a better raw material for cold-pressing than brown-seeded due to having lower Gls and fibre content. ...|$|R

A pot experiment was conducted using soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Toyoharuka) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench cv. Hybrid Sorgo) under four soil treatment combinations (cattle farmyard manure with or without biochar and <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> with or without biochar) to elucidate the mechanisms of its beneficial effects on plant growth {{in terms of the}} microbial community structure and mineral availability in soils with different types of organic manure application. The application of biochar significantly increased the growth of both species, particularly sorghum with <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> application by 1. 48 times higher than that without biochar. Microbial activity in soil was also enhanced by biochar application in both species with <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> application, particularly in sorghum. Principal component analysis using Biolog EcoPlate (TM) data indicated that biochar application changed the microbial community structure in soil, particularly sorghum-grown soil. The changes in microbial community structure in sorghum were considered to be at least partly affected by changes in soil pH due to interaction between plant and biochar under organic manure application. Biochar application had little effect on the profile of ammonium-acetate-extractable mineral elements in soil including calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium and sulfur with both types of manure application under soybean. Under sorghum, however, biochar with <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> manure application altered the profile. This alteration is attributable to an increase in the extractable concentration of certain metals in the soil including aluminum, cadmium and zinc, possibly caused by enhanced organic matter decomposition producing metal-chelating organic compounds. These different changes in the soil properties by biochar application may be directly or indirectly related to the different growth responses of different plant species to biochar application under organic manure application...|$|E

This paper presents the fate of phosphorus during co-combustion of wood chips and wood pellets with <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> pellets, a high phosphorus fuel in a 12 MW CFB boiler. 12 hour tests with 12 % and 18 % (energy basis) of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> with wood were performed with and without limestone addition. All fuels were characterised by means of standard fuel analyses combined with chemical fractionation. Retrieved ash samples were analysed using wet chemical analysis complemented with SEM/EDXA. Gaseous alkali metal chlorides as well as HCl and SO 2 were measured upstream of the convective pass at a flue gas temperature of 800 oC where also the deposit samples were collected with a deposit probe. The composition of deposits was studied with SEM/EDXA. Analyses of bed material particle cross-sections showed phosphorus compounds present within a K-silicates matrix between the agglomerated sand particles, indicating direct attack of gaseous potassium compounds on the bed surface followed by adhesion of rich in phosphorus ash particles. Build-up of the deposits took place mainly on the windward side of the probe; where up to 9 wt-% of phosphorus was present. SEM/EDXA shows that <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> addition caused an increase of K, Na besides P indicating presence of low melting phosphate salts in the deposits. During limestone addition in the deposit samples the increase of Cl could be noticed however no significant change in P content was observed.

Therefore, given the social implications surrounding physical appearance, the search for new bioactive compounds to prevent or attenuate skin ageing and enhance self-image is a priority of current research. In this context, being rich in valuable compounds, such as proteins, phenolics, lipids and vitamins, this study is focused on the potential activity of <b>rapeseed</b> press <b>cake</b> hydrolysates to be used as raw materials for skincare applications.; METHODS: In this study, the protein-rich press residue from the rapeseed oil industry was converted enzymatically into short-chain biologically active peptides using four protease products with varying substrate specificity - Alcalase 2. 4 L FG, Protex 6 L, Protamex and Corolase 7089. The antioxidant, anti-wrinkle and anti-inflammatory activities of the obtained hydrolysates were evaluated invitro while their biocompatibility with human skin fibroblasts was tested.; RESULTS: All hydrolysates were biocompatible with skin fibroblasts after 24 h of exposure, while the non-hydrolysed extract induced cell toxicity. Alcalase 2, 4 L FG and Protex 6 L-obtained hydrolysates were the most promising extracts showing improved bioactivities suitable for skin anti-ageing formulations, namely antioxidant activity, inhibiting approximately 80 % cellular reactive oxidative species, anti-inflammatory and anti-wrinkle properties, inhibiting around 36 % of myeloperoxidase activity and over 83 % of elastase activity.; CONCLUSION: The enzymatic technology applied to the rapeseed oil industry costream results in the release of bioactive compounds suitable for skincare applications.

40|$|International @ CDFA+GSCInternational audienceIntroductionThe use of {{renewable}} {{resources in the}} elaboration of various industrial materials and chemicals has been recently revitalized because of environmental concerns. Nowadays, vegetable oils constitute {{one of the most}} important classes {{of renewable}} resources. They can be extracted from the soybean or <b>rapeseed</b> press <b>cakes.</b> They are already a part of some polymeric material formulations but can also be used as polymer plasticizers To substitute paraffinic oil that are used at present as plasticizers for EPDM, modified vegetables oils were prepared as a new bio plasticizer. Efficient oxirane ring opening of fatty epoxides was performed to synthesis various poly ester and ether-ester. Some physico-chemical characterization of the synthetized modified oils were reported [ref]CC. In this paper, we wish to present our contribution in the synthesis of this bioplasticizers together with some characterizations in EPDM formulation. Results and discussionWe prepared a range of products via successive ring oxirane opening reaction. The ether-ester modified vegetable oils were prepared in two steps from epoxide derivatives. Initially, the ring opening of the epoxide with an alcohol was carried out to yield the hydroxyl-ether intermediate which was esterified in the presence of an anhydride. The polyester derivatives were prepared from the fatty epoxide via opening reaction with a series of acids then esterification of the resulting alcohol with anhydride. The reaction was performed in solvent free conditions and the influence of the catalysts (homogeneous or heterogeneous) in these reactions was evaluated. With this approach ether-ester and poly esters were prepared. Homogeneous (strong acid, Lewis acid [1, 2]) or heterogeneous catalysts (Amberlyst 15 [3]) were compared in solvent free conditions and with an excess of alcohol. With this approach fatty ether-esters were prepared. Among the evaluated catalysts, Amberlyst 15 and BF 3. OEt 2 exhibited significant activities for the two steps. Optimisations of the reaction conditions were performed in order to achieve complete conversion. The products were characterized by NMR, GC, GPC and TGA. Thermal stability plays a key role for EPDM plasticization (figure 1). Their properties as EPDM bioplasticizer are compared to non-modified oil and fatty polyester. Cyrille GraphFig. 2 : Rheology analysis of modified and non modified oil. Some vegetable oils derivatives may be good candidates to substitute paraffinic oils usually added as plasticizer. The influence of the chemical modifications on the properties will be described. ConclusionThis two-step ring opening approach allowed to prepare a range of potential bioplasticizers for EPDM starting from vegetable oils. This is an interesting method to add new functions on fatty acid esters and to have low polarity with different functions. References 1. Soi, H.

40|$|Abstract: Agglomeration {{occurring}} {{during the}} firing of phosphorus‐rich biomass is not fully understood. It has become clear that the ash‐forming matter in agricultural biomass (e. g., <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake)</b> is phosphorus dominated and that phosphate species are involved in agglomeration. Understanding the agglomeration mechanisms would provide valuable insight into possible strategies for preventing defluidization. The objective of this work was to study the ash composition resulting from the combustion of a phosphorus‐rich fuel, in particular, the phosphorus compounds formed; the focus was the effect of ash composition on the formation of sticky ash particles, which cause defluidization. Eleven mixtures of <b>rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> and bark with varying Ca/P molar ratio were studied. Using a 5 kW quartz BFB reactor operated at approximately 800 °C, eight‐hour combustion tests were performed prior to each agglomeration experiment. Fly ash and bottom ash samples were extensively analyzed with SEM/EDX, and the fuel properties were also determined. <b>Rapeseed</b> <b>cake</b> ash consists of particles containing different K/Na‐Ca/Mg‐P compounds. The ash composition responsible for low defluidization temperatures was found to lie {{in the region of}} the ternary diagram containing 30 ‐ 40 mol % P 2 O 5, 20 ‐ 40 mol % (CaO+MgO), and 30 ‐ 50 mol % (K 2 O+Na 2 O). Sodium probably formed CaNaPO 4, but it was also found in mixtures with other phosphates. The addition of bark favoured the formation of orthophosphates containing 40 ‐ 50 mol% (CaO+MgO), which increased the first melting temperature of the ash...|$|E
