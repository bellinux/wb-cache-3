40|$|The Max Planck Institute {{welcomes the}} {{initiative}} of the European Commission for a binding legal instrument on collective management of copyright and related rights in the EU. Numerous provisions are to be appreciated (paras 15 and 31). Yet the Commission seems to fail {{to take account of}} the full legal framework and factual circumstances that have structured the current system of collective rights management. Disposing of natural monopolies in a two-sided market (paras 5 - 9), collecting societies (about this terminology, see footnote 2) should not refuse to grant access to their services to <b>rightholders</b> and users. Hence, it is strongly recommended that the European legislature follows the experience of numerous Members States and proposes an obligation to contract with <b>rightholders</b> (para 10) as well as with users (para 11). The critique on the Commission’s approach to cross-border licences for online rights on musical works as set forth in the Recommendation of 2005 (footnote 6) has unfortunately not been duly considered and the Commission’s assessment of the practical effects of the Recommendation is mistaken (paras 9 - 10, 12, 17, 46 et seq.). Differences of substantive copyright law among Member States still constitute an obstacle to the establishment of an internal market for works. This is why the Institute deems the Commission's sectorial approach to the regulation of cross-border licensing to be problematic. Also such regulation would require further harmonisation of substantive copyright law (paras 13, 20 and 25). Moreover, the Proposal fails to take account of statutory remuneration rights and cases of mandatory collective management (see paras 14, 18 and 36). Both pursue specific protection of original <b>rightholders.</b> In this regard the Proposal’s refusal to distinguish between different categories of <b>rightholders</b> raises concerns (paras 15 - 18, 28, 55). Since collecting societies manage copyrights and related rights arising from national law, and considering the benefits of an authorisation system (paras 57 and 69 et seq.), which can be found in several Member States, the Institute advises the European legislature to clearly state that the intellectual property exception of article 17 (11) of the Service Directive applies to collecting societies (paras 19 - 24). The Proposal endangers the balance both between different categories of <b>rightholders</b> and between <b>rightholders</b> and users that the established system of collective management of copyright in Europe traditionally seeks to achieve (see paras 32 - 45, 64). It thereby compromises the laudable goal to foster the establishment of an internal market for online uses of works across Europe (paras 12, 26, 46 - 65) ...|$|R

50|$|EU Directive 2009/24, on {{the legal}} {{protection}} of computer programs, governs reverse engineering in the European Union. The directive states:(15) The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation of {{the form of the}} code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorisation of the <b>rightholder.</b> An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the <b>rightholder</b> or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program.|$|E

40|$|We {{see them}} everywhere. They carry {{significant}} values. All companies have one. Many companies build their business around one. This {{is what we}} call a trademark. The trademark is a mark for recognition and functions as a warranty for survival and continuous income which makes companies invest heavily in it. The biggest, currently existing, threat to trademarks is infringements. Infringements have grown into a significant multinational organized criminality. One of the reasons is that it is cheap to infringe. Currently, the damages provision in the Trademark Act is frequently discussed and criticized. In order to investigate whether this criticism is justified, this master thesis aims to compare the prevailing legal situation of trademark infringement damages to the needs and requirements of active trademark <b>rightholders.</b> The result illustrates that the damages in practice fail to repair the <b>rightholder’s</b> injury caused by the infringement as well as to prevent the potential infringer from infringing. The paper accordingly illustrates why the intended functions of the damages are not fulfilled, where the system fails and what consequences such failure has. From case law, legal doctrine and public press I have been able to extract a number of methods for calculating and supporting damages caused by trademark infringements. The intention is for it to function as a tool for <b>rightholders</b> when determining which method is most appropriate for their specific infringement situation.

The doctrines, of course, of performance in contract law and adverse possession in property law are prominent examples of this widespread erosion phenomenon.

On the other hand, the risk of erosion may reinforce the <b>rightholder's</b> motivation to take anti-erosion measures, bolstering the credibility of the threat to enforce, thus better preserving the entitlement. The article proves that these two effects of erosion rules always balance out. The same amount of value will be extracted from the right holder irrespective of the law's erosion doctrine. The article also demonstrates the limits of this "irrelevance" claim and the factors that may lead to its collapse.

In some cases, this has led to tensions and even litigations between the providers of these new business models and the <b>rightholders</b> or their service providers.
