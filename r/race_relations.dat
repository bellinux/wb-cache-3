5|$|Douglas Blackmon is a Wall Street Journal reporter. He {{grew up in}} Washington County, Mississippi, {{where as}} a seventh grader he was {{encouraged}} by his teacher and his mother to research a local racist incident, despite the opposition of some citizens.

5|$|Mugabe's initial {{calls for}} racial {{reconciliation}} failed to stem deteriorating <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> and growing white flight. Relations with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) also declined, with Mugabe crushing ZAPU-linked opposition in Matabeleland during the Gukurahundi between 1982 and 1985; at least 10,000 people, mostly Ndebele civilians, {{were killed by}} Mugabe's Fifth Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century. These ideas, considered subversive in the severely restricted Puerto Rico of the era, had nevertheless a considerable impact in the island nation's political and social history. His ideas on <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> alone had {{a major impact on}} economics and the social makeup of the island.|$|E

Filipinos are the second-largest Asian American group in the country. The United States hosts the largest population of Filipinos outside the Philippines, with a Historic Filipinotown in Los Angeles designated in August 2002, the first district established outside the Philippines to honor and recognize the area's Filipino community.|$|R

5|$|In 1965 Constantine {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Sports Council, which aimed to develop sport in Britain. Two years later, he was appointed to the three-person <b>Race</b> <b>Relations</b> Board, formed through the <b>Race</b> <b>Relations</b> Act, to investigate cases of racial discrimination. In this role he spoke out against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, a stance that led to an offer from the Liberal Party, which he declined, to stand as parliamentary candidate for Nelson. Later, he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate the release, after a military coup, of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the overthrown Prime Minister of Nigeria. Constantine was appointed to the BBC's General Advisory Committee in 1966 and became a BBC Governor two years later, although declining health restricted his involvement. The following year the students of St Andrews University elected Constantine as Rector, but again his health prevented him performing effectively in this role. In his last years, Constantine was criticised for becoming part of the Establishment; Private Eye mocked him, while the new generation of West Indian immigrants believed he was out of touch. More radical black spokesmen disapproved of his conciliatory approach to racist incidents.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{practicing}} {{law as a}} partner with her husband at the plaintiffs law firm of Handelman and Kilroy, Kilroy was a social worker, hospital technician and tutor. In 1988, as chairman of her local branch of the National Lawyers Guild, Kilroy signed a letter urging Columbus Mayor Dana G. Rinehart to support an order in favor of creating an equal employment opportunity chief to handle <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> issues in the Columbus Division of Police.|$|E
5|$|<b>Race</b> <b>relations</b> were tense {{during the}} Reconstruction era, as whites {{resisted}} freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E

5|$|Sanford was a {{major public}} figure of the post-World WarII South. He {{played a key role}} in the {{transformation}} of Southern politics into the New South, primarily in the areas of <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> and education. In recognition of his efforts in education and in countless other areas, a 1981 Harvard University survey named him one of the 10 best governors of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{story has}} been read as an {{analysis}} of <b>race</b> <b>relations,</b> not {{between black and white}} but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices. The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States. The ending of the story, however, has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered.|$|E
5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led {{a boycott}} of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting against its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first <b>Race</b> <b>Relations</b> Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Cities are {{normally}} easy to capture. If a city is unoccupied, then a player {{should have no}} trouble just riding in and claiming the city. However, if the city is occupied, the player should be prepared for some resistance. If there's a wall around the city, the player won't be able to enter unless they have siege weapons or a unit that can fly or scale walls. Initially most cities are under independent control, depending upon the <b>race's</b> <b>relation</b> to you they will either join you for a fee giving you control {{of the city and}} troops or force you to defeat their troops before they bow to you.|$|R
50|$|Another {{coaching}} change {{took place}} during the season when on November 14, Missouri head coach Gary Pinkel announced that he would be resigning from his position {{at the conclusion of the}} season. Pinkel said he was resigning due to health reasons, citing his diagnoses with lymphoma earlier in May. The announcement came during a tumultuous time in Columbia as the university and community were also dealing with <b>race</b> <b>relation</b> issues which lead to the school's president and chancellor also resigning. Upon completing his 15th season at Missouri, Pinkel will finish his coaching career with the most wins, games coached, and bowl victories in program history.|$|R
40|$|Following the upheavals of 2001 in the {{northern}} England mill towns, {{there has been a}} renewed effort in policy circles to reconceptualise the terms of civic engagement between Britain's ethnic communities. Labelled 'community cohesion', the official agenda has drawn extensively from scholarly observations on social capital and, more recently, on an 'ethics of hospitality', to recommend a doctrine of social integration at a local scale. This paper suggests the ideals and ethos behind the development of such cohesion policies are incomplete and bear a productive contradiction, which promises an ethical reflection on the values at the intellectual core of New Labour's <b>race</b> <b>relation</b> policy...|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the <b>Race</b> <b>Relations</b> Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|Banks was {{divorced}} from Eloyce in 1981. She received several valuable items from his playing career {{as part of}} their divorce settlement, including his 500th home run ball. She sold the items not long after the divorce. He remarried in 1984. In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives to discuss <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> in baseball after allegations of racial slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott. Banks married Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man. In late 2008, Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter.|$|E
5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} {{untouched by the}} Civil War. Missouri, as a slave state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> in Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, a black man, was lynched in 1889.|$|E

5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new {{constitution}} in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to <b>race</b> <b>relations.</b> Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} orcish blood, half-orcs are on poor terms {{with some of}} the other <b>races.</b> <b>Relations</b> are {{particularly}} troubled with elves and dwarves, due to racial enmity between orcs and these races. It is still possible for a half-orc to find camaraderie with an elf or a dwarf; dwarves in particular are willing to befriend half-orcs who have proven themselves worthy of trust. Half-elves tend to be sympathetic toward half-orcs, knowing the hardships of being an outcast from both of their parent races. Halflings and gnomes are generally accepting of half-orcs and happily interact with them. Half-orcs adopt different attitudes to gain acceptance from those who are wary of their orcish heritage. Some are reserved, some demonstrate public virtue, while others force respect through physical intimidation. Half-orcs living among humans may choose human names in order to fit in, or orcish names to intimidate others.|$|R
