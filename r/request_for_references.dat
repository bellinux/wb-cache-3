40|$|Personal {{tutoring}} at the University of Liverpool {{operated on}} {{the same set of}} assumptions for many years. All students were allocated to a tutor on arrival. Tutors were expected to make themselves known to their group of tutees, explain how they could be contacted and encourage tutees to come to see them about any problems they were encountering. As far as possible the tutor would remain the same throughout the student’s programme and would be expected to respond to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>references</b> when the student left. Tutors in turn expected to be allocated around eight students per cohort {{and to be able to}} refer students with problems beyond their competence to the relevant central services – welfare, counselling and careers. Beyond this minimum set of assumptions, the role evolved in different departments in response to the perceived needs of the students. Some went to considerable effort to ensure that tutees and tutors met at least once or twice a year. In other departments, more frequently on the science side of the University, tutor groups met regularly in timetabled slots during the first semester or even the first year as part of the academic programme. Sometimes these meetings were tied into specific modules...|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{reference procedure}} has been crucial {{in the legal}} integration of the Europe Union. The procedure allows the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to involve national courts in the application and enforcement of European law. In this paper we analyze why the ECJ receives more <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> a preliminary <b>reference</b> from some member states than from others. While {{this is not a}} new question, only a few systematic comparative tests have been presented to date, and these display important theoretical and methodological shortcomings. Theoretically, previous studies underestimate or neglect two intuitively plausible factors: country size and litigation rates. We argue that courts in bigger and highly judicialized countries send more references to Luxembourg. Methodologically, the quantitative design of existing comparative studies give a first indication of possible causal relationships, but several of the cases remain not well explained. We argue that country comparison is improved by analyzing necessary and sufficient conditions that highlight the particular combination of factors for each case. We apply a mixed quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis and test existing and new explanations for variation in the number of preliminary references from the fifteen old EU member states in the period from 1995 to 2006...|$|R

Your <b>request</b> <b>for</b> scheduling information (<b>Reference</b> 2) was responded to (Reference 3) and in accordance with that schedule, please find enclosed an amendment (original plus 15 copies) to the Private Fuel Storage Facility (PFSF) License Application (LA) that describes a new transportation corridor for the rail option, {{as well as a}} new location for the Intermodal Transfer Point (ITP). These changes are a result of our recently completed transportation study and field surveys that were previously discussed with you and described at the Environmental Impact Statement Scoping Meeting on June 2, 1998. The proposed new rail spur originates from the Union Pacific mainline at Low Junction south of 1 - 80 and proceeds along the western side of the Skull Valley to the PFSF. The new ITP is approximately 1. 8 miles west of Timpie Junction and still utilizes Skull Valley Road for the heavy haul option. Although transporting shipping casks by direct rail to the PFSF is the preferred option, heavy haul from the ITP is still considered a viable alternative. j Although most of the license amendment changes involve revisions to the Environmental Report which describe the interfaces and effects on the environment of the new rail corridor and ITP location, the LA, Safety Analysis Report, and Emergency Plan have also been revised to reflect related information.
