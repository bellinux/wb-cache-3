5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatross</b> colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
5|$|One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre, {{near the}} {{important}} bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra {{and the surrounding}} islands. The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face {{and how we can}} protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK. Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation. For example, the northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatross</b> colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.|$|E
5|$|The adult plumage {{of most of}} the {{albatrosses}} {{is usually}} some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. The extent of colouration varies: the southern <b>royal</b> <b>albatross</b> is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males, while the Amsterdam albatross has an almost juvenile-like breeding plumage {{with a great deal of}} brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three albatross species, the black-footed albatross and the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the light-mantled albatross). Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage.|$|E
50|$|Northern <b>royal</b> <b>{{albatross}}es</b> nest on the Chatham Islands (Forty-fours Island, Big Sister Island, and Little Sister Island), Enderby Island in the Auckland Islands, and at Taiaroa Head on the Otago Peninsula of New Zealand. The Taiaroa Head colony is {{the only}} albatross colony found on a human-inhabited mainland in the Southern hemisphere. When they are not breeding, northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses</b> undertake circumpolar flights in the southern oceans, and in particular like the Humboldt Current and the Patagonian Shelf.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSouthern <b>Royal</b> <b>Albatrosses</b> (Diomedea epomophora) were satellite-tracked from Campbell Island {{during the}} {{incubation}} period in 1997 and 1999. Their foraging activity {{was restricted to}} shelf and shelf-break areas within 1250 km of their breeding site. Foraging activity by 8 of the 14 individuals tracked was concentrated at a zone near the Snares Islands, on the Campbell Plateau. Southern and Northern <b>Royal</b> <b>Albatrosses</b> (D. sanfordi) foraged on average nearer their breeding site than two other species of greater albatrosses (Gibson's [D. gibsoni], and Wandering [D. exulans] Albatrosses) studied during the incubation period...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{breeding}} sites for the Chatham fulmar prion. [...] It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of Buller's and northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dunedin {{is also a}} centre for ecotourism. The world's only {{mainland}} <b>royal</b> <b>albatross</b> {{colony and}} several penguin and seal colonies lie within the city boundaries on the Otago Peninsula. To the south, {{on the western side}} of Lake Waihola, are the Sinclair Wetlands.|$|E
25|$|In 1904 {{a marine}} fish {{hatchery}} was established at Aquarium Point, Portobello. Another sign of changing attitudes to wild {{life was the}} self-establishment of the <b>royal</b> <b>albatross</b> colony at Taiaroa Head in the 1920s which was now carefully nurtured for its scientific interest.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{diversity}} of flora and fauna on the Otago Peninsula. Avifauna observed include the endangered yellow-eyed penguin, Megadyptes antipodes, little blue penguin, shags, and the <b>royal</b> <b>albatross.</b> For albatross, Taiaroa Head has been colonised, this being the only location in the world close to large-scale human cultivation and habitation. Various species of wading birds also inhabit the peninsula, notably royal spoonbills, which are a common sight around Hooper's Inlet and Papanui Inlet on the peninsula's Pacific coast.|$|E
50|$|The great {{albatrosses}} range {{across the}} Southern Ocean, and nest (for the most part) on isolated oceanic islands. The wandering albatrosses nest on islands around the Southern Ocean, from the Atlantic Ocean (South Georgia and Tristan da Cunha), to the Indian Ocean and New Zealand's Subantarctic islands. The <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses</b> nest only on New Zealand's Subantarctic islands, with one unusual colony on New Zealand's Otago Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|As {{a part of}} {{the famous}} Otago Peninsula, the harbor water is known for various rare wildlife. The area is the home of many species of wading birds. Other bird species which visit the harbour include two species of penguins, little penguin and famous yellow-eyed penguins. Taiaroa Head, {{at the tip of the}} Otago Peninsula, is home to a colony of {{northern}} <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses,</b> the only such close to a city in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the NSWASG lie in the pioneer {{albatross}} banding activities started by Doug Gibson and Allan Sefton in 1956 at Bellambi in the Illawarra region, and by Bill Lane and Harry Battam in 1958 at Malabar, some 56 km further north in south-eastern Sydney. This followed the realisation that large concentrations of great albatrosses appeared in winter off the New South Wales coast not far from Sydney, and raised the possibility among local amateur ornithologists of catching useful numbers at sea for banding. Black-browed albatrosses also occurred in similar numbers, but wandering albatrosses were considered easier to catch because of their “more phlegmatic disposition”, so the banding programs focussed on the latter. [...] At the time there {{were thought to be}} only two great albatross species - the wandering and <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses,</b> with the <b>royal</b> (now split into northern royal and southern <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses)</b> not known to occur along the coast of eastern Australia. The group, incorporating both banding programs, was formed in 1958 to operate as part of the Australian Bird Banding Scheme. [...] Its objective was “to accumulate… as much information as possible concerning Diomedea exulans when at sea”.|$|R
25|$|To the east, Dunedin City {{includes}} {{the entirety of}} the Otago Peninsula, a long finger of land that formed the southeastern rim of the Dunedin Volcano. The peninsula is lightly settled, almost entirely along the harbour coast, and much of it is maintained as a natural habitat by the Otago Peninsula Trust. The peninsula contains several fine beaches, and is home to a considerable number of rare species, such as yellow-eyed and little penguins, seals, and shags. Most importantly, it contains the world's only mainland breeding colony of <b>royal</b> <b>albatross,</b> at Taiaroa Head on the peninsula's northeastern point.|$|E
25|$|At the {{entrance}} to the Otago Harbour the peninsula rises to Taiaroa Head, home to a breeding colony of northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatross,</b> the only colony of albatross to be found on an inhabited mainland. The viewing centre for the albatross colony is one of the peninsula's main ecotourism attractions, along with other wildlife such as seals and yellow-eyed penguins. Most of the Otago Peninsula is freehold farming land, with increasing numbers of small holdings or lifestyle blocks. Some biodiversity sites such as Taiaroa Head are managed as sanctuaries for wildlife. Many species of seabirds and waders in particular may be found around the tidal inlets, including spoonbills, plovers, and herons.|$|E
500|$|The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) is a South American {{bird in the}} New World vulture family Cathartidae and is {{the only}} member of the genus Vultur. Found in the Andes {{mountains}} and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It has a maximum wingspan of [...] exceeded only by the wingspans of four seabirds and water birds—the roughly [...] maximum of the wandering albatross, southern <b>royal</b> <b>albatross,</b> great white pelican and Dalmatian pelican.|$|E
50|$|The great {{albatrosses}} {{are predominantly}} white in plumage as adults, with birds becoming whiter as they age. The two <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses</b> at {{all ages and}} the larger, older male wandering albatrosses are totally white-bodied, while adult females and younger animals of the other species have dark pencilling marks {{on the edges of}} their feathers. Generally the smaller species or subspecies and the juveniles have more dark brown colour. The recently discovered Amsterdam albatross retains the dark brown plumage of juvenile birds into adulthood.|$|R
50|$|The great {{albatrosses}} are seabirds in {{the genus}} Diomedea in the albatross family. The genus Diomedea formerly included all albatrosses except the sooty albatrosses, but in 1996 the genus was split, with the mollymawks and the North Pacific albatrosses both being elevated to separate genera. The great albatrosses themselves form two species complexes, the wandering and Amsterdam <b>albatrosses,</b> and the <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses.</b> The splitting {{of the great}} albatrosses into six or seven species has been accepted by most, though not all authorities.|$|R
50|$|Richdale's main ornithological {{interest}} was in seabirds, especially penguins and petrels, {{and he was}} engaged in long-term studies of various species {{for most of his}} life. He was the driving force to gain protection for the colony of northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses</b> at Taiaroa Head, Otago, after discovering the first successful fledgling there in 1938. Although his fieldwork was carried out in southern New Zealand, he spent some time studying overseas, as a Fulbright Fellow at Cornell University (1950-1951), as a Nuffield Research Fellow at the Edward Grey Institute for Bird Research (1952-1955) and, after retirement, again as a Nuffield Fellow, at the Zoological Society of London (1960-1963).|$|R

50|$|The {{northern}} <b>royal</b> <b>albatross</b> or toroa, Diomedea sanfordi, {{is a large}} seabird {{from the}} albatross family. It was split from the closely related southern <b>royal</b> <b>albatross</b> as recently as 1998, though not all scientists support that conclusion and consider both {{of them to be}} subspecies of the <b>royal</b> <b>albatross.</b>|$|E
50|$|Northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses</b> {{are listed}} as an {{endangered}} species by the IUCN, and they have an occurrence range of 64300000 km2, with a breeding range of 8 km2. 6,500 to 7,000 pairs breed on the Chatham Islands annually along with 60 pairs at Taiaroa Head, for an estimated total of 20,000 birds, although this is a 2012 estimate. In 1985 their main breeding grounds on the Chatham Islands have been badly damaged {{by a series of}} intense storms and the resulting lack of nesting material has lowered their breeding success. Chicks and eggs of birds breeding on the South Island have also been preyed upon by introduced species, such as cats, bottle flies, and stoats. Finally, longline fishing is the biggest threat to this bird, even though it has been reduced.|$|R
50|$|A small beach, Pilots Beach, {{is located}} {{just inside the}} harbour {{entrance}} {{to the south of}} the head, and many forms of marine life, such as New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions are often to be seen.At Pilots beach is the largest colony of little or blue penguins remaining on the Otago Peninsula. Nearby are important breeding habitats of the threatened yellow-eyed penguin. There may also be seen a number of dusky dolphins, orcas and migratory large whales such as southern rights and humpbacks. Their sightings in these areas are on the increase and Taiaroa Head {{may be one of the}} best vintage points along Otago coasts. The part of Taiaroa Head where northern <b>royal</b> <b>albatrosses</b> breed is managed by the NZ Department of Conservation as a nature reserve with restricted entry. On adjacent land the Otago Peninsula Trust manage a visitor centre and run guided tours into the Nature Reserve. Pilots Beach is managed as a recreation reserve by the Dunedin City.|$|R
25|$|Development of {{the ship}} from the Admiralty sketch design was based around the Fairey IIID {{seaplane}} being operated for the RAN by the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 101 Flight. Albatross could carry up to nine aircraft—six active and three in reserve—in three internal hangars; their incorporation inside the ship's hull resulted in an unusually high freeboard in the forward half of the vessel, and forced the propulsion machinery, accommodation, and bridge to all {{be located in the}} aft half. Three recovery cranes were used to manipulate the aircraft. The Faireys were removed from service shortly before Albatross entered service, and were replaced by the Supermarine Seagull Mark III. The Mark IIIs were unsuited for operations aboard Albatross, particularly as the aircraft were not durable enough to withstand catapult launches. Specifications for a new aircraft design were drawn up to the RAN and RAAF, and Supermarine designed the Seagull Mark V (later to be called the Walrus) specifically for Albatross, although the design was later adopted by the <b>Royal</b> Navy. <b>Albatross</b> was removed from seagoing service in 1933, two months before the Mark Vs entered service, although the aircraft were operated from the vessel while she was at anchor. In addition, the new Seagulls were too tall to manoeuvre around inside the hangars, although this problem was worked around by placing the aircraft, with undercarriage retracted, on specially designed trolleys.|$|R
