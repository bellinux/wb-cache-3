40|$|Compared {{extinction}} and 4 reinforcement-based {{procedures for}} eliminating a response in 5 groups of 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Two procedures provided for reinforcement {{of a specific}} alternative behavior (ALT-R), while 2 others were differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO) contingencies. The effect of 10 -sec and 1 -sec response-reinforcment intervals was examined {{with each of the}} ALT-R and DRO groups in (a) a training phase, in which an original response was established; (b) a response elimination phase; (c) an extinction phase; and (d) a <b>reacquisition</b> <b>phase.</b> The fastest response elimination occurred in the ALT-R group, and the slowest occurred in the DRO 1 -sec group. All reinforcement-based procedures showed an increase in original lever responses during the extinction phase, but this effect was lessened for both the groups that had experienced the 10 -sec response-reinforcement interval. All groups showed rapid recovery of the original lever responses during reacquisition, but slower recovery was shown in the DRO 10 -sec group.

40|$|Purpose. Augmented {{feedback}} {{is an important}} variable influencing motor learning. Previous studies show reduced feedback frequency benefits motor learning in young adults more than a comparison group of children, who benefit from frequent feedback during practice. It is unclear how motor and central nervous system differences in children with cerebral palsy may impact their use of feedback in motor skill acquisition. This study investigated the effect of augmented visual feedback (FB) on performance and learning of an upper extremity motor skill in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (SHCP) as they practiced with their less affected arm, compared to typically developing children (TDC). Methods. Participants were 8 - 17 years with academic performance within two grade levels. Both TDC (n = 20) and participants with SHCP (n = 19) were screened for visual perception (MVPT- 3) and manual dexterity (Box and Block). Children were divided into groups receiving frequent FB (100 %) or faded FB (62 %). Group differences for acquisition, retention, and reacquisition were compared in relation to FB level. Results. Both groups of children used visual FB to improve motor performance during skill practice. All children receiving 62 % FB performed with greater error than children receiving 100 % FB during the acquisition phase (p =. 012), delayed retention no-feedback test (p =. 017), and <b>reacquisition</b> <b>phase</b> (p =. 042). Children with SHCP in both FB groups performed with significantly greater error than TDC during the entire acquisition phase (p <. 001), delayed retention no-feedback test (p =. 031) and <b>reacquisition</b> <b>phase</b> (p =. 001). While no significant within group feedback effect was found for children with SHCP, there was a trend for greater accuracy in the 100 % group {{as compared to the}} 62 % group during acquisition (p =. 092) and this trend was seen again during reacquisition when FB was reintroduced (p =. 092). Conclusions. Results suggest that for children with SHCP skill acquisition is furthered by visual FB regarding their movement accuracy. Children with SHCP use visual FB {{in a manner similar to}} TDC, although differences in learning were evident during the acquisition, delayed retention, and reacquisition phases. Further investigation is needed to determine clinical implications. Occupational TherapyMastersUniversity of New Mexico. Occupational Therapy ProgramBurtner, Patricia A. Kantak, Shailesh S.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Successful {{long-term}} dieting {{appears to}} be difficult, and part of its difficulty might be explained by processes related to classical appetitive conditioning. Increasing the speed of extinction of appetitive responses to food cues and decreasing the magnitude of returns of these responses could help increase the long-term effectiveness of weight loss attempts. Two extinction techniques hypothesized to slow down rapid reacquisition of conditioned appetitive responses were investigated: the provision of 1) occasional reinforced extinction trials (OR) and 2) unpaired unconditioned stimuli (USs) during extinction (UNP). METHODS: After acquisition, participants (N = 90) received one of three extinction trainings: OR, UNP, or normal extinction (control), followed by a <b>reacquisition</b> <b>phase.</b> Their desire to eat, US expectancy, and salivation were measured. Effects of impulsivity on different phases of appetitive conditioning were also assessed. RESULTS: It was found that both extinction techniques were successful in reducing the rate of reacquisition of US expectancies. Participants in the OR condition also demonstrated a slower extinction of US expectancies and desires to eat. However, the reacquisition of conditioned desires was not affected by either extinction technique. Impulsivity did not moderate responses during acquisition or extinction, but appeared {{to slow down the}} reacquisition of conditioned desires. LIMITATIONS: US expectancies and eating desires were not completely extinguished, and a few differences in baseline responses caused difficulty in interpreting some of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the provision of occasional reinforced extinction trials and unpaired USs seem promising techniques to slow down reacquisition, but that additional studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|Spice' is a smokable herbal mixture marketed under many {{brand names}} as herbal {{alternatives}} to Cannabis. Spice users report experiences {{similar to those}} produced by Cannabis and regular users may develop addiction and experience withdrawal and symptoms. Spice contains dried, shredded plant material and chemical additives that could be responsible for its psychoactive cannabis-like effects. We analyzed by GC-IT/MS the composition of four different specimens of Spice drugs (Artic Synergy, Silver, Gold, Diamond). In all the samples tested we found the presence of JWH- 018 (1 -pentyl- 3 -(1 -naphthoyl) indole), a potent CB 1 and CB 2 synthetic agonist. Then, we investigated the rewarding properties of JWH- 018 by in vivo microdialysis and intravenous self-administration behavior (SA) in separate groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats. In microdialysis studies, we observed that JWH- 018, at the dose of 0. 25 mg/kg ip, preferentially stimulates extracellular dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell with respect to core and prefrontal cortex while no sub-regional differences were observed in the DA output after lower and higher doses tested (0. 125 and 0. 5 mg/kg ip). The administration of the CB 1 receptor inverse agonist/antagonist rimonabant (1 mg/kg ip 30 min before JWH- 018) blocked the NAc shell DA increase for 1 h after JWH- 018 injection. In SA studies, rats implanted with a jugular catheter were trained to self-administer JWH- 018 (10 and 20 µg/kg/inf iv) in single daily 1 h session for 11 weeks, under an initial Fixed Ratio (FR) 1 schedule, than increased to FR 3. Active nose-poking significantly increased over inactive ones from the 21 st SA session (20 µg/kg/inf iv, FR 3, acquisition phase) and the reinforcing effect was blocked by rimonabant (1 mg/kg ip, 30 min before SA session). However, when vehicle was substituted for JWH- 018 (37 th SA session, extinction phase), a low reduction of SA behavior was observed. But, the replacement of vehicle with JWH- 018, significantly increased the rate responding {{and the number of}} injections (<b>reacquisition</b> <b>phase).</b> These results suggest that the JWH- 018 shares with the psychoactive compound in Cannabis (THC) and with other drugs of abuse the property of stimulating preferentially NAc shell DA and of being self-administered by rats. Moreover, JWH- 018 is more potent than THC and our results suggest an important role of active metabolites. Metabolites quantification in plasma by GC/MS and behavioral (motor activity, nociception, body temperature, aggressiveness and short and long term memory) studies will be completed in rats and mice to fully evaluate the neurobiological effects of JWH- 018 and its active metabolites...|$|E
