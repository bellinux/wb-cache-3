5|$|Pre-game media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn being left out of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn fans in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game.

On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall had a record-breaking season. Both teams also had high-ranked defenses, and Tech's appearance in the 2000 Sugar Bowl also was mentioned in the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven {{teams with}} two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought two different tyre compounds to the race; the Soft and the Medium dry compound tyres. The A1-Ring underwent minor safety {{changes in the}} <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> race. The modifications were new kerbs placed across the track with flagstones inside the kerbs to prevent dust from accumulating on the circuit.

If some tsunami like tsunami induced to Landslide S 4 occurs in NSCS, particularly in the 32 run-up splace mentioned above, the coastal production and living quarters will suffer greatly or even a catastrophe.|$|R
50|$|Ali al-Mirghani, {{leader of}} the Khatmiyya, was often in {{opposition}} to Abd al-Rahman and the Ansar. Both of these Sufi movements organized youth groups and supported competing parties in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> independence. <b>The</b> Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 discussed {{the future of the}} Sudan, among other subjects. The Sudanese were not consulted. Educated Sudanese became increasingly concerned, and <b>the</b> Ansar appealed <b>to</b> many people in this group. The leaders portrayed <b>the</b> Mahdi <b>to</b> them as <b>the</b> first Sudanese nationalist and Abd al-Rahman was to many an attractive {{leader of the}} independence movement. In contrast, Ali al-Mirghani and the Khatmiyya became identified with the pro-Egyptian school of thought that favored unity of the Nile Valley.|$|R
