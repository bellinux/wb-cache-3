5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of the mist. This optical {{phenomenon}} occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. The Italian term Fata Morgana {{is derived from the}} name of Morgan le Fay, a powerful sorceress in Arthurian legend.|$|E
5|$|The low-lying {{areas of}} the North Somerset Levels and Somerset Levels {{have been subject to}} {{thousands}} of years of flooding and man's attempts to control the flow of water. In the north of the county the Limestone of the Mendip Hills dominates the landscape, while in the south the Blackdown and Quantock Hills <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of the levels. The highest areas are on Exmoor. The wide variety of landscapes has led to several areas being designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest for geological reasons, and support a range of flora and fauna as {{can be seen from the}} List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton {{side of the}} fence. When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two get into a fight amid the garbage bags. The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him. Leslie explains she made a party that he would want and leaves a content Ron alone to enjoy his birthday.|$|E

5|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} win in 17 matches after beating Plymouth 2–0 at home, with Chambers and Cresswell scoring {{in the first}} half. McGrath, Rankine and Rodman were sent back to their parent clubs, having become surplus to requirements under Worthington. The team were denied a second successive win after Peter Murphy scored a stoppage-time equaliser for Accrington, with the match finishing a 1–1 home draw, after Adam Reed had given York the lead in first half stoppage time. Carson and Kerr were ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season through injury, with the former returning to parent club Ipswich after the expiration of his loan. York recorded a second victory in three matches after winning 2–0 away to Northampton, who had been on a run of ten consecutive home wins, with Chambers scoring in the first half and John Johnson scoring an own goal in the second half. This result saw York <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of the relegation zone by moving up to 20th place in the table, having occupied 23rd place following the previous four results. Cresswell was recalled from his loan by new Sheffield United caretaker manager Chris Morgan, after making an important contribution for York in their battle against relegation.|$|E

25|$|But {{two events}} {{enabled him to}} <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of {{subordinate}} functions. In 1697, he married the Baroness Juliane von Honstedt from an old Württembergian family, who also {{had the advantage of}} being the daughter of a major general in the service of Prussia. At the same time, the Electors of Brandenburg become the Kings of Prussia in 1701, and Frederick William I of Prussia, the future King of Prussia, befriended him. Jean de Forcade de Biaix pleased him and his career began to show it.|$|E

25|$|The most {{spectacular}} power to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of Central Asia developed when Genghis Khan united the tribes of Mongolia. Using superior military techniques, the Mongol Empire spread to comprise all of Central Asia and China {{as well as}} large parts of Russia, and the Middle East. After Genghis Khan died in 1227, most of Central Asia continued {{to be dominated by}} the successor Chagatai Khanate. This state proved to be short lived, as in 1369 Timur, a Turkic leader in the Mongol military tradition, conquered most of the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{towers in}} the qibla wall {{do not contain}} stairs linking the prayer hall with the roof. Instead there are two square towers housing stairs leading to the roof. One set of stairs {{is located at the}} south western corner of the prayer hall while the other set, {{situated}} near the main entrance on the northern side, is only accessible from the exterior of the mosque. Small vents in the roof are topped with removable inverted kiln-fired bowls, which when removed allow hot air to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of the building and so ventilate the interior.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of launch on 17 December 1912, Endurance was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the {{possible}} exception of Fram, the vessel used by Fridtjof Nansen and later by Roald Amundsen. However, there was one major difference between the ships. Fram was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her it would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. But since Endurance was designed to operate in relatively loose pack ice she was not constructed so as to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of pressure to any great extent.|$|E

25|$|Poverty {{levels are}} {{snapshot}} pictures {{in time that}} omits the transitional dynamics between levels. Mobility statistics supply additional information about the fraction who leave the poverty level. For example, one study finds that in a sixteen-year period (1975 to 1991 in the U.S.) only 5% {{of those in the}} lower fifth of the income level were still at that level, while 95% transitioned to a higher income category. Poverty levels can remain the same while those who <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of poverty are replaced by others. The transient poor and chronic poor differ in each society. In a nine-year period ending in 2005 for the U.S., 50% of the poorest quintile transitioned to a higher quintile.|$|E
25|$|The Hephthalites {{were the}} most {{powerful}} of the nomad groups in the 6th and 7th centuries, and controlled much of the region. In the 9th through 13th centuries the region was divided among several powerful states, including the Samanid dynasty, the Seljuq dynasty, and the Khwarezmid Empire. The most spectacular power to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of Central Asia developed when Genghis Khan united the tribes of Mongolia. The Mongol Empire spread to comprise all of Central Asia and China as well as large parts of Russia, and the Middle East. After Genghis Khan died in 1227, most of Central Asia continued to be dominated by the successor Chagatai Khanate. In 1369, Timur, a Turkic leader in the Mongol military tradition, conquered most of the region and founded the Timurid Empire. Timur's large empire collapsed soon after his death, however. The region then became divided into a series of smaller khanates that were created by the Uzbeks. These included the Khanate of Khiva, the Khanate of Bukhara, and the Khanate of Kokand, all of whose capitals are located in present-day Uzbekistan.|$|E
25|$|Multiple factors {{affect the}} {{likelihood}} of downward assimilation, including race, location, and absence of mobility ladders. Generally, immigrants enter the sectors {{of the labor force}} that experience low pay, commonly through jobs in the service sector and manufacturing. Such jobs seldom offer chances for upward mobility. The lack of good pay and resources available to immigrant parents affects {{the likelihood of}} their U.S.-born children being able to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of poverty. Children born to low skilled immigrants may experience assimilation into the impoverished groups of the United States. Instead of adapting to the mainstream values and expectations of U.S. society, they take on the adversarial stance of the poor, entering the vicious cycle of poverty. According to the theory of segmented assimilation, second-generation immigrants are less likely to experience downward assimilation when their race does not align with groups that experience prejudice and discrimination, such as African Americans. Also, immigrant families can enter well established ethnic groups in the United States to increase their pool of resources, lowering the possibility of downward assimilation for their children.|$|E

Davies announced RRP as the scheme architects on 16 October 1998. Richard Rogers said [...] "The idea was that steps <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> {{of the water and}} there is a whole public domain where people meet each other and look down on the Assembly Members." [...] Richard Rogers had previously designed the Lloyd's building in London and the Pompidou Centre in Paris with Renzo Piano. 11 days later, Davies resigned as Secretary of State for Wales.|$|E
500|$|Other leading {{literary}} {{figures who}} admired Wodehouse were A.E. Housman, Max Beerbohm and Hilaire Belloc; {{on the radio}} and in print Belloc called Wodehouse [...] "the best writer of our time: the best living writer of English... the head of my profession". Wodehouse regarded Belloc's plaudit as [...] "a gag, to get a <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of serious-minded authors whom he disliked". Wodehouse was never sure that his books had literary merit as well as popular appeal, and, Donaldson suggests, must have been overwhelmed when the University of Oxford conferred an honorary doctorate of letters on him in June 1939. His visit to England for the awarding ceremony was the last time he set foot in his native land.|$|E
500|$|The main {{argument}} {{represented in}} the collection is that, rather than economics and wealth, modern-style poverty is described by a [...] "wildly dysfunctional set of values". A number of chapters discuss the [...] "ferocious young egoist" [...] that is meant to represent male youths who are violent and obsessive toward their significant others. Dalrymple also writes about his views on the [...] "destruction of...family ties", arguing that without family ties {{it is nearly impossible}} to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of the underclass. These issues, among others, are described as resulting from the [...] "intellectual foundation... makes a permanent underclass possible". This is meant to be directed against intellectuals and liberals that form the many ideas absorbed into the mentality of the underclass.|$|E

500|$|Unlike most LGV {{stations}} in France, the through tracks for Ashford International station {{are off to}} one side rather than going through, partly because the station pre-dates the line. High Speed 1 approaches Ashford International from the north in a cut-and-cover [...] "box"; the southbound line rises out of this cutting and crosses over the main tracks to enter the station. The main tracks then <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of the cutting and over a flyover. On leaving Ashford, southbound Eurostars return to the high-speed line by travelling under this flyover and joining from the outside. [...] The international platforms at Ashford are supplied with both overhead 25kV AC and third-rail 750 V DC power, avoiding the need to switch power supplies.|$|E
500|$|Michael's date {{leaves the}} theater as Michael hands his popcorn to a stranger, {{catches up to}} her, and assures her that [...] "It's only a movie". Some debate follows {{as to whether or}} not she was scared by the movie. They then walk down a foggy road as Michael teases her by singing the verses of [...] "Thriller". They pass a nearby graveyard, in which zombies begin to <b>rise</b> <b>out</b> of their caskets as Vincent Price {{performs}} his soliloquy. The zombies corner Michael and his date threateningly, and suddenly, Michael becomes a zombie himself. The zombies then break into an elaborate song and dance number, followed by the main chorus of [...] "Thriller" [...] (during which Michael was reverted to human form), frightening his date to the point where she runs for cover.|$|E
