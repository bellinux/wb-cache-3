Since the 1990s, the neighborhood has seen several historic preservation and <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects.</b> It is home to fourteen city parks, several schools and other amenities.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 2008, several <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects</b> in the {{downtown}} area, some {{of which had been}} discussed for decades, were put into motion and resulted in nearly $110 million in total investment from public and private sources. The first of these was the Phoenix Project, a development privately financed by Kent resident Ron Burbick that renovated and expanded a section of commercial space along East Main Street. Included in the project was construction of a pedestrian alleyway lined with small shops, eventually known as Acorn Alley, which opened in 2009. A second phase of Acorn Alley opened the next year. Other aspects of the redevelopment, which include a 360-space parking deck and bus transfer station, a hotel and conference center, and three separate mixed-use buildings, began to take shape in 2010 following the demolition of several buildings in a four block area. New offices for Ametek and the Davey Tree Expert Company opened in late 2012 along with several new small businesses on the first floors of each building. The hotel, operated by Kent State University, opened in June 2013 and the new parking garage, operated by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) opened April 30, 2013, as the Kent Central Gateway. In addition to parking, the facility functions as PARTA's main bus transfer station and has storefronts on the ground level facing East Erie Street. Included in the redevelopment was the purchase and renovation of the old Kent hotel, which first opened in 1920. After being mostly vacant since 1979 and completely vacant since 2000, it re-opened on April 1, 2013, as the new home to the Kent location of Buffalo Wild Wings and also houses offices, a wine and jazz bar, and apartments. A five-story mixed-use building called The Landmark was completed in 2014 and construction started in November 2015 on an additional five-story mixed-use building featuring microapartments, scheduled to be completed in 2016. The developments attracted the attention of The Plain Dealer and The New York Times and earned the city and university the 2013 Larry Abernathy Award from the International Town–Gown Association in recognition of the positive town–gown cooperation and collaboration.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the {{regional}} BART system was {{conceived as a}} much more extensive system than was eventually built, with plans for express trains through San Francisco and local service within San Francisco.

This leaves a legacy of the inadequate 38-Geary bus serving these neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in {{approximately}} 1991, under the New Jersey Development and Redevelopment Law, the borough authorized {{the creation of}} the Red Bank RiverCenter to manage redevelopment in what was designated as a special improvement district. RiverCenter retains authority over the management and redevelopment of a defined central business district, which includes Broad Street from the post office to Marine Park and from Maple Avenue to one block east of Broad Street. A number of urban <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects</b> have taken place, including improved signage, distinctive and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and lighting, a coherent design plan for Main Street and other major thoroughfares, improved condition of parking lots with landscaping, and similar projects.|$|E

By early December 2007, City Council members were demanding greatly expanded oversight over the Deputy Mayor's office, and Albert was strongly resisting such efforts. By April 2008, the City Council was imposing audits on the Deputy Mayor's office and the <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects</b> it was overseeing.|$|E

In February 2010 3CDC reported the redevelopment of nearly 200 condominiums and more than 30 new storefronts, with 60% of those being sold despite a down housing market. According to 3CDC, 2010 will be their most ambitious year yet with $164 million in <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects,</b> most centered in Over-the-Rhine.

25|$|Walthamstow has a {{wide variety}} of housing stock, but the vast {{majority}} of residential property was built in the early 20th century. From Coppermill Lane in the west (next to the marshes), to Wood Street in the east, there are scores of terraced streets dating to the Edwardian era and the 1920s. The area along Markhouse Road and St James Street has many examples of Warner properties. These were developed as affordable housing for the working classes in the early part of the 20th century. Bombing raids in the Second World War and urban <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects</b> in the 1960s and 1970s have left areas with more modern housing, mostly in the shape of low-rise concrete blocks.|$|E
25|$|Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, {{regeneration}} {{has continued}} {{through to the}} start of the early 2010s. Some of the most significant <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects</b> include new buildings in the Commercial District, the King's Dock, Mann Island, the Lime Street Gateway, the Baltic Triangle, the RopeWalks, and the Edge Lane Gateway. All projects could be eclipsed by the Liverpool Waters scheme, which if built will cost in the region of £5.5billion and be one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters is a mixed-use development planned to contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite fierce opposition from such groups as UNESCO, which claimed that it would adversely affect Liverpool's World Heritage status.|$|E

25|$|Financial {{services}} have also become {{important to the}} city since the establishment of Dublin's International Financial Services Centre in 1987. More than 500 operations are approved to trade under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies. Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as Citibank and Commerzbank. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ), Internet Neutral Exchange (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) are also located in Dublin. The Celtic Tiger also led to a temporary boom in construction, with large <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects</b> in the Dublin Docklands and Spencer Dock. Completed projects include the Convention Centre, the 3Arena, and the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre.|$|E
25|$|It was {{far more}} {{successful}} in opposing cancellation of the Southwest Washington urban renewal project, which called for razing nearly all buildings in that quadrant {{of the city and}} constructing a new urban center. Although the Federal City Council's specific plans were not adopted, it was deeply involved in the planning process and its studies often relied on by Congress. The Federal City Council even raised money to develop its own concepts for redeveloping downtown and Southwest D.C., and lobbied Congress to have its plans adopted. In 1962, it won adoption of its proposal in the House of Representatives. When the bill died in the Senate {{at the end of the}} 87th Congress, it went to the Senate and won passage there in 1963. When the 1963 legislation moved to the House, Representatives John Dowdy and John L. McMillan attached a number of riders to the bill that required competitive bidding, forced federal agencies to give displaced businesses priority in receiving federal assistance, required the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to develop plans for relocating low-income residents, and placed limits on the number of <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects</b> that could be approved or constructed at any given time. But many liberals in Congress as well as HUD Secretary Robert C. Weaver opposed these riders. The riders were enacted into law. Unwilling to see redevelopment of Southwest D.C. collapse, the Federal City Council agreed to sponsor legislation that would authorize the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA, the federal bureau overseeing the reconstruction of Southwest D.C.) to conduct redevelopment on the same basis as federal agencies in other cities. Although this meant ignoring the Federal City Council's plans for redevelopment, it allowed the RLA to begin acting quickly and decisively on <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
25|$|ATSDR {{works closely}} with {{communities}} to evaluate the public health effects related to redevelopment of brownfields properties. These are sites that were formerly used for industrial purposes and may still be contaminated with hazardous substances. ATSDR has worked at more than 400 brownfield or land reuse sites to assess health effects of potential exposure to hazardous substances. The agency has created resources to provide guidance to communities when planning <b>redevelopment</b> <b>projects,</b> including tools to evaluate the potential threat of chemicals at development sites. In addition to evaluating {{the health effects of}} contamination at specific brownfield sites, ATSDR encourages communities to monitor community health.
