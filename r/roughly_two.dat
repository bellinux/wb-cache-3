5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} cinema from its initial years to the 1980s. In 1959, to promote the showing of The Big Hunt, a live {{elephant}} appeared outside the cinema.

They initially created the material {{as a way to}} secure a record deal, but later decided to release it independently. Chana later said that the decision allowed her to have more creative input on her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E
5|$|Between the 2:3 and 1:2 {{resonances}} with Neptune, {{at approximately}} 42–48AU, the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur {{over an extended}} timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered. This region {{is known as the}} classical Kuiper belt, and its members comprise <b>roughly</b> <b>two</b> thirds of KBOs observed to date. Because the first modern KBO discovered, , is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos ("Q-B-1-os"). The guidelines established by the IAU demand that classical KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{is home to}} the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen Business School.

The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen {{is one of the most}} bicycle-friendly cities in the world. The Copenhagen Metro launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen while the Copenhagen S-train network serves and connects central Copenhagen to its outlying boroughs.

The Britannia received a fair amount of attention in both the popular press and the British House of Commons, especially when it was revealed that BOAC had contemplated fitting Rolls-Royce Tynes to their fleet of Douglas DC-7s as an interim measure until the Britannia was cleared for service.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roughly</b> <b>two</b> {{weeks after}} Kanoa dissipated, the season's second {{hurricane}} was identified over the open {{waters of the}} eastern Pacific on August6. This storm traveled {{in a similar fashion}} to Kanoa in response to a high pressure system over the northern Pacific. By August9, the system turned northwest and weakened. Cold, dry air began to enter the storm as it accelerated over cooler waters. Several reconnaissance missions were flown into the storm due to rapid changes in the storm's wind field and structure. Late on August10, the system intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and its forward motion slowed as it turned more westward.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains <b>roughly</b> <b>two</b> meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E

5|$|The first F-22, an {{engineering}} and manufacturing development (EMD) aircraft named Raptor 4001, was unveiled at Marietta, Georgia, on 9 April 1997, and first flew on 7 September 1997. In 2006, the Raptor's development team, composed of over 1,000 contractors and the USAF, won the Collier Trophy, American aviation's most prestigious award.

5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the Famine of 1740-41, which killed <b>roughly</b> <b>two</b> fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied {{over the next}} century, but another devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century the population was reduced by over half, {{at a time when}} the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.|$|E
