50|$|Couplers are the {{fittings}} which {{hold the}} tubes together. The most common are called scaffold couplers, {{and there are}} three basic types: right-angle couplers, putlog couplers and swivel couplers. To join tubes end-to-end joint pins (also called spigots) or sleeve couplers are used. Only <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>couplers</b> and swivel couplers {{can be used to}} fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection'. Single couplers are not load-bearing couplers and have no design capacity.|$|R

50|$|<b>Right</b> <b>angles</b> are {{fundamental}} in Euclid's Elements. They are defined in Book 1, definition 10, which also defines perpendicular lines. Euclid uses <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> in definitions 11 and 12 to define acute angles (those {{smaller than a}} <b>right</b> <b>angle)</b> and obtuse angles (those greater than a <b>right</b> <b>angle).</b> Two angles are called complementary if their sum is a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Closely {{related and}} {{important}} geometrical concepts are perpendicular lines, meaning lines that form <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> at {{their point of}} intersection, and orthogonality, which is the property of forming <b>right</b> <b>angles,</b> usually applied to vectors.

50|$|In diagrams, {{the fact}} that an <b>angle</b> is a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> is usually {{expressed}} by adding a small <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> that forms a square with the angle in the diagram, as seen in the diagram of a right triangle (in British English, a right-angled triangle) to the right.

50|$|Rectangular {{drainage}} develops on {{rocks that}} are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of joining at approximately <b>right</b> <b>angles.</b> The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints.

50|$|Proof: Since angle BDA is a <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> angle DBA equals π/2 minus angle DAB. However, angle DAH also equals π/2 minus angle DAB (since angle HAB is a <b>right</b> <b>angle).</b> Therefore triangles DBA and DAH are similar. Therefore angle DIA equals angle DOH, where I is the {{midpoint}} of BA and O is {{the midpoint}} of AH. But AOH is a straight line, so angle DOH and DOA are supplementary angles. Therefore the sum of angles DIA and DOA is π. Angle IAO is a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 2π, so in quadrilateral IDOA, angle IDO must be a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> But ADHE is a rectangle, so the midpoint O of AH (the rectangle's diagonal) is also {{the midpoint of}} DE (the rectangle's other diagonal). As I (defined as the midpoint of BA) {{is the center of}} semicircle BA, and angle IDE is a <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> then DE is tangent to semicircle BA at D. By analogous reasoning DE is tangent to semicircle AC at E. Q.E.D.|$|R
