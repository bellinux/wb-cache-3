40|$|Biological <b>rafts</b> were {{identified}} and isolated at 37 °C and neutral pH. The strategy for isolating <b>rafts</b> utilized membrane tension to generate large domains. For lipid compositions that led only to microscropically unresolvable <b>rafts</b> in lipid bilayers, membrane tension led to the appearance of large, observable <b>rafts.</b> The large <b>rafts</b> converted back to small ones when tension was relieved. Thus, tension reversibly controls <b>raft</b> enlargement. For cells, application of membrane tension resulted in several types of large domains; one class of the domains was identified as <b>rafts.</b> Tension was generated in several ways, and all yielded <b>raft</b> fractions that had essentially the same composition, validating the principle of tension {{as a means to}} merge small <b>rafts</b> into large <b>rafts.</b> It was demonstrated that sphingomyelin-rich vesicles do not rise during centrifugation in sucrose gradients because they resist lysis, necessitating that, contrary to current experimental practice, membrane material be placed toward the top of a gradient for <b>raft</b> fractionation. Isolated <b>raft</b> fractions were enriched in a GPI-linked protein, alkaline phosphatase, and were poor in Na+-K+ ATPase. Sphingomyelin and gangliosides were concentrated in <b>rafts,</b> the expected lipid <b>raft</b> composition.

40|$|AbstractActin-aldolase <b>rafts</b> provide {{insights}} into the use of <b>rafts</b> as models for three-dimensional actin bundles. Although aldolase has three twofold axes, filaments in actin-aldolase <b>rafts</b> were not strictly related by a twofold axis. Interfilament angles were on average + 15 ° off the expected 180 °, and most <b>rafts</b> appeared handed; that is, rows of cross-bridges were tilted in a clockwise direction off the perpendicular. We can account for both the deviation of the angle from 180 ° and the handedness of the <b>rafts</b> by a steric constraint due to the lipid layer. We further found that the axial spacings of cross-bridges varied significantly from <b>raft</b> to <b>raft.</b> We suggest that this difference arises from variations in the twist of the filaments that nucleate <b>raft</b> formation; that is, filaments added to a <b>raft</b> adopt the symmetry {{of those in the}} <b>raft.</b> We conclude that the organization of filaments in <b>rafts</b> can be modulated by outside factors such as the lipid layer and that the variable twist of filaments in the nucleating core of the <b>raft</b> are imposed on all the filaments in the <b>raft.</b> These results provide a measure of the potential for polymorphism in actin assemblies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, two {{centrifugal}} model tests (case 1 : <b>raft</b> foundation, case 2 : 2 x 2 piled <b>raft</b> foundation) {{were conducted}} in order to evaluate the effect of ground subsidence on load sharing among piles and <b>raft</b> and settlement of <b>raft</b> and piled <b>raft</b> foundations. For each case, two conditions consisting of undrained (without groundwater pumping) and drained (with groundwater pumping) conditions were considered. Vertical loads were applied to the models after the foundations were completely consolidated by selfweight at 50 g. The results show that load sharing by the piles in piled <b>raft</b> foundation (piled load share) for drained condition decreases faster than that for undrained condition. Settlement of both <b>raft</b> and piled <b>raft</b> foundations for drained condition increases more quickly than that for undrained condition. In addition, the settlement of <b>raft</b> foundation increases more largely than the settlement of piled <b>raft</b> foundation for drained condition.

40|$|Seismic {{observations}} of the mantle, which include long-wavelength structure, a k^(− 1) dependence of heterogeneity on harmonic k, and a heterogeneous upper boundary layer, and supercontinent kinematics {{may be explained by}} the dynamic interaction between a continent like <b>raft</b> and thermal convection. We have formulated finite element models of convection with <b>rafts</b> simulating continental plates in a cylindrical geometry. The azimuthal interconnectivity of this geometry is vital to resolve the two-way dynamics between <b>rafts</b> and convection. Computations show that (1) <b>raft</b> motion is periodic, (2) long-wavelength thermal structure is significant within both thermal boundary layers and the fluid interior, and (3) the large-scale thermal structure with a wavelength longer than the width of <b>raft</b> is responsible for <b>raft</b> motion. These three results, which are observed for a range of Rayleigh numbers, internal heating rates, and <b>raft</b> sizes, are a direct consequence of the dynamic interaction between the <b>raft</b> and convection. The physical processes for a model with a Rayleigh number of 10 ^ 5 are representative: when the <b>raft</b> is stationary, due to the less efficient heat transfer through the <b>raft</b> and instabilities from the bottom boundary layer, heat accumulates beneath the <b>raft</b> and results in long-wavelength thermal anomalies. The long-wavelength thermal anomalies enhance <b>raft</b> motion. Accompanying the enhanced <b>raft</b> movement, the long-wavelength thermal anomalies diminish and the <b>raft</b> velocity decreases or the <b>raft</b> comes to rest. Since convection models without <b>rafts</b> generate less long-wavelength heterogeneity compared to the models with <b>rafts,</b> or continental plates, we suspect that continental plates may {{play a crucial role in}} mantle dynamics. Interestingly, <b>raft</b> motion with a period of about 10 transit times is usually significant; 10 transit times is about 600 m. y. if scaled to the Earth. This is close to the observed 300 – 500 m. y. period of supercontinent aggregation and dispersal...|$|R

5|$|Just {{two years}} after opening, a flood in March 1904 did serious damage to the structure. However, the owners hired the Horseheads Bridge Company, run by the Perkins brothers. They charged $7,000 (1904 USD) to {{complete}} repairs of the bridge. With the reopening of the bridge, and along with the newly constructed Erie Railroad station, a new revitalization came to Skinners Falls and Milanville, including an acid company, creamery, and a dairy company, which helped raise income for the bridge using the $0.22 toll. One company that could not make it is the Skinners' timber <b>rafting,</b> which had been in business for over 140 years. In 1914, J.

40|$|The use of piled <b>raft</b> {{foundations}} {{has become}} more popular in recent years, as the combined action of the <b>raft</b> and the piles can increase the bearing capacity, reduce settlement, and the piles can be arranged so as to reduce differential deflection in the <b>raft.</b> Piled <b>raft</b> foundation is a new concept in which the total load coming from the superstructure is partly shared by the <b>raft</b> through contact with soil and the remaining load is shared by piles through skin friction. A piled <b>raft</b> foundation is economical compared to the pile foundation. Because piles {{do not have to}} penetrate the full depth of clay layer but it can be terminated at higher elevations.

40|$|Lipid <b>rafts</b> are {{membrane}} microdomains {{that are}} enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids.
