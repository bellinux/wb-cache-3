Vegetation sampling {{was done by}} quadrat method. Altogether 40 quadrats were sampled to determine the Importance Value Index (IVI) of tree species, and distribution pattern of seedlings and saplings. Regeneration was assessed by density- diameter curve. Four tree species were recorded from the forest. Betula utilis was the dominant tree species with the highest Importance Value Index (173. 22) in mixed Betula forest and 262. 96 in pure Betula forest and <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> was the co – dominant species (65. 95) in mixed Betula forest while <b>Rhododendron</b> <b>campanulatum</b> was the co-dominant species (37. 03) in pure Betula forest. Density of Betula utilis increased with increase in elevation where as density of other tree species decreased with increase in elevation. Mixed Betula forest at lower elevation was young. The density diameter curve of the tree population of Betula utilis, both on mixed and pure forests, deviated slightly from the typical reverse J shaped {{structure and}} hence did not show the sustainable regeneration.

40|$|A {{bioclimatic}} {{model was}} used to simulate distributions of the dominant tree species on the Tibetan Plateau. The model is based on physiological constraints to alpine plant growth. The bioclimatic variables used in this model are: minimum temperature in the coldest month, maximum temperature in the warmest month, accumulated growing-season warmth, and minimum value of soil moisture availability in the growing season. A comparison was made between simulated current distributions of tree species and their actual natural distributions on the Tibetan Plateau. It was shown that there is good agreement between simulated current and actual natural distributions. The simulated current distribution areas of tree species such as <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis,</b> Picea likiangensis var. linzhiensis, Pinus densata, Larix griffithiana were a little larger than their actual distributions.

40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{deals with}} the {{rhizosphere}} effect exerted on the microbial communities by ten representative and important tree species of the Indian Himalayan region. The study covered a wide altitudinal range (1200 to 3610 m above mean sea level) representing subtropical to subalpine climatic conditions. The rhizosphere to soil (R:S) ratio was found to range from 0. 2 to 3. 5, 0. 3 to 2. 9, and 0. 3 to 3. 4, for bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi, respectively. Barring a few exceptions, generally the tree species of subtropical and temperate regions exerted a slight stimulatory effect on the rhizosphere microorganisms. Coniferous species of the subtropical and temperate locations viz., Cedrus, Pinus and Taxus supported relatively higher microbial population in the rhizosphere in comparison to other species. Abies pindrow (a conifer), Betula utilis, and <b>Rhododendron</b> <b>campanulatum,</b> species of the subalpine region were found to exert a distinct negative rhizosphere effect.

40|$|In the Eastern Central Himalaya (Langtang Valley) and its {{southern}} declivity (Helambu), palynological and phytosociological studies {{were carried out}} with the aim of reconstructing the natural vegetation pattern and elucidating the development of replacement communities between the upper cloud forest belt (2000 - 4000 m a. s. l.), and the alpine belt (ca. 4000 - 5100 m a. s. l.). According to palynological studies and historical information, the remote area under study was first influenced by man during the 15 th century, presumably by hunters who set fire to the forests which were dominated by Quercus semecarpifolia, Tsuga dumosa, <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> and Betula utilis. Pteridium aquilinum increased and Juniperus decreased {{as a result of the}} fires being set. The only permanent settlement of the upper Langtang Valley (Langtang village) is situated at 3450 m a. s. 1. at the transition between the middle and upper cloud forest belt and was founded during the 17 th century. A Rhododendron lepidotum dwarf shrub appeared as the first replacement community for the forest. From the continuous influence of fire, forest clearance and grazing pressure, the Rhododendron shrub was partly replaced by pastures and nitrophlous communities in places near the settlement. Permanent settlements never existed at and above the timberline. Here, the anthropo-zoogenous influence is indicated by plants favored by fire or grazing. Under natural conditions, the altitudes between 3000 and 3500 m a. s. l. seem to have been occupied by more Quercus semecarpifolia than was expected based on the present day situation. In addition to this, it was possible to trace a late increase of <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> (19 th century). The forests at the timberline were dominated by Betula ufilis before and after the beginning of human impact...|$|R

30|$|Recruitment {{was mainly}} {{affected}} by the temperatures in the spring, summer and early autumn seasons, and it {{was found to have}} significantly positive correlations with mean temperatures in April, July and September (Figure  7). Temperatures in spring facilitating fir seedling establishment were also found in the treeline ecotones of the Shennongjia Mountains (Dang et al., 2009). High temperatures in spring are very important for germination (Camarero and Gutiérrez, 1999) and might simulate tree recruitment from soil seed banks (Dang et al., 2009). The significant positive correlations between summer temperatures and recruitment were also reported from conifer seedlings in alpine treeline ecotone of the Snowy Range in Wyoming USA (Germino and Smith, 1999) and from <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> forest in the alpine timberline of the Mt. Everest in southern QTP, China (Lv and Zhang, 2011). Higher summer temperatures will strengthen the photosynthesis rate, which could encourage both growth and nonstructural carbon storage for fir seedlings to survive harsh winter climate (Camarero and Gutiérrez, 1999).|$|R
40|$|In {{present study}} 120 tree cores from 60 trees of <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> from two {{different}} sites Chandanbari and Cholangpati area of Langtang National Park were collected.

40|$|Climate {{warming is}} {{expected}} to advance treelines to higher elevations. However, empirical studies in diverse mountain ranges give evidence of both advancing alpine treelines as well as rather insignificant responses. In this context, we aim at investigating the sensitivity and responsiveness of the near-natural treeline ecotone in Rolwaling Himal, Nepal, to climate warming. We analysed population densities of tree species along the treeline ecotone from closed forest stands via the krummholz belt to alpine dwarf shrub heaths (3700 - 4200 m) at 50 plots in 2013 and 2014. We quantified species - environment relationships, i. e. the change of environmental conditions (e. g., nutrient and thermal deficits, plant interactions) across the ecotone by means of redundancy analyses, variation partitioning and distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps. In particular, we focus on explaining the high competitiveness of <b>Rhododendron</b> <b>campanulatum</b> forming a dense krummholz belt and on the implications for the responsiveness of Himalayan krummholz treelines to climate change. Results indicate that treeline trees in the ecotone show species-specific responses {{to the influence of}} environmental parameters, and that juvenile and adult tree responses are modulated by environmental constraints in differing intensity. Moreover, the species - environment relationships suggest that the investigated krummholz belt will largely prevent the upward migration of other tree species and thus constrain the future response of Himalayan krummholz treelines to climate warming...|$|R
30|$|The {{habitats}} {{vary from}} dense subtropical deciduous sal forest (Shorea robusta) {{in the south}} to alpine pastures in the north. The study area spans over five ecoregions: Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forest, endangered western Himalayan broadleaf forest (Olson et al. 2001), Himalayan subtropical pine forest, western Himalayan subalpine coniferous forest and western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadow (Wikramanayake 2002). The areas below 1, 000  m, with a tropical climate, are dominated by sal (Shorea robusta) forest. Areas at altitudes of 1, 000 to 2, 000  m, with a subtropical climate, are dominated by chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) with an admixture of Quercus incana, Quercus lamellosa, Rhododendron arboreum, Alnus nepalensis etc. Areas at altitudes of 2, 000 to 3, 000  m, with a temperate climate, are dominated by oak, rhododendron and laurel stands along with conifers such as blue pine, fir and hemlock. In the subalpine zone (3, 000 to 4, 000  m), several conifers (Pinus wallichiana, <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis,</b> <b>Abies</b> pindrow, Tsuga dumosa) and broad-leaved species (Betula utilis, rhododendrons and Quercus semecarpifolia) form diverse types of vegetation (Paudel et al. 2012). In the alpine zone, above 4, 000  m, there are some shrubs, but grassland is more common. The region also supports a high faunal (especially mammal) diversity, including 7 % of the mammals endemic to this region (Paudel et al. 2012; Primack et al. 2013). Summer monsoon (June-September) accounts for about 80 % of the precipitation and winter rain is infrequent (Das 1968).|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{understanding}} {{of the differences in}} vegetation and soil characteristics between slope aspects in high altitude semiarid environments is fundamentally important for efficient management of these semi-natural systems; however, few studies have quantified these differences. Here, we analyzed forest stand characteristics, carbon stocks and soil properties of north- and south-facing slopes in a trans-Himalayan semiarid valley. Pinus wallichiana was the dominant and Juniperus indica the co-dominant species in both aspects, whereas Betula utilis and <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> were only recorded in north-facing forests. Pinus regenerated in both aspects, whereas Juniperus did not. Carbon stocks did not differ between aspects; 33  t/ha in north-facing and 31  t/ha in south-facing forests. Similarly, soil properties did not vary between slope aspects, expect for potassium (highest in south-facing slopes). These results suggest that topographic factors affect mountain forests through their direct influence on radiation and moisture, but that human disturbance also plays a significant role affecting vegetation and soil characteristics in a semiarid environment. These natural and anthropogenic factors may play in harmony or in discord with each other. Here, the aridity of the region, parent material and land use history led to less pronounced differences between slope aspects, than commonly found in moister habitats...|$|R

In vitro antioxidant activity evaluated by means of three antioxidant methods, namely 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Briggs-Rauscher oscillating reaction (BR) and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and total phenol contents with the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent; the ferrous iron chelating capacity was also assessed. The methanol extract of A. spectabilis showed significant antioxidant activity and polyphenol contents (IC 50 4. 13 µg/mL, 0. 20 μg/mL eq. resorcinol, 4. 22 mM eq.

Phytochemical studies were also carried out with 1 D- and 2 D NMR experiments and DI-ESI-MS, HPLC-DAD and LC-MSn measurements. Oligomeric C-type proanthocyanidins, mainly trimeric gallocatechin derivatives, were the most abundant compounds (16 % of extract expressed as procyanindin B 1). Gallocatechin oligomers (up to six units) and prodelphynidin-gallocatechin polymers were also identified in the extract.

40|$|Four communities, {{formed as}} a result of locally varying site conditions, were {{identified}} and studied along the timberline ecotone in part of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS). Communities on the vicinity of pilgrimage site and along gentler slopes were highly disturbed having sharp timberlines, while those located far and in the steep slopes were less affected, forming a little broader transition. The tree density ranged from 340 to 780 trees/ha, while the basal cover of communities varied greatly and ranged from 6. 4 to 55. 1 m 2 /ha. Birch dominated community had lowest basal area among all the communities, while mixed community had the highest. In all the respective communities, from subalpine zone, density and basal area was higher than that of timberline zone. The Importance Value Index (IVI), which used to determine the overall importance of each species in the community structure, of dominant species at timberline was more than 200 in all the communities, except in the mixed community. Influence of the anthropogenic disturbances was apparent on the regeneration performance of all the studied tree species. <b>Rhododendron</b> <b>campanulatum</b> was the dominant shrub species of the area and formed krummholz, while distribution of other species varies greatly with forest type. The shrub density decreased from high to low disturbance, while the herbaceous species density increased with prevalence of a few species favoring the high disturbance (grazing).

40|$|Only a {{few studies}} have {{addressed}} the soil and foliar carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry in alpine treeline ecotones. Moreover, information on the soil nutrient availability (primarily N, P) in such ecosystems is rare. To fill these gaps, we performed a multiple data sampling in a near-natural alpine treeline ecotone in Rolwaling Himal, Nepal. Our results show strongly varying soil C:N:P ratios and nutrient availability with soil depth. Caused by high monsoon precipitation and coarse-grained soils with low water-holding capacities, a vertical transport of nutrients and potentially mineralizable soil organic matter (SOM) in soils occurs, which is a general problem in the study area impeding growing conditions for trees. Soil N and P availability, and soil C:P and N:P ratios decrease significantly as elevation increases, especially at the transition from krummholz (dominated by <b>Rhododendron</b> <b>campanulatum)</b> to the alpine tundra (dwarf scrub heath). Soil C:N ratios increase significantly with elevation, most notably from the subalpine forest to krummholz and the alpine tundra. These altitudinal trends indicate increasing nutrient (N, P) shortage especially in the alpine tundra. Low N and P availability in alpine tundra soils are likely caused by a lower litter input from dwarf shrub vegetation, and a decline in litter mineralization in this altitudinal zone resulting in small accumulation of SOM. Nutrient availability in the entire study area is generally limited by low soil pH (from 2. 5 to 4). In total six investigated tree species show diverse relationships between foliar and soil stoichiometric ratios, and soil nutrient availability. Significantly increasing foliar C:N and C:P ratios with elevation due to significantly decreasing foliar N and P concentrations suggest a limitation in N and P. Foliar N:P ratios indicate N rather than P limitation. Contrary to previous studies from different alpine treeline ecotones, we do not consider the Rolwaling treeline ecotone as an area of nutrient accumulation. We conclude that altitudinal variations in stand structures themselves govern nutrient cycling through the input of C, N, and P into soils by differences in leaf fall...|$|R
40|$|Global {{warming is}} {{triggering}} some species to shift towards the poles or higher elevations, but spatial translocation is {{also influenced by}} land-use regime or intensity.

Our four transects were located in treeline ecotones of two protected areas in Nepal, namely Manaslu Conservation Area (3 transects) and Gaurishankar Conservation Area (1 transect). Transects (20 m wide) ran from the USL of A. spectabilis down towards the treeline and beyond to the forest line. Length of each transect varied depending on local conditions. Co-ordinates, elevation, height and age of each A. spectabilis individual along the transects were recorded. We noted an upward shift of both the USL and the tree limit.

A total of 54 tree species (40 genera) in Q. leucotrichophora, 43 tree species (30 genera) in Q. floribunda and 23 tree species (16 genera) in Q. semecarpifolia dominated forests were recorded. Lauraceae was the dominant family in Q. leucotrichophora and Q. floribunda forests (6 and 8 species respectively), while Ericaceae (3 species) was the dominant family in Q. semecarpifolia dominated forests. Pinaceae and Taxaceae were only two gymnospermic family represented by Pinus roxburghii at low, Abies pinrow at mid, <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> and Taxus wallichiana at higher elevational oak forests. There was no significant variation (p= 0. 8) between overall tree density in different oak forests which ranges from 337 � 51 individual/ha in Q. semecarpifolia to 433 � 92 individual/ha in Q. leucotrichophora forests. The seedling density has significant variation (p= 0. 01) in different oak forests where highest density was recorded in Q. leucotrichophora forests (1981 individual/ha) and lowest in Q. semecarpifolia forests (348 individual/ha). The Total Basal Area (TBA) reported from Q. leucotrichophora (88. 06 m 2 /ha) and Q. floribunda (110. 5 m 2 /ha) forests was {{higher than those of}} earlier reported from the region, while basal area of Q. semecarpifolia (90. 16 m 2 /ha) was comparable with the forests of western Himalaya...|$|R
40|$|In Nepal, the {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens) has been sparsely studied, {{although}} its range covers a wide area. The {{present study was}} carried out in the previously untapped Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) situated in central Nepal with an aim to explore current distributional status and identify key habitat use. Extensive field surveys conducted in 10 red panda range districts were used to estimate species distribution by presence-absence occupancy modeling and to predict distribution by presence-only modeling. The presence of red pandas was recorded in five districts: Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Myagdi, Baglung and Dhading. The predictive distribution model indicated that 1, 904. 44 km 2 of potential red panda habitat is available in CHAL with the protected area covering nearly 41 % of the total habitat. The habitat suitability analysis based on the probability of occurrence showed only 16. 58 % (A = 315. 81 km 2) of the total potential habitat is highly suitable. Red Panda occupancy was estimated to be around 0. 0667, indicating nearly 7 % (218 km 2) of the total habitat is occupied with an average detection probability of 0. 4482 ± 0. 377. Based on the habitat use analysis, altogether eight variables including elevation, slope, aspect, proximity to water sources, bamboo abundance, height, cover, and seasonal precipitation were observed to have significant roles in the distribution of red pandas. In addition, 25 tree species were documented from red panda sign plots out of 165 species recorded in the survey area. Most common was Betula utilis followed by Rhododendron spp. and <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis.</b> The extirpation of red pandas in previously reported areas indicates a need for immediate action for the long-term conservation of this species in CHAL...|$|R
40|$|Population {{structure}} {{and distribution of}} vegetation are often affected by elevation induced climate variation in the Himalaya. This research aims at assessing the population {{structure and}} distribution of <b>Abies</b> <b>spectabilis</b> in three different elevation sites within the forests areas in Manang District of central Nepal. Vegetation sampling was conducted during Sept-Oct 2012 and the population information of all the woody vegetation from a total of 59 concentric circular sampling plots of 10 m radii along the transect line were collected. The middle elevation site was characterized by the highest density of seedlings (15, 044 /ha), saplings (1, 629 /ha), poles (272 /ha) and trees (179 / ha) of all woody vegetation. In this elevation, the highest proportion was contributed by A. spectabilis (54 %) at combined-level {{in spite of the}} lack of large-sized stems (dbh> 70 cm). The proportion of A. spectabilis stem was nearly one-fourth of all the woody vegetation while its lowest proportion (15. 5 %) was found at the lower elevation at combined-level. On the contrary, its basal area proportion was nearly the half of all the woody vegetation at the lower elevation site, nearly one-third at the middle elevation site and less than 10 % at the upper elevation site. There was a significant variation in mean density and basal areas of all stem categories among the sampled sites except the seedling density of all the woody vegetation between the lower and the middle elevations. The stem distribution of all the woody vegetation including A. spectabilis demonstrated the characteristics of normal (sustainable) forest in Manang District. The presence of only small-sized trees with good recent regeneration of A. spectabilis in the upper treeline ecotone revealed stand densification as well as its potential for upward migration in response to environmental change including climate change in future...|$|R
