40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} focused on trading stocks and {{improvement}} of long and short positions in case of negative stock's price development. For this purpose, we use Vertical Ratio Call Spread and Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Spread</b> option strategies. We also show in theory and in practice as well the ways of creating these option strategies and their usage for spreading the profit interval for long and short positions open, and without any additional costs...|$|E
50|$|If {{the bull}} <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is done so {{that both the}} sold and bought put expire on the same day, it is a {{vertical}} credit <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many options {{strategies}} are built around spreads and combinations of spreads. For example, a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> {{is basically a}} bull spread that is also a credit spread while the iron butterfly {{can be broken down}} into a combination of a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> and a bear call spread.|$|R
50|$|A bearish {{debit spread}} can be {{constructed}} using puts. See bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bear call <b>spread</b> {{and bear}} <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are bearish {{vertical}} spreads constructed using calls and puts respectively.|$|R
50|$|Bull call <b>spread</b> and bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are bullish {{vertical}} spreads constructed using {{calls and}} puts respectively.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{gain and}} loss {{potential}} {{are the same}} for call and <b>put</b> <b>spreads.</b> Note that net credit = difference in premiums.|$|R
5000|$|A bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> {{is simply}} the lower side of a short iron condor and has {{virtually}} identical initial and maintenance margin requirements.|$|R
50|$|Any {{spread that}} is {{constructed}} using calls can {{be referred to}} as a call <b>spread,</b> while a <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is constructed using put options.|$|R
5000|$|Iron condor - the {{simultaneous}} buying of a <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> and a call spread {{with the same}} expiration and four different strikes. An iron condor {{can be thought of}} as selling a strangle instead of buying and also limiting your risk on both the call side and put side by building a bull <b>put</b> vertical <b>spread</b> and a bear call vertical spread; ...|$|R
5000|$|A bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is {{a limited}} profit, limited risk options trading {{strategy}} {{that can be used}} when the options trader is moderately bearish on the underlying security. It is entered by: ...|$|R
5000|$|A long box-spread can {{be viewed}} as a long bull call spread at one pair of strike prices, [...] and , plus a long bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> at the same pair of strike prices.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the risks}} involved, put writing without holding {{covering}} cash is rarely used alone. Investors often sell puts {{in combination with}} other options contracts such as for <b>put</b> <b>spreads</b> to limit downside risk.|$|R
50|$|To {{find the}} credit spread {{breakeven}} points for call spreads, the net premium {{is added to}} the lower strike price. For <b>put</b> <b>spreads,</b> the net premium is subtracted from the higher strike price to breakeven.|$|R
50|$|Because of put-call parity, a {{bear spread}} can be {{constructed}} using either put options or call options. If constructed using calls, it is a bear call spread. If constructed using puts, it is a bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{box spread}} {{consists}} of a bull call spread and a bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b> The calls and puts have the same expiration date. The resulting portfolio is delta neutral. For example, a 40-50 January 2010 box consists of: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> with a bear call spread. The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull call spread with a bear call spread or a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> with a bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b> Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R

50|$|Moderately bearish' options traders usually set {{a target}} {{price for the}} {{expected}} decline and utilize bear spreads to reduce cost. While maximum profit is capped for these strategies, they usually cost less to employ. The bear call spread and the bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are common examples of moderately bearish strategies.|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} {{loss of a}} long iron condor {{is the difference between}} the strikes on either the call <b>spread</b> or the <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> (whichever is greater if it is not balanced) multiplied by the contract size (typically 100 or 1000 shares of the underlying instrument), less the net credit received.|$|R
50|$|Traders often scan price {{charts and}} use {{technical}} analysis to find stocks that are oversold (have fallen sharply in price and perhaps {{due for a}} rebound) as candidates for bullish <b>put</b> <b>spreads.</b> Additionally, writing (selling) credit spreads with higher current IV (implied volatility) 50% and higher, will increase {{the prospects for a}} profitable trade.|$|R
50|$|ABC Bull <b>Put</b> Credit <b>Spread</b> Return = (1 - 0.5)/100-90-(1-0.5) = 5.26%.|$|R
50|$|Stock {{can make}} steep {{downward}} moves. Moderately bearish options traders usually set a target {{price for the}} expected decline and utilize bear spreads to reduce cost. This strategy can have unlimited amount of profit and limited risk when done correctly. The bear call spread and the bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are common examples of moderately bearish strategies.|$|R
50|$|A bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is {{constructed}} by selling higher striking in-the-money put options and buying {{the same number}} of lower striking out-of-the-money put options on the same underlying security with the same expiration date. The options trader employing this strategy hopes that the price of the underlying security goes up far enough such that the written put options expire worthless.|$|R
40|$|A {{conspicuous}} {{amount of}} aggregate tail risk {{is missing from}} the price of financial sector crash insurance during the 2007 - 2009 crisis. The difference in costs of out-of-the-money put options for individual banks, and puts on the financial sector index, increases fourfold from its pre-crisis level. At the same time, correlations among bank stocks surge, suggesting the high <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> cannot {{be attributed to a}} relative increase in idiosyncratic risk. We show that this phenomenon is unique to the financial sector, that it cannot be explained by observed risk dynamics (volatilities and correlations), and that illiquidity and no-arbitrage violations are unlikely culprits. Instead, we provide evidence that a collective government guarantee for the financial sector lowers index put prices far more than those of individual banks, explaining the divergence in the basket-index spread. By embedding a bailout in the standard one-factor option pricing model, we can closely replicate observed <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> dynamics. During the crisis, the spread responds acutely to government intervention announcements. ...|$|R

The question asked is whether the Swedish system will be politically as weill as financially stable in the future. The design is described and analysed with resspect to sustainability...|$|R
50|$|Moderately bullish options traders usually set {{a target}} {{price for the}} bull run and utilize bull spreads to reduce cost. (It does not reduce risk because the options can still expire worthless.) While maximum profit is capped for these strategies, they usually cost less to employ for a given nominal amount of exposure. The bull call spread and the bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are common {{examples}} of moderately bullish strategies.|$|R

5000|$|The iron condor is {{an option}} trading {{strategy}} utilizing two vertical <b>spreads</b> - a <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> and a call spread with the same expiration and four different strikes. A long iron condor is essentially selling {{both sides of the}} underlying instrument by simultaneously shorting the same number of calls and puts, then covering each position with the purchase of further out of the money call(s) and put(s) respectively. The converse produces a short iron condor.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{gain and}} loss {{potential}} {{are the same}} for call and <b>put</b> debit <b>spreads.</b> Note that net debit = difference in premiums.|$|R
5000|$|Bull <b>Put</b> Credit <b>Spread</b> Potential Return = (sold put price - {{purchased}} put price)/(sold put {{strike price}} - purchased put strike price - initial credit) ...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{practical}} advantages of an iron condor over a single vertical <b>spread</b> (a <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> or call spread), is that the initial and maintenance margin requirements for the iron condor are often {{the same as the}} margin requirements for a single vertical spread, yet the iron condor offers the profit potential of two net credit premiums instead of only one. This can significantly improve the potential rate of return on capital risked when the trader doesn't expect the underlying instrument's spot price to change significantly.|$|R
40|$|Investors {{in option}} markets price in a {{substantial}} collective government bailout guarantee {{in the financial}} sector, which puts a floor on the equity value of the financial sector as a whole, {{but not on the}} value of the individual firms. The guarantee makes put options on the financial sector index cheap relative to put options on its member banks. The basket-index <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> rises fourfold from 0. 8 cents per dollar insured before the financial crisis to 3. 8 cents during the crisis for deep out-of-the-money options. The spread peaks at 12 cents per dollar, or 70 % {{of the value of the}} index put. The rise in the <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> cannot be attributed to an increase in idiosyncratic risk because the correlation of stock returns increased during the crisis. Sector-wide tail risk, partially absorbed by the government’s collective guarantee for the financial sector, lowers the index put prices but not the individual put prices, and hence can explain the basket-index spread. A structural model quantitatively matches these facts and indicates that as much as half of the value of the financial sector during the crisis. The model solves the problem of how to measure systemic risk in a world where the government distorts market prices. 2 Electronic copy available at...|$|R
50|$|The Hog/corn ratio (or corn/hog ratio) is {{the number}} of bushels of corn equal in value to 100 pounds of live hogs (feed <b>ratio).</b> <b>Put</b> another way, the price of hogs, per hundredweight, divided by the price of corn per bushel. Since corn is a major input cost to hog producers, the higher the price of hogs {{relative}} to corn, the more profit there is in feeding hogs.|$|R
5000|$|The iron {{butterfly}} is {{a neutral}} strategy {{and consists of}} a combination of a bull <b>put</b> credit <b>spread</b> and a bear call credit spread (see above). The iron butterfly is a special case of an iron condor (see above) where the strike price for the bull <b>put</b> credit <b>spread</b> and the bear call credit spread are the same. Ideally, the margin for the iron butterfly is the maximum of the bull put and bear call spreads, but some brokers require a cumulative margin for the bull put and the bear call. The maximum return generated for the iron butterfly is when the stock price is the same as when the position was entered. The return calculation for the iron butterfly position using the maximum margin of the bull <b>put</b> credit <b>spread</b> and the bear call credit spread and assuming price of the stock or index at expiration is the same as when the position was entered is shown below: ...|$|R
