40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the climate of}} the Carpathian Region (17 °- 27 °E; 44 °- 50 °N), the European Commission launched in 2010 and financed the CARPATCLIM project. The CARPATCLIM consortium was made by nine country members (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine) under the scientific and technical coordination of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The CARPATCLIM members collected, quality-checked, homogenized, harmonized, and interpolated daily data for sixteen meteorological variables and more than thirty derived indicators related to the period 1961 - 2010. The principal outcome of the project is the Climate Atlas of the Carpathian Region, hosted on a dedicated website (www. carpatclim-eu. org) and made of high-resolution daily grids (0. 1 °x 0. 1 °) of all variables and indicators. In order to describe the climate evolution of the Carpathian Region, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variability of ten variables: minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, daily temperature range, precipitation, cloud cover, <b>relative</b> <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration,</b> relative humidity, surface air pressure, and wind speed. For each variable, we performed a linear trend analysis on an annual and seasonal basis. Temperature was found to increase in every season, in particular {{in the last three}} decades, confirming the trends occurring in Europe; wind speed decreased in every season; cloud cover and relative humidity decreased in spring, summer, and winter, and increased in autumn, whilst <b>relative</b> <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> behaved in the opposite way; precipitation and surface air pressure showed no significant trend, though they increased slightly on an annual basis. In the Carpathian region positive/negative sunshine duration anomalies are highly correlated to the corresponding temperature anomalies during the global dimming (1960 s- 1970 s) and brightening (1990 s- 2000 s) periods.

40|$|In this work, a new {{approach}} is tested by applying neural networks treatment to meteorological time-series data sets, recorded during 1991 - 2000 at certain Greek locations, {{in order to create}} fully appropriate solar data information. Neural networks, in this case, are used for creating missing mean, maximum and minimum global and diffuse solar irradiance hourly data, when educated with other known meteorological time-series hourly values. For this purpose, hourly data of air temperature, <b>relative</b> humidity, <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration,</b> clouds' octals, as well as local latitude are used with regard to these sites. Neural networks' education process outputs are checked against known hourly values of solar irradiance, based upon the mentioned meteorological hourly raw data necessary for this action recorded at the National Observatory of Athens, the actinometric station at the Technological Education Institute (TEI) of Piraeus, and six other locations. Selection of these sites is representative of the climatic conditions in Greece, from north to south and east to west.

40|$|Climate {{change will}} have {{important}} implications in the agriculture of semi-arid regions, such as Southern Spain, where the expected warmer and drier conditions might augment crop water demand. To evaluate these effects, a data set consisting of observed daily values of air temperature, <b>relative</b> humidity, <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> and wind speed from eight weather stations in Andalusia and covering the period 1960 - 2005 was used for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETo). ETo was calculated using five methods: the more complex Penman-Monteith FAO- 56 (PM) equation, considered as a reference in this study, and four alternative methods with fewer data requirements, Hargreaves, Blaney-Criddle, Radiation and Priestley-Taylor. These methods were compared to PM with respect to ETo average values and trends. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall {{test was used to}} evaluate annual and seasonal trends in the main climate variables and ETo. Due to increases in air temperature and solar radiation, and decreases in relative humidity, statistically significant increases in PM-ETo were detected (up to 3. 5 Â mmÂ year- 1). Although the Hargreaves equation provided the closest average values to PM, this method did not detect any ETo trend. On the other hand, trends found from Blaney-Criddle and Radiation ETo values were similar to those obtained from PM. In addition, after a local adjustment, these two methods gave accurate ETo average values. Therefore, Blaney-Criddle and Radiation methods have shown themselves to be the most accurate approaches for ETo determination in climate change studies, when available data provided by climate models are limited.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a relationship between}} the <b>relative</b> <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> and solar irradiation on the earth's surface. Following {{a review of the literature}} on Ångström's equation and the properties of instantaneous solar radiation, the sunshine–radiation relationship is derived from monthly average values of daily beam radiation which are used as a measure for the fraction of clear sky, ƒ[clear]=H̄[b]/H̄[b,clear]. The resulting (non-linear) relationship, ƒ[clear]=(K̄/K̄[clear]) ^ 2, unlike the Ångström–Prescott relation, does not contain empirical constants and only requires the monthly average clear sky atmospheric transmittance to account for the climate of a particular location (K̄[clear] is typically between 0. 65 to 0. 75). The relationship is verified for monthly intervals for Perth and Townsville, Australia and compared to existing Ångström–Prescott equations for a wide range of climates and locations. The excellent agreement of the proposed relationship with the average value of data in the latter comparison suggests that it may be universally valid and that the Ångström–Prescott equation is a local (linear) approximation of the derived relationship. For daily time intervals the sunshine–radiation relationship changes to ƒ[clear]=(K/K[clear]) ^ 3.

To evaluate the effect of climate change, a data set consisting of observed daily values of air temperature, <b>relative</b> humidity, <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> and wind speed from five selected weather stations in the 3 H Plain and covering the period 1981 - 2009 was used for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET 0). ET 0 was calculated using FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith equation; then sensitivity coefficient of ETc of major climatic variables and regional responses of precipitation deficit to climate change were conducted in the 3 H Plain. The results showed that a clear drop in solar radiation (SR) was detected and temperatures increased, especially the minimum temperature. Wind speed (WS) decreased significantly {{in most of the}} stations, especially from seeding to jointing stages for wheat. No significant change was detected for relative humidity (RH) in 1981 - 2009. Temperature was the most sensitive variable in general for the plain, followed by SR, WS and RH. The decrease of sensitivity coefficient of solar radiation (SSR) mainly occurred in seeding to jointing stages and heading to maturity stages of winter wheat. Sensitivity coefficient of temperatures (ST) increased in Beijing, Xinxiang, Xuzhou and Yanzhou stations, which means that an increase in temperatures may lead to a larger increase of ETc in these four stations. However, ST decreased in the Shijiazhuang station. With the decrease of WS, ETc will decrease due to the positive coefficient in Beijing and Xinxiang stations. Trends of SRH showed no significant changes in the time series analysis. A positive relationship was detected between precipitation deficit and relative humidity, and the latter was considered the most correlative factor for precipitation deficit. Peer reviewe...|$|R
