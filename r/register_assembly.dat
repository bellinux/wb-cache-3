40|$|Background and Aim: Application {{of modern}} {{technologies}} {{and changes in}} industries and work practices, particularly in assembly lines, have resulted in increased work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This has led to reduced occupational competence in both industrialized and developed countries. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the prevalence of MSDs in the upper limbs, postural loading on the upper limbs (using the LUBA technoque), and ergonomic risk factors among assembly workers of an Iranian Telecommunications Manufacturing Company (ITMC) in Shiraz, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional survey data were collected, using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaire (NMQ) and LUBA Checklist, on 193 randomly selected <b>registered</b> <b>assembly</b> workers from 8 units of the assembly line of ITMC, Shiraz, Iran. The statistical tests used were as follws: 1. The qui-square test, to determine factors causing MSDs; 2. One-way analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis to determine postural loading index; 3. Logistic multiple regression analysis, to determine risk factors. Results: Lower-back symptoms were found to be the most prevalent problem (67. 9 %.) among the workers. The findings also showed that the upper limb disorders were significantly associated with age, sex, job, daily working time, work evironment conditions, and twisting (P< 0. 01). Based on LUBA, a large majority of the workers (89. 64 %) had experienced high postural loading (PLI = 5). In addition, significant associations were found between postural loading and symptoms of upper limbs and units of work (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on these findings, MSDs are prevelent among Telecommunication Manufacturing Company in Shiraz, Iran. The most important factors likely to cause MSDs are postural loading on the limbs and unfavourable working conditions. Interventional programs aimig at preventing musculoskeletal problems among assembly line workers should focus on reducing postural loading...|$|R

40|$|Assembly protein (AP) {{preparations}} from bovine brain coated vesicles {{have been}} fractionated by clathrin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Two distinct fractions that possess coat assembly activity were obtained and are termed AP- 1 and AP- 2. The AP- 1, not retained on the resin, has principal components with molecular weights of 108, 000, 100, 000, 47, 000, and 19, 000. The AP- 2, {{bound to the}} resin and eluted by Tris-HCl at a concentration that parallels the latter's effect on coat disassembly, corresponds to the active complex described previously (Zaremba, S., and J. H. Keen, 1983, J. Cell Biol., 97 : 1339 - 1347). Its composition {{is similar to that}} of the AP- 1 in that it contains 100, 000 -, 50, 000 -, and 16, 000 -mol-wt polypeptides in equimolar amounts; minor amounts of 112, 000 - and 115, 000 -mol-wt polypeptides are also present. Both are distinct from a recently described assembly protein of larger subunit molecular weight that we term AP- 3. These results indicate the existence of a family of assembly proteins within cells. On incubation with clathrin both AP- 1 and AP- 2 induce the formation of coat structures, those containing AP- 1 slightly smaller (mean diameter = 72 nm) than those formed in the presence of AP- 2 (mean diameter = 79 nm); both structures have been detected previously in coated vesicle preparations from brain. Coats formed in the presence of AP- 2 consistently contain approximately one molecule each of the 100, 000 -, 50, 000 -, and 16, 000 -mol-wt polypeptides per clathrin trimer. By low angle laser light scattering the molecular weight of native AP- 2 was determined to be approximately 343, 000, indicating that it is a dimer of each of the three subunits, and implying that it is functionally bivalent in clathrin binding. A model for AP-mediated coat assembly is proposed in which a bivalent AP- 2 molecule bridges the distal legs or terminal domains of two clathrin trimers that are destined to occupy adjacent vertices in the assembled coat. Binding of a second AP- 2 molecule locks these two trimers in <b>register</b> for <b>assembly</b> and further addition of AP- 2 to free trimer legs promotes completion of the clathrin lattice. Effects of AP binding on the angle and flexibility of the legs at the hub of the trimer (the "pucker") are suggested to account for the characteristic size distributions of coats formed under varied conditions and, more speculatively, to contribute to the transformation of flat clathrin lattices to curved coated vesicles that are thought to occur during endocytosis...|$|R

It was a new palace, in front of the old palace of 1915 vintage, built in 1970 {{in the form of a}} contemporary Pagoda. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah, the then heir apparent to the throne. The southern gate of the palace is located at the crossing of Prithvipath and Darbar Marg roads. The palace area covers (30 ha) and is fully secured with gate controlled walls on all sides. The palace, as previously discused in Kathmandu's history, was the scene of a gruesome tragedy, termed “Nepal’s greatest tragedy”, on June 1, 2001 at the hall in the palace where the Crown Prince Dipendra in an inebriated state supposedly gunned down his immediate family consisting of his father King Birendra, his mother Queen Aishwarya, his brother and sister, and also five of his relatives, later killing himself.
