50|$|The {{platform}} {{is based on}} a unitized welded steel body (monocoque) with an independent short long arms (SLA) double wishbone front <b>suspension</b> with stabilizer <b>bar</b> and an independent multi-link twist blade <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> with stabilizer <b>bar.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Abarth's Mario Colucci also {{developed}} the [...] Scorpione SS. This powerful model was extensively re-engineered, with a coil-over front <b>suspension,</b> a reworked <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> anti-sway <b>bars</b> front and rear, and all-wheel Girling disc brakes. Top speed is 115 mph. This model was foreshadowed by the [...] "Scorpione S" [...] of 1969, which had this higher developed chassis {{combined with the}} lower powered engine. With the rear-mounted heavier 124 engine weight distribution has a distinct rear bias (39/61), although this {{seems to have had}} only a modest effect on handling, limited to some front-end lift at higher speeds. After Abarth was taken over by Fiat in 1971, the Scorpione was quickly cancelled.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, a [...] "high-cube" [...] style van {{based on}} the Mark III front {{bodyshell}} but with longer wheelbase and Renault-derived <b>rear</b> torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension</b> was introduced and was named the Ford Courier. The Courier continued in the Mark IV style through until 2002, when it {{was replaced by the}} Ford Transit Connect.|$|R
5000|$|... “ 5.0-liter V8 engine, available. The added {{performance}} that {{adds to the}} pleasure of driving.” The Olds Cutlass Supreme coupe and sedan were stock with a 3.8-liter V6, 2 barrel engine, while a 5-liter V8 engine was available at extra cost. The transmission is a 3-speed automatic with torque converter clutch. The front suspension is a strut type, which {{is also known as}} the MacPherson strut. Where the rear is a multi link. Both front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> include anti-roll <b>bars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All E-Types {{featured}} independent {{coil spring}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> with torsion <b>bar</b> front ends, and four wheel disc brakes, in-board at the rear, all were power-assisted. Jaguar {{was one of}} the first vehicle manufacturers to equip cars with disc brakes as standard from the XK150 in 1958. The Series 1 (except for late 1967 models) can be recognised by glass-covered headlights (up to 1967), small [...] "mouth" [...] opening at the front, signal lights and tail-lights above bumpers and exhaust tips under the number plate in the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} racing grid was 43 American-born drivers; {{including the}} last-place finisher Frank Warren who crashed on lap 11 {{out of the}} 492 laps {{that made up the}} advertised distance. Benny Parsons would return to the track after being a part of that lap 11 crash which destroyed the whole right side of his car. Travis Carter, his crew and volunteers, including Ralph Moody and his staff of 20 people managed to complete the repairs in an hour and eight minutes. They had to replace a <b>rear</b> axle, <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> side <b>bars,</b> braking system and roll bar cage. Parsons would encounter some vibration issues on lap 308 that would knock him out of the race. Even with the DNF, he would slide into a comfortable 28th place finish.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{powered by a}} [...] Mitisubishi 8 HA 21 WT V8 diesel engine mounted behind the bow gunner. Its tracks were fitted with five road wheels, with a drive wheel at the front and an idler wheel at the <b>rear.</b> Torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension</b> was fitted. No night vision {{equipment}} or NBC protection was fitted. The vehicle could ford {{to a depth of}} 1 m.|$|R
5000|$|The American M26 Pershing was {{designed}} as a medium tank to replace the M4 Sherman, and contained many features common on post-war MBTs. These features include an automatic transmission mounted in the <b>rear,</b> torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension</b> [...] and had an early form of powerpack. The M26, however, suffered from a relatively weak engine, and was somewhat under powered. [...] The design of the M26 had profound influence on American postwar medium and Main Battle tanks: ...|$|R
50|$|The Japanese models {{continued}} to carry SS-I and SS-II trim levels. The SS-I {{is powered by}} 1ZZ-FE engine, SS-II is motored by 2ZZ-GE engine. The SS-II also can be ordered with Super Strut Package with super strut <b>suspension,</b> <b>rear</b> strut <b>bar,</b> 16-inch alloys, metal pedals, and colored rocker panels. The SS-II has climate control AC with digital display. Options included {{the choice of the}} Elegant Sports Version with front lip spoiler and headlight covers, or the Mechanical Sports Version with full body kits.The Japanese market Celica was updated with minor changes in August 2002.|$|R
50|$|Opel {{launched}} a brand-new Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show, in September 2015. The Astra K is smaller (5 cm), and lighter (up to 200 kilos) compared to Astra J. Although it is smaller on the outside, Opel claims it is bigger on the inside, {{than the previous}} Astra J. Depending on the model and trim level {{it is up to}} 200 kilograms - at the very least 120 kilograms - lighter than its predecessor. The completely new vehicle architecture {{plays a major role in}} the weight reduction. Every component was checked for compact design and lightweight materials. The bodyshell weight alone was reduced by 20 percent from 357 to 280 kilograms. Additional, chassis-related measures resulted in another 50 kilograms of weight reduction; these include high-strength and ultra-high-strength low-weight steels, compact subframes as well as weight reductions to the front and <b>rear</b> axle. <b>Rear</b> <b>suspension</b> is torsion <b>bar</b> (only with Watts-linkage with top engines), and McPherson struts is it at the front.|$|R
5000|$|The Beetle {{featured}} a rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder, boxer engine in a two-door bodywork featuring a flat front windscreen, accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet {{and behind the}} rear seat - and offering a coefficient of drag of 0.41; to this relatively good CD, the also streamlined rear of car was of help. The bodywork attached with eighteen bolts to its nearly flat chassis which {{featured a}} central structural tunnel. Front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> featured torsion <b>bars</b> along with front stabilizer bar - providing independent suspension at all wheels. Certain initial features were subsequently revised, including mechanical drum brakes, split-window rear windows, mechanical direction-indicators and the non-synchronized gearbox. Other features, including its distinctive overall shape, endured. In fact, the Beetle was prized for its seemingly unchanged appearance and [...] "marketed to American consumers as the anti-GM and Ford: 'We {{do not believe in}} planned obsolescence. We don't change a car for the sake of change.'" ...|$|R

40|$|This report discuss {{about the}} design and {{development}} of mountain bike <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> for all-mountain riding style. The objective {{of this study is}} to design and develop a proper geometry of <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system for mountain bike, and to study the motion mechanisms of <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system. This study deals with the path analysis (PA) of a wheel axle and pivot position determination for the crank set of mountain bike. The results show that the new developed <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> base on Monolink type have a suitable frame geometry that give a great horizontal and vertical travel for improvement of pedalling efficiency. In addition the crank set position for the Monolink <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> also helping for a smooth ride resulting from the less chain growth and chainstay lengthening. These research uses AutoCAD, Autodesk Sketch Pro and SolidWork to design and analyze the path analysis in terms of displacement of “x” and “y” axis of the developed <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> The results are compared between another several types of <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|M151 (1960) - Initial version. Because of its <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> design {{it had a}} {{dangerous}} tendency to flip over when cornered too aggressively by unaware drivers. The coil spring and swing-axle <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> lay-out (similar to the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> of the early-model Chevrolet Corvair) could result in large rear wheel camber changes, causing drastic oversteer and a subsequent roll-over.|$|R
50|$|Replacing the Milemaster was the 122 cc Imp which sacrificed <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{for light}} weight. However, the later, larger 197 cc Imp Supreme adopted {{conventional}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only the modular six-cylinder engines were {{available}} from model year 1995 on. The front suspension was redesigned to more closely match {{that of the}} 850. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> received a completely redesigned multi-link independent system with a single fibreglass transverse leaf spring. The 1995 estate received independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Volvo reported that the single composite leaf spring used in the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> of the 960 estate had the same mass as {{just one of the}} two springs it replaced. Boge's Nivomat self-levelling <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system became an option rather than standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} must {{be either}} Volkswagen Type 1, 181 ball joint or link pin only. <b>Rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is based on}} Volkswagen Type 1 independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> or swing axle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> is {{independent}} using conventional springs, with good wheel geometry control and a limited-slip differential. It {{is noteworthy that}} the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> geometry can be finely tuned.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the third}} generation, Ford {{installed}} fully independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> in the 5-door Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer - {{but not in}} the 3-door Sport model. This replaced the non-independent [...] "live axle" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> used in previous model year Explorers. With a fully independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> each <b>rear</b> wheel connects to the rear differential via a half-shaft drive axle. This design offers increased ride comfort, on-road handling, and vehicle stability. Other vehicles have used this setup on both rear and four-wheel drive vehicles for many years. For example, the Hummer H1 and the Mercedes-Benz ML-Class use independent front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> One reason for Fords switch to independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> in the Explorer was due to the well-publicized vehicle rollovers and resulting fatalities that occurred with the previous generations of Ford Explorer. All of the Explorers involved in the rollovers had non-independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> and most of the vehicles had Firestone tires which Ford judged to be defective (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Front {{suspension}} {{is based}} on Volkswagen type 1 link pin style. [...] <b>Rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is based on}} VW Type 1 independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> arms may be lengthened up to 1 inch. Stock track width as measured, wheel mating surface to wheel mating surface must be maintained. No secondary suspension is allowed. Additional modifications are allowed with limitations. No air or coiler shocks allowed.|$|R
50|$|Porsche used four-wheel torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension</b> {{for their}} 356 and 911 series from 1948 until 1989 with the {{introduction}} of the 964. They are also used in the front suspension of the 914 as well as the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> of the 924, 944, and 968. Honda also used front torsion bars on the third generation Civic and other variants built on the same platform including the Ballade and first generation CRX.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{supports}} the swingarm, which is attached via the swingarm pivot bolt {{to the frame}} and holds the axle of the rear wheel. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> can consist of several shock arrangements: ...|$|R
50|$|Bikes with a 'floating drivetrain' or 'floating bottom bracket' can use {{any type}} of {{suspension}} system to suspend the rear wheel from the frame, but use linkages to connect the crank assembly to the frame and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Since the linkages {{are connected to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> suspension movement causes the crank assembly to move as well. The floating drivetrain is often employed to compensate for the disadvantages of a particular <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system so the design can make better use of its advantages.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts and the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> is independent semi-trailing arms. In 1982, the front suspension was upgraded to include twin-pivot lower control {{arms and the}} geometry of the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> was revised.|$|R
50|$|Coilover shock {{absorbers}} are usually {{a kind of}} twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring. They are common on motorcycle and scooter <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions,</b> and widely used on front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> in cars.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Looking {{at various}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{configuration}}s, design a <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> configuration {{to replace the}} factory Ford Escort Hotchkiss style <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> with a design that will allow for ideal suspension geometry {{to be kept in}} check throughout variances in ride and roll as well as allowing for adjustability to allow the suspension to be tuned for certain track conditions as well as being capable of working in with different vehicle settings as a whole...|$|R
50|$|Plunger <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{was offered}} later, with a {{swingarm}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> frame available from 1954. The model continued in production until 1959, {{by which time}} the traditional Lucas magdyno {{had been replaced by}} an alternator and coil ignition.|$|R
5000|$|Back-halved - a bodied drag {{racing car}} {{that has had}} its stock <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> removed and {{replaced}} with a four-link or ladder <b>bar</b> <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> and narrowed <b>rear</b> axle. This arrangement allows for larger tires and better adjustability.|$|R
25|$|All {{cars are}} {{required}} to use a double wishbone setup for the front <b>suspension</b> and independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b> Both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> systems feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which can be adjusted from the cockpit.|$|R
2500|$|The Mustang has a MacPherson-strut front {{suspension}} with reverse [...] "L" [...] {{lower control}} arms. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{was a new}} three-link system with a Panhard Rod that controls the vertical and lateral movements of the axle. This live axle <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> while sacrificing handling, provides the benefits of reduced cost and weight over heavier, more expensive independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions.</b> In spite of this, Ford has drawn heavy criticism from the automotive journalism community for the decision to equip the 5th generation Mustang with the live axle system. At a press conference, Ford stated that to include an independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> would have added $5,000 to the showroom price of the car.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s some further prototypes were built, like a four-cylinder with a {{rotary valve}} and carbon seals {{as well as}} a {{two-cylinder}} model with <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> neither of which reached production. Several prototypes with <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> and an Earles front fork were also built.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "softail" [...] is a {{registered}} trademark of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, coined {{with the release of}} the FXST Softail in 1984. Since then, the word has expanded to include other motorcycles with hidden <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> as well as bicycles incorporating a <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|Obviously any four wheel vehicle needs {{suspension}} {{for both the}} front wheels and the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> but in two wheel drive vehicles these can be very different configuration. For front-wheel drive cars, <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> has few constraints {{and a variety of}} beam axles and independent suspensions are used. For rear-wheel drive cars, <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> has many constraints and the development of the superior but more expensive independent suspension layout has been difficult. Four-wheel drive often have suspensions that are similar for both the front and rear wheels.|$|R
