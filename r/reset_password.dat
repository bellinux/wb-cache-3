We were told the problems were limited and asked to project confidence, have people use pencil and paper, and try to submit again later. Then at 6 p.m. they admitted they had issued the wrong PINs to every volunteer in Colorado, and reissued new PINS (which also didn't work)." [...] In North Carolina, another campaign official said that [...] "the system went down for a half hour during peak voting, but for hundreds or more, it never worked all day...

The agency’s functions are of such nature that a potential information leakage can endanger peoples’ lives.

50|$|A {{major problem}} with {{self-service}} <b>password</b> <b>reset</b> inside corporations and similar organizations is enabling users {{to access the}} system if they forgot their primary password. Since SSPR systems are typically web-based, users need to launch a web browser to fix the problem, yet cannot log into the workstation until the problem is solved. There are various approaches to addressing this Catch-22, {{most of which are}} compromises (e.g., desktop software deployment, domain-wide <b>password</b> <b>reset</b> account, telephone access, visiting a neighbour, continuing to call the help desk, etc.). Some companies have created software which presents a restricted web browser at the login screen with the sole ability to access the <b>password</b> <b>reset</b> page without logging into the system; an example of this is Novell's Client Login Extension technology. Because these technologies effectively give the user access to computer resources, specifically a web browser, to <b>reset</b> <b>passwords</b> without authenticating to the computer, security is a high priority and capabilities are very limited so that the user cannot do more than is expected in this mode.|$|R

50|$|Starting with Windows XP, a <b>password</b> <b>reset</b> disk can {{be created}} using the Forgotten Password wizard. This disk {{can be used to}} <b>reset</b> the <b>password</b> using the <b>Password</b> <b>Reset</b> Wizard from the logon screen. The user's RSA private key is backed up using an offline public key whose {{matching}} private key is stored in one of two places: the <b>password</b> <b>reset</b> disk (if the computer is not a member of a domain) or in Active Directory (if it is a member of a domain). An attacker who can authenticate to Windows XP as LocalSystem still does not have access to a decryption key stored on the PC's hard drive. If the <b>password</b> is <b>reset,</b> the DPAPI master key is deleted and Windows XP blocks all access to the EFS encrypted files to prevent offline and rogue attacks and protect the encrypted files. If the user changes the password back to the original password, EFS encrypted files can be recovered.|$|R

30|$|A {{consumer}} {{who wants}} to avail the online banking services needs to register at the bank before making any transactions. Along with account details, consumer has to submit his/her personal identification details such as permanent address proof, mobile number and most importantly a fingerprint for registration. In this process, a new idea is proposed where the user can select a user-id (UID) and password. We put a restriction that the password must contain at least one digit, one control character, uppercase and lowercase letters and one punctuation symbol is quite strong. In our implementation of this registration phase, we have followed the proper rules and regulations to create, lockout and <b>reset</b> <b>passwords</b> as described in [31 – 33, 37].|$|R
50|$|Two-factor {{authentication}} is a 'strong authentication' method, as it {{adds another}} layer of security to the <b>password</b> <b>reset</b> process. In most cases this consists of Preference Based Authentication plus a second form of physical authentication (using something the user possesses, i.e. Smartcards, USB tokens, etc.). One popular method is through SMS and email. Advanced SSPR software requires the user to provide a mobile phone number or personal e-mail address during setup. In {{the event of a}} <b>password</b> <b>reset,</b> a PIN code will be sent to the user's phone or email and they will need to enter this code during the <b>password</b> <b>reset</b> process. Modern technology also allows authentication via voice biometrics using voice recognition technology.|$|R
30|$|While {{password}} based schemes are prevalent {{forms of}} authentication, {{as the number}} and complexity of passwords continue to grow due to {{the increasing number of}} online accounts per user and complicated password creation policies, users are finding it increasingly difficult to manage and remember passwords for different accounts, and have to <b>reset</b> <b>passwords</b> frequently [1, 2]. To address this, prior efforts investigated various forms of fallback authentication mechanisms to facilitate <b>resetting</b> of <b>passwords.</b> Among these, pre-selected challenge questions (i.e., personal knowledge questions) are often used as a fallback authentication mechanism to facilitate resetting/recovery of passwords [3]. However, this widely used approach of leveraging static challenge questions as fallback authentication mechanism has several limitations. For instance, recent studies revealed that personal knowledge based questions are often susceptible to various weaknesses such as easy predictability, inapplicability, and poor recall rate [3 – 8]. Furthermore, static security questions are becoming weaker due to improved information retrieval techniques and increases in online content [8], where an attacker can obtain the answers to many of the static challenge questions by mining online sources (e.g., social networking sites, public records or even a simple Google search).|$|R

Many a times, users write their passwords on sticky notes {{just because of the}} fear of forgetting password. Or they tend to keep password very simple so that they can easily remember it. This is a major security loophole because such passwords can easily be guessed and hacked. Providing a fallback authentication mechanism, which helps the user to <b>reset</b> his <b>password</b> and unlock his account without calling the helpdesk, will eliminate those wasted minutes and dollars too. If a fallback authentication mechanism is provided to users to <b>reset</b> their <b>passwords</b> on their own instantly, from their own desktop and even without login to the system, this will address the problem from root...|$|R
