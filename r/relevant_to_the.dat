5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E

5|$|In Barker v.

Applying Barker, the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest. The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.|$|E

5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually tell a story or event <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E
