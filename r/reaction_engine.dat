5000|$|A pulsejet {{engine is}} an {{air-breathing}} <b>reaction</b> <b>engine</b> that employs an ongoing sequence of discrete combustion events {{rather than one}} sustained combustion event. This clearly distinguishes it from other <b>reaction</b> <b>engine</b> types such as rockets, turbojets and ramjets, which are all constant combustion devices. All other reaction engines are driven by maintaining high internal pressure; pulsejets are driven by an alternation {{between high and low}} pressure. This alternation is not maintained by any mechanical contrivance, but rather by the natural acoustic resonance of the rigid tubular engine structure. The valveless pulsejet is, mechanically speaking, the simplest form of pulsejet, and is, in fact, the simplest known air-breathing propulsion device that can operate [...] "statically", i.e. without forward motion.|$|E
