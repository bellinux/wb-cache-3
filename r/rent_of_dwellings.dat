50|$|In Middleton {{they built}} company houses (Newtown). A {{contemporary}} writer described {{the part of}} Middleton built by the Company: 'Masterman Place or as it is sometimes called, New-Middleton, was erected in 1833 by the London Lead Company from the chaste and appropriate design of Mr. Bonomi, and {{under the direction of}} Robert Stagg. It consists of several uniform rows of neat and convenient cottages, situated in a spacious garden, a portion of which was appropriated to each dwelling. The increasing population of Middleton had considerably enhanced the <b>rents</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> houses there, and it was to diminish this burden that the Company built Masterman Place, in which, as vacancies occur, they place their most deserving workmen, thus combining general utility with the reward of personal merit. The first occupiers took possession of their new abodes in May 1824, accompanied by bands of music, etc.’. Temperance was required by the company in their new houses.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn art. 1824 - 1835, the new Civil Code institutes {{a series}} of {{particular}} rules in the matter <b>of</b> <b>renting</b> <b>dwellings,</b> rules that apply mainly to renting spaces destined {{to the practice of}} a professional's activity. Among these we mention the dispositions regarding the termination of the agreement (art. 1824 - 1825), the unwritten clauses (art. 1826), vices that threaten the body health or integrity (art. 1827) or the right to preference when renting (art. 1828). We consider the analysis of these dispositions useful all the more so as the regulation of the new Civil Code in the matter <b>of</b> <b>renting</b> <b>dwellings</b> is not singular. That is why in this study we also aim at referring to the stipulations contained in Law no. 114 / 1996 regarding dwellings and to the O. U.

40|$|Despite {{the large}} number of case studies {{estimating}} the impact of railways on property values, there is as yet no research conducted specifically for the Dubai Metro. This study applies the existing empirical methods, corrected for sources of bias, to test for the effect of the Dubai Metro on the values of residential and retail properties. The results will also be of interest to neighbouring cities developing their first railways. The existing empirical work reveals a large variation in estimates for the effect of railways on property values. This thesis provides a comprehensive meta-analysis examining the sources of variation and relating these findings to the estimates for the Dubai Metro. As an addition to the existing literature, this study examines the effect on sale and rent values using repeated cross-sectional and pseudo panel data, and makes a case for the preferred data structure. Besides applying the known measures of accessibility to a metro, this research represents the first attempt to test for the effect of the change in the generalized cost of travel (GC) due to the operations of the metro. The results from the preferred models indicate negative, insignificant and positive impacts of the metro on the sale value <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> located at different distances. The metro also enhances the <b>rent</b> value <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> and the sale value of retail properties. The study also finds an increase in the value <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> due to a decrease in the GC. The results suggest that while a reduction in the GC of public transport boosts the sale value of retail properties, values are higher in areas with higher private and public transport trip rates. The positive effect of the metro implies that a value capture mechanism can be explored, provided the related policy implications are understood. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Leases as an Alternative to Homeownership in Europe. Some Key Legal AspectsLeasing a {{property}} is sometimes {{not a real}} alternative to homeownership in many countries. A low proportion <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> housing hinders {{the efficiency of the}} housing market. Reasons for this may be of different natures but, for sure, most of them have roots in the urban leases legal system. A lease conceived as not flexible, not stable, and not affordable for tenants has little opportunity to be successful. At the same time, if it entails legal uncertainties, has low guarantees, and does not have an efficient eviction process, it is neither attractive for landlords who might prefer to close down their properties and leave them in disrepair. This paper analyses some key legal features in the three countries with the highest proportion <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> <b>dwellings</b> and in five Southern European countries with low proportions <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> properties and tries to find common elements that encourage or discourage citizens from opting for renting {{a property}} instead of buying it...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{noise levels}} {{measured}} in metropolitan streets are {{on many occasions}} over the norms but {{the consequences of this}} as a health hazard are only starting to be questioned; this is obviously worse in the large cities of the second and third worlds. A stated preference (SP) experiment was designed to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reducing the noise level in a group based residential location context. Important issues were the proper definition of the context and the variable metric for the environmental attribute. The experiment considered variations of the attributes travel time to work, monthly house <b>rent,</b> position <b>of</b> the <b>dwelling</b> with respect to the sun and subjective noise level inside it; objective levels were also measured after the experiment.

40|$|Most {{countries}} measure {{changes in}} the housing cost component of their CPI based on a sample <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> <b>dwellings</b> for which periodic surveys measure changes in rents. Changes {{in the value of}} rental services of owned homes have been estimated applying a user cost approach or often by assuming that they will follow the trend <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> units. In temporal comparisons several housing types are usually distinguished by size of unit and whether it is single family, multiple units and the like. Spatial housing indexes have typically followed a similar methodology, particularly in the EU where matched models are distinguished within a limited range of housing types. This paper reviews some of the issues in spatial comparisons since the inception of the ICP in 1968 through the plans for the 2004 - 5 comparisons now under way. The principal focus of the paper is on two issues, rental equivalence for home owners as a problem of asymmetric information, and spatial rental differences as a measure of costs versus amenities...|$|R

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to date to the role of the neighbourhood as a factor influencing residential mobility and the residential choice process. The question addressed here is to what extent neighbourhood characteristics (percentage <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> <b>dwellings,</b> low-income households, and ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood) influence different categories of residents to wish to leave their neighbourhood. The answer to this question can enhance our understanding of residential mobility and of the mechanisms causing segregation by income and ethnic groups. We use data from the 2002 Netherlands Housing Demand Survey, enriched with neighbourhood characteristics. Whether or not people wish to leave their neighbourhood is estimated using a multilevel logistic regression model with cross-level interaction effects between individual and neighbourhood characteristics. The main result shows that, with an increasing percentage of people from an ethnic minority in the neighbourhood, more people have the wish to leave the neighbourbood. However, this is to a lesser extent the case for members of ethnic minorities themselves. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

Comparisons of aggregated estimates generated from micro-level data to estimates at the macro-level can inform both levels on the accuracy and precision of methods and data sources. In this study, the treatments of housing in the macro statistics of the National Accounts and in the micro statistics of household expenditure and income surveys are examined. Three approaches to value dwelling services using household survey data are compared: capitalization rate, hedonic, and rental equivalence. Estimates are produced {{using data from the}} U. S.

Possible sources of differences in the macro- and micro-based aggregates are discussed.
