2500|$|... "Search {{and rescue}} service" [...] is a judicially defined term in Norway, which {{specifically}} applies to an immediate response to saving people from death and injury. It {{does not involve}} <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> {{protection of the environment}} or prevention of accidents. Most alarms are channeled through the sub-centers, which double as 1-1-2 emergency telephone number centers. Some alarms may be channeled via the coast radio stations or air traffic control. All Norwegian-registered aircraft are required to have an emergency locator transmitter connected to the Cospar-Sarsat system. JRCC SN is linked to the Global Maritime Distress Safety System, the Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue System and Inmarsat.|$|E

50|$|The {{right to}} be rewarded for salvage at sea under common law is based both on {{equitable}} principles and public policy and is not contractual in origin. Historically, salvage is a right in law, when a person, acting as a volunteer (that is, without any pre-existing contractual or other legal duty so to act) preserves or contributes so to preserving at sea any vessel, cargo, freight, or other recognized subject of salvage from danger. This is the typical case of salvage and is distinct from Prize law, which is the <b>rescuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> from the enemy {{at a time of}} war, for which a reward is made by the Court of Admiralty sitting as a Prize Court.|$|R

Wildland firefighting includes size up, containment, extinguishment, and mop up. Search and Rescue, which has already been mentioned, is performed early in any fire scenario and many times is in unison with extinguishing and ventilation.|$|R

40|$|Today, fire always causes great {{damage to}} people and their properties, {{and the risk of}} fireoften comes {{suddenly}} and unconsciously.

Inour paper, we design a system which is based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in theZigBee wireless sensor network (WSN) positioning system. This is a very good demonstrationsystem for the fire system. The system for firefighters could reflect the location of the firefightersand the information of current fire-site.

40|$|In {{the article}} {{on the basis of}} {{previously}} unknown archival materials {{for the first time in}} the national historiography a public way in Soviet agriculture of Moscow region in the period 1940 - 1942 yy. is considered. Particular attention is paid to the historiography of this problem, new methods of modern historians in the study of the rural economy of this period are marked. Different approaches in the analysis of the results of collectivization and the appearance in the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) new sectors of agricultural production - the state and the collective are compared. Features of the state agricultural production plants and the legal status of their workers in the state farms and machine and tractor stations (MTS) are pointed. Specific difficulties encountered in the process and as a result of the evacuation <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> state farms and MTS, preparing for spring sowing in the implementation of the directive of All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks of self-reliance are examined in details. The dedication of staff rear structures in the <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> the <b>property</b> entrusted to them, the preparation of the spring sowing campaign, raising funds and manpower in extreme conditions is marked. Relationship of the status on the front and readiness of rear workers to work in the changed circumstances is traced. The difference between subjective difficulties associated with defects of command-administrative system, which prevailed in government and objective hardship arising from the outbreak of hostilities is taken into account. Much attention is paid to the description of the technical condition of the machine and tractor fleet of state farms and MTS as the main means of agricultural production. The conclusion  about the causes and consequences of unavailability governance structures to conduct evacuation and preparation of the spring sowing are made. </p...|$|R
