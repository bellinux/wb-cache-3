The <b>relative</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>responsivity</b> of this detector was shown to be flat {{over most of the}} wavelength range examined and the spectral flatness was shown to be comparable to the best infrared black coatings currently available.

The responsivity of this detector was shown to be linear in the 0. 06 mW to 2. 8 mW radiant power range and its spatial uniformity was similar to other pyroelectric detectors utilising different types of black coatings. The carbon nanotube coatings were reported to be much more durable than other infrared black coatings commonly used to coat thermal detectors in the infrared, such as metal-blacks.

40|$|To {{implement}} the detector-based radiometric {{scale in the}} new Medium Background Infrared (MBIR) facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), we have developed an electrical substitution cavity radiometer that can be operated just above liquid nitrogen temperature. This MBIR Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR) utilizes a temperature-controlled receiver cone and an independently temperature-controlled heat sink. Being a thermal-type detector, low noise and drift of the radiometer signal depends mainly on low-noise temperature control of the receiver and heat sink. Using high critical-temperature (Tc) superconducting thin film temperature sensors in the active control loops, we have achieved closed-loop temperature controllability of better than 10 µK at 89 K for a receiver having an open-loop thermal time constant of about 75 seconds. For a flux level of 1 µW to 10 µW, the rms noise floor over a measurement cycle time is below 20 nW. This is the lowest noise level yet reported for a liquid nitrogen cooled electrical-substitution radiometer, {{and it is the}} first demonstration of the use of high-Tc superconductors in such a radiometer.
