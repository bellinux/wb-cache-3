The concept of thistype of device is that it can be used by normal plant operators and maintainers without the need forspecialist interpretation of spectra, although the underlying spectral plots are available if required.The sort of faults that can be detected include a range of mechanical problems such as imbalance,misalignment, and bearing problems in the motor and driven equipment, as well as electrical problemsincluding insulation breakdown, loose stator windings, <b>rotor</b> <b>slot</b> problems, current or voltage imbalance,and harmonic distortion. Because these systems measure both current and voltage, they also monitorpower and are able to identify problems caused by unusual operating conditions and identify causes oflost efficiency.Because model-based systems only examine the difference between actual and predicted currents,they effectively filter out all the normal electrical signals that are so apparent in conventional Motor CurrentSpectral Analysis (MCSA), leaving a much simpler set of signals to be analysed.Because these systems are based on the relationship between voltage and current, they deal well withinverter driven systems where the input voltage may be of a variable frequency and there may be a noisywaveform high in harmonic components. Model-based systems effectively filter out all this noise in thevoltage signal from the resulting current signal, leaving just the underlying imperfections.This ease of use and low cost of this type of equipment makes it appropriate for lower cost, lowercriticality equipment.|$|E

Its aim is to compare the vibration magnitude when the motor possesses different geometrical rotor-slot shapes. The cross sectional areas of two typical semi-closed slot shapes (rectangular and round shapes) are kept equally constant according to the IEEE standard. Under an assumption of sinusoidal motor excitation, the simulation works employ the finite element method (FEM) and the Newton-Raphson method to solve time varying nonlinear equations. The numerical solutions obtained indicate the electromagnetic force distribution over the motor cross sectional area. Such forces cause mechanical vibration in the motor. To evaluate this vibration, the displacement of stator inner perimeters was observed carefully.

General conclusion is that harmonic reactance values used in literature are more or less accurate (or by 10 % higher). On the contrary, real resistance values are 2 ~ 4 times higher and the active powers absorbed by the rotation machine do not exactly correspond to the damping value.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [126]- 127) Sensorless speed {{detection of}} induction machine drives {{is a goal}} that has seen efforts towards in generations. Traditional methods of speed detection include shaft - mounted tachometer, etc. However, since most induction machines work in harsh conditions and maintenance {{is not expected to}} be usual, shaft-mounted-tachometers generally lower the strength of the shaft and reduce the lifetime of the induction machine. It has been found that eccentricity and <b>rotor</b> <b>slot</b> harmonics in the induction machine stator current contain accurate speed information. Many efforts have been made to extract ihformation from eccentricity and <b>rotor</b> <b>slot</b> harmonics. However, they usually end up with extremely complicated analog circuits and unsatisfying performances. It is only after the development of Digital Signal Processing theory and DSP microprocessor that the extraction of speed information from eccentricity and <b>rotor</b> <b>slot</b> harmonics became feasible. Since then, algorithms have been developed to perform sensorless speed detection. However, they generally turned out to be very MIPS (million instruction per second) intensive and required a large number of RAM. And this prevents the application of sensorless speed detection in the motor industry. This thesis intends to investigate and develop techniques that utilize the unique characters of Goertzel algorithm, namely, very low RAM requirements and lower MIPS requirements. Such techniques would make the sensorless speed detection more feasible and applicable to the motor industry. In the process of implementing Goertzel algorithm, some new phenomena were identified and some previous work in the area was questioned. It was found that it is very possible to design a sensorless speed detection algorithm based on Goertzel algorithm with very low RAM and MIPS requirements while achieving the desired resolution. M.

Second, the MCA EXIN neurons are used to extract the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix, which is formed by the ADALINEs' output sequence. Then, the slot frequency is estimated by using Pisarenko's theory with this retrieved minimum eigenvector, and subsequently {{the speed of the}} motor is estimated. Compared to the original Pisarenko's method however, not only the proposed algorithm can work recursively sample by sample, but the computational complexity and mean square frequency estimation error are largely reduced. The proposed sensorless technique has been experimentally tested on a suitably developed test set-up with a 2 -kW induction motor drive.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{was to develop a}} vector controlled induction motor drive operating without a speed or position sensor but having a dynamic performance comparable to a sensored vector drive. The methodology was to detect the motor speed from the machine <b>rotor</b> <b>slot</b> harmonics using digital signal processing and to use this signal to tune a speed estimator and thus reduce or eliminate the estimator’s sensitivity to parameter variations. Derivation of a speed signal from the <b>rotor</b> <b>slot</b> harmonics using a Discrete Fourier Transform-based algorithm has yielded highly accurate and robust speed signals above machine frequencies of about 2 Hz and independent of machine loads. The detection, which has been carried out using an Intel i 860 processor in parallel with the main vector controller, has been found to give predictable and consistent results duing speed transient conditions. The speed signal obtained from the <b>rotor</b> <b>slot</b> harmonics has been used to tune a Model Reference Adaptive speed and flux observer, with the resulting sensorless drive operating to steady state speed accuracies down to 0. 02 rpm above 2 Hz (i. e. 60 rpm for the 4 pole machine). A significant aspect of the research has been the mathematical derivation of the speed bandwidth limitations for both sensored and sensorless drives, thus allowing for quantitative comparison of their dynamic performance. It has been found that the speed bandwidth limitation for sensorless drives depends on the accuracy to which the machine parameters are known and that for maximum dynamic performance it is necessary to tune the flux and speed estimator against variations in stator resistance in addition to the tuning mechanism deriving from the DFT speed detector. New dynamic stator resistance tuning algorithms have been implemented. The resulting sensorless drive has been found to have a speed bandwidth equivalent to sensored drives fitted with medium resolution encoders (i. e. about 500 ppr), and a zero speed accuracy of ± 8 rpm under speed control.
