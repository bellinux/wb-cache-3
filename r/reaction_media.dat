Most important factors are the choice of the solvent and the electrolyte used, because the polymerization reaction is sensitive to the nucleophilicity of the environment near the surface of the electrode.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the {{solvolysis}} system using 1 -BuOH {{shown in this}} paper, the yield of the levulinates was high (exceeding 60  %). As shown in Fig.  3, the second step of the mechanism involves the decomposition of glucoside to produce HMF derivative as an intermediate. The produced HMF derivatives were liable for condensation to insoluble residue in the <b>reaction</b> <b>media.</b> To avoid this condensation, HMF derivatives should be provided slowly to the <b>reaction</b> <b>media.</b> At the same time, the <b>reaction</b> <b>media</b> should provide optimum condition to convert HMF derivatives to levulinates. Result from the solvolysis using 1 -BuOH suggested that the lower cellulose accessibility of 1 -BuOH resulted in slower supply of glucosides and HMF derivatives to the <b>reaction</b> <b>media.</b> The <b>reaction</b> <b>media</b> of strongly acidified 1 -BuOH converted the HMF derivatives to butyl levulinate smoothly. Consequently, a high yield of butyl levulinate exceeding 60  % was obtained in the single reaction process under atmospheric pressure. Garves [16] reported an acid-catalyzed degradation of cellulose with alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol, applied at a temperature of 180 – 200  °C under the pressurized condition in an autoclave, gave a yield of levulinate about 10 – 45  %. On the other hand, the results in this paper showed that a much higher yield of levulinate (exceeding 60  %) could be achieved using a more simple reaction process of just refluxing in 1 -BuOH under atmospheric pressure. The results in this paper suggested that our simple solvolysis process using alcoholic <b>reaction</b> <b>media</b> that have a high boiling point and a low accessibility to cellulose has high potential for conversion of cellulosics into bio-levulinate.|$|E
