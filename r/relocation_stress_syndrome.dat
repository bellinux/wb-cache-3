40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to: a) investigate the relationship of selected anthropometric, strength, and kinematic variables to the incidence of patellofemoral <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> in high school female athletes; and b) develop a predictive equation to screen individuals who may be predisposed to patellofemoral <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Twenty-nine subjects were analyzed across nine dependent variables: two anthropometric measures, one strength measure, and six kinematic measures. Heavy subjects and those with a larger static quadriceps angle (Q-angle) {{were more likely to have}} patellofemoral <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Leg strength did not seem to be a factor. Also, a variable of gait, the time from foot contact to the time when the minimum dynamic Q-angle occurred, was significantly slower in the subjects with patellofemoral <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Furthermore, a predictive equation, which we created using discriminant analysis, was 89 % accurate in predicting which subjects would or would not have patellofemoral <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The equation uses an individual's weight, pelvic width, and static Q-angle. We conclude that, through proper screening, individuals susceptible to patellofemoral <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> may be identified prior to their becoming symptomatic, and that, through identifying causal variables, corrective procedures may be introduced in order to prevent patellofemoral <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> from hindering an individual's physical activity...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} functional and static foot posture and medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> in distance runners. Methods: Twenty-eight runners with a clinical diagnosis of medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 12 asymptomatic runners were assessed with the Foot Posture Index to measure static overpronation. Range of motion was measured at the talocrural joint, with the knee extended and flexed as was range of motion at the first metatarsophalangeal joint and the angular difference between the neutral and relaxed calcaneal stance positions. Each participant was then videotaped while running on a treadmill shod and unshod. This videotape was analyzed using freeze frame to identify abnormal or mistimed pronation at each phase of gait. The results were analyzed using logistic regression to give {{the probability that a}} runner is likely to experience medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome,</b> predicted from the static measurements and dynamic observations. Results: Variables identified as being significant predictors of medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> were the difference between the neutral and relaxed calcaneal stance positions, range of motion of the talocrural joint with the knee extended, early heel lift and abductory twist during gait, and apropulsive gait.

40|$|Background: Medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a type}} of exercise-induced leg {{pain that}} is common in {{recreational}} and competitive athletes. Although various studies have attempted to find the exact pathogenesis of this common condition, it remains unknown. Methods: Various theories in literature from 1976 to 2006 were reviewed using key words. Results: Until recently, inflammation of the periosteum due to excessive traction was thought to be the most likely cause of medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This periostitis has been hypothesized by some authors to be caused by the tearing away of the muscle fibers at the muscle-bone interface, although there are several suggestions as to which, if any, muscle is responsible. Conclusions: Recent studies have supported the view that medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> is not an inflammatory process of the periosteum but instead a stress reaction of bone that has become painful.

40|$|The porcine <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} of swine which, like neuroleptic malignant syndrome, {{is characterized by}} hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction. We investigated the porcine <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> as a possible animal model for neuroleptic malignant syndrome in two ways. First, we administered haloperidol and lithium carbonate, alone and in combination, to susceptible and resistant swine. Second, we attempted to prevent the syndrome by pretreating animals with bromocriptine. Porcine <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> was induced in 2 of 3 susceptible and 1 of 3 resistant swine by combined treatment with lithium and haloperidol, but was not triggered by treatment with lithium or haloperidol alone. Pretreatment with bromocriptine conferred no protection against the syndrome.

40|$|Activity or exercise-induced leg pain is {{a common}} {{complication}} among competitive and “weekend warrior” athletes. Shin splints is a term {{that has been used}} to describe all lower leg pain as a result of activity. There are many different causes of “shin splints,” one of which is medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and the treating clinician must be aware of potentially serious causes of activity related leg pain. Restoring proper biomechanics to the entire kinetic chain and rehabilitation of the injured area should be the primary aim of treatment to optimize shock absorption. The role inflammation plays in medial tibial <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> is controversial, but in this case, seemed to be a causative factor as symptomatology was dramatically decreased with the addition of proteolytic enzymes.

40|$|International audienceWe {{applied a}} battery of {{biomarkers}} in the earthworm Eisenia andrei to assess the pollutant-induced <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Earthworms were exposed to sublethal concentrations of copper (1 – 10 μM) and benzo[a]pyrene (0. 01 – 10 μM) as models of inorganic and organic pollutants for 1, 3 and 7 days. Four potential biomarkers of stress were measured: lysosomal membrane stability of coelomocytes, lysosomal accumulation of lipofuscin in chloragogenous tissue and of neutral lipids in coelomatic cells, plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase activity in the intestinal epithelium; metallothionein content was also evaluated as a biomarker of exposure. Significant changes were observed in the parameters measured in earthworms exposed to both contaminants. Certain biomarkers, such as lysosomal membrane stability and Ca 2 +-ATPase activity, that showed a decreasing trend with increasing pollutant concentration and time of exposure, proved to be particularly suitable to describe {{the evolution of a}} <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> from its early phase to the development of pathological conditions. On the other hand, contaminant-induced changes in lysosomal lipofuscin and neutral lipid accumulation showed a bell-shaped trend, indicating that these biomarkers are able to follow the development of pollutant-induced <b>stress</b> <b>syndrome</b> as far as an equilibrium in the cell functions is maintained; therefore, they are particularly useful to describe mild stress conditions...|$|R
