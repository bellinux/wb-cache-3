Without such authentication, <b>relics</b> are not to be used for public veneration.

To achieve this goal, this study proposed, designed, and implemented an RFID and Sensor Web–enabled smart cultural <b>relics</b> management system (SCRMS). In this system, active photovoltaic subtle energy-powered Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{is used for}} long-range contactless identification and lifecycle management of cultural <b>relics</b> during their storage and circulation. In addition, different types of ambient sensors are integrated with the RFID tags and deployed around cultural <b>relics</b> to monitor their environmental parameters, helping {{to ensure that they}} remain in good condition. An Android-based smart mobile application, as middleware, is used in collaboration with RFID readers to collect information and provide convenient management for the circulation of cultural <b>relics.</b> Moreover, multiple sensing techniques are taken advantage of simultaneously for preservation of cultural <b>relics.</b> The proposed system was successfully applied to a museum in the Yongding District, Fujian Province, China, demonstrating its feasibility and advantages for smart and efficient management and preservation of cultural <b>relics...</b>|$|R
