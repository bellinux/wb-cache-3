25|$|The {{first step}} in {{performing}} a cycle of directed evolution is the generation of a library of variant genes. The sequence space for <b>random</b> <b>sequence</b> is vast (10130 possible sequences for a 100 amino acid protein) and extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Neither experimental, nor natural evolution can ever get close to sampling so many sequences. Of course, natural evolution samples variant sequences close to functional protein sequences and this is imitated in DE by mutagenising an already functional gene.|$|E
25|$|Algorithmic {{information}} theory studies, among other topics, {{what constitutes a}} <b>random</b> <b>sequence.</b> The central idea is that a string of bits is random {{if and only if}} it is shorter than any computer program that can produce that string (Kolmogorov randomness)—this means that random strings are those that cannot be compressed. Pioneers of this field include Andrey Kolmogorov and his student Per Martin-Löf, Ray Solomonoff, and Gregory Chaitin. For the notion of infinite sequence, one normally uses Per Martin-Löf's definition.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>random</b> <b>sequence</b> of numbers, {{a number}} {{may be said}} to be cursed because it has come up less often in the past, and so it is thought that it will occur less often in the future. A number may be assumed to be blessed because it has {{occurred}} more often than others in the past, and so it is thought likely to come up more often in the future. This logic is valid only if the randomisation is biased, for example with a loaded die. If the die is fair, then previous rolls give no indication of future events.|$|E

25|$|One {{motivation}} for local alignment is {{the difficulty of}} obtaining correct alignments in regions of low similarity between distantly related biological sequences, because mutations have added too much 'noise' over evolutionary time {{to allow for a}} meaningful comparison of those regions. Local alignment avoids such regions altogether and focuses on those with a positive score, i.e. those with an evolutionarily conserved signal of similarity. A prerequisite for local alignment is a negative expectation score. The expectation score is defined as the average score that the scoring system (substitution matrix and gap penalties) would yield for a <b>random</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{two broad}} {{categories}} of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A cDNA library is constituted by the cDNA produced through reverse transcription of mRNA collected from specific cells {{of types of}} cell. This library can be ligated into a construct {{so that it is}} attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay. A random library uses lengths of DNA of <b>random</b> <b>sequence</b> in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including cassette mutagenesis. Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is ligated into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate restriction endonucleases.|$|E

The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination.

40|$|Simulations of {{originally}} existent biological sequences {{are helpful}} for computational analysis and manipulations, rather than wet lab experiments, considerably reducing {{the cost and}} time associated with traditional wet lab experiments. The basic idea is to compare {{the results of a}} run on real data to many runs on random data. This paper discusses the need for <b>random</b> biological <b>sequence</b> analysis and an alternative for generating biological <b>random</b> <b>sequences.</b> A novel <b>random</b> generation algorithm which uses the statistical distributions to generate numbers and to map these numbers into biological <b>random</b> <b>sequences</b> is conceived. Algorithm for generating <b>random</b> <b>sequences</b> with normal and binomial distributions is implemented; <b>random</b> <b>sequences</b> with tandem repeats, GC base control and nucleotide position control are also incorporated by modifying this algorithm.

40|$|A {{sample of}} {{transfer}} RNA molecules {{is compared to}} a sample of <b>random</b> <b>sequences</b> having the same length and same percentage composition of the different bases. For each sequence all possible secondary structures are constructed and a distribution of free energies for the states is obtained. It is found that the ground state free energies of tRNA molecules are significantly lower than for <b>random</b> <b>sequences,</b> and that tRNA molecules have significantly fewer alternative secondary structures at energies close to the ground state than do <b>random</b> <b>sequences.</b> A distance D is defined which measures the average difference between molecular configurations and the ground state configuration. At realistic temperatures of order 300  K this distance is much larger for <b>random</b> <b>sequences</b> than for tRNA sequences. Thus the secondary structure of tRNA molecules at finite temperature is more stable than for <b>random</b> <b>sequences.</b> Sequences are considered which differ by a small number of mutations from real tRNA sequences. On average mutations destabilize the secondary structure. This suggests that a stable secondary structure is one of the factors selected for by natural selection.

25|$|Temporal memory {{consists}} of remembering when a specific memory has occurred. In a study participants {{were placed in}} 4 groups; two control groups either given caffeine or a placebo and two groups that were sleep deprived for 36 hours either given caffeine or a placebo. The task used to measure temporal memory consisted of discriminating between recent and less recent face presentations. A set of twelve unfamiliar faces were presented sequentially every 10 seconds. A self-ordered pointing task was used afterwards for 5 minutes to prevent rehearsal and to keep tired participants occupied. This required them to mark any new items seen (either nouns or abstract shapes) presented on 12 sheets. A second set was presented, followed by another self-ordered pointing task, and then a <b>random</b> <b>sequence</b> of 48 faces either containing previously presented faces or new ones were shown to the participant. They {{were asked if they}} recognized the faces and whether they were from the first or second set. Results indicate that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but does produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set). Caffeine was found to have a greater effect on the sleep deprived group as compared to the placebo group deprived of sleep but still performed worse than both control groups. Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Brain imaging studies of those sleep deprived found that the greatest reduction in metabolic rate is in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E

Previous computational and experimental studies of random proteins generated from noncoding regions yielded inclusive results due to species-dependent codon biases and GC contents. Here, we approach this problem by investigating 10, 000 sequences randomized at the amino acid level. Using well-established predictors for protein intrinsic disorder, we found that natural sequences have more long disordered regions than <b>random</b> <b>sequences,</b> even when <b>random</b> and natural <b>sequences</b> have the same overall composition of amino acid residues.
