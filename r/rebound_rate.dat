50|$|During {{isostatic}} rebound, the Earth’s lithosphere (crust) {{is slowly}} rising due to buoyant forces, following {{the removal of}} a large mass on the surface. This can be likened to an ice cube floating in {{a glass of water}} with a penny sitting on top. The weight of the penny makes the ice cube float lower, similar to the immense weight of a glacier on top of the lithosphere. When the penny (glacier) is removed, the ice cube (lithosphere) “rebounds” and floats slightly higher. In the geologic case, this scenario happens very slowly. Rates of isostatic rebound throughout SE Alaska vary from 0.1 to 1.5 inches/year depending on glacial history.

40|$|The oxygen rebound mechanism, {{proposed}} {{four decades}} ago, is invoked {{in a wide}} range of oxygen and hetero-atom transfer reactions. In this process, a high-valent metal-oxo species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to generate a carbon-centered radical, which immediately recombines with the hydroxometal intermediate with very fast rate constants that can be in the ns to ps regime. In addition to catalyzing C-O bond formation, we found that manganese porphyrins can also directly catalyze C-H halogenations and pseudohalogenations, including chlorination, bromination and fluorination as well as C-H azidation. For these cases, we showed that long-lived substrate radicals are involved, indicating that radical rebound may involve a barrier in some cases. In this study, we show that axial ligands significantly affect the oxygen <b>rebound</b> <b>rate.</b> Fluoride, hydroxide and oxo ligands all slow down the oxygen <b>rebound</b> <b>rate</b> by factors of 10 - 40 fold. The oxidation of norcarane by a manganese porphyrin coordinated with fluoride or hydroxide leads to the formation of significant amounts of radical rearranged products.

Hence, this paper presents the development of a sustainable lightweight wet-mix shotcrete by replacing natural coarse gravel with a kind of byproduct, nut shell (walnut). Fibers made from dumped polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were mixed in the composite to improve the properties of the lightweight wet-mix shotcrete. The initial evaluation of the fresh concrete mixed with different volume fraction of walnut shell was carried out in terms of its performance capacities of mechanical properties (i. e., tensile and compressive strength), pumpability and shootability (i. e., slump, pressure drop per meter and <b>rebound</b> <b>rate)</b> and the results were compared with plain concrete. With increase of walnut shell, compressive and splitting tensile strength of casting concrete decreased, while slump and pressure drop reduced slightly. Additionally, appropriate dosage of walnut shell can improve the shootability of fresh concrete with low <b>rebound</b> <b>rate</b> and larger build-up thickness. In the second series tests, polypropylene (PP) fiber and multi-dimension fiber were also mixed in composite for comparative analysis. After mixing fibers, the splitting tensile strength had obtained marked improvement with slight reduction of compressive strength, along with acceptable fluctuation in terms of pumpability and shootability. Furthermore, relation of density and compressive strength, relation of rebound and density, build-up thickness and relation of compressive and splitting tensile strength were discussed.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of treatment naive patients receiving entecavir monotherapy through Westmead Hospital was performed. Patients were excluded {{if they had}} received previous treatment with another nucleoside or nucleotide analogue, were pregnant or less than 18 years old. RESULTS: Out of 336 patients, 163 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Range of follow up was 3 - 46 mo (mean 26 mo). 134 patients (82. 2 %) had pre-treatment biopsies, with 26 patients (16. 0 %) demonstrating F 3 - 4 fibrosis. In total, 153 patients (93. 9 %) achieved at least Partial Virological Suppression (PVS), with 134 patients (82. 2 %) achieving complete virological suppression. The cumulative CVS and PVS rates at 36 mo were 82. 1 % and 96. 4 %, respectively. 3 patients (1. 8 %) failed to achieve PVS, while 5 patients (3. 0 %) developed virological rebound. 128 patients (78. 5 %) maintained CVS throughout follow up. Predictors of CVS included lower baseline DNA level (P = 0. 001), hepatitis B virus e antigen negative status (P = 0. 001) and increasing age at treatment (log rank 0. 001).
