40|$|It is {{suggested}} that a large deep underocean (or ice) neutrino detector, given the presence of significant numbers of neutrinos in the PeV energy range as predicted by various models of Active Galactic Nuclei, can make unique measurements of the properties of neutrinos. It {{will be possible to}} observe the existence of the tau neutrino, measure its mixing with other flavors, in fact test the mixing pattern for all three flavors based upon the mixing parameters suggested by the atmospheric and solar neutrino data, and measure the tau neutrino cross section. The key signature is the charged current tau neutrino interaction, which produces a double cascade, one at either end of a lightly <b>radiating</b> <b>track.</b> At a few PeV these cascades would be separated by roughly 100 m, and thus be easily resolvable in next generation DUMAND-like detectors. First examples might be found in detectors presently under construction. Future applications are precise neutrino astronomy and earth tomography.

30|$|Time delay {{estimation}} (TDE) is a {{basic problem}} in modern signal processing and it has found extensive applications such as localizing and <b>tracking</b> <b>radiating</b> sources in radar and sonar. Nowadays, the same technique is used to localize and track acoustic sources in room environments. For example, in automatic camera tracking for video conferencing [1, 2], {{the location of the}} current speaker is required for the camera to turn toward them; in speech enhancement [3, 4] using a steerable microphone array, the speaker location is required for noise cancellation.|$|R

Incorporated into the original workshop location was the first locomotive servicing area for Queensland Railways. In Queensland, major steam locomotive depots tended to be of two designs: a 2 ̆ 7 through shed 2 ̆ 7 arrangement (similar to the Mayne Depot); and a round turntable, with <b>tracks</b> <b>radiating</b> from a central point, such as the roundhouse found in Rockhampton and at the Ipswich Railway Workshops.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{means to}} reduce the component of railway rolling noise <b>radiated</b> by the <b>track</b> {{is to increase the}} damping of the rail. This increases the attenuation with distance of vibrations transmitted along the rail and thereby reduces the noise radiated. To achieve this, a tuned, damped mass-spring absorber system has been designed. To cover a wide range of frequencies, multiple tuning frequencies are used along with a material with a high damping loss factor. Suitable materials have been found from extensive tests on samples and prototypes of the damper have been built and tested, both in the laboratory and in the field. Results are very promising with reductions of the track component of noise of around 6 dB being measured...|$|R
30|$|Time delay {{estimation}} {{has been}} a research topic of significant practical importance in many fields (radar, sonar, seismology, geophysics, ultrasonics, hands-free communications, etc.).

This area has made remarkable advances {{in the past few}} decades, and is continuing to progress, with an aim to create processors that are tolerant to both noise and reverberation. This paper presents a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art of time-delay-estimation algorithms ranging from the simple cross-correlation method to the advanced blind channel identification based techniques. We discuss {{the pros and cons of}} each individual algorithm, and outline their inherent relationships. We also provide experimental results to illustrate their performance differences in room acoustic environments where reverberation and noise are commonly encountered.|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{trafficking}} {{from the}} endoplasmic reticulture (ER) to the Golgi complex is mediated by pleiomorphic carrier vesicles that are driven along microtubule tracks by {{the action of}} motor proteins. Here we describe how NSP 4, a rotavirus membrane glycoprotein, binds to microtubules and blocks ER-to-Golgi trafficking in vivo. NSP 4 accumulates in a post-ER, microtubule-associated membrane compartment and prevents targeting of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) at a pre-Golgi step. NSP 4 also redistributes β-COP and ERGIC 53, markers of a vesicular compartment that dynamically cycles between the ER and Golgi, to structures aligned along linear <b>tracks</b> <b>radiating</b> throughout the cytoplasm. This block in membrane trafficking is released when microtubules are depolymerized with nocodazole, indicating that vesicles containing NSP 4 are tethered to the microtubule cytoskeleton. Disruption of microtubule-mediated membrane transport by a viral glycoprotein may represent a novel pathogenic mechanism and provides a new experimental tool for the dissection of early steps in exocytic transport. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
60|$|Had Bellew {{discovered}} {{one or two}} tracks made by men of {{the forest}} like himself, his knowledge of wood-craft would have enabled him at once to decide which way they had come and whither they had gone; but, {{with at least a}} dozen meandering <b>tracks</b> <b>radiating</b> from the ship in all directions, as well towards the sea as the land, he felt himself puzzled. He knew well enough that they were too fresh to be those of the wrecked crew, unless indeed the crew had remained by the ship; but in that case there would have been evidences of an encampment of some sort, such as fittings-up on board, or huts on shore. He followed the tracks that led to the sea and found that they terminated abruptly, as if those who had made them had plunged into the water and drowned themselves. Before following up those that went landward he returned to the ship and clambered on board, but found nothing to reward him for his pains. The sea had swept the hold fore and aft so completely that nothing whatever was left.|$|R
50|$|On October 14, 1890 Sherman {{founded the}} Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway in Downtown Los Angeles. He {{received}} a 50-year franchise {{from the city}} and sold stock to help build his street car railroad. In January, 1891 Sherman made is brother-in-law, Eli P. Clark, vice-president and manager of the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway, the predecessor of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. The company built 47 miles of <b>track</b> <b>radiating</b> out around from Arcade Depot at 6th and Central Streets in downtown Los Angeles. The new company did well. The power for the street cars came from two Thompson-Corliss type oil steam engines, each with 700 horsepower, made by Golden State Miners’ Iron Works in San Francisco. Joseph W. Wolfskill sold a lot to the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway for the Arcade Depot. In 1899 the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway became part of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, as steam trains and other rail lines were added to the system. Gen. Sherman purchased land that became the town the bears his name: Sherman Oaks, his land deals made him more money than his railroading.|$|R

[...] Tiny Mix Tapes described the album's music as [...] "both ambient yet thrashing, melodic yet <b>radiating,</b> with standout <b>tracks</b> like [...] "untitled 02" [...] and [...] "untitled 07" [...] fully exhibiting Lamar’s vertiginous flows and adept ear for exciting, tuneful, next-level rap production." [...] The Chicago Tribune also observed the [...] "soul, spoken word and avant-garde music that permeated Butterfly," [...] noting that [...] "the tracks favor upright bass, skittering drums and horn textures as much as loops and samples while Lamar employs a range of vocalists, from SZA and CeeLo Green to augment his typically dense, diamond-hard rhymes." [...] Lyrically, the release furthers Lamar's exploration of psychological and politically-charged ideas, with references to spirituality and race featured throughout. Drowned in Sound also noted the thematic interplay between sexuality and oppression present in the release.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{types of}} rail damper are now commercially {{available}} to reduce noise <b>radiated</b> by railway <b>track.</b> These dampers, {{attached to the}} rail between sleepers, increase the attenuation with distance of vibration transmitted along the rail (decay rate). Currently, there are no standardized procedures to measure {{the effectiveness of these}} dampers without the need for their installation in a track. Track decay rates of damped freely supported rails have been measured using two proposed methods: (i) for short rails (4 - 6 m length), at low frequency from the modal properties of the rail, and at high frequencies directly from point and transfer response functions (FRFs) {{at either end of the}} rail; and (ii) for long rails (15 - 32 m), by integrating decay rates derived from FRFs measured at intervals along the rail. Results from four test institutes show generally good agreement between the two methods for three different damper designs. However, at some frequencies substantial inter- and intra- method variability is evident. Sources of this variability are identified and are discussed. Further tests conducted on a 32 m test track show that decay rates of damped track can be reasonably determined by summing decay rates of the free damped rail and those of the undamped track...|$|R
