5|$|The mould Penicillium roqueforti {{contributes}} {{the blue}} coloration {{and much of}} the flavour in blue cheeses such as <b>Roquefort</b> and Stilton. Mould fungi are processed to produce vegetarian meat substitutes such as Quorn.|$|E
5|$|Dairy {{products}} such as milk, butter, ghee, yoghurt, buttermilk and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle, though the milk of sheep, goat, yak, and buffalo is also used {{in some parts of}} the world and for gourmet products. For example, buffalo milk is used to make mozzarella in Italy and gulab jamun dessert in India, while sheep milk is used to make blue <b>Roquefort</b> cheese in France.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or <b>Roquefort,</b> {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including <b>Roquefort</b> and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, {{for a number of years}} in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the <b>Roquefort</b> produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.|$|E

25|$|In 1941, Bedaux {{experimented with}} a political-economic system {{of his own}} invention, Equivalism, in <b>Roquefort,</b> Vichy France. Recent {{research}} has shown that the experiments amounted to tinkering which locals hardly noticed.|$|E
25|$|Several {{restaurants}} serve local specialities, notably aligot, farçous, tripoux, and <b>Roquefort,</b> Laguiole, and Cantal cheeses, {{as well as}} {{red wine}} from the nearby village of Marcillac. Fouace is a breakfast item, a sweet bread {{that can be found}} in many local bakeries.|$|E
25|$|Parmigiano is also {{particularly}} high in glutamate, containing {{as much as}} 1.2g of glutamate per 100g of cheese, making it the naturally produced food with the second highest level of glutamate, after <b>Roquefort</b> cheese. The high concentration of glutamate explains the strong umami taste of Parmigiano.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{countries}} {{blamed the}} US and the EU for stagnated negotiations since both maintain protectionist policies in agriculture. While generally favoring free trade, Bush has also occasionally supported protectionist measures, notably the 2002 United States steel tariff {{early in his}} term. Bush also implemented a 300% tax on <b>Roquefort</b> cheese from France in retaliation for a European Union ban on hormone-treated beef common in the American beef industry.|$|E
25|$|The major {{industrial}} {{use of this}} fungus is the production of blue cheeses, flavouring agents, antifungals, polysaccharides, proteases and other enzymes. The fungus has been a constituent of <b>Roquefort,</b> Stilton, Danish blue, Cabrales, Gorgonzola and other blue cheeses that humans {{are known to have}} eaten since approximately AD 50; blue cheese is mentioned in literature as far back as AD 79, when Pliny the Elder remarked upon its rich flavour.|$|E
25|$|Foods such as Gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano, feta, the Waterford blaas, Herve cheese, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Piave cheese, Asiago cheese, camembert, Herefordshire cider, cognac, {{armagnac}} {{and champagne}} {{can only be}} labelled as such if {{they come from the}} designated region. To qualify as <b>roquefort,</b> for example, cheese must be made from milk of a certain breed of sheep, and matured in the natural caves near the town of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon in the Aveyron region of France, where it is colonised by the fungus Penicillium roqueforti that grows in these caves.|$|E
25|$|French cuisine {{is renowned}} for {{being one of}} the finest in the world. According to the regions, {{traditional}} recipes are different, the North of the country prefers to use butter as the preferred fat for cooking, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South. Moreover, each region of France has iconic traditional specialities: Cassoulet in the Southwest, Choucroute in Alsace, Quiche in the Lorraine region, Beef bourguignon in the Bourgogne, provençal Tapenade, etc. France's most renowned products are wines, including Champagne, Bordeaux, Bourgogne, and Beaujolais as well as a large variety of different cheeses, such as Camembert, <b>Roquefort</b> and Brie. There are more than 400 different varieties.|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or <b>Roquefort).</b> In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1370, John was sent with a small army to Aquitaine to {{reinforce}} his ailing elder brother, the Black Prince, {{and his younger brother}} Edmund of Langley, Earl of Cambridge. With them, he participated in the Siege of Limoges (September 1370). He took charge of the siege operations and at one point engaging in hand-to-hand fighting in the undermining tunnels. After this event, the Black Prince surrendered his lordship of Aquitaine and sailed for England, leaving John in charge. Though he attempted to defend the duchy against French encroachment for nearly a year, lack of resources and money meant he could do little but husband what small territory the English still controlled, and he resigned the command in September 1371 and returned to England. Just before leaving Aquitaine, he married the Infanta Constance of Castile on September 1371 at <b>Roquefort,</b> near Bordeaux, Guyenne. The following year he took part with his father, Edward III, in an abortive attempt to invade France with a large army, which was frustrated by three months of unfavourable winds.|$|E
500|$|This region also {{produces}} milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized ewe's milk {{is used to}} produce the <b>Roquefort</b> in Aveyron, while [...] in Laguiole is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The Salers cattle produce quality milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well. Cabécou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy. [...] This area {{is one of the}} region’s oldest milk producers; it has chalky soil, marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats.|$|E
500|$|Restaurants {{are popular}} in the area known as Le Midi. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the {{restaurants}} of Bouzigues, Meze, and Sète. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of Sète, Bourride, Tielles and Rouille de seiche. In the Languedoc [...] jambon cru, sometimes known as jambon de montagne is produced. High quality <b>Roquefort</b> comes from the brebis (sheep) on the Larzac plateau. The Les Cévennes area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, pâtés and goat cheeses. [...] Catalan influence {{can be seen in}} the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a purée of dried cod wrapped in mangold leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific Catalan style known as a cargolade. Wild boar can be found in the more mountainous regions of the Midi.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} The University of Texas at Austin, Mansfield won several beauty contests, including Miss Photoflash, Miss Magnesium Lamp, and Miss Fire Prevention Week. The only title {{she refused}} was Miss <b>Roquefort</b> Cheese, because she believed it [...] "...just didn't sound right." [...] Mansfield accepted a bit {{part in a}} B-grade film titled Prehistoric Women (produced by Alliance Productions, alternatively titled The Virgin Goddess) in 1950. In 1952, while in Dallas, she and Paul Mansfield participated in small local-theater productions of The Slaves of Demon Rum and Ten Nights in a Barroom, and Anything Goes in Camp Gordon, Georgia. After Paul Mansfield left for military service, Mansfield first appeared on stage in a production of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman on October 22, 1953, with the players of the Knox Street Theater, headed by Lumet.|$|E
500|$|Though sheep's milk may {{be drunk}} rarely in fresh form, {{today it is}} used {{predominantly}} in cheese and yogurt making. Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content. [...] Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, <b>Roquefort</b> of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk. Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin. Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU, Canada agrees [...] "to protect 143 {{geographical}} indications for high-quality European products, such as <b>Roquefort</b> cheese, balsamic vinegar from Modena or Dutch Gouda cheese and many others." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{industrial}} {{use of this}} species is the production of blue cheeses, such as its namesake <b>Roquefort,</b> Bleu de Bresse, Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage, Brebiblu, Cabrales, Cambozola (Blue Brie), Cashel Blue, Danish blue, Fourme d'Ambert, Fourme de Montbrison, Lanark Blue, Shropshire Blue and Stilton, and some varieties of Bleu d'Auvergne and Gorgonzola. [...] (Other blue cheeses, including Bleu de Gex and Rochebaron, use Penicillium glaucum.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{extension}} of protection for geographical indications is somewhat controversial because a geographical indication {{may have been}} registered as a trademark elsewhere. For example, if [...] "Parma Ham" [...] {{was part of a}} trademark registered in Canada by a Canadian manufacturer, ham manufacturers in Parma, Italy might be unable to use this name in Canada. Wines (such as Bordeaux, Port and Champagne), cheeses (such as <b>Roquefort,</b> Parmesan, and Feta), Pisco liquor, and Scotch whisky are examples of geographical indications.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Rogers was {{involved}} in research on cheese, including Swiss, cheddar, and <b>Roquefort.</b> He set off for the International Dairy Congress in Italy. In 1936 the Borden Company {{announced that it would}} provide cash awards and gold medals for [...] "meritorious work in science as it is related to the dairy industry." [...] Two recipients were selected for the first prizes: Lore A. Rogers of the USDA and Carl F. Huffman of Michigan State University.

2500|$|Vidal-Naquet {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{scholars}} to deconstruct historical revisionism, notably in The Assassins of Memory and Reflexions on Genocide. He was also opposed to the 23 February 2005 French law on colonialism passed by the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), but which was finally repealed by president Jacques Chirac in the beginning of 2006. Vidal-Naquet also criticized the 1990 Gayssot Act which prohibits revisionist discourse, claiming that the law shouldn’t interfere in historical matters. Vidal-Naquet’s arguments against legislation relating to historical studies is not, however, a door opened to revisionist speech. He once declared that he would rather name revisionists “negationists”, and that he wouldn’t engage with them for “simple and scientific reasons. An astronomer doesn’t debate with an astrologer. I wouldn’t discuss with someone who supports the idea that the moon is made of <b>Roquefort</b> ... it is impossible.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{restaurant}} {{continued to}} improve {{through the late}} 1970s and into the early 1980s.

In 1979, Washington Post restaurant reviewer Lon Tuck noted that Old Ebbitt's Omelet Room was one of the most famous locations in the city. Its trademark omelets were the [...] "Old Ebbitt" [...] (made with sharp cheddar cheese and Bermuda onions) and another made with chili and served with a garden salad with <b>Roquefort</b> blue cheese dressing. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler observed in 1981 that its signature dishes included chili, blue cheese and Welsh rarebit hamburgers, quiche Lorraine, a Reuben sandwich, and steaks. Its crab cakes were poorly reviewed as too bland and heavy with bread. It was one of the few dining places in the city to stay open until 1:00 A.M.|$|E
2500|$|Lore Alford Rogers (7 February 1875 - 21 March 1975) was an American {{bacteriologist}} {{and dairy}} scientist.

His head ached with the rattle and suffocation of the train, and he knew hers must ache more. The windows of the compartment and the door were all closed, the litigious little commercial traveller in shiny grey had insisted upon that, there was no corner seat either for Marjorie or himself, the dim big package over her head swayed threateningly. The green shade over the light kept opening with the vibration of the train, the pallid old gentleman with the beard had twisted himself into a ghastly resemblance to a broken-necked corpse, and pressed his knees hard and stiffly against Trafford, and the small, sniffing, bow-legged little boy beside the rusty widow woman in the corner smelt mysteriously and penetratingly of <b>Roquefort</b> cheese. For the seventeenth time the little commercial traveller jumped up with an unbecoming expletive, and pulled the shade over the light, and the silent {{young man in the}} fourth corner stirred and readjusted his legs.|$|E
