Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposals</b> for a heavy escort fighter (Tyazholyy Istrebitel' Soprovozhdeniya) {{was received}} at the Polikarpov OKB in November 1938, but {{the press of}} work with the I-180 and SPB prototypes prevented any significant design work until {{the third quarter of}} 1940. Mikhail Yangel was appointed head designer, but his job was complicated by multiple changes {{in the role of the}} aircraft from escort fighter to interceptor, dive bomber, and eventually reconnaissance.|$|E

In the decade that followed, AT erected new buildings across the country including the AT Building in New York City. April 5, 1985, AT issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposals</b> that produced eleven respondents. Stein and Co., the winning realtor, sought Skidmore, Owings and Merrill as designers {{for the purpose of}} distinguishing a proposal from the nearby Willis Tower.

5|$|President Richard Nixon {{reestablished}} the AMSA {{program after}} taking office, keeping with his administration's flexible response strategy {{that required a}} broad range of options short of general nuclear war. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A. This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposals</b> in November 1969.|$|E

A <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposals</b> (RFP) was issued in December 1982 for preliminary design work. Interest was expressed by Aérospatiale, Bell Helicopter, Boeing Vertol, Grumman, Lockheed, and Westland. Contractors were encouraged to form teams.

Being the only proposal received, a preliminary design contract was awarded on 26 April 1983.|$|E
5|$|Winning the {{contract}} to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF {{would be a huge}} boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal as soon as the <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Proposals</b> (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.|$|E
5|$|In February 2002, the US Marine Corps {{commenced}} a {{study to}} identify potential replacement rotorcraft for the aging Sikorsky VH-3D presidential transport helicopters. On 18 December 2003, the United States Department of Defense issued a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Proposals</b> (RFP) for the supply of 23 helicopters {{to be used as}} a replacement for the 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns of the Marine Corps' HMX-1 squadron, which performs the role of Presidential helicopter transportation; this requirement was given the designation of VXX, or the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program. Two companies, AgustaWestland and Sikorsky Aircraft responded to the VXX RFP; additionally, that had been interest in a potential Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey-based bid, however the rotorcraft was deemed to be non-transportable by military airlift and thus unsuitable to qualify.|$|E
