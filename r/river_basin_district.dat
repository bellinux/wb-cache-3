With the register in place, the number and extent of international <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>Districts</b> could be determined. The results show that the number and area of international districts are significant.

Further, a case study elucidating the connections between international cooperation and water quality in 14 international <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> in the Baltic Sea Drainage Basin is presented. The case study tries to connect indicators of cooperation with indicators influencing or describing water quality. The results show that the WFD is a push forward for international <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> management in the region.

40|$|In {{this report}} we propose a {{classification}} of <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>districts</b> (RBDs) {{in terms of}} the consistency between reported significant pressures and pressures expected to be relevant in each RBD on the basis of pan-European indicators. We discuss the results and limitations of the classification obtained at European scale, and we suggest a perspective for its use for improving Water Framework Directive (WFD) implementation and the subsequent in-depth analysis of programmes of measures (PoMs) and their effectiveness. Overall, the analysis highlights that some <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>districts</b> report pressures {{in a way that is}} in line with expectations from European indicators, while some others report either higher or lower pressure intensity than expected. Reasons for these discrepancies may include lack of relevant local information in the assessment of European indicators, and under/overestimation of pressures by the RBD authorities or reporting member states.

In each <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>District,</b> broad reference groups are established. Through surveys and qualitative case studies, we examine how this norm of participation is operationalized in the River Basin Districts, and how different actors evaluate it.

40|$|Luciobarbus guiraonis (Eastern Iberian barbel) is an endemic {{fish species}} {{restricted}} to Spain, mainly {{distributed in the}} Júcar <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>District.</b> Its study is important because there is little knowledge about its biology and ecology. To improve the knowledge about the species distribution and habitat requirements, nonlinear modelling was carried out to predict the presence/absence and density of the Eastern Iberian barbel, based on 155 sampling sites distributed throughout the Júcar <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>District</b> (Eastern Iberian Peninsula). In this case study, we used multilayer feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN) to represent nonlinear relationships between L. guiraonis descriptors with biological and habitat variables. The gradient descent algorithm was implemented to find the optimal model parameters {{and the importance of}} the ANN's input variables was determined by the partial derivatives method (PaD). The predictive power of the model was evaluated with the Cohen's Kappa (k), the correctly classified instances (CCI), and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots. The presence/absence of L. guiraonis was predicted by the ANN model with a high performance (k= 0. 66, CCI= 87 % and AUC= 0. 85); the prediction of density was moderate (CCI = 62 %, AUC= 0. 71 and k= 0. 43). The most significant variables that described the presence/absence were: solar radiation (its highest contribution was observed between 2000 and 4200 WH/m 2), drainage area (with the strongest influence between 3000 and 5. 000 km 2), and proportion of exotic fish species (with relevant contribution between 50 and 100 %). In the density model, the most important variables were coefficient of variation of mean annual flows (relative importance of 50. 5 %) and proportion of exotic fish species (24. 4 %), but the partial derivative method was unable to identify a positive or negative relationship between these variables and fish density. The models provide important information about the relation of L. guiraonis with biotic and abiotic variables, this new knowledge could be used to support future studies and practical decisions about the management and conservation of this species in the Júcar <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>District,</b> and potentially for the conservation of other endemic fish species of Barbus and Luciobarbus in Mediterranean rivers...|$|E
40|$|The European Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000 / 60 /EC) was {{incorporated}} into the Swedish legislation in 2004 through the ordinance Förordningen om förvaltningenav kvaliteten på vattenmiljön (SFS 2004 : 660). The objective is that all water bodies shall reach a good status by the year 2015. In Sweden the comprehensive plans of the municipalities can play {{a large role in}} reaching these goals. A comprehensive plan deals with the long term water and land use of the municipality, which can facilitate an early consideration of water management in the planning process of the municipality. In Sweden five river basin districts have been established in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. The focus of this study is on the Northern Baltic Sea <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>district.</b> Action strategies have been created for each <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>district,</b> dictating what measures the authorities, among them the municipalities, need to take. The purpose with this study is to find out to what extent the municipalities have taken the action strategies regarding the Northern Baltic Sea river basin and the water quality standards set in Förordningen om förvaltningen av kvaliteten på vattenmiljön (SFS 2004 : 660) into account when working with their comprehensive plans. The study also sheds light on the municipalities’ view on the demands made on them and what actions can facilitate the working process. The study was made in three parts; a survey, literature studies and interviews. An overall study of all the municipalities in the county of Stockholm was made and three were selected for an in-depth study. The results of the study show that the demands on the municipalities have not been met due to lack of knowledge. The municipalities are aware of the existence of the Water Framework Directive but find it hard to interpret the environmental quality standards and the action strategies. The municipalities wish for a clearer legal definition of the environmental quality standards and a better definition of how the implementation of the action strategies can be made.
