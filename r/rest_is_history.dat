40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{dynamics}} of a model frictional system submitted to minute external perturba-tions. The system consists of a chain of sliders connected through elastic springs that rest on an incline. By introducing cyclic expansions and contractions of the rest length of the springs, we induce the reptation of the chain. Decreasing the amplitude of the perturbation below a critical value, we observe an intermittent creep regime characterized by alternated periods of reptation (flowing state) and rest (quiescent state). A further decrease of the perturbation leads to {{the disappearance of the}} reptation. The width of the transi-tion region between the continuous creep and the full stop (i. e., the range of excitation amplitudes where the intermittent creep is observed) is shown to depend on the difference between the static (µs) and the dynamic (µ d) friction coefficients. For µs = µ d the intermittent creep is not observed. Studying the statis-tical features of the intermittent creep regime for any given perturbation amplitude, we find that the time the system resides in each state (flowing or quiescent) suggests that: (i) reptation events are uncorrelated, and (ii) <b>rest</b> events <b>are</b> <b>history</b> dependent. We show that this latter <b>history</b> dependency <b>is</b> consistent with the aging of the stress state inside the chain of sliders during the quiescent periods.

Or does he intend, as Nietzsche later does, to elevate strength to an ethical constant, where â€“ according to how it is unanimously received at any rate â€“ it is understood not only as a structuring principle, but also as an intrinsically moral value? I think not. He is referring, rather, to the relationship that exists between morality â€“ indeed that goes beyond it: ethics as discourse â€“ and the power relationships in society, power or might. It concerns a relationship that ethical speech very effectively conceals, since ethics supposedly seeks ways to resolve retributively the conflicts that arise from the power relationships. "Moral values are what those in power consider to be good because they have good use for them; this they then laud as being good for everyoneâ€: this is what the sophist from Chalcedon means, albeit using a different wording...|$|R
