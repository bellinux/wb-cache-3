25|$|In {{deciding}} on {{what type of}} vine training system to use, growers will also consider the climate conditions of the vineyard where the amount of sunlight, humidity and wind could have a large impact on the exact benefits the training system offers. For instance, while having a large spread out canopy (such as what the Geneva Double Curtain offers) can promote a favorable leaf to fruit ratio for photosynthesis, it offers very little wind protection. In places such as the Châteauneuf-du-Pape, strong prevailing winds such as le mistral can take the fruit <b>right</b> <b>off</b> the vine so a more condensed, protective vine training system is desirable for vineyards there.|$|E

25|$|When the Blonds' time in Los Angeles ended {{near the}} end of 1975, they {{returned}} to the Tri State promotion and immediately targeted the United States Tag Team championship. On March 18, 1976, the duo defeated Greg Valentine and Gorgeous George, Jr. Due to disputes over pay and billing the Blonds’ time in Tri State was short lived, they quickly dropped the tag team title to Buck Robley and Bob Slaughter only eleven days after they won them. The Blonds next appeared in CWF once more, winning the Florida Tag Team titles from Steve Keirn and Bob Backlund not long after arriving in the territory. Just like with Tri State, their stay in Florida was short, as they dropped the titles to Mike Graham and Ken Lucas only a few months later and left. After a short stay in Florida, the duo began working for Jim Crockett’s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). On January 17, 1977, Roberts and Brown defeated the team of Dino Bravo and Tim Woods for the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship and held on to it for three months until Bravo and new partner Tiger Conway Jr. beat them for the gold. During the summer of 1977, the Hollywood Blonds moved from Mid-Atlantic to Memphis and the NWA Mid-America promotion (later Continental Wrestling Association, CWA). In Memphis, the Blonds shot up the tag team ranks <b>right</b> <b>off</b> the bat defeating Bob Ellis and Jim Garvin for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on July 25.

500|$|While {{recognized}} {{primarily as}} a playmaker leading up to his NHL career, Kariya was forced into shooting more as the Mighty Ducks lacked scorers {{in his first two}} seasons with the team. During his third NHL season, he commented that, [...] "If Teemu [...] had been here <b>right</b> <b>off</b> the bat, then maybe I wouldn't have focused so much on shooting." [...] Kariya was able to put many shots on goal due to his quick release. In 1998–99, he led the League with 429 shots on goal, which at the time was the second-highest recorded total in NHL history. Nonetheless maintaining his passing ability, Kariya was particularly adept at making plays from deep in the offensive zone and beside the opposing team's net.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool's {{rivalry with}} Manchester United {{is viewed as}} a manifestation of the cities' {{competition}} during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. The two clubs alternated as champions between 1964 and 1967, and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in 1968, followed by Liverpool's four European Cup victories. Despite the 38 league titles and eight European Cups between them the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time– Liverpool's run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester United's 26-year title drought, and United's success in the Premier League-era has likewise coincided with Liverpool's ongoing drought, and the two clubs have finished first and second in the league only five times. Nonetheless, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, [...] "My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool <b>right</b> <b>off</b> their fucking perch", and the last player to be transferred between the two clubs was Phil Chisnall, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.|$|E

Mark asks Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt), who also recalls Ann's infatuation with Justin.

Realizing her behavior was inappropriate, Ann sets Leslie up on a date with Justin.|$|E
