They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans {{to make him a}} Catholic priest; he rather settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E

While performing the study, Saffir <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring {{the utility of the}} Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E

5|$|Writing for American Humor, {{academic}} Robert G. Pielke {{observed that}} the sketch was a very well-done, and moving, reflection on NBC management's fealty to Nielsen ratings and profit. Pielke went on to analyze the sketch and characterized it {{as an example of}} Saturday Night Live resisting conformist authority. He commented that an injustice had been wrought by NBC the company, whereas the NBC executives who came to shut down Star Trek were simply pawns in the process. He posited that the U.S.S. Enterprise crew members were against cancelling the television program because their self-worth had become tied to it. Pielke noted that {{within the confines of the}} sketch's plot itself, as each crew member <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no option other than cancellation, they each showed their actual identity and humanity.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to survival, the early colonists {{were expected to}} make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.|$|E
25|$|The Republican administrations of President Richard Nixon (1969–74) and Gerald Ford (1974–77) were {{characterized}} by their emphasis on détente and on economic intervention through wage and price controls. Ford angered conservatives by continuing Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State and pushing his policy of détente with the Soviet Union. Conservatives finally found a new champion in Ronald Reagan, whose 8 years as governor of California had just ended in 1976, and supported his campaign for the Republican nomination. Ford narrowly won renomination but lost the White House. Following major gains by Democratic liberals in the 1974 midterm election, Jimmy Carter was elected as President. Carter proved too liberal for his fellow Southern Baptists, (as they voted for him in 1976 but not 1980), too conservative for the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and many considered his foreign policy a failure. Carter <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a strong national sense of malaise, as inflation skyrocketed, interest rates soared, the economy stagnated, and prolonged humiliation resulted when Islamic militants in Tehran kept American diplomats hostage for 444 days in 1979–81.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Lois Pope, {{widow of}} National Enquirer owner Generoso Pope Jr., met a {{disabled}} American veteran at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no memorial {{in the city}} which honored disabled veterans. Although {{she did not know}} him, Pope called the office of United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown to plead for a memorial. Pope called every day for the next six months, until finally Brown's secretary put her call through. Brown agreed to support legislation establishing a memorial. Because the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 (P.L. 99-625) barred the expenditure of federal funds for memorials, a foundation needed to be established to oversee private fundraising. Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson, the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), an organization founded in 1920 to assist disabled veterans. The DAV was itself not a nonprofit, and thus Pope and Wilson agreed that a new foundation, the Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial Foundation (DVLMF; also known as the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation) should be created. Brown (who left office in 1997), Pope, and Wilson incorporated the foundation in 1998, and Wilson was named its president.|$|E

25|$|Some representatives mistrusted {{proposals}} to enlarge federal powers, {{because they were}} concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially argued that a bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that the federal government could never raise a standing army powerful enough to overcome a militia. Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed populace would have no trouble resisting the potential threat to liberty of a standing army. Anti-federalists, on the other hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification. The Constitution was declared ratified on June 21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for ratification. James Madison drafted what ultimately became the Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June 8, 1789, and was adopted on December 15, 1791.|$|E

For instance, we wanted to let the mission {{briefing}} scene play normally—this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target. That scene was followed by a scene of the target beheading a local. We realized that an actual briefing is very technical and rote, so intercutting these scenes helped keep the audience engaged." ...|$|E

Harding opposed entry into the League of Nations as negotiated by Wilson, but favored an [...] "association of nations", based on the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. This was general enough to satisfy most Republicans, and only a few bolted the party over this issue.

Doctors diagnosed his problems, which were not organic, and referred him to see the proper specialists. He claims to have had no recollection of leaving Florida, nor what he had done during his five months in Charlotte. When asked, he stated that, [...] "It was like someone switching off a light and then switching it back on." [...] Cook's story has been told through different media.

500|$|By late 1924, Mint {{officials}} <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a problem}} with the quarter in circulation. [...] Quarters were returning to the Mint with the date completely worn off. [...] Unwilling to seek another act of Congress, Mint officials made the step on which the date appears recessed into the design, rather than raised from it. [...] This change solved the problem; quarters from 1925 and after are more common and cheaper in lower grades as they have survived with their dates intact. [...] This action was among the last acts of the Engraver's Department under Morgan, who died on January 4, 1925 and was succeeded by John R. Sinnock. [...] The modification meant that the 1927-S, with a mintage of 396,000 is much cheaper in circulated grades than the 1923-S, with a mintage of 1,360,000, though the 1927-S is more expensive in uncirculated grades.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, John William Fenton, {{a visiting}} Irish {{military}} band leader, <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no national anthem in Japan, and suggested to Iwao Ōyama, {{an officer of}} the Satsuma Clan, that one be created. Ōyama agreed, and selected the lyrics. The lyrics may have been chosen for their similarity to the British national anthem, due to Fenton's influence. After selecting the anthem's lyrics, Ōyama then asked Fenton to create the melody. After being given just two to three weeks to compose the melody and only a few days to rehearse, Fenton debuted the anthem before the Japanese Emperor in 1870. This was the first version of [...] "Kimigayo". This was discarded because the melody [...] "lacked solemnity", according to the Japanese government although others believe it is because the melody was actually [...] "unsingable" [...] for the Japanese. However, this version is still performed annually at the Myōkōji temple in Yokohama, where Fenton served as a military band leader. Myōkōji serves as a memorial to him.|$|E

500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals {{are the key to}} her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs [...] "straight," [...] but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did." [...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using.

500|$|The band's {{follow-up}} single, [...] "Get Me to the World on Time", {{which put}} distorted sound effects to a psychedelic-tinged Bo Diddley beat, {{was released in}} May 1967. The song managed to chart at number 27 in the US and number 42 in the UK, and was the most electronically experimental composition by the group thus far. When {{it came time for}} The Electric Prunes to record songs for their first album, they were limited musically due to the predominate presence of Tucker and Mantz's (also Jill Jones) songwriting partnership, which composed the majority of the album's material. The group's debut album, The Electric Prunes possessed exotically-combined effects, and violin-like guitar riffs, mixed with a diverse, and somewhat uneven, selection of pop songs, with only [...] "Train For Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Luvin'" [...] being penned by the band. Tracks such as the soft rock tune, [...] "Onie" [...] and [...] "Toonerville Trolley" [...] suggest inconsistency in an attempt to produce a commercially viable sound. Reflecting on the album, Tulin said, [...] "Consequently there are definitely songs that I believe do not belong on the album and were, in fact, a waste of our time and energy. There were several other ideas we were working on, but [...] <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no use pursuing them because they too would have been 'too weird.'" ...|$|E
