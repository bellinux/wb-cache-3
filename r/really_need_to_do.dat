The weeds were probably of only six weeks' growth; and when they got so high that he actually could not find his tanias {115b} among them, he would take cutlass and hoe, and make a lazy raid upon them, or rather upon a quarter of them, certain of two facts; that in six weeks more they would be all as high as ever; and that if they were, it did not matter; for so fertile is the soil, so genial the climate, that he would get in spite of them more crop off the ground than he needed. 'Pity the poor weeds. Is there not room enough in the world for them and for us?' seems the Negro's motto.

The primary objective of the program was to provide an interactive orientation experience, utilizing the creative talents of existing students from the faculty. Twenty-five student leaders undertook to develop specific activities for commencing students that were program and course specific. An unintended consequence of the program was the extent to which early social relationships emerged between commencing students as an outcome of these shared experiences. A discussion of the program, its development and preliminary evaluation, provides an opportunity for critically evaluating the extent to which we seek to create increasingly sophisticated informational orientation experiences for commencing students and whether all we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to provide "Speed Dating and Lollipops "...|$|E
40|$|I am {{interested}} in studying the complexity of mathematical practice. In mathematics, as we all know, some structures are more complicated than others, some constructions more complicated than others, and some proofs more complicated than others. I {{am interested}} in understanding how to measure this complexity and in measuring it. The motivations for this come from different areas. Form a foundational viewpoint, {{we want to know}} what assumptions we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> mathematics (ZF C is way much more than we usually use), and we are also interested in knowing what assumptions are used in the different areas of mathematics. Form a computational viewpoint, it is important to know what part of mathematics can be done by mechanical algorithms, and, even for the part that can’t be done mechanically, we want to know how constructive are the objects we deal with. Furthermore, it is sometimes the case that this computational analysis allows us to find connections between constructions in different areas of mathematics, and in many cases to obtain a deeper understanding of mathematical objects being analyzed. My work is quite diverse in terms of the techniques I have used, the approaches I have taken, and the areas of mathematics that I have analyzed.

40|$|As I {{near the}} {{completion}} of my undergraduate degree in Architecture, I am often asked if architecture is my future. I typically reply, "I don't know," and then continue with, "what I <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is design and build something — {{no bigger than a}} shed, and I think that will be the litmus test for my future as an architect or designer. " I sense the need to move from 1 / 8 " = 1 '- 0 " to 1 " = 1 ". The full-scale world is all I am concerned with. It is a world that was utterly neglected in my studies as an architecture student. Last autumn, alongside my Dad and a family friend, I helped assemble a Sears backyard shed that came as a kit of parts waiting to be formed into floors, walls and a roof. This particular kit of parts must have sat in our garage for over a year, but the pieces went up willingly enough, as it was only daylong project. Having followed the directions and making sure the end result looked as the diagrams indicated, we assumed we now had a shed to last. But, Kalamazoo — where my parents reside — is accustomed to regular snowfall in the winter months. The Sears shed must not have been designed for such regular snowfall, because within three months of assembling the shed, nature disassembled it, collapsing the roof {{under the weight of the}} snow. My opportunity had arrived. The following is a log documenting the construction of a new backyard shed. For most, a humble project; for me, a project infused with sentiment and introspection, concepts of beauty and ethics, and a chance to turn from a critic to a creator. Oh, to most who ever see this shed it will appear as nothing more than any familiar organization of brick and metal, a proper orientation of walls and a roof - nothing to even mark a memory in one's mind.
