50|$|This is a {{fundamental}} result in rigidity theory: one consequence of the theorem is that, if one makes a physical model of a convex polyhedron by connecting together <b>rigid</b> <b>plates</b> {{for each of the}} polyhedron faces with flexible hinges along the polyhedron edges, then this ensemble of plates and hinges will necessarily form a rigid structure.|$|R

5000|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{states that the}} Earths crust {{is made up of}} <b>rigid</b> <b>plates</b> that [...] "float" [...] on top of the mantle and move relative to one another.

Intraplate deformation differs from that respect by the observation that deformation can occur anywhere the crust is weak and not just at plate margins.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{intimate}} coupling between {{the movement of}} the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between <b>rigid</b> <b>plates</b> moving {{on the surface of the}} Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.|$|R
