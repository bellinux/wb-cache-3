50|$|Like {{other ethnic}} groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Borana Oromo people {{regionally}} developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the Borana, below them were the Gabbaro (some 17th to 19th century Ethiopian texts <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> the dhalatta).

This indicates the prominence enjoyed by Halepaika during that time. To <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> [...] "old casters" [...] during that time should convey the fact that Halepaika formed one of the earliest martial settlers {{in this part of the}} country. This fact can be compared with another similar community in the region, the Komarapaiks, which means 'junior soldiers', in Kannada, and are said to have migrated during the 12th century.

40|$|As {{part of the}} LoanSTAR program, Stroman High School in Victoria Texas {{underwent}} two retrofits: a) an {{absorption chiller}} was changed to an electric vapor compression chiller, and b) an EMCS system was installed after about 5 months in the post retrofit period. Moreover, retrofit savings calculation was complex since pre-retrofit data consisted only of monthly utility data while hourly monitored data are available for the post-retrofit period. The retrofit savings in electricity and gas were computed by two different approaches: Unnormalized Utility Bill Comparison and Weather and Schedule Normalized Utility Bill Comparison Using Post-Retrofit Daily Models. (For purpose of simplicity, in this report, we will <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> Level- 0 and Level- 1, respectively.) This report describes these approaches and discusses how well the retrofit savings predicted by both approaches compare with each other.

40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of users in online systems is of essential importance for sociology, system design, e-commerce, and beyond. Most existing models assume that individuals in diverse systems, ranging from social networks to e-commerce platforms, tend to what is already popular. We propose a statistical time-aware framework to identify the users who differ from the usual behavior by being repeatedly and persistently {{among the first to}} collect the items that later become hugely popular. Since these users effectively discover future hits, we <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> discoverers. We use the proposed framework to demonstrate that discoverers are present {{in a wide range of}} real systems. Once identified, discoverers can be used to predict the future success of new items. We finally introduce a simple network model which reproduces the discovery patterns observed in the real data. Our results open the door to quantitative study of detailed temporal patterns in social systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{recursive}} forward dynamics algorithm (RFDA) for a tree structured rigid multibody {{system has}} two stages. In the first stage, while {{going down the}} tree, certain equations are associated with each node. These equations are decoupled from the equations related to the node’s descendants. We <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> the equations of RFDA of the node and the current paper derives them in a new way. In the new derivation, associated with each node, we recursively obtain he coordinates, which describe the system consisting of the node and all its descendants. The special property of these coordinates is that {{a portion of the}} equations of motion with respect to these coordinates is actually the equations of RFDA associated with the node. We first show the derivation for a two noded system and then extend to a general tree structure. Two examples are used to illustrate the derivation. While the derivation conclusively shows that equations of RFDA are part of equations of motion, it most importantly gives the associated coordinates and the left out portion of the equations of motion. These are significant insights into the RFDA...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented in this report has been to develop a numerical method for the investigation of water-lubricated soft elastohydrodynamic (EHD) conjunctions {{as it relates to}} the problem of car tyre aquaplaning. Whereas the problem of aquaplaning on very thick water films is very well-studied, the aspects of a tyre sliding on thin water layer is much less investigated. Considering fluid flow in very thin layers, one can find that the relative importance of viscosity of the fluid increases over the mass inertia effects. Therefore it is suggested in the present investigation to distinct between two different regimes of aquaplaning and <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> dynamic aquaplaning and viscous aquaplaning. The subject of the present investigation is viscous aquaplaning on thin fluid layer. Considering flow in a thin fluid layer allows a number assumptions to be made, which brings this problem close to the problem of fluid lubrication of machine elements. This makes it possible to apply advanced numerical methods originally developed for the lubrication theory to the aquaplaning of a pneumatic car tyre on a thin layer of water. Numerical results were produced for 20, 40, 60, 120, and 200 km/h. No fluid films were detected separating the surfaces in this range of velocities...|$|E
40|$|Wireless ad hoc networks, {{wireless}} mesh {{networks and}} {{wireless sensor networks}} have {{been the focus of}} recent research due to their potential applications in civilian and military environments such as disaster recovery, battlefield, group conference, and intelligent transportation. In such networks, nodes communicate with each other using multi-hop wireless links. Due to lack of any infrastructure support, each node acts as a relay, forwarding data packets for others. Although there are differences (e. g., data transmission speed, link and physical layer characteristics) among these networks, they have many common features: they are based on wireless communication, and the packets are transmitted through multi-hop relay; Also, applications in these networks are typically peer-to-peer rather than client-server. Due to these common features, we <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> wireless P 2 P networks. Most of the previous research in wireless P 2 P networks focuses on the development of dynamic routing protocols that can efficiently find routes between two communicating nodes. Although routing is an important issue, other issues such as information (data) access are also very important since the ultimate goal of using wireless P 2 P networks is to provide information access to the users. We use the following example to motivate our research on data access in wireless P 2 P networks. In a battlefield, a wireless P 2 P network may consist of several commanding officers and a group of soldiers around the officers. Each officer has a relatively powerfu...|$|E
40|$|Last time {{we talked}} about disk access model (as known as DAM, or {{external}} memory model). Our goal is to minimize I/Os, where {{we assume that the}} size of the disk is unbounded, while the memory is bounded and has size M. In particular, the memory is divided into MB pages, each of which is a block of size B. Today {{we are going to continue}} trying to minimize I/Os, but we are going to look at a new model called cache-oblivious model introduced in [FLPR 99] (you can also refer to the survey [Dem 02] for more detail). The new model is similar to DAM, but with two differences (we further <b>refer</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> two assumptions) : 1. Algorithms are not allowed to know M or B. 2. Algorithms do not control cache replacement policy. Operating system handles cache replace-ment, and we assume it makes optimal choices. (So in our analysis, we assume that we evict what we want to evict.) Why do we have cache-oblivious model? First, it makes programs easily portable across different machines. You do not have to find parameters in your code for a specific machine. Note that the block size B is chosen to amortize against the expensive cost of seeking on the disk. In really, B is not fixed, because even on a given disk, there are multiple levels of memory hierarchy (L 1 /L 2 cache...|$|E
