Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain <b>raiser</b> by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E

On 6-7 occasions this made fund <b>raisers</b> angry, but nonetheless, King asserts that the goods and services that the funds were raised for were provided to the fund <b>raisers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Years later, due to Betances' {{experience}} as a logistics facilitator of armed revolts, a fund <b>raiser</b> for the Cuban independence cause, and as a diplomat, José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France. Betances never met Martí personally, but Martí did know Betances' younger sister, Eduviges, who lived in New York City and shared her brother's revolutionary ideals. Martí assisted her financially in her final days, out of admiration for the Betances' family. Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí. Soon after, Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895, an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma to {{the leadership of the}} Cuban insurrection movement.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury has two rugby union clubs, Toc H R.F.C. and Old Bedians. Toc H, {{founded in}} 1924, plays at Simons Fields, on Ford Lane. Its first team {{plays in the}} North Lancashire and Cumbria league. The club runs four senior teams and a youth section, and has run a 10-a-side {{competition}} every May since 1951, as a charity fund <b>raiser</b> for local hospices. Old Bedians is based in East Didbury, and was founded in 1954. It regularly fields three senior teams {{as well as a}} junior section. Desmond Pastore, believed to be the oldest rugby player in the world, was a founder member of the club, and later became its president. Formerly a player for Sale and Cheshire, Desmond played his last game for Manchester club Egor on his 91st birthday.

5|$|Wills' unmarked gravesite was {{restored}} in 1980 with a headstone erected by the MCC and by public subscription. He {{was inducted into}} the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1989 and was made an inaugural member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996. The Tom Wills Room in the MCG's Great Southern Stand serves as a venue for corporate functions. A statue outside the MCG, sculpted by Louis Laumen and erected in 2001, depicts Wills umpiring the famous 1858 football match between Melbourne Grammar and Scotch College. The AFL commemorated the 150th anniversary of the match by staging the Tom Wills Round during the 2008 AFL Season. The two schools played in a curtain <b>raiser</b> at the MCG ahead of the round opener between Melbourne and Geelong. That same year, Victoria's busiest freeway interchange, the Monash–EastLink interchange in Dandenong North, was named the Tom Wills Interchange. Tom Wills Oval, inaugurated in 2013 at Sydney Olympic Park, serves as the training base for the Greater Western Sydney Giants of the AFL.|$|E
40|$|Pigs are {{intermediate}} {{hosts and}} potential reservoirs {{of a number}} of pathogens that can infect humans. The objectives of this manuscript are to understand pig raising patterns in Bangladesh, interactions between pigs and humans, social stigma and discrimination that pig <b>raisers</b> experience and to explore the implications of these findings for public health interventions. The study team conducted an exploratory qualitative study by interviewing backyard pig <b>raisers</b> and nomadic herders (n = 34), observing daily interactions between pigs and humans (n = 18) and drawing seasonal diagrams (n = 6) with herders to understand the reasons for movement of nomadic herds. Pig <b>raisers</b> had regular close interaction with pigs. They often touched, caressed and fed their pigs which exposed them to pigs' saliva and feces. Herders took their pigs close to human settlements for scavenging. Other domestic animals and poultry shared food and sleeping and scavenging places with pigs. Since pigs are taboo in Islam, a majority of Muslims rejected pig raising and stigmatized pig <b>raisers.</b> This study identified several potential ways for pigs to transmit infectious agents to humans in Bangladesh. Poverty and stigmatization of pig <b>raisers</b> make it difficult to implement health interventions {{to reduce the risk of}} such transmissions. Interventions that offer social support to reduce stigma and highlight economic benefits of disease control might interest of pig <b>raisers</b> in accepting interventions targeting pig borne zoonoses...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} that pig <b>raisers</b> in Bangladesh have with their pigs {{could increase the}} risk of zoonotic disease transmission. Since raising pigs is a cultural taboo to Muslims, we aimed at understanding the motivation for raising pigs and resulting practices that could pose the risk of transmitting disease from pigs to humans in Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim country. These understandings could help identify acceptable strategies {{to reduce the risk of}} disease transmission from pigs to people. To achieve this objective, we conducted 34 in-depth interviews among pig herders and backyard pig <b>raisers</b> in eight districts of Bangladesh. Informants explained that pig raising is an old tradition, embedded in cultural and religious beliefs and practices, the primary livelihood of pig herders, and a supplemental income of backyard pig <b>raisers.</b> To secure additional income, pig <b>raisers</b> sell feces, liver, bile, and other pig parts often used as traditional medicine. Pig <b>raisers</b> have limited economic ability to change the current practices that may put them at risk of exposure to diseases from their pigs. An intervention that improves their financial situation and reduces the risk of zoonotic disease may be of interest to pig <b>raisers.</b> CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United StatesU 01 CI 000298 /CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States 5 -U 01 -CI 000298 - 03 /CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 12 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26122206 PMC 469691...|$|R

In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4–0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona would endure a slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3–0) on {{the opening day of}} the season; they would go on to be defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows Hércules. Nevertheless, Barça would recover and go on to magnificent 5–0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0–2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1–1 draw, sending Barça through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1–0. Barça, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to win them the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 {{for the third time in}} a row to round off a very successful season.|$|E
