40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{balancing}} dc and ac {{resistance ratio}} bridges {{are the primary}} measurement devices used by National Measurement Institutes for the calibration of standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90). Performance assessment of these resistance ratio bridges {{is critical to the}} determination of both the uncertainties of the measurements and for identifying if a <b>resistance</b> <b>bridge</b> is exhibiting noncompliant behavior.

Additionally, the possible effects from using different ac frequencies were investigated.

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of interference from non-ideal laboratory environment on the resistance-bridge operation. Interference can be either the result of thermal emf, electromagnetically induced voltage or harmonic distortion of the power supply voltage. Interference is manifested as the increased measurement dispersion or even as non-negligible change in the measured resistance. Thermal emf is the voltage generated by the temperature gradients on junctions of different metals. Resistance bridges are cancelling this effect by using either alternating current or DC current reversal. Electromagnetic interference is air transmitted interference that generates induced voltage in the thermometer, connecting cables and/or bridge circuits. This effect results not only in unstable bridge operation and increased noise, but can also produce an offset in bridge readings. Ideally, AC power supply voltage would be pure sine with constant frequency, phase and amplitude, but in practice it is often distorted. Higher order harmonics and/or subharmonics may interfere with the bridge operation. Experiments with interference sources were conducted on the DC <b>resistance</b> <b>bridge</b> MI 6010 and the AC <b>resistance</b> <b>bridge</b> ASL F 900. The results were compared and advantages and not only disadvantages of AC and DC principle were outlined, but also some practical recommendations for the reduction of interference are given based on practical observations and experiments...|$|E

Tested were four multi-meter type instruments which use the UI method to determine resistance and three resistance bridges that measure resistance as a ratio between a resistance thermometer and a standard resistor. The device {{used to measure the}} nonlinearity of the instruments was a RBC 100 <b>resistance</b> <b>bridge</b> calibrator. The device is a passive four resistor matrix that enables for 35 different resistances to be generated by parallel/series switching of the four base resistors. The device had been previously automated for easier use [6]. This eliminates the need for an operator to be present during calibration, the device can also be placed in an thermally stable enclosure and switched from within it. The software that was purposely developed for the automated work with the RBC 100 controls both the calibrator as well as gathers measurements from the instrument under test. The software also calculates non-linearity and keeps record of the measurements that were performed. During testing, two rounds of measurement sets were performed. During each round 3 sets of all 35 combinations were measured on every instrument under test. The multimeter type instruments nonlinearity was measured to be far lower than the declared uncertainty. The linearities of the resistance bridges were in most cases equal to the declared uncertainty value. This was however to be expected, since bridge nonlinearity accounts for the major part of its uncertainty.

However, high-accuracy resistance thermometer systems are often needed in many industrial applications, where measurement performances comparable to resistance bridges are often needed {{at a lower}} cost and size. A tiny, portable, ratiometric front-end exploiting a 24 -bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with Σ Δ modulator is described. It was designed to measure the resistance ratio between a 100 Ω industrial PRT (IPRT) and a reference resistor with repeatability to within a few parts in 106. Its small size makes it ideal for integration in the stem-handle assembly of a thermometric probe, enabling an early transmission of measurement data in digital form.

As a one-dimensional material with tubular structure, the high thermal conductivity and high aspect ratio of CNT is beneficial to improve the heat transfer of polymer composites, and the most important is that CNT could provide more paths for the phonon transport and bridge the rGO and explosives [16].

The excitation voltage does not alter this, as it affects both sides equally. When the bridge is operating off null, the excitation’s magnitude sets output sensitivity. The bridge output is nonlinear for a single variable resistor. Similarly, two variable arms (e. g., RC and RB both variable) produce nonlinear output, although sensitivity doubles.
