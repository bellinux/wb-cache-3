Catherine {{came from a}} wealthy Protestant family and brought with her a dowry of £2,000, but also a religious association that offered Robert some <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> recusancy laws then in effect. From {{the death of his}} grandmother the following year he inherited a property at Chastleton, in Oxfordshire. The couple's first son William died in infancy, but their second son Robert survived, and was baptised at Chastleton's Protestant church on 11November 1595. When Catesby's father died in 1598, his estates at Ashby St Ledgers were left to his wife, while Catesby and his family remained at Chastleton. Catesby had seemed happy to remain a Church Papist but after his wife's death later that year he became radicalised, and reverted to a more fanatical Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> isolation and anxiety.|$|E
50|$|Regarding the style, {{a critic}} noted that much like Forge of Darkness, Fall of Light {{is written in}} Shakespearean style and tone, {{although}} there are more elements of comic relief and <b>respites</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> darkness in this one compared to the first.|$|R
5000|$|... “One of <b>the</b> few <b>respites</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{cycle of}} {{propaganda}} and exercise was the occasional visit of singers and dancers {{brought in to}} perform for troops before they headed to war - a heightened experience for these groups of agitated, isolated young men. In the series of satirical paintings “The Day before I went Away” (2008), Guo Jian offers impressions of how young woman were positioned by the army in these covertly erotic performances to manipulate the soldiers {{to the point of}} sexual hysteria and blood lust.” ...|$|R
50|$|The title character, Ralph Snart, is a Walter Mitty {{type who}} {{frequently}} escapes the painful realities {{of his life}} by daydreaming himself into incredible and often bizarre adventures. As the series progresses, his real life becomes as strange as his daydreams until {{there is not much}} to differentiate the two states. For this reason, his brain is sought by the arch-villain, Dr. Goot. Ralph's insanity takes the form of delusional fantasies, mostly consisting of drinking beer, that provide sub-plot <b>respites</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main plot: Dr. Goot's eternal quest to use Ralph's brain for his own evil ends.|$|R
25|$|KR and {{his wife}} were among the {{relatively}} few Romanovs on intimate terms with Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra, who found KR's devotion to his family a welcome <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> playboy lifestyle of many of the other Grand Dukes.|$|E
25|$|The {{peaks of}} Mount Tamalpais loom above redwood-shaded canyons and rugged grass-covered hills of Marin. Its highest point, east peak, is 2,571-feet. During the late 19th Century, Marin County was less {{regarded}} {{as a source of}} lumber, and a place of natural beauty and <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> densely populated areas just south across the San Francisco Bay.|$|E
25|$|This {{friendship}} was advantageous for the Jewish {{community and}} gave them a <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oppressive laws enacted against them. Later kings reversed Shapur's policy of religious tolerance. Under pressure from Zoroastrian Magi and influenced by the high-priest Kartir, Bahram I killed Mani and persecuted his followers. Bahram II was, like his father, amenable to {{the wishes of the}} Zoroastrian priesthood. During his reign, the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Romans under Emperor Carus, and most of Armenia, after half a century of Persian rule, was ceded to Diocletian.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> figure {{is likely to}} be below the 100,000 Jews who had not yet converted to Christianity by 1492, possibly as low as 40,000.

25|$|Early December {{brought a}} period of cold settled weather to the UK, which offered some <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flooding. On 14 December, low {{pressure}} area Nicki brought coastal flooding along the south coast of England and eastern Scotland. Weymouth harbourside was flooded, and 30 homes in Looe were also flooded. Some residents in the Scottish towns of Stonehaven and Peterhead were evacuated. In Kingsbridge, Devon the town centre was flooded after the quay was overtopped and the railway line to Dawlish was disrupted after flooding. £500,000 of damage was caused at North Berwick, Lothian by the waves, with a 15m section of harbour wall brought down in Lossiemouth.|$|E
25|$|In 1704 at Damdama Sahib, {{during a}} one-year <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heavy {{fighting}} with Aurangzeb which the Khalsa {{was engaged in}} at the time, Guru Gobind Singh and Bhai Mani Singh added the religious compositions of Guru Tegh Bahadur to Adi Granth to create a definitive compilation.

His banis are found in the Sri Dasam Granth, they are part in the daily prayers of Sikhs During this period, Bhai Mani Singh also collected Guru Gobind Singh's religious writings, as well as his court poems, and included them in a secondary religious volume, today known as the Dasam Granth Sahib.|$|E
25|$|Ingle was a well-liked captain, {{according}} to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on {{well with the}} limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely easy, because the county rarely had {{more than half a}} dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches. Ingle himself missed some games most seasons because of chronic hay fever which, {{according to}} Foot, he maintained was made worse by long train journeys: he told Foot that he would travel in the luggage rack to get some sleep and some <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dust.|$|E
2500|$|Illicit liquor sales brought racketeering, violence, {{and houses}} of prostitution. Intervention {{by the state}} police was not welcomed by Mayor Miles B. Kitts, who went to Harrisburg and testified before well-publicized {{hearings}} conducted by Pennsylvania Governor William C. Sproul. But the actions of local and state law enforcement and the governor's hearings offered only a brief <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> all <b>the</b> excitement.

5000|$|Whitney Pastorek, {{reviewing}} the album for Entertainment Weekly, gave the album a B- rating. She {{referred to the}} duets as [...] "a welcome <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> all <b>the</b> noodling", but said that as a whole, the album was [...] "an indulgence he's earned but doesn't quite pull off." [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau picked out one song <b>from</b> <b>the</b> album, [...] "Waitin' on a Woman", as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) , calling it [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money".|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the treaty}} with the Ayyubids was set to expire in 1239. Plans for a new crusade to be led by Frederick came to nothing, and Frederick himself was excommunicated by Gregory IX again in 1239. However, other European nobles took up the cause, {{including}} Theobald IV, Count of Champagne and King of Navarre, Peter of Dreux, and Amaury VI of Montfort, who arrived in Acre in September 1239. Theobald was elected leader of the crusade at a council in Acre, attended by {{the most of the}} important nobles of the kingdom, including Walter of Brienne, John of Arsuf, and Balian of Sidon. The arrival of the crusade was a brief <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lombard War; Filangieri remained in Tyre and did not participate. The council decided to refortify Ascalon in the south and attack Damascus in the north.|$|E
500|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club notes Russo {{seems to}} employ vices without restraint, {{which is a}} <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other {{exacting}} characters in the episode and a makes him a sort of metaphor for the show.

500|$|During {{the treaty}} negotiations, two Protestant mediators—Han Bruno of Metz and Johannes Sturm—were {{concerned}} that Henry's war in Scotland was a stumbling block. The sixteenth article {{of the treaty}} made Scotland {{a party to the}} new peace, and Henry pledged not to attack the Scots again without cause.

50|$|By {{the time}} of Ysaÿe's second stay in Paris around 1885, he had prided himself on having written several polonaises, mazurkas, and concertos without ever having taken harmony and musical {{composition}} lessons. He never stopped composing, even when {{his career as a}} traveling virtuoso gave him <b>respite.</b> However, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1890s on, Ysaÿe reflected on his youthful compositions and felt that they were devoid of any originality or value.|$|R

Dr. Cliff Arnall gauged the third Monday of January to be the most depressing day using a formula based on weather, holiday debt, and failed resolutions. The exception to Arnall’s formula involves engineers with children in kindergarten through eighth grade.

50|$|The word picnic first {{appeared}} in English in a letter of the Gallicized Lord Chesterfield in 1748 (OED), who associates it with card-playing, drinking and conversation, and may have entered <b>the</b> English language <b>from</b> this French word. The practice of an elegant meal eaten out-of-doors, rather than an agricultural worker's dinner in a field, was connected with <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> hunting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages; the excuse for the pleasurable outing of 1723 in François Lemoyne's painting (illustration, left) is still offered {{in the context of}} a hunt.|$|R
500|$|The third act's {{tranquil}} beginning {{provides a}} brief <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> drama. An introductory 16-bar {{theme for the}} horns will later be sung by Cavaradossi and Tosca in their final duet. The orchestral prelude which follows portrays the Roman dawn; the pastoral aura is accentuated by the shepherd boy's song, {{and the sounds of}} sheep bells and church bells, the authenticity of the latter validated by Puccini's early morning visits to Rome. Themes reminiscent of Scarpia, Tosca and Cavaradossi emerge in the music, which changes tone as the drama resumes with Cavaradossi's entrance, to an orchestral statement of what becomes the melody of his aria [...] "E lucevan le stelle".|$|E
500|$|The annual Oldham Carnival started around 1900, {{although}} {{the tradition of}} carnivals in the town goes back much further, providing a [...] "welcomed <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tedium of everyday life". The carnival parade was always held in mid-to-late summer, with the primary aim of raising money for charities. It often featured local dignitaries or popular entertainers, in addition to brass, military and jazz bands, the Carnival Queen, people in fancy dress, dancers and decorated floats from local churches and businesses. Whenever possible, local people who had attained national celebrity status were {{invited to join the}} cavalcade. The carnival's route began in the town centre, wound its way along King Street, and ended with a party in Alexandra Park.|$|E
500|$|Altitude {{affects the}} {{temperature}} {{to a large}} extent, with higher parts of the Deccan Plateau and other areas being relatively cooler. Hill stations, such as Ootacamund ("Ooty") in the Western Ghats and Kalimpong in the eastern Himalayas, with average maximum temperatures of around , offer some <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heat. At lower elevations, in parts of northern and western India, a strong, hot, and dry wind known as the loo blows in from the west during the daytime; with very high temperatures, in some cases up to around it can cause fatal cases of sunstroke. Tornadoes may also occur, concentrated in a corridor stretching from northeastern India towards Pakistan. They are rare, however; only several dozen have been reported since 1835.|$|E
50|$|In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted {{proceedings}} {{against the}} Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.

500|$|The Millennium Park rink has a lobby which {{provides}} skaters a <b>respite</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> natural environs, {{as well as}} toilets and public lockers. [...] During the 2003–04 season the rink rented 77,667 pairs of ice skates. By 2009–2010, its ninth season, it was attracting more than 100,000 skaters a year. While availability of the rink depends on the weather, {{it also has a}} state-of-the-art chiller system that can maintain the ice in the event of unseasonably warm weather. Thus, temperature is not the only factor involved in decisions to close the rink. In his review of the plaza and rink, Kamin gave it two stars (out of a possible four), called the structure [...] "solid, though unremarkable", and praised its uses throughout the year.|$|E
60|$|The lower casements of {{the houses}} were {{furnished}} with mirrors set {{at right angles with}} them, and nothing which went on in the streets was lost. Some of the streets were long and straight, and at rare moments they lay full of sun.

Once a man with his hands pinioned before him, and a gendarme marching stolidly after him with his musket on his shoulder, passed under their windows; but who he was, or what he, had done, or was to suffer, they never knew. Another time a pair went by {{on the way to the}} railway station: a young man carrying an umbrella under his arm, and a very decent-looking old woman lugging a heavy carpet bag, who left them to the lasting question whether she was the young man's servant in her best clothes, or merely his mother.|$|R

Although the Baroness and Billy utilize the Castle's secret passages to evade capture, they are thwarted by Destro himself. After being tortured for a time, Billy is ready to crack, and the Baroness does her best to keep him together. But Billy turns on his cellmate, ratting her out for trying to escape.
