40|$|The existence, nature, {{and causes}} of a 2 ̆ 2 crisis 2 ̆ 2 {{in the market}} for property-casualty {{insurance}} in the United States remain the subject of extensive debate. Two alarming features of current markets, unaffordability and unavailability, are cited as evidence that something is amiss. Premiums charged for several lines of property-casualty insurance coverage have soared over the past several years. Stories detailing two to three hundred percent rate increases for daycare centers, five thousand percent increases for asbestos <b>removal</b> <b>firms,</b> and fifty to one hundred percent increases for medical malpractice coverage for obstetricians have become commonplace. Yet, if higher premiums were the only remarkable characteristic of the current crisis, {{it would be difficult to}} differentiate these developments from many other instances of rapid price inflation that have occurred in insurance and other businesses over the last decade. The most worrisome feature of present difficulties in property-casualty insurance is the current unavailability of certain liability insurance products, regardless of the premium offered for their purchase. Liability coverages that are currently almost unavailable from property-casualty insurers include policies that protect against environmental pollution and certain lines of coverage that insure governmental units against citizen suits for failure to provide protective services such as police protection, roadway maintenance, or traffic signals...|$|R

40|$|Variation in the {{terminology}} {{used to describe}} clinical management of carious lesions has contributed {{to a lack of}} clarity in the scientific literature and beyond. In this article, the International Caries Consensus Collaboration presents 1) issues around terminology, a scoping review of current words used in the literature for caries removal techniques, and 2) agreed terms and definitions, explaining how these were decided. Dental cariesis the name of the disease, and thecarious lesionis the consequence and manifestation of the disease-the signs or symptoms of the disease. The termdental caries managementshould be limited to situations involving control of the disease through preventive and noninvasive means at a patient level, whereascarious lesion managementcontrols the disease symptoms at the tooth level. While {{it is not possible to}} directly relate the visual appearance of carious lesions' clinical manifestations to the histopathology, we have based {{the terminology}} around the clinical consequences of disease (soft, leathery, firm, and hard dentine). Approaches to carious tissue removal are defined: 1) selective removal of carious tissue-includingselective removal to soft dentineandselective <b>removal</b> to <b>firm</b> dentine; 2) stepwise removal-including stage 1,selective removal to soft dentine, and stage 2,selective <b>removal</b> to <b>firm</b> dentine 6 to 12 mo later; and 3) nonselective removal to hard dentine-formerly known ascomplete caries removal(technique no longer recommended).

40|$|The International Caries Consensus Collaboration (ICCC) {{presented}} {{recommendations on}} terminology, on carious tissue removal and on managing cavitated carious lesions. It identified 'dental caries' {{as the name}} of the disease that dentists should manage, and the importance of controlling the activity of existing cavitated lesions to preserve hard tissues, maintain pulp sensibility and retain functional teeth in the long term. The ICCC recommended the level of hardness (soft, leathery, firm, and hard dentine) as the criterion for determining the clinical consequences of the disease and defined new strategies for carious tissue removal: 1) Selective removal of carious tissue - including selective removal to soft dentine and selective <b>removal</b> to <b>firm</b> dentine; 2) stepwise removal - including stage 1, selective removal to soft dentine, and stage 2, selective <b>removal</b> to <b>firm</b> dentine 6 to 12 months later; and 3) non-selective removal to hard dentine - formerly known as complete caries removal (a traditional approach no longer recommended). Adoption of these terms will facilitate improved understanding and communication among researchers, within dental educators and the wider clinical dentistry community. Controlling the disease in cavitated carious lesions should be attempted using methods which are aimed at biofilm removal or control first. Only when cavitated carious dentine lesions are either non-cleansable or can no longer be sealed, are restorative interventions indicated. Carious tissue is removed purely to create conditions for long-lasting restorations. Bacterially contaminated or demineralised tissues close to the pulp {{do not need to be}} removed. The evidence and, therefore these recommendations, supports minimally invasive carious lesion management, delaying entry to, and slowing down, the destructive restorative cycle by preserving tooth tissue, maintaining pulp sensibility and retaining the functional tooth-restoration complex long-term...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theory {{to study the}} political economy of CEO longevity by examining how agreement between the board and the CEO over the value-maximizing choice of project-investment action influences the length of CEO tenure and who succeeds the CEO. A key element of the analysis is that the CEO’s entrenchment, rather than being taken as exoge-nously given, is endogenously determined in equilibrium by a tradeoff between the probability of CEO <b>removal</b> and <b>firm</b> value; higher entrenchment diminishes the probability of the CEO being removed and decreases firm value. The bright side of board-CEO agreement is that higher agreement causes the CEO to entrench less, leading to a higher firm value ex ante. However, the dark side of this agreement is that higher agreement also shields the CEO more from being fired upon bad performance ex post. Moreover, CEOs with higher agreement with their boards {{are more likely to be}} succeeded by insiders upon their departures. I find strong empirical support for these predictions of my model. This study also casts doubt on the valid-ity of using CEO longevity as an empirical measure for managerial entrenchment, as has been routinely done in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The International Caries Consensus Collaboration {{undertook}} a consensus process and here presents clinical recommendations for carious tissue removal and managing cavitated carious lesions, including restoration, based on texture of demineralized dentine. Dentists should manage the disease dental caries and control activity of existing cavitated lesions to preserve hard tissues and retain teeth long-term. Entering the restorative cycle {{should be avoided}} as far as possible. Controlling the disease in cavitated carious lesions should be attempted using methods which are aimed at biofilm removal or control first. Only when cavitated carious lesions either are noncleansable or {{can no longer be}} sealed are restorative interventions indicated. When a restoration is indicated, the priorities are as follows: preserving healthy and remineralizable tissue, achieving a restorative seal, maintaining pulpal health, and maximizing restoration success. Carious tissue is removed purely to create conditions for long-lasting restorations. Bacterially contaminated or demineralized tissues close to the pulp {{do not need to be}} removed. In deeper lesions in teeth with sensible (vital) pulps, preserving pulpal health should be prioritized, while in shallow or moderately deep lesions, restoration longevity becomes more important. For teeth with shallow or moderately deep cavitated lesions, carious tissue removal is performed according toselective <b>removal</b> to <b>firm</b> dentine. In deep cavitated lesions in primary or permanent teeth,selective removal to soft dentineshould be performed, although in permanent teeth,stepwise removalis an option.

40|$|This paper compiles {{a set of}} stylized {{facts on}} the {{evolution}} of firm size and labor and total factor productivity distributions during the process of transition. These facts are based on the data for all Slovenian manufacturing firms active between 1994 and 2003. Stylized picture of transition can be summarized as follows. Initially, we can distinguish between two types of firms: small and on average more productive and large and on average less productive <b>firms.</b> <b>Removal</b> of institutional restrictions has spurred growth of small firms and entry of new firms on one hand and decline and exit of large firms on the other. These simultaneous shifts have transfirmed the shape of firm size distribution from bimodal into unimodal. While labor and total factor productivity distributions exhibit large right-hand shifts and lower heterogeneity over time, firm productivity rankings changed substantially. Smaller firms, which were initially more productive, exhibited lower productivity growth rates and thus gradually lost their advantage. Commonly held view of transition as a process of reallocation of resources from inefficient state to efficient private firms is at odds with our results of aggregate labor and total factor productivity decompositions. Almost half of aggregate labor productivity growth can be explained by within firm growth and the rest by reallocation. Our evidence suggests that within firm growth seems {{to be related to the}} process of technological catching up of less productivelarge firms. These stylized facts may give a wrong impression of transition being a detfirministic process, while it is not. The process is stochastic and thus similar to those found for established market economies. Hence theoretical models of transition should reflect detfirministic features that we outlined and preserve stochastic elements introduced in now standard models of industrial dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The recent wave of {{corporate}} fraud and scandals has raised concerns on {{the practices of}} protecting directors {{from the threat of}} removal. This study examines the association between protecting directors from removal and financial reporting quality. ^ Existing theories suggest two opposite effects on financial reporting quality when directors are protected from removal. Entrenchment theory argues that measures to protect directors from removal increase both managers 2 ̆ 7 motivations and opportunities to manipulate earnings, asserting a negative association between protection from removal and financial reporting quality. In contrast, alignment theory predicts a positive association between protecting directors from removal and financial reporting quality. ^ This study uses the existence of staggered boards as a proxy for directors 2 ̆ 7 protection from removal. By adopting three widely used measures of financial reporting quality (i. e., the occurrence of financial reporting fraud, the likelihood of financial statement misstatements, and earnings management), this study attempts to provide a complete picture of how protecting directors from removal affects financial reporting quality. ^ First, selecting fraud cases between 1995 and 2001 from the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases and using a matched-pair methodology, this study shows that fraud firms are less likely to have staggered boards that protect directors from <b>removal.</b> Next, selecting <b>firms</b> that misstated financial statements during 1995 - 2001 and using a matched-pair methodology, this study shows that firms without staggered boards are more likely to inflate reported earnings. Finally, focusing on the constituents in the S 2 ̆ 6 P 1, 500 for the period 1995 - 2001, this study shows that staggered boards are associated with lower levels of earnings management. The above results remain unchanged in various robustness tests. ^ Overall, the findings favor the alignment theory, which states that protecting directors from removal helps improve financial reporting quality. The findings can help resolve the debates on the merit of protecting directors from removal, point a way to improve financial reporting quality, and shed additional insights into the associations between corporate governance and financial reporting quality. ...|$|R
