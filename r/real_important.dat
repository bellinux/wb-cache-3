I'll be awful careful of it. I hope you won't catch the measles, for they are not nice, {{especially}} when they strike in, but you would look all right, even if you did have red spots on your face.

If I was you I would get the velvet hood all right. The heathen live in warm countries so they don't want hoods.|$|E

His hymns are born by a forceful and often Old Testamental wrath and renunciation of the world switching with Christian mildness and confidence.

His worldly poems and patriotic songs are often long-winded and marked by outer effects but in short version he is unequalled, as in his both plain and worthy commemorative poem of the naval hero Niels Juel.|$|E
