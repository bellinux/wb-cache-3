40|$|Special {{approaches}} {{unique to}} the waveband are required for the modelling of terahertz optical systems. Ray tracing is inadequate because in typical instruments the propagating beams are not very many wavelengths in diameter and a "quasi-optical" approach is required in which Fresnel diffraction effects can be efficiently and accurately simulated. Typically, it is also necessary {{to be able to}} simulate the coupling of quasi-optical beams to feed antenna structures to predict optical performance. In many systems the beams can be considered to be coherent and their propagation through a beam guide consisting of re-focussing elements can be efficiently modelled using modal analysis, especially useful for quick design purposes, beam control and optimisation. This modal approach has been extended to allow for aberrations and truncation particularly relevant in compact mirror based systems. At the same time physical optics, although computationally intensive, is also a useful tool when detailed analysis is required, particularly for providing crosspolarisation information and high accuracy far-field beam patterns from large <b>reflecting</b> <b>antennas,</b> for example. However, modal analysis in general is a very powerful tool, which enables one also to understand issues associated with throughput when partially coherent systems are being considered. This is important for the efficient optical modelling of large arrays systems now being developed for next generation astronomical instrumentation. In the presentation, we will discuss these issues and present examples from real instrumentation. We also summarise our continuing work on the development of computationally efficient modelling tools for fast quasi-optical design and analysis...|$|R

30|$|In 1998, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and ILC Dover, Inc. {{developed}} a 1 m diameter X-band planar membrane <b>reflect</b> array <b>antenna</b> [41], {{as shown in}} Figure  7 (a). The two-layer membrane was polyimide film with both sides clad with 0.5 µm thick copper. The frame was a circular inflatable tube, which was connected to a tripod supporting the antenna feed. In 2000, the two companies co-{{developed a}} 3 m Ka-band membrane <b>reflect</b> array <b>antenna</b> [42], as shown in Figure  7 (b). The horseshoe shaped frame consisted of one straight rigid tube, two straight tubes, and one semi-circular inflatable tube. The membrane could be rolled on the rigid tube to avoid creases. There were 16 catenary points distributed on the horseshoe shaped frame to apply stress on the membrane, and the surface flatness {{was measured to be}} ±  0.2 mm. In 2002, JPL proposed the idea of a “movie screen” membrane array antenna with a rectangular frame [44, 45], as shown in Figure  7 (c). The antenna feed was offset on the spacecraft, which eliminated the need for a feed-supporting tripod, resulting in a more compact structure. Two edges of the rectangular frame were inflatable tubes, and the other two edges were flat panels covered by roll-up shells, on which the membrane could be tightly rolled. Several cross bars, distributed uniformly on the membrane and employed as compression members to stretch the membrane, had no connection with the inflatable tubes. One constant force spring hung on each end of the cross bar and was connected to cables at the membrane edge. Similarly, some constant force springs hung on the flat panel and were connected to the cable. The membrane was deployed by the tubes inflating and was tensioned by constant force springs after deployment. From 2004 to 2008, JPL conducted a series of studies on “movie screen” antennas [46 – 48]. In 2008, a 2.2 m ×  2.2 m planar membrane antenna was developed and achieved a surface flatness of 0.17 mm.|$|R

50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that a high standing wave ratio (SWR) per se causes loss. A well-adjusted ATU feeding an antenna through a low-loss line may have {{only a small percentage}} of additional loss compared with an intrinsically matched antenna, even with a high SWR (4:1, for example). An ATU sitting beside the transmitter just re-reflects energy <b>reflected</b> from the <b>antenna</b> (“backlash current”) back yet again along the feedline to the antenna (“retro-reflection”). High losses arise from RF resistance in the feedline and antenna, and those multiple reflections due to high SWR cause feedline losses to be compounded.|$|R

This paper tests an alternative approach that can increase the reliability of the GPS system in structural monitoring by using the spectral content of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of GPS signals to detect frequencies of antenna vibrations. This approach suggests the potential of using SNR data analysis as a supplement to low-quality positioning solution or as a near real-time alert of excessive vibration proceeding the position solution calculation. Experiments, involving a GPS antenna subjected to vertical vibrations of 0. 4 - to 4. 5 -cm amplitude at a range of frequencies between 0. 007 and 1 Hz, examine the dynamic multipath-induced SNR response corresponding to the antenna motion.

The use of MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) protocols provides a possible solution for military nodes, {{including those in}} an airborne network. However MANET research has primarily focused on ground-based studies, using vehicular speeds {{and in many cases}} random mobility patterns. Nodes of an airborne network travel at speeds significantly faster than ground vehicles, and fly in coordinated paths not modeled by random mobility. In addition, the quality of the radio links for airborne nodes varies with time, due to interference, range, or antenna occlusion when banking. These characteristics make it impossible to extrapolate existing MANET research results to the airborne network. In this paper we present a simulation evaluation of MANET protocol performance for an airborne environment, with the intent to identify a routing protocol that can best deal with the dynamics of an airborne network. A scenario involving widebody aircraft trajectories was modeled in OPNET. Intermittent link outages due to aircraft banking were modeled by use of a notional radio link, antenna model, and modified OPNET source code that <b>reflects</b> positional <b>antenna</b> gain, including antenna occlusion when an aircraft banks.
