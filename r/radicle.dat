5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the <b>radicle</b> elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the <b>radicle</b> elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The <b>radicle</b> or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
25|$|Monocotyledonous {{plants have}} two {{additional}} {{structures in the}} form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a coleoptile that forms the first leaf while the <b>radicle</b> is covered with a coleorhiza that connects to the primary root and adventitious roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between <b>radicle</b> and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, <b>radicle,</b> coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and <b>radicle,</b> acting as a protective covering.|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{dehydration}} induces imbalanced metabolism before loss of membrane integrity in desiccation-sensitive germinated <b>radicles.</b> Using a photoacoustic detection system, responses of CO 2 emission and fermentation to drying were analyzed non-invasively in desiccation-tolerant and -intolerant <b>radicles</b> of cucumber (Cucumis sativa) and pea (Pisum sativum). Survival after drying and a membrane integrity assay showed that desiccation tolerance was present during early imbibition and lost in germinated <b>radicles.</b> However, tolerance could be re-induced in germinated cucumber <b>radicles</b> by incubation in polyethylene glycol before drying. Tolerant and polyethylene glycol (PEG) -induced tolerant <b>radicles</b> exhibited a much-reduced CO 2 production before dehydration compared with desiccation-sensitive <b>radicles.</b> This difference was maintained during dehydration. In desiccation-sensitive tissues, dehydration induced {{an increase in the}} emission of acetaldehyde and ethanol that peaked well before the loss of membrane integrity. Acetaldehyde emission from sensitive <b>radicles</b> was significantly reduced when dehydration occurred in 50 % O 2 instead of air. Acetaldehyde/ethanol were not detected in dehydrating tolerant <b>radicles</b> of either species or in polyethylene glycol-induced tolerant cucumber <b>radicles.</b> Thus, a balance between down-regulation of metabolism during drying and O 2 availability appears to be associated with desiccation tolerance. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, acetaldehyde was found to disturb the phase behavior of phospholipid vesicles, suggesting that the products resulting from imbalanced metabolism in seeds may aggravate membrane damage induced by dehydration...|$|R
40|$|This study {{establishes}} {{a relationship between}} desiccation tolerance and the transfer of amphiphilic molecules from the cytoplasm into lipids during drying, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of amphiphilic spin probes introduced into imbibed <b>radicles</b> of pea (Pisum sativum) and cucumber (Cucumis sativa) seeds. Survival following drying and a membrane integrity assay indicated that desiccation tolerance was present during early imbibition and lost in germinated <b>radicles.</b> In germinated cucumber <b>radicles,</b> desiccation tolerance could be re-induced by an incubation in polyethylene glycol (PEG) before drying. In desiccation-intolerant <b>radicles,</b> partitioning of spin probes into lipids during dehydration occurred at higher water contents compared with tolerant and PEG-induced tolerant <b>radicles.</b> The difference in partitioning behavior between desiccation-tolerant and -intolerant tissues could not {{be explained by the}} loss of water. Consequently, using a two-phase model system composed of sunflower or cucumber oil and water, physical properties of the aqueous solvent that may affect the partitioning of amphiphilic spin probes were investigated. A significant relationship was found between the partitioning of spin probes and the viscosity of the aqueous solvent. Moreover, in desiccation-sensitive <b>radicles,</b> the rise in cellular microviscosity during drying commenced at higher water contents compared with tolerant or PEG-induced tolerant <b>radicles,</b> suggesting that the microviscosity of the cytoplasm may control the partitioning behavior in dehydrating seeds...|$|R

In the laboratory, pre-screening of non-host or false-host plants of Striga for trap cropping or the screening of hosts for resistance involves visual evaluation of Striga seed germination that may be stimulated by plant parts or root exudates.

25|$|Seed {{germination}} is {{a process}} by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling. It involves the reactivation of the metabolic pathways that lead to growth {{and the emergence of}} the <b>radicle</b> or seed root and plumule or shoot. The emergence of the seedling above the soil surface is the next phase of the plant's growth and is called seedling establishment.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of growth is germination, a process which first becomes {{apparent}} as a seed's <b>radicle</b> emerges. This is the {{first stage of}} root growth and occurs within the first 48 hours under ideal growing conditions. The first photosynthetic structures, the cotyledons, develop from the hypocotyl, the first plant structure to emerge from the soil. These cotyledons both act as leaves and as a source of nutrients for the immature plant, providing the seedling nutrition for its first 7 to 10 days.|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal {{sections}} {{revealed that}} <b>radicles</b> of laboratory-grown slash (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) and loblolly (Pinus taeda L.) pine and lateral roots of naturally-grown and container-grown loblolly pine developed a rootcap that was 3 - 8 cell layers wide around the root proper {{at the level}} of the quiescent center and 8 - 32 cell layers from the quiescent center to the distal tip. Rootcap cells contained amyloplasts which were located mainly in the rootcap center and central columellar cells of the rootcap. Large amyloplasts were located in and around the rootcap center while small amyloplasts were found in other columellar cells. Amyloplast number per rootcap cell varied with pine species and with how seedlings were grown. There were fewer amyloplasts in <b>radicles</b> than in lateral roots. The spatial distribution of amyloplasts was similar between <b>radicles</b> and lateral roots and they were not found exclusively on the bottom of rootcap cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the dynamics of tocopherols in cotyledons and <b>radicles</b> from sunflower seeds with high and low total tocopherol content, mainly in the -tocopherol form, and from seeds with increased proportions of -, -, and -tocopherol, both under dark and light conditions. Tocopherol content was measured every 24 h from 1 to 12 days after sowing. In all cases, the content of individual tocopherol forms in the cotyledons and <b>radicles</b> was reduced along the sampling period, which was more pronounced under light conditions. The presence of light had a slightly greater effect on - and -tocopherol than on - and -tocopherol. A marked light effect was also observed on total tocopherol content, with light promoting the reduction of tocopherol content in cotyledons and <b>radicles.</b> The study revealed only slight differences in the patterns of tocopherol losses in lines with different tocopherol profiles, both under dark and light conditions, which suggested that the partial replacement of -tocopherol by other tocopherol forms had no great impact on the protection against oxidative damage in seedlings.

25|$|The part of {{the plant}} that first emerges from the seed is the {{embryonic}} root, termed the <b>radicle</b> or primary root. It allows the seedling to become anchored {{in the ground and}} start absorbing water. After the root absorbs water, an embryonic shoot emerges from the seed. This shoot comprises three main parts: the cotyledons (seed leaves), the section of shoot below the cotyledons (hypocotyl), and the section of shoot above the cotyledons (epicotyl). The way the shoot emerges differs among plant groups....|$|E
25|$|The first root {{that comes}} from a plant is called the <b>radicle.</b> A root's four major {{functions}} are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2) anchoring of the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, 3) storage of food and nutrients, 4) vegetative reproduction and competition with other plants. In response to the concentration of nutrients, roots also synthesise cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how fast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizae, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots.|$|E
500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that plant {{growth and development}} is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded [...] "It is hardly an {{exaggeration to say that}} the tip of the <b>radicle</b> [...] [...] acts like the brain of one of the lower animals [...] [...] directing the several movements". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.|$|E

2500|$|Morphophysiological {{dormancy}} includes seeds with underdeveloped embryos, {{and also}} have physiological components to dormancy. These seeds, therefore, require a dormancy-breaking treatments, {{as well as}} a period of time to develop fully grown embryos. Plant families where morphophysiological dormancy occurs include Apiaceae, Aquifoliaceae, Liliaceae, Magnoliaceae, Papaveraceae and Ranunculaceae. Some plants with morphophysiological dormancy, such as Asarum or Trillium species, have multiple types of dormancy, one affects <b>radicle</b> (root) growth, while the other affects plumule (shoot) growth. The terms [...] "double dormancy" [...] and [...] "two-year seeds" [...] are used for species whose seeds need two years to complete germination or at least two winters and one summer.

2500|$|Germination {{is usually}} {{the growth of a}} plant {{contained}} within a seed; it results {{in the formation of the}} seedling, it is also the process of reactivation of metabolic machinery of the seed resulting in the emergence of <b>radicle</b> and plumule.

Dormant seeds are ripe seeds that do not germinate because they are subject to external environmental conditions that prevent the initiation of metabolic processes and cell growth. Under proper conditions, the seed begins to germinate and the embryonic tissues resume growth, developing towards a seedling.|$|E
