40|$|The rise of <b>remedial</b> <b>gymnastics</b> [heilgymnastiek] In {{this article}} the {{introduction}} and {{further development of}} <b>remedial</b> <b>gymnastics</b> in the Netherlands from 1840 until about 1900 is described. In {{the second half of}} the 19 th century there was an increasing interest for the apphcation of <b>remedial</b> <b>gymnastics</b> as a form of conservative medical treatment. Contrary to what one would expect, it were not physicians but mostly physical education teachers who dedicated themselves to this kind of treatment. The activities of these so-called 'heilgymnasten' gradually gained recognition from the public and the physicians. The lack of a proper training school, research facilities and a forum for exchanging experiences forced the 'heilgymnasten' to raise the level of their skills and knowledge by themselves. During the eigthies, a period in which the process of differentiation and specialization in the field of medicine increased, conflicts between members of the medical profession and 'heilgymnasten' occurred more frequently. Some of the latter decided to form an organization that would look after their interests and would enable them to increase the professional level of the 'heilgymnasten'. On September ist 1889 the 'Society for practising <b>remedial</b> <b>gymnastics</b> in the Netherlands' [Genootschap ter beoefening van de Heilgymnastiek in Nederland] was founded. The main aims of its members were to establish a state exam, a public training school as well as to ensure proper legislation for this new profession. The founding of the Society lifted the controversy between physicians and 'heilgymnasten' from the level of a dispute between individuals to that of a battle over the domain between professional organizations. What was at stake was the autonomy in the field of <b>remedial</b> <b>gymnastics.</b> This confrontation lasted until the Second World War. In 1942 the Dutch 'heilgymnasten' got the legal status for their profession that they had wanted so desperately...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the clinical efficiency of electrodynamic rehabilitation methods in teenager sportsmen with supporting-motor apparatus (SMA) injuries. Patients and methods: 46 boys in the age of 14 – 16 with SMA injuries participated in the study. 20 boys received only conventional rehabilitation remedies (physiotherapy, <b>remedial</b> <b>gymnastics,</b> massage and taping), while the treatment of other 26 boys was enhanced with the DENS therapy. Duration of procedures was 30 – 40 minutes, duration of the whole treatment course — 10 – 14 days. The clinical effect of the DENS therapy was evaluated according the progress of clinical symptoms and life quality indices assessment result (before and immediately after and one month after the rehabilitation course), sing the evidentiary medicine methods. Results: After the two-week course of the DENS therapy the absolute risk reduction (ARR) in the teenagers with SMA injuries was fluctuating between 34. 6 (8. 7 – 60. 5) % (physical performance) and 56. 9 % (33. 1 – 80. 8 %; school performance; р = 0. 022), while the relative risk reduction (RRR) by the same indicators was equal to 69. 2 % (16. 2 – 88. 7 %) and 71. 1 % (39. 8 – 86, 2 %; р = 0. 002). The relative risk (RR) was registered at the level of 0. 31 (0. 11 – 0. 89; р = 0. 022) and 0. 29 (0. 14 – 0. 86; р = 0. 0002). The ARR value higher than 50 % always indicates the clinically significant effect while the ARR value between 25 and 50 % indicates the clinically significant effect very often. The following indicators according to the MDASI questionnaire were significantly improved within the test group: pain (p = 0. 001), sleet disturbance (p = 0. 050) and feeling of depression (p = 0. 045). According to the PedsQL™ 4. 0 questionnaire data, the significant improvement of the emotional performance (from 83. 7 ± 6. 97 to 91. 2 ± 3. 75) was registered in the point II. Conclusion: The rehabilitation course showed significant clinical effect in young sportsmen with SMA injuries. Introduction of the DENS therapy significantly reduces the frequency of adverse outcomes and improves the clinical effect of rehabilitation. <br /...|$|E
