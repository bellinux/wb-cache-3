50|$|In 1971 {{the colors}} of the 1st Cavalry Division came to Fort Hood from Vietnam, {{resulting}} in the reflagging of the 1st Armored Division, {{the colors of}} which were sent to Germany to <b>reflag</b> the 4th Armored Division.|$|E
50|$|The {{colors of}} the 11th Aviation Group left Vietnam in March 1973, bound for Dolan Barracks in Schwäbisch Hall, Germany, where {{they were used to}} <b>reflag</b> an {{existing}} aviation group. The Group's mission was to support Headquarters US Army Europe and the Seventh Army. In November 1979 the 11th Aviation Group became a major subordinate command of VII Corps.|$|E
5000|$|The 1st Cavalry Division next {{fought in}} the Vietnam War. No longer a {{conventional}} infantry unit, the division had become an air assault division as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), {{commonly referred to as}} the 1st Air Cavalry Division. The use of helicopters on such large scale as troop carriers, cargo lift ships, medevacs, and as aerial rocket artillery, was never before implemented, but by doing so it freed the infantry from the tyranny of terrain to attack the enemy at the time and place of its choosing. In 1965, colors and subordinate unit designations of the 1st Cavalry Division were transferred from Korea to Fort Benning, Georgia, where they were used to <b>reflag</b> the existing 11th Air Assault Division (Test) into 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Concurrently, the colors and subordinate unit designations were transferred to Korea to <b>reflag</b> what had been the 1st Cavalry Division into the 2nd Infantry Division.|$|E

5000|$|On 31 July 1986, the Transportation Corps {{celebrated its}} 44th Anniversary. This {{was also the}} day the Transportation Corps was {{inducted}} into the U.S. Army Regimental System. The activation of the Regiment marked the redesignation of several Transportation Corps training commands. The redesignation provided a link with renowned transportation units of the past. The Training Brigade was <b>reflagged</b> the 8th Transportation Brigade, honoring the 8th Transportation Group in Vietnam. The 8th Transportation Group enjoyed an outstanding reputation in Vietnam for its support of numerous tactical operations and {{for the development of the}} [...] "gun truck," [...] a highly armored 5-ton truck usually sporting multiple M2 [...]50 caliber machine guns. The 2nd Battalion, Training Brigade, was <b>reflagged</b> as the 71st Transportation Battalion. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Training Brigade, Fort Dix, was <b>reflagged</b> as the 36th Transportation Battalion. The 5th Battalion, 4th Training Brigade, Fort Leonard Wood was <b>reflagged</b> as the 58th Transportation Battalion. These units were <b>reflagged</b> as part of the Army's parent regiment system.|$|R

The Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th ID has been reflagged to CAB, 1st AD. 4-501st Aviation (4th Battalion [...] "Pistoleros", 501st Regiment, Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division) deployed to Kuwait in November 2012.|$|E
50|$|In 1965 {{the colors}} of the 2d Infantry Division Artillery left Fort Benning, Georgia, and went to Korea, where they were used to <b>reflag</b> the 1st Cavalry Division. From 1965 through 2006, the DIVARTY {{remained}} in Korean, ready to fight to deter North Korean aggression. The DIVARTY participated in numerous exercises, including annual Team Spirit exercises from 1976-1993, in order to maintain its readiness. Units from the DIVARTY also continuously manned firebases along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to provide immediate fire support to patrols in the DMZ. In 1981, the 1st Battalion, 38th FA and the 2nd Battalion, 17th FA replaced 105mm M102 howitzers with 155mm M198 howitzers, expanding the range and lethality of the DIVARTY.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the U.S. Army Regimental System {{initiative}} renamed {{a large percentage}} of infantry, armor and artillery battalions to align overseas commands with units assigned to stateside brigades, reinforcing the Army's regimental designations and unit morale. The original intent was to initiate personnel replacement and rotations within regiments, a [...] "next step" [...] that did not provide sufficient flexibility to Army personnel managers. The impact on Berlin-based infantry battalions was to <b>reflag</b> the 2d, 3d and 4th Battalions, 6th Infantry as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 502d Infantry, respectively, during the summer of 1984, assigning Berlin infantry units a shared identification with infantry battalions of 2d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|The {{existing}} 3d Brigade did not inactivate and {{was instead}} <b>reflagged</b> as the 199th Light Infantry Brigade and assigned directly to I Corps. The 199th was later <b>reflagged</b> as the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (Light) and {{was transferred to}} Fort Polk, Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|The 1st Battalion {{colors were}} {{returned}} from Germany in 1996. The 1-18 IN was <b>reflagged</b> as 1-15 IN on 15 February 1996. The actual <b>reflagging</b> ceremony {{was held at}} Fort Stewart on 25 April 1996. The 2nd Battalion was inactivated in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The {{timeline}} of the Brigade Combat Team growths {{calls for}} the <b>reflagging</b> of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division as the independent 172nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team in fiscal year 2008; this was accomplished during a <b>reflagging</b> ceremony on March 19 in Schweinfurt, Germany. The 2nd Brigade will subsequently be reformed at Fort Riley, Kansas. A similar event occurred in September 2010, when the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division in Baumholder, Germany, <b>reflagged</b> as the 170th Infantry Brigade.|$|R
50|$|Following their {{occupation}} duty {{with the}} 82nd Airborne Division in Berlin, the Devils reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The regiment remained at Fort Bragg until 1957, when {{the era of}} infantry regiments as tactical units ended and the Pentomic era began, in which designations were used to perpetuate lineages and honors. On 1 September of that year the lineage of Company A, 504 PIR was reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 504th Infantry and remained assigned to the 82nd as one of five battle groups that replaced the three regiments previously assigned to the division. The lineage of Company B, 504 PIR was used to <b>reflag</b> existing elements of the 11th Airborne Division in Germany as HHC, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 504th Infantry.|$|E
50|$|Rittmeyer's initial Fernspäh company, {{back in the}} day simply {{designated}} as Lehrgruppe R (Training Group R), quickly reflagged as Fernspählehrkompanie 200. His concept proved prolific enough to allow the creation of a Fernspäher school in Weingarten, South Germany. This institution would eventually <b>reflag</b> as the International Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol School (ILRRPS) and later move to Pfullendorf. From May 2001 it was called the International Special Training Center (ISTC). ILRRPS provided training for comparable units from Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, and the United States. Initially the British Special Air Service provided the Commanding Officer and some instructors for ILRRPS however they later withdrew from participation. When the Special Forces Command was activated in 1996, many of the ranks were filled with personnel from Fernspähkompanie 100 and Fernspähkompanie 300 which disbanded at last.|$|E
50|$|In 1873, Griscom {{also took}} over the {{management}} of the American Steamship Company, a Philadelphia based passenger and cargo service to Liverpool that was also backed by the Pennsylvania Railroad. This company, known as the American “Keystone” Line was unprofitable because of the substantially higher costs associated with operating American-flagged vessels. In 1884, the assets of the American Line were acquired by International Navigation. Two years later, INC also acquired the assets of the financially troubled Inman Line, operator of a British flagged Liverpool-New York mail service. With PRR’s backing, Griscom ordered two record breakers to restore Inman’s fortunes. However, the British Government objected to Inman’s ownership change and revoked Imman’s mail contract. Griscom successfully lobbied Congress to <b>reflag</b> the two new express liners and qualify for an American mail subsidy. In 1893, Inman was merged the American Line and the company built two additional express liners in the US to create a premium weekly service, now routed to Southampton.|$|E
50|$|On 15-16 February 1996, the DIVARTY was {{involved}} in a complicated <b>reflagging</b> action involving three divisions. As part of finalizing the designations of the reduced 10 division force, the Germany-based units of 3rd Infantry Division were <b>reflagged</b> to 1st Infantry Division (1st ID): HHB, 3rd Infantry Division Artillery as HHB, 1st Infantry Division Artillery; 3-1 FA was inactivated, with its personnel and equipment used to activate 1st Bn, 6th FA (1st ID); and 5-41 FA was inactivated, with its personnel and equipment used to activate 1st Bn, 7th FA (1st ID). Btry A, 76th FA and Btry B, 25th FA were simultaneously reassigned to the 1st ID. At the same time, the Georgia-based units of the 24th ID were <b>reflagged</b> to 3rd ID units: HHB, 24th Infantry Division Artillery as HHB, 3rd Infantry Division Artillery; 1st Bn, 41st FA reassigned to the 3rd ID at Fort Steward, GA; 3rd Bn, 41st FA <b>reflagged</b> as 1st Bn, 9th FA, at Fort Stewart; and 4th Bn, 41st FA, <b>reflagged</b> as 1st Bn, 10th FA, at Fort Benning, GA. Battery G (TAB), 333rd FA at Fort Stewart was <b>reflagged</b> as Btry A (TAB), 39th FA. In addition, the three battalions and TAB battery, Btry A, 13th FA was reassigned to the 3rd ID.|$|R

50|$|The {{attacks on}} oil tankers continued. Both Iran and Iraq carried {{frequent}} attacks {{during the first}} four months of the year. Iran was effectively waging a naval guerilla war with its IRGC navy speedboats, while Iraq attacked with its aircraft. In 1987, Kuwait asked to <b>reflag</b> its tankers to the US flag. They did so in March, and the US navy began Operation Earnest Will to escort the tankers. The result of Earnest Will would be that while oil tankers shipping Iraqi/Kuwaiti oil were protected, Iranian tankers, and neutral tankers shipping to Iran would be unprotected, resulting in both losses for Iran and the undermining of its trade with foreign countries, damaging Iran's economy further. Iran also deployed Silkworm missiles to attack some ships, but only a few were actually fired. Both the US and Iran jockeyed for influence in the Gulf. To discourage the US from escorting tankers, Iran secretly mined some areas in the Gulf. The US began to escort the reflagged tankers, but one of them was damaged by a mine while under escort. While being a public-relations victory for Iran, the US increased its reflagging efforts. While Iran mined the Persian Gulf, their speedboat attacks were reduced, primarily attacking unflagged tankers shipping in the area.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, {{the first}} {{proceedings}} alleging {{human rights abuses}} on a FCV were brought in the New Zealand courts and the crew members were awarded compensation. The government conducted an investigation in 2004 and identified systemic human rights and contractual abuses but did not publicly release the findings. In September 2005, ten Indonesian crew of the Korean flagged Sky 75 vessel fled at port and complained to the New Zealand Police of subjection to inhumane conditions and non-payment of wages. In 2006, the government published the code of Practice on Foreign Fishing Crew. As this was non-binding policy directive, there was no obligation for New Zealand authorities to enforce the code, therefore exploitation continued, with further successful claims in the courts raising awareness of the issue. In 2010 the Oyang 70 sank, killing 6 crew members. Surviving crew members revealed {{that they had been}} subjected to human rights and contractual abuse. In 2011, crew members of the Shin Ji and Oyang 75 alleged they had been subjected to physical, psychological and sexual abuse, suffered inhumane working conditions and punishments, and were underpaid or denied payment of wages, forced under threat to conceal this to authorities. Following these allegations, the government conducted a Ministerial inquiry in March 2012. A bill containing many of the recommendations in the report was introduced to Parliament but failed to pass. It was later reintroduced under urgency and the Fisheries (Foreign Charter Vessels and Other Matters) Amendment Act passed into New Zealand law in 2014. This amendment mandates that all FCV’s within the EEZ must <b>reflag</b> to New Zealand by 2016, which will allow the New Zealand Courts full jurisdiction over all crew members, who will then be entitled to the same protections that are available to all workers in New Zealand. Additionally, an Observer Programme has been implemented in order to effectively monitor the situation. The new legislation is hoped {{to bring an end to}} modern slavery in New Zealand's territorial waters.|$|E
5000|$|As {{shown by}} image 6, the ASA {{proposal}} {{was based on}} creating an international passenger terminal totally separate from the existing Tijuana passenger terminal and east of the Matrix aircraft maintenance center which {{was similar to the}} TwinPorts proposal (image 5). The difference between the ASA and TwinPorts proposals laid in the fact that ASA opposed north side runways on Otay Mesa and connecting the Tijuana and San Diego airports through a cross-border aircraft taxiway to service their respective terminals. While the Tijuana airport's ILS (Instrument Landing System) 09 approach required the use of U.S. airspace and coordinating operations with Brown Field Municipal Airport on Otay Mesa and the U.S. Naval Outlying Landing Field Imperial Beach, ASA opposed any San Diego airport development that would require the use of Mexican airspace. Instead, ASA proposed a 387,000sq.ft. (36,000 square meters) Tijuana international terminal to be built on the disputed former Ejido Tampico that would have been linked to San Diego through a bridge/tunnel connected directly to a U.S. 258,000sq.ft. (24,000 square meters) passenger terminal and parking facility on Otay Mesa. A 30-page report written by Ralph Nieders for the San Diego Chamber of Commerce titled [...] "Key Issues TwinPort/ASA Proposals" [...] compared both proposals and highlighted issues such as airspace, routes, slots (landing rights), U.S. airline interest and support, and was prepared in anticipation of President Carlos Salinas' visit to California which began in San Diego on September 28, 1991. In San Diego, President Salinas did not endorse the Twinports concept and instead announced Mexico would proceed with ASA's $300 million U.S. dollar expansion plan for the Tijuana airport and that private investors would provide $700 million U.S. dollars to build a state of the art Boeing 747 and jumbo aircraft maintenance center to make the Tijuana airport into “one of the most important airports not only in Mexico but in the whole region". This position was bolstered by the uncertainty over the Hong Kong transition from British to Chinese rule that had led to the exodus of people and capital from Hong Kong and the belief that Cathay Pacific would relocate or <b>reflag</b> part of its aircraft fleet to Mexico making the Tijuana airport its North and Latin American hub base.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} was reactivated in 1947, <b>reflagged</b> from the 19th Armored Division, {{which had been}} 'placed on rolls,' but not actually activated, during World War II. The 19th Armored Division was eventually activated just after the war, and allotted to the Sixth Army area of the Organized Reserves (specifically California, Oregon, and Arizona). In 1947, the 19th Armored Division was <b>reflagged</b> as the 13th Armored Division at California's request. In 1952, the {{division was}} <b>reflagged</b> as the 63rd Infantry Division in Los Angeles, California, and thus the 13th Armored Division was finally inactivated.|$|R
