25|$|In February 2014, Lau {{joined the}} cast of the Korean {{real-time}} military-variety show <b>Real</b> <b>Men,</b> with fellow celebrities, Chun Jung-myung, Park Gun-hyung, K.Will. He quickly became the break-out star and variety favorite because of his natural optimism and eagerness to learn Korean culture, despite being Canadian-born and completely unfamiliar with the Korean military. In addition, his appearance in Star King further cemented his skills, along with his appearance in <b>Real</b> <b>Men</b> propelled his rising popularity, leading to more variety show opportunities like being chosen as the first guest star in JTBC's Crime Scene and his first solo endorsement opportunity with KFC Korea and netting his second solo endorsement with Sprite Korea.|$|E

Firstly, they draw on the rich experience of Franciscan figures of the past, <b>real</b> <b>men</b> and women {{from the ranks of}} the Order, who were both contemplative and dedicated to so many activities as parents and single people, kings and craftsmen, recluses and people involved in welfare activities. Secondly, {{at the beginning of the}} third millennium, they face a test of their creativity when confronted by the new evangelisation. Thirdly, they cultivate a deep knowledge of Francis the prophet, an example from the past, leading them into the future.|$|E
50|$|He {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 19 May 2001, just an hour ahead of his {{official}} 85th birthday celebration.His story served as a basis for the novel by Boris Polevoy The Story of a <b>Real</b> <b>Man</b> and a subsequent film (1948) directed by Aleksandr Stolper where his name was changed to Meresyev. The novel also inspired Sergei Prokofiev's last opera The Story of a <b>Real</b> <b>Man.</b> In 2005 a documentary called Alexey Maresyev.

500|$|Absent {{mothers and}} abusive fathers are another {{theme in the}} novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could {{remember}} her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house {{to the extent that}} Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: [...] "It is the job of <b>real</b> <b>men</b> who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight." ...|$|E
500|$|The general tone of {{the next}} day's press reviews ranged from {{disappointment}} to outrage. The more conservative critics complained about [...] "Wagnerism" [...] and the subordination of the voice to {{the noise of the}} orchestra. There was consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue; Galli-Marié's interpretation of the role was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others compared the work unfavourably with the traditional Opéra-Comique repertoire of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in L'Art Musical called Carmens music [...] "dull and obscure ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". It seemed that Bizet had generally failed to fulfill expectations, both of those who (given Halévy's and Meilhac's past associations) had expected something in the Offenbach mould, and of critics such as Adolphe Jullien who had anticipated a Wagnerian music drama. Among the few supportive critics was the poet Théodore de Banville; writing in Le National, he applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with <b>real</b> <b>men</b> and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique [...] "puppets".|$|E

500|$|Dennis Feldman had {{the idea}} for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, <b>Real</b> <b>Men.</b> Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable odds against an {{extraterrestrial}} craft ever locating and visiting Earth, given that stellar distances are great, and faster-than-light travel is unlikely, Feldman started {{to think that it}} was [...] "unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what 'd describe as a big tin can." [...] Thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions [...] "giving out directions" [...] such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that [...] "in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides." ...|$|E
500|$|Among leading musical figures at {{the premiere}} were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Charles Gounod. Geneviève, {{suffering}} from an abscess {{in her right}} eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Saëns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: [...] "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-Marié's performance was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained {{of a lack of}} melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in L'Art Musical called the music [...] "dull and obscure... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet Théodore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with <b>real</b> <b>men</b> and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique [...] "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: [...] "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".|$|E

2500|$|Muhammad then {{approached}} the Banu Qaynuqa, gathering {{them in the}} market place and warned them to stop their hostility lest they suffer the same fate that happened to the Quraish at Badr. He also told them to accept Islam saying he was a prophet sent by God as per their scriptures. The tribe responded by mocking Muhammad's followers for accepting him as a prophet and also mocked their victory at Badr saying the Quraish {{had no knowledge of}} war. They then warned him that if he ever fought with them, he will know that they were <b>real</b> <b>men.</b> This response was viewed as a declaration of war. Muhammad then besieged the Banu Qaynuqa [...] after which the tribe surrendered unconditionally and were later expelled from Medina.|$|E
2500|$|Archbishop Saliège of Toulouse {{wrote to}} his parishioners: [...] "The Jews are <b>real</b> <b>men</b> and women. Not {{everything}} is permitted against these men and women, against these fathers and mothers. They {{are part of the}} human species. They are our brothers like so many others. A Christian should not forget this". The words encouraged other clerics like the Capuchin monk Père Marie-Benoît, who saved many Jews in Marseille and later in Rome where he became known among the Jewish community as [...] "father of the Jews". Marie-Rose Gineste transported a pastoral letter from Bishop Théas of Montauban by bicycle to forty parishes, denouncing the uprooting of men and women [...] "treated as wild animals", and the French Resistance smuggled the text to London, where it was broadcast to France by the BBC, reaching tens of thousands of homes.|$|E
2500|$|The A's offered Boros a {{front-office}} job, but he declined. Unemployed {{during a}} baseball {{season for the}} first time in over 20 years, Boros said he would take some time off but hoped to manage again. He met with the press at his home, drinking from a cup that read [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy." [...] He noted that the team's management felt he wasn't tough enough on the players, especially Rickey Henderson. Boros said, [...] "This nice guy label — I'm kind of getting clubbed to death with it. The public misinterpreted it when it saw a manager who went and talked to his players and asked their feelings. That all helped to create this impression of too nice a guy, one who can't make up his mind. The players are telling him what to do." [...] Sports Illustrated ran a feature on the firing of Boros several months later. The article refuted the charge that Boros lacked toughness but opened as follows:"When the Oakland A's dismissed Steve Boros in May, the manager's failing was more narrowly defined: He wasn't 'tough enough.' Newspapers across the country solemnly reported this canard. The shortcoming most mentioned was that the A's skipper didn't sufficiently 'stand up for his players'; that is, he didn't kick dirt on umpires or get thrown out of games. It was also revealed that Boros had read more than 100 books, cover to cover, and had other wimpy interests. <b>Real</b> <b>men</b> don't eat quiche. Tough guys don't dance. And so on." ...|$|E
