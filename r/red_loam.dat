500|$|Madurai {{is located}} at [...] It has an average {{elevation}} of 101 metres. The city of Madurai lies on the flat and fertile plain of the river Vaigai, which runs in the northwest-southeast direction through the city, dividing it into two almost equal halves. The Sirumalai and Nagamalai hills lie {{to the north and}} west of Madurai. The land in and around Madurai is utilised largely for agricultural activity, which is fostered by the Periyar Dam. Madurai lies southeast of the western ghats, and the surrounding region occupies the plains of South India and contains several mountain spurs. The soil type in central Madurai is predominantly clay loam, while <b>red</b> <b>loam</b> and black cotton types are widely prevalent in the outer fringes of the city. Paddy is the major crop, followed by pulses, millet, oil seed, cotton and sugarcane.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} awoken {{two hours before}} dawn on 28 October, and ate breakfast in the dark. [...] By 8:00 am, the party had rejoined the Murray where the river was 30 metres wide, between steep <b>red</b> <b>loam</b> banks, {{continuing}} northwards to cross the Oakley brook at about 8:35 am. [...] Peel approached along the western {{bank of the river}} and returned to tell of a settlement of about 20 bark beehive shaped mia-mias in the bend of the river. [...] The weather broke and it started to rain heavily as Captain Ellis, Mr Norcott and three of the police attacked from the south.|$|E
2500|$|Gobichettipalayam {{is located}} in Kongu Nadu, the northwestern part of Tamil Nadu about [...] south west of Chennai. Western Ghats forms {{the border of the}} region {{resulting}} several hill locks and Bhavani River traverses across the region. The temperature is moderately warm in Gobichettipalayam, except during the summer months when it is very hot. Rainfall is moderate to high, unpredictable and unevenly distributed. The soil mainly consists of black loam, <b>red</b> <b>loam</b> and red sand. In general, the soil in and around the city is fertile and good for agriculture purposes and the surrounding water logged rice fields contribute to the high humidity levels.|$|E

50|$|It is {{distributed}} through the Wheatbelt and southern Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia. It is found growing in loamy soils, often over limestone or clay loam on flats. The dark <b>red</b> <b>loams,</b> that {{are rich in}} minerals and often slightly saline, associated with the decomposition of the fine-grained dolerite gneiss dykes and outcropping units of the Yilgarn Block best suit the tree.|$|R
60|$|Another half-hour {{brought us}} to about a dozen native shafts in the usual chimney shape. They were quite new and had been {{temporarily}} left {{on account of the}} rise of the water, which was here twenty-four feet below the surface. The top soil is of sandy clay, and the gold-containing drifts, varying in thickness, they told me, from two to four feet, consisted of quartz pebbles bedded in <b>red</b> <b>loam.</b> The general look of the stratum and the country suggested an old lagoon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{factorial}} {{pot experiment}} was conducted using {{two types of}} soils (sandy <b>loam</b> and <b>red</b> clay <b>loam)</b> that are commonly used for commercial vegetable production in Bundaberg, region of Central Queensland Australia. The soils were amended with 0, 25, 50 and 75 t/ha of green waste biochar and minimum doses of N, P and K (30 kg/ha, 30 kg/ha and 40 kg/ha respectively). After two weeks of plant establishment, the pots were leached with 1. 5 litres of deionised water at week intervals, and cation concentrations of the leachate were determined. In 25 t/ha biochar treatment, {{there was a significant}} (P< 0. 05) reduction in K and Ca leaching by 40 % and 26 % respectively from sandy loam, and of Ca by 23 % from the <b>red</b> clay <b>loam.</b> Soil water holding capacity and soil organic carbon were also increased in both biochar treated soils. After 12 weeks of growth, shoot weight was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in 25 t/ha biochar-treated sandy <b>loam</b> and <b>red</b> clay <b>loam</b> (32 % and 31 % respectively). These results clearly demonstrated that a higher yield of capsicum can be achieved from green waste biochar application in sandy <b>loam</b> and <b>red</b> clay <b>loam</b> at 25 t/ha biochar...|$|R
