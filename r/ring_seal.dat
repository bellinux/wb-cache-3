2500|$|The design {{popularized by}} von Liebig thus {{consisted}} of an inner, straight tube {{surrounded by an}} outer straight tube, with the outer tube having ports for fluid inflow and outflow, and with the two tubes sealed in some fashion at the ends (eventually, by a blown glass <b>ring</b> <b>seal).</b> Its simplicity made it convenient to construct and inexpensive to manufacture, the higher heat capacity of the circulating water (vs. air) allowed for maintaining near to constant temperature in the condenser, and so the Liebig type {{proved to be the}} more efficient condenser—capable of condensing liquid from a much greater flow of incoming vapor—and therefore replaced retorts and air condensers. An added benefit of the simplicity of the straight inner tube design of this condenser type is that it can be [...] "packed" [...] with materials that increase the surface area (and so the number of theoretical plates of the distillation column, see section below), e.g., plastic, ceramic, and metal beads, rings, wool, etc. [...] See Fractional Distillation.|$|E

[...] With the intention of either renewing his Mughal connexions or seeking Mughal recognition of his southern conquests, Devaraja Wodeyar II sent an embassy to Aurangzeb, at Ahmadnagar. [...] In response, in 1700, the Mughal emperor sent the Mysore maharaja a signet <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> bearing the title [...] "Jug Deo Raj" [...] (literally, [...] "lord and king of the world"), and permission to sit on an ivory throne, and also a sword from Aurangzeb's personal regalia, a firangi, with gold etching on the hilt, to be used as a sword of the State by the Mysore maharajas, while seated on the ivory throne. Devaraja Wodeyar II, at this time, also reorganised his administration into eighteen departments, which, even today, is famous as the 'athaara kacheri' (eighteen departments), in [...] "imitation of what the envoys had seen at the Mughal court." [...] When the maharaja died on 16 November 1704, his dominions extended from Midagesi in the north to Palni and Anaimalai in the south, and from Kodagu and Balam in the west to Baramahals in the east.|$|E

40|$|The {{system of}} upper high nickel {{alloying}} steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> and lower high nickel alloying steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> {{installed in the}} grooves of turbine, can extend out and fit with the wall of valve cage, resulting in forming a good seal under the pressure. In the project, the failure steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is considered. This situation had threatened {{the safety of the}} whole steam turbine system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the failure cause of the steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> used in nuclear steam turbines. New high nickel steel alloy <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> was compared with the failed <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The dimensions of macroscopic ring with clearly plastic deformation were measured using calipers. Surface morphology of ring was observed by optical microscopy through metallographic analysis. There is a lot of precipitation in the grain boundaries of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> along with smaller grain size than the new <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> To explore the composition of precipitation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used. The results indicated that the concentration of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) was higher in the precipitation of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> At the same time, the hardness and elastic modulus of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> were reduced, measured by nanoindentation test. In-situ SEM tensile testing were used to record and analyze the generation of crack source and crack development under applied load. The reasons of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure can be answered because of these experimental results at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The main reason of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure is a combination of long-term stress and elevated temperature during turbine operation. Complex work environment caused recrystallization and recovery, resulting in grain refinement and secondary phase precipitation. Further embodiment, recrystallization and recovery caused the elastic modulus and hardness of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> decrease. Moreover, a lot of secondary phase precipitates appeared at grain boundaries during use. The appearance of secondary phase precipitates become the weakest part of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The applied load lead to <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure from the formation of microvoids to microvoids aggregated becoming microcracks until to the appearance of cracks at macroscopic scale. These changes of microscopic structure ultimately reflected in critical plastic deformation of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or, rarer still, cylinder-wall damage) issue.|$|E
