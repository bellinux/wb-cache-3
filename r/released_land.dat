A time limit of 3½ years for developers to construct homes on <b>released</b> <b>land</b> was built into the scheme {{in an effort to}} prevent land speculation, which the inter-departmental committee believed was a key factor in spiralling prices in Perth. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now City of Stirling) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently. The scheme was divided into nine sections, with what is now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage.|$|E
