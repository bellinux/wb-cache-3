5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{correlation}} between the level of posttraumatic stress <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> Norwegian children and their parents exposed to the 2004 tsunami disaster. Method: We assessed the level of PTSD <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> 307 children and 175 parents six to ten months after their experiences in the tsunami disaster. The parents were asked to complete two questionnaires. The first questionnaire was based on the Children Stress Disorder Checklist, a parental report of children s acute and posttraumatic stress <b>reactions.</b> <b>In</b> the second questionnaire, The Impact of Event Scale Revised was applied to assess parents posttraumatic stress reactions. Correlation analysis was conducted to explore possible associations between the levels of posttraumatic stress <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> children and their parents. Results: The degree of posttraumatic stress <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> children was significantly positively correlated with the degree of posttraumatic stress <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> their parents. Furthermore there were positive correlations between parents and children within the three different subscales intrusion, avoidance and hyperactivity. Conclusion: The strong association between posttraumatic stress <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> children and their parent suggest that family functioning post trauma and the mental health of other family members may be of importance in development of posttraumatic stress <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> children, and may interrupt their healing process. These findings underscore the need to expand the focus of trauma-related interventions from the child to their parents and family...|$|R

5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E
