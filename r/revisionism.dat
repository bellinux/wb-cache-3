5|$|To {{achieve its}} aims, the {{organisation}} used contacts with {{political parties and}} employed multi-prong historical <b>revisionism</b> and propaganda efforts, including periodicals, books and public speeches. A HIAG-owned publishing house, , served as a platform for its publicity aims. This extensive body of work, 57 book titles and more than 50 years of monthly periodicals, {{has been described by}} historians as revisionist apologia.|$|E
5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's <b>revisionism</b> and orthodox Trotskyism are {{so deep that}} no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated {{that it will not}} permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion to be reached. They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.|$|E
5|$|Gone {{with the}} Wind {{has been criticized}} as {{historical}} <b>revisionism</b> glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, it has been credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest films of all time; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute's list of top 100 American films since the list's inception in 1998, and in 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|In August 1968, the Polish People's Army {{took part}} in the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Some Polish intellectuals protested, and Ryszard Siwiec burned himself alive during the official national holiday celebrations. The Polish participation in the crushing of the Czech liberal communism (called socialism with a human face, and, according to David Ost, constituting the crowning achievement of Marxist <b>revisionism)</b> further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters. But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka faded and the 5th Congress of the PZPR in November reconfirmed his rule. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his Brezhnev Doctrine, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the fraternal course.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist <b>revisionism</b> of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E
5|$|When the Empire of Brazil began aiding Uruguay in its {{struggle}} against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the Platine War. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and absconding to Britain. His last years were spent in exile {{living as a}} tenant farmer {{until his death in}} 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and racist political movement in Argentina called <b>Revisionism</b> has tried to improve Rosas's reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking forgiveness for him and especially for the 1970s military dictatorship. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|The Sino-Soviet rift and the {{obsession}} with Khrushchev's <b>revisionism</b> looms {{large in the}} coming of the Cultural Revolution, as Mao saw <b>revisionism</b> and de-Stalinization as a threat not only to his own position but also to the very survival of the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary force. Accordingly, an appreciation of Kang's role as a supporter of Mao's line in this period helps explain his return to very near the pinnacle of power a few years later.|$|E

25|$|The reestablishment was {{centered}} on a comprehensive and thoroughgoing criticism and repudiation of modern <b>revisionism</b> and of {{the leadership of the}} Lavas in Manila as well as the Taruc-Sumulong grouping which had usurped authority over remnants of the HMB.|$|E

25|$|Mao {{went on to}} {{publicly}} denounce <b>revisionism</b> in April 1960. Without pointing fingers at the Soviet Union, Mao criticized their ideological ally, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, while the Soviets returned the favour by proxy via criticizing the Party of Labour of Albania, a Chinese ally. In 1963, the Chinese Communist Party began to openly denounce the Soviet Union, publishing a series of nine polemics against its perceived <b>revisionism,</b> {{with one of them}} being titled On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Historical Lessons for the World, in which Mao charged that Khrushchev was not only a revisionist but also increased the danger of capitalist restoration. Khrushchev's downfall from an internal coup d'état in 1964 also contributed to Mao's fears of his own political vulnerability, particularly because of his declining prestige amongst his colleagues following the Great Leap Forward.|$|E
25|$|<b>Revisionism</b> {{challenged}} {{the view that}} fundamental and irreconcilable sectional differences made the outbreak of war inevitable. It scorned a previous generation's easy identification of the Northern cause with abolition, but it continued a tradition of hostility to the Reconstruction measures that followed the war. The Civil War became a needless conflict brought on by a blundering generation that exaggerated sectional differences between North and South. Revisionists revived {{the reputation of the}} Democratic party as great nationalists before the war and as dependable loyalists during it. <b>Revisionism</b> gave Lincoln's Presidency a tragic beginning at Fort Sumter, a rancorous political setting of bitter factional conflicts between radicals and moderates within Lincoln's own party, and an even more tragic ending. The benevolent Lincoln died at the moment when benevolence was most needed to blunt radical designs for revenge on the South.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, a {{confrontation}} with China regarding the USSR's rapprochement with the West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's <b>revisionism</b> led to the Sino–Soviet split. This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist–Leninist movement, with the governments in Albania, Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China {{in place of the}} USSR.|$|E
25|$|The Historiography of the Poor Laws {{can be said}} to {{have passed}} through three {{distinct}} phases. Early historiography was concerned with the deficiencies of the Old Poor Law system, later work can be characterized as an early attempt at <b>revisionism</b> before the writings of Mark Blaug present a truly revisionist analysis of the Poor Law system.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{theory is}} that the Hutu and Tutsi originally belonged to the same Bantu population, but were artificially divided by German and then Belgian colonists so that the Tutsi minority could serve as local overseers for Berlin and Brussels. The latter view has received support among proponents of Rwandan national unity, but has been criticized as an attempt at historical <b>revisionism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adolf Hitler's rise in Nazi Germany in 1933; the German {{annexation}} (Anschluss) of Austria in 1938; {{the resulting}} revival of <b>revisionism</b> in Hungary; the agitation for autonomy in Slovakia; and the appeasement {{policy of the}} Western powers of France and the United Kingdom left Czechoslovakia without effective allies. exposed to hostile Germany and Hungary on three sides and to unsympathetic Poland on the north.|$|E
25|$|To remain sincere to his friend, Overbeck {{maintained}} a critical {{distance from the}} content of Nietzsche's writings, and denounced {{the beginnings of a}} hero-worship and <b>revisionism.</b> He refused to cooperate with Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche and her Nietzsche-Archiv and, mostly in private notes and letters, accused her of misinterpreting Nietzsche. He refused to give her his correspondence with Nietzsche - {{which turned out to be}} right, as she would forge other correspondents' letters.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the 1976 Constitution which {{prohibited}} foreign debt was promulgated, aid and investments, Albania had basically become self-sufficient although it was lacking in modern technology. Ideologically, Hoxha found Mao's initial views to be in line with Marxism-Leninism. Mao condemned Nikita Khrushchev's alleged <b>revisionism</b> {{and he was also}} critical of Yugoslavia. Aid given from China was interest-free and it {{did not have to be}} repaid until Albania could afford to do so.|$|E
25|$|McCreery {{had four}} sons and one daughter. His eldest son, Michael, {{was a member}} of the Communist Party of Great Britain in the early 1960s, but left in 1963 to become leader of the Committee to Defeat <b>Revisionism,</b> for Communist Unity. He pre-deceased his father in 1965. His second son, Bob, {{inherited}} his passion for steeplechasing and became the champion amateur National Hunt jockey in the 1950s. His youngest son is the psychologist and author Charles McCreery.|$|E
25|$|Hayward's thesis {{was written}} in 1991, prior to his four honours papers, with the {{conclusion}} written in early 1993. Entitled The Fate of Jews in German hands: An Historical Enquiry into the Development and Significance of Holocaust <b>Revisionism,</b> the thesis underwent examination by internal examiner Dr. Vincent Orange of University of Canterbury's History Department and external examiner Professor John Jensen of Waikato University before its grade of A+ was confirmed by Professor W. David McIntyre, Head of the University of Canterbury's History Department.|$|E
25|$|America in Vietnam (1978), by Guenter Lewy, is {{an example}} of {{historical}} <b>revisionism</b> that differs much from the popular view {{of the role of the}} U.S. in the Vietnam War (1955–75), for which the author was criticised and supported for belonging to the revisionist school on the history of the Vietnam War. Lewy's reinterpretation was the first book of a body of work by historians of the revisionist school about the geopolitical role and the military behavior of the United States in the country of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Gömbös {{signed a}} trade {{agreement}} with Germany that helped Hungary's economy out of depression, but made Hungary dependent on the German economy for both raw materials and markets. Adolf Hitler appealed to Hungarian desires for territorial <b>revisionism,</b> while extreme right-wing {{organizations such as the}} Arrow Cross Party increasingly embraced extreme Nazi policies, including those relating to the suppression and victimization of Jews. The government passed the First Jewish Law in 1938. The law established a quota system to limit Jewish involvement in the Hungarian economy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Revisionism</b> {{was popular}} in Poland but lacked large support in Palestine. The Revisionists refused {{to comply with}} British quotas on Jewish migration, and, {{following}} the election of Hitler in Germany, the Revisionist youth movements HeHalutz and Beitar began to organize illegal Jewish migration to Palestine. In Europe and America they advocated pressing Britain to allow mass Jewish emigration {{and the formation of}} a Jewish Army in Palestine. The army would force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration and promote British interests in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge {{conspiracy}} theory {{is the argument}} that U.S. Government officials had advance knowledge of Japan's December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Ever since the Japanese attack there has been debate as to {{how and why the}} United States had been caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans for an attack. In September 1944, John T. Flynn, a co-founder of the non-interventionist America First Committee, launched Pearl Harbor <b>revisionism</b> when he published a forty-six page booklet entitled The Truth about Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|The former deconstructs the {{assumptions}} and poor methodology {{in the book}} , by Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman. Time on the Cross denied that slavery was unprofitable, a moribund institution (even though, in fact, few academics said or believed that by this time), inefficient, and extremely harsh for typical slave. The book received {{a large amount of}} mainstream media attention for its <b>revisionism,</b> impressed the historical community with its use of cliometrics, and outraged many in the civil rights community (with some calling it a rallying cry for racism).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} and mid-20th centuries this {{was a form of}} bowdlerisation, {{concerned}} with some of the more violent elements of nursery rhymes and {{led to the formation of}} organisations like the British 'Society for Nursery Rhyme Reform'. Psychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim strongly criticized this <b>revisionism,</b> on the grounds that it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues and it has been argued that revised versions may not perform the functions of catharsis for children, or allow them to imaginatively deal with violence and danger.|$|E
25|$|The Myth of the Eastern Front: The Nazi-Soviet War in American Popular Culture is a 2008 book by the American historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies of the University of Utah. It {{discussed}} {{perceptions of}} the Eastern Front of World War II in the United States {{in the context of}} historical <b>revisionism.</b> The book traced the foundation of the post-war myth of the clean Wehrmacht, its support by U.S. military officials, and the impact of Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS mythology on American popular culture, up to the time of its publication.|$|E
25|$|Gibson {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, and Marlon Brando by starring as Fletcher Christian in a cinematic retelling of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The resulting 1984 film The Bounty {{is considered to be}} the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's <b>revisionism</b> did not go far enough. He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's antagonist. He has further praised Anthony Hopkins's performance as Lieutenant William Bligh as the best aspect of the film.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, Filipescu joined Lord Cecil's International Peace Campaign, {{serving as}} vice {{president}} of its chapter, alongside Petru Groza and Constantin Rădulescu-Motru; Titulescu was its president. Perhaps his most important speech, held in Paris in May of that year and published in brochure form, proposed a Europe-wide bloc composed of France, Italy, the Little Entente, the Balkan Entente and the Soviet Union, which would help secure borders threatened by <b>revisionism</b> and keep the peace. The same speech proposed a mutual assistance pact between the Soviets and Romania. Nevertheless, he also militated for better Bulgaria–Romania relations.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, Auguste Mariette, {{founder of}} the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, {{unearthed}} the much later Inventory Stela (estimated DynastyXXVI, c.678–525BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the Stela are considered good evidence, this passage is widely dismissed as Late Period historical <b>revisionism,</b> a purposeful fake, created by the local priests with the attempt to certify the contemporary Isis temple an ancient history it never had. Such an act became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines and priest's domains were fighting for political attention and for financial and economic donations.|$|E
