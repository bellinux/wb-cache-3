5|$|A {{journalist}} {{from the}} Eastern Daily Press {{reported on the}} head in March 1967, stating that it had undergone laboratory tests which had established it to be made out of 2200-year-old English oak. Howard told the reporter that when living in Norwood Hill, Surrey, the race car driver Donald Campbell <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> head of Atho for luck before making his attempts to break the world land speed record. In July 2008, Howard's son Peter confirmed to the researcher Melissa Seims that he had witnessed his father constructing the Head, {{and that it was}} thus fake. Seims suggested that the design of the head had been inspired by an older folkloric artefact, the Dorset Ooser.|$|E
5|$|In The Girlie Show in 1993, {{the song}} was {{performed}} in an alternate version as the second to last song of the tour. It had a military theme to it. Halfway through the performance Madonna paused the song for a military drill with the dancers and the audience. The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico, when Madonna <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> Puerto Rican national flag between her legs in between the performance. For the Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat, velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt which proclaimed 'Mother' {{in the front and}} 'F*cker' in the back painted in silver. This demonstrated her ghetto-girl appearance adopted for the song's performance.|$|E

As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> barrel of his revolver across her stomach.|$|E

25|$|As {{reported}} by the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus around 600 BC, charge (or electricity) could be accumulated by rubbing fur on various substances, such as amber. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair. They also found that if they <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> amber for long enough, they could even get an electric spark to jump. This property derives from the triboelectric effect.|$|E
25|$|At the hospital, Rappe's {{companion}} at the party, Bambina Maude Delmont, told Rappe's {{doctor that}} Arbuckle had raped her friend. The doctor examined Rappe but {{found no evidence}} of rape. Rappe died one day after her hospitalization of peritonitis, caused by a ruptured bladder. Delmont then told police that Arbuckle raped Rappe, and the police concluded that the impact Arbuckle's overweight body had on Rappe eventually caused her bladder to rupture. Rappe's manager Al Semnacker (at a later press conference) accused Arbuckle of using a piece of ice to simulate sex with her, which led to the injuries. By the time the story was reported in newspapers, the object had evolved into being a Coca-Cola or champagne bottle, instead of a piece of ice. In fact, witnesses testified that Arbuckle <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> ice on Rappe's stomach to ease her abdominal pain. Arbuckle denied any wrongdoing. Delmont later made a statement incriminating Arbuckle to the police in an attempt to extort money from Arbuckle's attorneys.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Captain Britain's {{powers were}} linked to the mystical Amulet of Right, worn around his neck. When Brian Braddock <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> amulet he was {{transformed}} from an ordinary mortal into a superhero version of himself, complete with a more muscular physique. The amulet could also mystically replenish his superhuman energies. He also possessed a telescoping staff to vault. This also had other functions, the most heavily relied upon being the ability to project a force field. Later, Merlyn changed the staff into the mace-like Star Sceptre, which he could utilize like a quarterstaff and which also gave him the ability of flight. Merlyn changed his costume just before he entered the alternate Earth-238, fusing {{the powers of the}} Amulet and the Scepter into the new uniform and then later put these powers within Brian himself when he was forced to rebuild Brian following Brian's death {{at the hands of the}} Fury, making the suit a regulatory device for his powers. Eventually, Brian no longer required even the battle-suit for the full use of his powers, as his heritage of being the son of a denizen of the extra-dimensional Otherworld became enough to power him.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{continued}} her provocative imagery in the 1993 erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics. She also {{starred in the}} film Dangerous Game, which was released straight to video in North America. The New York Times described the film as [...] "angry and painful, and the pain feels real." [...] In September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit book, album and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over.|$|E
500|$|The [...] in mice {{administered}} cicutoxin by {{intraperitoneal injection}} is 48.3mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9mg/kg for mice given potassium cyanide by intraperitoneal injection, while the LD50 for arsenic via intraperitoneal injection in mice is 46.2mg/kg. The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; {{it is thought}} ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death. Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants. Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant; a case was reported where a family of five people <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> plant onto the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying. Livestock have long been the worst affected, leading to the common name [...] "cowbane". Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant. In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant {{out of the ground}} ingesting both the foiliage and the roots. Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings. Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Although Hirst was a {{right-handed}} batsman, he bowled {{with his}} left arm at medium-fast pace. He {{was one of the}} first bowlers to make the ball swerve through the air in a controlled fashion. According to A. A. Thomson, Hirst's development of swing bowling was almost as revolutionary as Bernard Bosanquet's invention of the googly. His bowling partnership with Rhodes was particularly effective, and established a formidable reputation. Hirst could not make the ball swing in every match, nor could he maintain it through a long innings. However, when he could achieve swerve, even the best batsmen found it almost impossible to bat against him. His success was dependent on atmospheric conditions; for example, he could not swing the ball much in Australia. He was particularly effective when bowling into the wind. Sammy Woods described facing Hirst when the ball was moving in the air: [...] "How the devil can you play a ball that comes in at you like a hard throw-in from cover-point?" [...] Hirst was not an especially quick bowler, [...] a little faster than medium pace, with a long run-up and a relaxed action. He usually bowled over the wicket, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets and therefore angled the ball across the pitch. After delivery, the ball swung through the air at the last minute and hurried through after pitching, appearing to get faster. A very accurate bowler, he was difficult to score against unless a batsman was prepared to hit him in the air over mid on. The main dangers to the batsmen were the risk of being bowled or hitting the ball with a defensive shot and being caught by specially-placed fielders on the leg side. His ability to make the ball swing made him effective on a variety of pitches. Before Hirst developed his technique, bowlers often <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> ball in the dirt to remove the shiny layer of the ball, unaware that this layer helped the ball to swing. Hirst's Wisden obituary records: [...] "Hirst, in fact, has been described as the father of all modern seam and swing bowling." ...|$|E

2500|$|In one study, mothballs (which contain napthalene) {{were placed}} in a flowerbed. [...] A common grackle picked one out, {{extended}} its left wing and <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> mothball {{up and down the}} length of the shaft of each of the secondary feathers. [...] The grackle went on to rub the mothball over its secondary coverts on the ventral side and onto the propatagium area. [...] The grackle then repeated the same rubbing actions on its right wing. [...] The entire rubbing behaviour lasted approximately 10 minutes. European starlings also performed a similar behaviour with mothballs.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} {{recording}} Tempted, drummer Nigel Pegrum emigrated to Australia for personal relationship reasons. He {{was replaced by}} eccentric drummer Liam Genockey of Gillan, easily identified by his long, plaited beard. He and Knight were simultaneously members of [...] "Moiré Music", a free-jazz band with a classical flavour, led by Trevor Watts. Unlike Pegrum, who employed a traditional rock drumming style, Genockey favoured a more varied drumming style, influenced by both Irish and African drumming, in which he hit, brushed, and <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> various surfaces of his drums and cymbals, creating a more varied range of sounds. [...] Consequently, when the band embarked on their 20th Anniversary Tour, they did so with a totally new rhythm section.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the five}} weeks between 2 May and 8 June 616 sick men (one {{third of the}} 4th Light Horse Brigade) were {{evacuated}} from the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance. During the same period, the field ambulance treated almost {{an equal number of}} patients needing dressings and for minor ailments. Some were kept in hospital for a few days. In five weeks, the field ambulance cared for the equivalent of two regiments or two-thirds of the total brigade. According to Falls, [...] "in general, however, the Force's standard of health was very high." [...] These minor ailments included very painful boils which were inevitable in the dust, heat and sweat of the Jordan Valley. They often started where shirt collars <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> backs of necks, then spread {{to the top of the}} head and possibly the arm pits and buttocks. These boils were treated by lancing or hot foments sometimes applied hourly and requiring a day or two in hospital. Foments were made from a wad of lint wrapped in a towel heated in boiling water, wrung as dry as possible then quickly slapped straight on the boil. Other maladies suffered during the occupation included dysentery, a few cases of enteric, relapsing fever, typhus, and smallpox along with sand-fly fever.|$|E
2500|$|In book ii Cuthbert {{becomes a}} monk (chapter one). While still a [...] at the monastery of Ripon, Cuthbert {{is given the}} job of {{greeting}} guests; having washed and <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> feet of one guest, Cuthbert seeks to feed the visitor, finds he has no bread in the guesthouse [...] and so goes to the monastery; but because the bread there is still baking, he has to return empty handed; when Cuthbert returns the visitor—an angel in disguise—has vanished leaving three warm loaves. Cuthbert, having {{been invited to the}} monastery of Coldingham by Abbess Æbbe, is followed by a cleric to the beach where he keeps one of his night-time vigils; the cleric sees two sea-animals emerge from the waves to clean and rub Cuthbert's feet; the author of the Anonymous Life was told this by a priest of Melrose called Plecgils (chapter three). In the following chapter Cuthbert and two brothers, having sailed {{to the land of the}} Picts, become hungry in the territory of the Niuduera (probably in eastern Fife) waiting for the sea to calm in order to resume their voyage; their hunger is relieved however when three slices of prepared dolphin meat is found on the beach, enough to feed them for three days; the story was reported to the author by a priest named Tydi, still living as the work was authored (chapter four).|$|E
2500|$|Ali fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell {{was billed}} as Ali's toughest {{opponent}} since Liston—unbeaten in five years and having defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced. Terrell was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali [...] "Clay", much to Ali's annoyance (Ali called Cassius Clay his [...] "slave name"). The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. [...] "I want to torture him", he said. [...] "A clean knockout is too good for him." [...] The fight was close until the seventh round when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, [...] "What's my name, Uncle Tom... what's my name?" [...] Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye—forcing Terrell to fight half-blind—and then, in a clinch, <b>rubbed</b> <b>the</b> wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as [...] "one of the ugliest boxing fights". Tex Maule later wrote: [...] "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty." [...] Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.|$|E
