I offer a brief explanation of why that may be happening, then give a Canonical Typology perspective, which brings these problems to the fore. I give examples showing that the phenomena could in principle be treated either by syntactic rules (but these would be complex) or within morphology (but this would involve redundancy). Thus `non-autonomous' case values, those which have no unique form but are realized by patterns of syncretism, could be handled by a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntax</b> (one with access to other features, such as number) or by morphology (with resulting systematic syncretisms).

40|$|DeVilliers and DeVilliers (2000, 2005) {{propose that}} deaf and hearing {{children}} acquire {{a theory of}} mind (or the understanding that human behaviour {{is the product of}} psychological states like true and false beliefs) as a consequence of their linguistic mastery of a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntax.</b> Specifically, they argue that the syntactic rule for sentential complementation with verbs of speech (e. g., “say”) precedes syntactic mastery of complementation for cognition (e. g., “think”) and both of these developmentally precede and promote conceptual mastery of a theory of mind (ToM), as indexed via success on standard false belief tests. The present study examined this proposition in groups of primary-school-aged deaf children and hearing preschoolers who took false belief tests and a modified memory for complements test that included control questions. Guttman scaling techniques indicated no support either for the prediction that syntactic skill precedes ToM understanding or for the earlier emergence of complementation for “say” than for “think”.

40|$|Translations—unconsciously—rely on the {{hypothesis}} that sentences of a certain source language LS can be expressed by sentences of the target language LT. Formal theories of semantics, on the other hand, assume that semantics is computed compositionally: the meaning of an expression {{is a function of}} the meaning of its parts. A standard argument for the compositionality of meaning is productivity. Formal semantic compositionality has been formalized by the rule-to-rule hypothesis of Bach (1976). The idea is well-known from the Montague grammars. The meaning of idioms is, however, not a function of its parts: its meaning has to be learnt as a unit. Combining the basic idea of translation with the rule-to-rule hypothesis, we can express structures of language LS in language LT. These structures of LT—called translations—can also be either computed compositionally or as units: each syntactic rule of LS should have its counterpart expressed—not by semantic rules, but—by syntactic descriptions in language LT. 1. Toward a new approach to machine translation The meaning of a complex linguistic structure is wholly determined by its sub-structures and the meanings of them. Semantic compositionality was formalized by the rule-to-rule hypothesis of Bach (1976) : it says that a tight correspondence is imposed between syntax and semantics such that every <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntax</b> is also a rule of semantics. In a machine translation system (Rosetta—described by Landsbergen 1985) we can meet a rather direct application of the compositionality principle adopted from the Montague Grammars (Thomason 1974) : The meaning of an expression {{is a function of the}} meaning of its parts and the way in which they are syntactically combined. (…) it is an important criterion of a correct translation that it is meaning-preserving, this seems to be a useful guideline in machine translation. (Appelo & al. 1987...|$|E

One of the hurdles in learning a language is to learn the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>of</b> the language. <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntax</b> are often ordered in that before one rule can applied one must apply another. It has been thought that to learn the order <b>of</b> n <b>rules</b> one must go through all n! permutations.

We present a mathematical analysis of the complexity of Block's algorithm. The algorithm has a complexity of order n^ 2 given n rules.
