40|$|Summary. Jurassic limestones {{occurring}} in a screen between two <b>ring</b> <b>dykes</b> are {{shown to have}} undergone two periods of thermal metamorphism; the first charac-terized by a high ratio of C 02 :H 20 and the second by a high ratio of H 20 :C 02 in the vapour phase. Tile first metamorphism produced minerals characteristic of Bowen's decarbonation series. Some of these minerals became unstable in the second metamorphism and (OH, F) bearing minerMs were produced. A stage of fracture-controlled replacement veins with mineral assemblages which indicate a varying CO~:I-I~O ratio in the vapour and a general falling temperature s quence terminate the metamorphic history. Three new minerals, rustumite I (CaaSi 2 OT. Ca-(OH) 2), dellaite 1 (Ca 12 Si~O 2 ~(OH) 4), and kilchoanite (CaaSi 207), of which the last has previously been described, are characteristic of the second episode of meta-morphism...|$|R

5000|$|A {{collapse}} is {{triggered by}} the emptying of the magma chamber beneath the volcano, sometimes {{as the result of}} a large explosive volcanic eruption (see Tambora in 1815), but also during effusive eruptions on the flanks of a volcano (see Piton de la Fournaise in 2007) or in a connected fissure system (see Bárðarbunga in 2014-2015). If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular fracture, the [...] "ring fault", develops around the edge of the chamber. Ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions which are also known as <b>ring</b> <b>dykes.</b> Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse.

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{series of}} {{overlapping}} ring structures each contain varied, pre-caldera volcanic sequences, overlain by massive intra-caldera rhyolitic ignimbrites and enclosed within <b>ring</b> <b>dykes</b> of fayalite-hedenbergite granite-porphyry. Early basalts are hypersthene-normative but may originally have been alkaline or transitional to nepheline-normative. They are linked, {{through a series}} of andesine basalts, mugearites and trachyandesites, to aphyric trachytes. Pre-caldera rhyolitic rocks, interbedded with and overlying the basic and intermediate volcanics, are mainly ignimbrites which were perhaps originally peralkaline or near peralkaline, but are often recrystallized to subalkaline compositions. They formed mainly through partial melting with zone refining of crustal rocks, the mantle-derived basic to intermediate magmas providing the heat source. In the early stages of each caldera-forming cycle the ignimbrite eruptions were of small volume and the rocks have varied crystal contents. Later, large high level magma chambers must have developed, from which crystal-rich ignimbrites with volumes in the order of 100 km 3 were erupted, with accompanying caldera collapse. The form of the complex as a whole shows that this cycle occurred repeatedly, but with the location of magma generation migrating progressively westwards, resulting in a chain of rhyolitic cauldrons, into whic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Seismic reflection, bathymetry, {{acoustic}} imagery and magnetic data are presented that encompass {{the boundary between}} rifting of the Papuan continent and westward propagating sea-floor spreading in the Woodlark Basin. West of the spreading tip, the southern margin is charac-terized by large fault blocks, which were tilted to the south on north-dipping normal faults during the current rifting phase, and graben further south where previous rifting failed. The northern margin is devoid of large offset normal faults and its subsidence from near sea level requires synrift flow of the lower crust. The margin asymmetry primarily reflects across-strike differences in the prerift geology, morphology and rheology. Horst and graben with 3 km relief below sea level occur adjacent to the spreading tip. Although heat flow data imply greater crustal thinning {{to the south of}} Moresby continental seamount, seismicity shows that deformation is currently focused on the Moresby normal fault that bounds its northern side. Based on logging results from ODP Leg 180 and semblance analysis, depth conversion of seismic reflection data show that Moresby Fault has a dip 298, which is compatible with an earthquake slip plane of 308 – 338.

40|$|The Upper Carboniferous {{porphyritic}} microgranite of Altenberg-Frauenstein, {{formerly known}} as Granitporphyr (Dalmer 1896) and here abbreviated as GP, forms a 36 km long and up to 18 km wide complex of <b>ring</b> <b>dykes</b> related to the Teplice-Altenberg caldera in the German–Czech border region of the Eastern Erzgebirge/Krusné Hory. The microgranites are characterized by the occurrence of plagioclase-mantled K-feldspar phenocrysts. The microgranite varieties representtwo main stages of intrusion evolved from acid (GP I) to intermediaterocks (GP II) within the intrusion. The most acid rock (GP Icum) occurs as enclaves in GP I and GP II and is interpreted as a cumulate of K-feldspar and quartz phenocrysts. The porphyritic microgranites show field, textural and geochemical evidence suggesting {{that some of them}} have formed as a result of interaction between felsic and mafic magmas. Mixing features are abundant in the porphyriticquartz-feldspar-hornblende microgranite (GP II) interpreted as a hybrid rock. They are less discrete in the early phase (GP I) and not obvious in the acid enclaves (GP Icum). This trend seems to reflect a continuous deflation of the magma chamber from the top to the bottom. According to the definition of rapakivi granites after Haapala and Rämö (1992), the porphyritic microgranite of Altenberg-Frauenstein may be considered as rapakivi granite although ovoid alkali feldspar megacrysts typical of classical rapakivi granites are not recorded.

In this study we mapped and analyzed the volcanic and tectonic structures of Pavonis Mons in order to understand its formation and the relationship between magmatic and tectonic activity. We use the mapping ArcGIS software and vast set of high resolution topographic and multi-spectral images including CTX (6 m/pixel) as well as HRSC (12. 5 m/pixel) and HiRiSE (∼ 0. 25 m/pixel) mosaic images.

Displacements across recent crater rim and volcanic deposits (strike slip faults and wrinkle ridges) have been documented suggesting that, at least during the most recent volcanic phases, the regional tectonics has contributed in shaping the morphology of Pavonis.

40|$|The size, shape, {{location}} and/or chemical {{evolution of}} basaltic magma plumbing systems at most volcanoes {{is not well}} constrained. Having this information beneath active systems allows scientists to target areas which will likely {{be the first to}} display volcanic unrest. With these constraints and datasets that cover long periods of time or include anomalous topographic features, we can start to investigate how a volcanic system has changed over time. To accomplish this, geochemical and geophysical studies at Masaya volcano (Nicaragua) and Mauna Loa volcano (Hawaii, USA) were conducted. Melt Inclusions were collected from Masaya volcano to investigate the processes within the magma chamber. The almost unchanging chemistry of the whole rock, crystals and melt inclusions regardless of which eruptive cone sampled suggests that the system is buffered in both temperature and chemistry. A large deep reservoir with rapid transit times to the surface could explain the data. Bouguer gravity mapping data at Masaya and Mauna Loa volcanoes were collected, processed and inverted to constrain the location and volumes of density anomalies at depth. Beneath Masaya volcano, the gravity data provides evidence of a very large intrusive complex (< 900 km 3) at 4 - 9 km depth as well as several small shallow anomalies perhaps due to <b>ring</b> <b>dykes</b> around a buried caldera rim. This study strengthens arguments that Masaya does not have a large shallow magmatic system and that shallow endogenous growth is minimal. Gravity mapping and inversions from Mauna Loa provide evidence for relatively rapid rift zone migration most likely caused by a large edifice destabilizing event.

40|$|Summary. Leucite and pseudoleueitc {{invariably}} {{have lower}} K/Rb ratios and higher K/Sr and K/Ba ratios than the groundmasses {{of the rocks}} in which they occur. The distribution of Rb, Sr, and Ba between K-rich minerals (e. g. alkali feldspars) and the liquids from which they crystallize is generally such that Rb is impoverished and Sr and Ba enriched, relative t ~ K, in the crystallizing phase. Leucite shows the opposite relationship and this is attributed tothe leucite structure being sensitive to the size and valency of the ions rep]acing K. p SEUDOLEUCITE normally consists of a fine-grained intergrowth of nepheline and alkali feldspar and {{is believed to be}} formed by reaction of primary leucite with Na-rich magma (Bowen and Ellestad, 1937), subsolidus breakdown of primary Na-rieh leucite (Fudali, 1963), or breakdown of K-analcime (Larsen and Buie, 1938). During a recent geochemical nd mineralogical investigation of the Marangudzi igneous complex, Southern Rhodesia (Rees, 1960; Gifford, 1961) I found that pseudoleucites usually have larger concentrations of Rb and smaller concentrations of Sr and Ba than the rocks in which they are contained. This means that the groundmasses of these rocks have lower Rb and higher Sr and Ba concentrations. Pseudoleucites from other areas show a similar distribution of these elements relative to their bulk rock or groundmass composition. Leueite phenocrysts from fine-grained or glassy lavas also show high concentrations of Rb and low concentrations of Sr and Ba relative to their bulk rocks or groundmasses. The above relationships do not conform with those expected con-sidering the normal laws of trace element distribution (Goldschmidt, 1937; Ringwood, 1955) and the possible reasons for this are discussed in this paper.

40|$|The Rallier-du-Baty Peninsula {{forms the}} southwestern {{part of the}} Kerguelen Archipelago (Indian Ocean), whose magmatic {{activity}} {{is related to the}} long-lived 115 -Ma Kerguelen plume. The peninsula is mostly made of alkaline rocks constituting two well-defined ring complexes. This paper focuses on the northern ring complex, which is not yet known. Recent field studies have revealed seven discrete syenitic <b>ring</b> <b>dykes</b> ranging in age from 6. 2 to 4. 9 Ma, and two later volcanic systems. ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar dating of a trachytic ignimbrite linked to the Dôme Carva volcano complex yields an age of 26 ± 3 Ka. This represents the last major eruptive event on the Kerguelen Archipelago. The volcanism is bimodal with trachybasalts and trachyandesites constituting the mafic lavas and trachytes and rhyolites constituting the felsic lavas. The volume of erupted felsic magma is by far the larger, and is represented by abundant pyroclastic deposits and lava flows. Boulders of plutonic rocks are found to the northwest of Dôme Carva, and represent intermediate rocks (i. e. monzogabbros and monzonites) that are not present at the surface. Basic rocks are mostly trachybasalts and trachyandesites, while true basalts are scarce. Their mineralogy consists chiefly of plagioclase, olivine, diopside and oxides. Sieve-textured plagioclase is common, as well as corroded olivine and diopside phenocrysts. Peralkaline commenditic trachytes are the most abundant type of acid volcanic rocks. They consist of abundant sanidine, augite and magnetite phenocrysts and interstitial quartz, aegerinic pyroxenes and Na-amphiboles. Ring dykes of quartz-poor alkali feldspar syenites display the same mineralogy, except hornblende is common and replaces diopside. Hornblende is particularly abundant in intermediate monzogabbros. Major and trace element variations of volcanic rocks emphasise the predominant role of fractional crystallisation with a general decrease of MgO, CaO, P₂O₅, TiO₂, FeO, Ba, Sr and Ni from basic to felsic rocks. However, the scattering of the data from the basic rocks indicates that other processes have operated. The overall evolution from trachyte to rhyolite is in agreement with the fractionation of sanidine as the major control. An increase of incompatible elements from trachyte to rhyolite is observed. The felsic lavas display an increase of ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr(i) without any significant variations in the Nd isotopic composition. The genesis of the basic rocks is complex and reflects concomitant processes of fractional crystallisation, mixing between different basic magmas and probable assimilation of Ba-rich oceanic crust. Major and trace element modelling confirms the possibility of producing the trachytes through continuous differentiation from a basaltic alkaline parent. Discrepancies observed for some trace elements {{can be explained by the}} crystallisation of amphibole at an intermediate stage of magma evolution. The overall evolution from trachyte to rhyolite is thought to be controlled by crystal fractionation. High ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr(i) of the trachytes is interpreted to reflect interaction with an ocean-derived component, probably during assimilation of hydrothermally altered oceanic crust. Boulders of amphibole-bearing monzonites and monzogabbros found to the northwest of Dôme Carva are thought to represent intermediate magma composition that formed at depths but did not erupt. 34 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the rock units of the Slieve Gullion <b>ring</b> <b>dyke</b> complex, to determine their composition, structure and position within the stratigraphic sequence; as well as producing a model for the emplacement of these units. A combination of detailed field observations, mapping, rock sample collection and structural measurements were obtained at selected field sites around the <b>ring</b> <b>dyke</b> complex. In the laboratory, the rock samples obtained were prepared for thin section and geochemical analysis. When compared to previously published geochemical data, the results found here were generally in agreement. The geochemistry results obtained for the various rock units studied were also generally within the expected igneous rock categories on the IUGS classification graph. There are some exceptions to this however and it is suggested here that those rocks have undergone hydrothermal secondary alteration, which is supported by the presence of infilled fractures within the outcrops and evidence for the presence of hot fluids (tuffisites). The geochemistry data plots all of the rocks studied here (apart from the basalts) within the alkaline or high-k calc-alkaline series on the tectonic environment graph of Ewart (1982). This suggests a cratonic or continental rift environment which supports that this igneous complex is related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The geochemistry results and observations of the thin sections for the rafts of basalt found within the Forkill Quarry both confirm that these outcrops are basalts. It was also found that the basalts were geochemically similar to the Antrim basalts and it is therefore suggested here that the Forkill Quarry basalts predate the formation of the <b>ring</b> <b>dyke.</b> Overall this research agrees with the traditional <b>ring</b> <b>dyke</b> emplacement model as proposed by Emeleus et al. (2012) due to the presence of multiple sharp contacts between the rock units as well as evidence of crushing and the presence of percolating hot fluids near to rock contacts...|$|E

40|$|The {{petrology}} of the Sutherland Commonage olivine melilitite intrusives {{have been}} investigated using petrographic and chemical methods. The occurrence consists of a <b>ring</b> <b>dyke</b> which surrounds a centrally located sill complex. The rock of the <b>ring</b> <b>dyke</b> is a typical melilitite which consists of olivine in a groundmass of melilite, clinopyroxene, opaque spinel, nepheline and perovskite. The sill complex is a multiple intrusion and is comprised of a lower green melilitite and an overlying (and younger) grey melilitite. The green melilitite is deuterically altered and the original mineralogy is destroyed to a large extent. The grey melilitite contains autoliths of the green and is a fairly typical monticellitic melilitite in which phenocrysts of olivine are set in a groundmass of melilite, monticellite, opaque spine!, nepheline and perovskite. Microprobe analyses of clinopyroxenes indicate that they are aluminous titanian diopsides and salites which exhibit complex zonation patterns. They record magmatic conditions ranging from the intrusive stage to a final phase of magmatic evolution during which a vapour phase evolved after {{the majority of the}} groundmass minerals had crystallised. The chemistry of olivine phenocrysts suggests that the parent magma to the Commonage intrusives accumulated in a temperature-zoned reservoir {{at the base of the}} lithosphere. Large, unzoned olivine phenocrysts crystallised in this chamber. Subsequent rupture of the chamber and ascent of magma led to supercooling and the crystallisation of abundant, strongly zoned phenocrysts of smaller size. Olivine crystallisation continued until the magma reached crustal levels. It is inferred from the chemistry of chromites and magnetites that the magma in the <b>ring</b> <b>dyke</b> was more evolved than those in the sill complex and that very oxidising conditions prevailed in the grey melilitite during the crystallisation of magnetite in this intrusive type. The high fO₂ may have resulted from the degassing of CO₂ after intrusion. Major and trace elements have been analysed for in eleven whole rock samples and the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratio was determined for seven of the same samples. The results of the geochemical study suggest that the Commonage melilitites were derived by the melting of a recently metasomatised region of the asthenosphere, probably under the influence of an ocean-island-type hotspot situated in the lower mantle...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of caldera formation {{are affected by}} internal factors, such as magma chamber structure and properties and regional tectonic stresses. Understanding their interrelationship is important for assessing volcanic hazard and reconstructing {{the evolution of a}} volcano. The Monowai volcanic centre, located at the Tonga–Kermadec Arc, is a basaltic–andesitic submarine stratovolcano and caldera. Recent surveys have shown that it is active, but little is known about its structure and evolution. Here we present a combined analysis of swath bathymetry and potential field data from Monowai, acquired during cruise SO 215 on the R/V Sonne, in 2011 April–June. The Monowai caldera is associated with a 20 – 25 mGal Bouguer gravity anomaly high and a broad positive magnetic anomaly. Short-wavelength magnetic anomalies of up to + 1400 and − 800 nT are observed along the caldera rim and on the summit of Monowai cone. Inversion of the Bouguer gravity anomaly data shows that the caldera high is caused by a buried dense body with density contrast of up to + 450 [*]kg[*]m− 3 with respect to the surrounding arc crust. The body has a volume of ∼ 250 [*]km 3 and is divided into a main unit extending from 3 to 6 [*]km depth and a shallower ring structure that underlies the rim of Monowai caldera. We estimate the density of the body to be 2650 – 2850 [*]kg[*]m− 3, suggesting a mafic composition. The ring structure is interpreted as set of <b>ring</b> <b>dykes</b> and the main unit as a solidified or partly solidified magma chamber system (the Monowai pluton). The observed magnetic anomalies are consistent with pluton intrusion within the Bruhnes magnetic polarity. Analysis of the swath bathymetry data shows that Monowai is located in a 20 -km-wide graben, part of an en-echelon, left-stepping horst and graben system that spans the length of the arc and backarc. The Monowai caldera is elongated perpendicular to the direction of rifting, suggesting that it is affected by the regional stress regime. Geomorphological analysis suggests that the caldera was created by repeated collapse of a single caldera structure and that its complex shape and multiple ring faults can be attributed to prolonged activity and multiple cycles of inflation and collapse. We propose a multiphase evolution of the Monowai volcanic centre comprising initial magma emplacement and crustal inflation; magma chamber evacuation and caldera collapse; caldera resurgence and mass waisting; southward migration of the eruptive vent; and formation of Monowai cone. It remains unclear whether the current eruption at the Monowai cone is fed directly from a small underlying magma chamber, or laterally from the Monowai pluton. Observation of radial fissure ridges on its flanks suggests that a shallow magma body may have been recently emplaced beneath the summit causing inflation and the formation of extensional cracks. The summit appears unstable and may be prone to lateral or vertical collapse. Therefore, the region remains a potential source of regional volcanic and tsunami hazard...|$|R
5000|$|The highest {{unit of the}} Cerro Tuzgle volcano is the [...] "Platform" [...] unit, {{which covers}} a surface area of 0.5 km2 and is capped off by a well-preserved summit crater. It {{consists}} of well-preserved blocky lava flows with maximum thicknesses of 30 m. These are the youngest stages of Tuzgle volcanism and are well preserved. Radiating away from the central summit of the volcano, another lava flow unit forms the so-called Azufre synthem; these lava flows reach maximum thicknesses of 15 m and are gray to brownish-red with some evidence of hydrothermal alteration. On the northwestern and southern flanks, lava emission from one emission area down steep slopes form the San Antonio synthem (unconformity bounded unit), with lava flows up to 30 m thick. These San Antonio stage lavas have been cut by a 1.25 km long fault scarp trending NNE-SSW {{that may have been}} formed by a mass failure of the Tuzgle edifice, which was then rebuilt by the Azufre stage lavas. On the northern flank is found a volcaniclastic fan with a surface area of 12 km2, a volume of [...] and thicknesses of 30 - 40 m, presumably, considering its geochemical composition, formed by a mass failure of the San Antonio stage edifice. The scarp was probably formed by the same event but was not accompanied by explosive activity or a pyroclastic flow. This flank collapse may have been triggered by magma injection. A structure on the southern side of the volcano may also be a collapse scar, but no deposit is identifiable. A weakness zone running east-west cuts across the Tuzgle edifice, and some volcanic features are aligned along this weakness. A 5 km wide feeder dyke has been modelled and is associated with this weakness zone. The youngest- and best-exposed lava flow of Cerro Tuzgle originated in a group of three depressions bordered by 1 - 2 m scoria ridges. These depressions, presumably eruption fissures, are arranged in en echelon order. This youngest lava flow has a structure between block lava and aa lava. In non-volcanic terms patterned ground is found resulting from pre-glacial processes.Tuzgle is underpinned by a plateau formed by mostly unwelded ignimbrites, while the so-called [...] "Pre-platform", [...] "Platform", [...] "Post-platform" [...] and [...] "Young Flow" [...] units make up the central volcano. The moderately crystal-rich ignimbrite has a volume of [...] and is 80 m thick, and was presumably emitted from a caldera now buried by the Cerro Tuzgle edifice. Circular lava domes (50 m thick at a maximum) are found in the southeastern, eastern and northern sector of the volcano and may have formed along <b>ring</b> <b>dykes</b> associated with the caldera. A high electrical conductivity zone beneath Tuzgle may constitute a magma chamber embedded within porous material containing saline fluids with the bottom at a depth of at least 22 km and the top at a depth of 8 km. Crustal silicic magmas gave rise to ignimbrites from depths of 15 - 18 km. The magma chamber appears to be placed next to a crustal decollement at 20 km. Thermobarometric data also indicate a magma origin depth of 10 - 20 km. Beneath Tuzgle, a high seismic attenuation plume rises from an earthquake cluster at 200 km depth up to the volcano and is probably linked to asthenospheric upwelling.|$|R
40|$|Both a {{circular}} slip surface stability calculation (Bishop or Fellenius) and a Finite Element Method calculation (c-phi reduction) produce a safety factor {{but not a}} probability of failure or reliability index. A Monte-Carlo method leads, because of the many slip surface calculations, to the most accurate calculation of the probability of safety, but this method is far too time consuming for daily FEM calculations. The idea is therefore to replace the Monte-Carlo approach by a First Order Reliability Method (FORM), based on {{a limited number of}} FEM calculations. A possible problem with this FORM is, that variable soil parameters create a correlated and therefore variable failure mechanism. However, FORM gives an indication of this non-linear behaviour and in most cases an accurate probability of failure of the structure can be calculated. This article gives a complete example of the calculation of the probability of failure of a <b>dyke</b> <b>ring</b> along a river, based on a limited number of Phi-C reduction calculations with Plaxis. The input data for this calculation is based on a limited number of given soil test data...|$|R
