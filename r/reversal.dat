5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic <b>reversal,</b> called the Brunhesâ€“Matuyama <b>reversal,</b> occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete <b>reversal,</b> with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E

40|$|This study investigates whether, {{how and why}} {{industry}} {{performance can}} drive long-term return <b>reversals.</b> Using data from the UK, we find that firms in losing industries significantly outperform those in winning industries over the subsequent five years.

40|$|The {{rod-shaped}} {{cells of}} the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus move uni-directionally and occasionally undergo <b>reversals</b> during which the leading/lagging polarity axis is inverted. Cellular <b>reversals</b> depend on pole-to-pole relocation of motility proteins that localize to the cell poles between <b>reversals.</b> We show that MglA is a Ras-like G-protein and acts as a nucleotide-dependent molecular switch to regulate motility and that MglB represents a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family and is the cognate GAP of MglA. Between <b>reversals,</b> MglA/GTP is restricted to the leading and MglB to the lagging pole defining the leading/lagging polarity axis. For <b>reversals,</b> the Frz chemosensory system induces the relocation of MglA/GTP to the lagging pole causing an inversion of the leading/lagging polarity axis. MglA/GTP stimulates motility by establishing correct polarity of motility proteins between <b>reversals</b> and <b>reversals</b> by inducing their pole-to-pole relocation. Thus, the function of Ras-like G-proteins and their GAPs in regulating cell polarity is found not only in eukaryotes, but also conserved in bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Constructing simpler models, either {{stochastic}} or deterministic, {{for exploring}} the phenomenon of flow <b>reversals</b> in fluid systems is in vogue across disciplines. Using direct numerical simulations and nonlinear time series analysis, we illustrate that the basic nature of flow <b>reversals</b> in convecting fluids can depend on the dimensionless parameters describing the system. Specifically, we find evidence of low-dimensional determinism in flow <b>reversals</b> occurring at zero Prandtl number, whereas we fail to find such signatures for <b>reversals</b> at infinite Prandtl number. Thus, even in a single system, as one varies the system parameters, one can encounter <b>reversals</b> that are fundamentally different in nature.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of firm size on return <b>reversals</b> using weekly returns from January 1980 to December 2011. We find that return <b>reversals</b> are greater for large-firm stocks than for small-firm stocks {{in the first half of}} the study period. However, the firm size effect on return <b>reversals</b> disappears in the second half of the study period. The {{difference}} in the intensity of return <b>reversals</b> between large- and small-firms is dictated by the market conditions. Return <b>reversals</b> of large-firm stocks are greater during the up market period than down market period. In contrast, there is no significant difference for small-firm stocks between up and down markets. A high institutional demand for large-firm stocks results in high demand for immediacy as well as strong return <b>reversals</b> for these stocks in the first half of the study period. After institutions shifted their preferences to stocks of smaller firms since the mid- 1990 s, return <b>reversals</b> for large-firm stocks became insignificantly different from small-size firms in the second half of the study period...|$|R

This essay {{examines}} {{what causes}} the significant negative relation between idiosyncratic risk and subsequent stock returns, {{as shown by}} Ang et al. (2006 a, 2006 b). Our analyses demonstrate that this negative relation is driven by monthly return <b>reversals</b> as documented in the previous literature (e. g. Jegadeesh (1990)). The abnormal positive returns from taking a long (short) position in the low (high) idiosyncratic risk portfolio are fully explained by an additional control variable, the "winners minus losers" portfolio returns, introduced to the conventional three- or four-factor time-series regression model. The cross-sectional regressions confirm that no significant relation exists between idiosyncratic risk and expected returns once we control for return <b>reversals.</b> Dissertation Essay II. There are two approaches to explain the short-term return <b>reversals.</b> Liquidity hypothesis argues that non-informational trades generate return <b>reversals</b> and informational trades cause return continuations.
