5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then <b>reposition</b> the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{industry}} is today struggling with its productivity as products keep failing after long and expensive development programs. The protability is further threatened by erce competition from cheaper product copies. As {{an attempt to}} increase the pipeline output, pharmaceutical companies have lately turned to the strategy of drug <b>repositioning.</b> By applying an already developed drug in new disease areas the lifetime of the product is prolonged and return time on already made investments elongated.   Such development is imbued by less risk than a de novo development and {{has proven to be}} a faster and cheaper way to meet the medical demand. With limited company budgets and the often many <b>repositioning</b> possibilities, an informed <b>repositioning</b> selection must be made. As such theoretical model is not publicly available this thesis takes on the task to determine which parameters to take into consideration and how these should be weighted in relation to each other in order to evaluate di erent drug <b>repositioning</b> possibilities. Six main topics are identied to a ect the <b>repositioning</b> success, these are: medical need, economic return, scientic support, timing, life cycle extenders and external relations. These ndings are derived from empirics collected during interviews with employees from ve di erent competence areas involved in <b>repositioning</b> initiatives, na mely: research & development, clinical studies, regulatory a airs, pricing, and commercial. By further support from literature within the elds of drug <b>repositioning</b> and R&D project selection a three-step <b>repositioning</b> model was developed. The first step in the three-step <b>repositioning</b> model consists of primary parameters, these are essential parameters that have to be fullled in order to perform a <b>repositioning</b> strategy. If any of the primary parameters are not fullled, the <b>repositioning</b> opportunity should be killed in a go/no-go decision. In a second step, the secondary parameters are evaluated in a scoring model in order to determine the economical outlook of each <b>repositioning</b> opportunity. The opportunities showing greatest economical outlook should further be evaluated in the third and nal step in the three-step <b>repositioning</b> model. In this nal step the di erent <b>repositioning</b> opportunities are evaluated by their coherence with an overall corporate strategy. By applying this <b>repositioning</b> model to a <b>repositioning</b> selection scarce company resources  ay be focused on the <b>repositioning</b> opportunities showing best future prospect. Evaluating the potential of <b>repositioning</b> opportunities in a structured way should also increase chances to succeed. If successful, a <b>repositioning</b> initiative may a ect both company and society as the company improves return on earlier investments, while more patients in need of treatment will receive access to it. However, the three-step <b>repositioning</b> model presented in this thesis should be tested for more cases and perhaps be complemented with additional parameters or di erent gradings in order to optimize the selection...|$|R

The helicopters frequently formed part of the Australian Defence Force's response to natural disasters, including by delivering food for people and livestock cut off by floods. They were also used for civilian construction tasks such as emplacing lighthouses and carrying air conditioning plants {{to the top of}} tall buildings. On two occasions Chinooks supported Queensland Police Service drug eradication efforts in remote parts of the state by transporting fuel for RAAF Iroquois helicopters and carrying seized narcotics. In August 1981, two CH-47s lifted containers from the cargo ship Waigani Express to enable the vessel to be refloated after it ran aground in the Torres Strait. A similar operation was undertaken to free the Anro Asia when it ran aground near Caloundra, Queensland, in November the same year. Another unusual task was conducted in December 1981 when a Chinook transported two bulldozers onto a grounded iron ore carrier near Port Hedland, Western Australia, so that they could be used to <b>reposition</b> the ship's load.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to <b>reposition</b> themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery, after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E
40|$|<b>Repositioning</b> is {{conscious}} {{adaptation to}} a changing environment, representing {{a fundamental shift}} in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s value proposition (Turner, 2003). <b>Repositioning</b> as a pure play is largely neglected in the strategy literature, while empirical studies are rare.

A framework for successful <b>repositioning</b> is proposed, with six elements: core strategic values, strategic flexibility/learning capabilities, customer awareness and sensitivity, external orientation, management commitment, and belief in the product and brand. The Bulmers case affirms the ontological status of <b>repositioning</b> as a viable strategy. The case also indicates that <b>repositioning</b> is a feasible means of strategic change, which is transformational with limited scale, and is largely intellectual and enacted with strategic learning.

By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to <b>reposition</b> the chain as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting.

Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to <b>reposition</b> the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV) {{can be treated}} using a simple <b>repositioning</b> maneuver. This study demonstrates the effects of early <b>repositioning</b> therapy in patients with BPPV, {{especially with regard to}} recurrence. Methods. We enrolled 138 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with BPPV in the emergency rooms and ENT out-patient clinics of Chung-Ang University Hospital and Samyook Medical Center from January to June 2009. All patients immediately underwent appropriate canalith <b>repositioning</b> procedures (CRPs) depending on canalith type and location. The CRPs were performed daily until the patient’s symptoms were resolved. The patients were classified into two groups according to the duration between symptom onset and initial treatment: less than 24 hours (early <b>repositioning</b> group, n= 66) and greater 24 hours (delayed <b>repositioning</b> group, n= 72). We prospectively compared the numbers of treatments received and the recurrence rates between the two groups. Results. Follow-up periods ranged from 8 to 14 months, 77 cases involved posterior canal BPPV, 48 cases were lateral canal BPPV (of which 20 cases were cupulolithiasis), and 13 cases were multiple canal BPPV. BPPV recurrence was found in a total of 46 patients (33. 3 %). The necessary numbers of CRPs were 2. 3 for the early <b>repositioning</b> group and 2. 5 for the late <b>repositioning</b> group, a difference that was not statistically significant (P= 0. 582).

Twenty-five asymptomatic young adults (age range 18 - 30 years) were recruited for the study. The subjects were measured for dorsal neck muscle strength (kg) with a digital dynamo-meter. The <b>repositioning</b> errors (degrees) were measured by two cervicocephalic kinaesthetic sensibility tests: the head-to-neutral head position <b>repositioning</b> and head-to-target <b>repositioning</b> tests.
