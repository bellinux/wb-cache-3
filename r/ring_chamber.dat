40|$|The fi ring {{process for}} clay-brick {{production}} in traditional kilns generates at-mospheric pollution when industrial and domestic scrap {{is used as}} fuel. An alternative is presented here, using the solar energy for clay-brick fi ring. We are developing a system for clay-brick fi ring to reach temperatures between 900 °C and 1050 °C; these temperatures are suffi ciently high to fi re bricks or similar ceramic products. The present paper describes the design and charac-terization {{of the components of}} a solar furnace for clay-brick fi ring with inner chamber dimensions of 0. 48 × 0. 61 × 0. 64 m. To convey the sunlight to the fi-ring chamber, a heliostat with nine 1 × 1 m mirrors is used to send the rays of the sun to an off-axis parabolic concentrator that focuses the light on the en-trance of the fi <b>ring</b> <b>chamber.</b> The heliostat has a solar-tracking system which makes primary and secondary adjustments to assure that the refl ected solar radiation always arrives at the concentrator. The fi <b>ring</b> <b>chamber</b> contains a prismatic cavity that absorbs the solar radiation to generate the heat which i...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{macroscopic}} stress distributions in {{horizontal and vertical}} directions in non-bonded aggregates, {{as well as the}} contact forces (local stresses) at the contact areas ("microscopic'). A <b>ring</b> <b>chamber</b> was used to study the horizontal and vertical stresses under static vertical loads, whereas contact area stresses were measured using pressure film placed {{in different parts of the}} equipment. The pressure films reveal elevated contact forces at some contact areas in response to the applied load, and the grain size range of the particles also influences the stress (contact force) distribution: fine-grained aggregates distribute forces more evenly than coarse-grained aggregates. When an open fraction of aggregates is used, the coarse-grained aggregates have a greater role in supporting loads, as higher contact forces are transmitted across contact areas between large aggregate particles...|$|E
50|$|The base {{contains}} a meeting room, a small kitchen, and toilets. A spiral staircase leads {{up to the}} <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> where the bell ropes are arranged in a circle. On {{the walls of the}} chamber are tablets commemorating peals previously rung by the guild. Above the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> is the sound chamber and, at the top, the belfry.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is reached}} by the 15th-century spiral {{staircase}} from {{the ground floor of}} the tower. The room contains the church clock, installed in 1911 as a memorial to the family of John Rose. The <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> was probably the medieval priests' lodgings, and as such has the typical window giving a view of the chancel. A wooden ladder leads up to the bell chamber.|$|R
50|$|The bells are rung {{regularly}} by a {{team from}} the village, supported by ringers from the nearby parish church at Salford. The bell <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> is {{on the first floor}} of the tower which is entered by the south door in the base of the tower. The <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> is accessed by a short flight of ladder type steps with a trap-door at the top, which is closed during ringing.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe are {{studying}} a new scheme to produce very low emittance muon beams using a positron beam of about 45 GeV interacting on electrons on target. This is a challenging and innovative scheme that needs a full design study. One of the innovative topics {{to be investigated}} is the behaviour of the positron beam stored in a low emittance ring with a thin target, that is directly inserted in the <b>ring</b> <b>chamber</b> to produce muons. Muons will be immediately collected at the exit of the target and transported to two mu+ and mu- accumulator rings. We focus in this paper on the simulation of the e⁺ beam interacting with the target, its degradation in the 6 -D phase space and the optimization of the e⁺ ring design mainly to maximize the energy acceptance. We will investigate the performances of this scheme, ring optics plus target system, comparing different multi-turn simulations...|$|E

A crotch absorber design {{for use in the}} Advanced Photon Source (APS) has been proposed and analyzed. The absorber is placed downstream of sectors S 2 and S 4 in the curved storage <b>ring</b> <b>chamber</b> W and wili be subjected to a peak power of ISO = • per 100 mA synchrotron radiation. A beryllium mm 2 ring is brazed on the GlidCop cooling cylinder in order to diffuse the concentrated bending magnet heating. One concentric water channel and two annular return water channels are arranged in the GlidCop cylinder to enhance the coolinf. A Bodner-Partom thermoviscoplastic constitutive equation and a modified Manson-Cofnn fatigue relation are proposed to simulate the cyclic thermal loading, as well as to predict the thermal fatigue life of the crotch absorber. Results of temperature and stress using finite element computations are displayed and series of e-beam welder tests and microstructure measurements are reported. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we will {{describe}} {{some of the}} recent experimental measurements [1, 2, 3] performed at CESRTA [4], and the supporting simulations, which probe the interaction of the electron cloud with the stored beam. These experiments have been done over a wide range of beam energies, emittances, bunch currents, and fill patterns, to gather sufficient information to be able to fully characterize the beam-electron-cloud interaction and validate the simulation programs. The range of beam conditions is chosen to be {{as close as possible to}} those of the ILC damping ring, so that the validated simulation programs can be used to predict the performance of these rings with regard to electroncloud- related phenomena. Using the new simulation code Synrad 3 D to simulate the synchrotron radiation environment, a vacuum chamber design has been developed for the ILC damping ring which achieves the required level of photoelectron suppression. To determine the expected electron cloud density in the ring, EC buildup simulations have been done based on the simulated radiation environment and on the expected performance of the ILC damping <b>ring</b> <b>chamber</b> mitigation prescriptions. The expected density has been compared with analytical estimates of the instability threshold, to verify that the ILC damping ring vacuum chamber design is adequate to suppress the electron cloud single-bunch head-tail instability.

5000|$|The {{church has}} ten bells with a tenor weight of [...] The <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> is {{accessed}} via a wooden staircase of 54 steps.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> of {{the tower}} was {{refurbished}} in 2008. The tower is {{the headquarters of the}} Chester Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers.|$|R
5000|$|He {{invented a}} device, {{now known as}} an Ellacombe apparatus, with chiming hammers, to enable one person to chime all the bells in a tower. However in reality, it {{required}} very advanced and rare expertise for one person to ring changes on multiple bells, and the apparatus fell out of fashion. Consequently the Ellacombe apparatus {{has been removed from}} many towers in the UK, but there are still visible holes in the ceiling which the ropes would come through into the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> and often the frames are still in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> without ropes.|$|R
50|$|The ring {{of eight}} bells was {{increased}} to ten on 20 November 1999. At {{the same time}} a new ground floor <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> was created {{at the foot of the}} tower.|$|R
50|$|Below {{the bell}} chamber {{there may be}} one or more sound chambers, (one of {{which is likely to}} house the clock {{mechanism}} if the church has one) and through which the rope passes before it drops into the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> or room. Typically, the rope's length is such that it falls close to or on {{to the floor of the}} <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b> About 5 ft from the floor, the rope has a woolen grip called the sally (usually around 4 ft long) while the lower end of the rope is doubled over to form an easily held tail-end.|$|R
50|$|However in reality, it {{required}} very advanced and rare expertise {{for one person}} to ring changes, which most churches did not have and it alienated bell ringers from the church. The sound of a chime was a feeble substitute for the rich sound of swinging bells, and the apparatus fell out of fashion. Consequently the Ellacombe apparatus {{has been removed from}} many towers in the UK, but there are still visible holes in the ceiling which the ropes would come through into the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> and often the frames are still in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> without ropes.|$|R
5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows {{light the}} staircase to the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b> There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The tower {{contains}} 8 bells by Mear and Stainbank of Whitechapel in London. There {{is also a}} clock {{mechanism in}} the bell <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> built in 1897, this mechanism also plays the Westminster Chimes {{using some of the}} eight bells.|$|R
50|$|The ringers {{stand in}} a <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> below, and the ropes pass through holes in the ceiling. The rope has a woollen grip called the sally while {{the lower end of}} the rope is doubled over to form an easily held tail-end.|$|R
50|$|St Peter's Church has large ring of ten bells {{which is}} {{unusual for a}} small rural church. A closed-circuit {{television}} camera in the belfry, enables {{the movement of the}} bells to be seen in real time view on a monitor in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
50|$|The West end is {{dominated}} by the medieval stone tower. The stone is random laid ragstone with flint dressings in parts. The tower is crenellated with three stages. The lowest stage is divided externally by a string course between the door and the window. Above it is the old <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> and above that the bell chamber. In the Northeast corner of the tower, adjacent to the nave wall is a small stair turret with an external door. This gives access to the old <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> the bell chamber and the roof. There are three step diagonal buttresses on the Western corners, the East of the tower is effectively buttressed by the nave. A perpendicular style three light window above the West door illuminates the ground floor.|$|R
50|$|For {{the latter}} {{quarter of the}} 20th century the bells were unringable, but a major project in 2005-6 saw the bells removed, retuned (at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry) and rehung in a new frame. They are now rung from the ground floor instead of the 1960 <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} four fixed bells which are struck by hammers {{operated}} by bell ropes from the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b> Two of the bells' hammers require repair (damaged due to {{wear and tear}} 2005). The smallest bell is most used as it has a second pulley in a more convenient location.|$|R
50|$|Lillington {{church clock}} {{was made by}} Potts of Leeds and {{installed}} in 1897. It seems that the tower had no clock before then. The clock was renovated, the four dials repainted and gilded, and the mechanism repositioned within the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> by the Cumbria Clock Company of Penrith in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Avilionella is a Middle Ordovician tarphyceroid genus {{consisting}} of closely coiled, compressed shells {{with a small}} perforation in the center, shallow dorsal impression, and subventral tubular siphuncle with thin connecting <b>rings.</b> <b>Chambers</b> are very short, separated by closely spaced, dish-shaped septa. Coiling becomes loose in the mature, adoral, part of the shell.|$|R
2500|$|As {{is still}} {{recorded}} {{today on the}} charity board of Grantham church (in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> of the church's bell tower), in 1706 a Mr. Michael Sullivan left a benefaction to the church for a sermon against drunkenness, to be paid by the Angel Inn. As recorded in the Grantham Register the benefaction was: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1988, to {{mark the}} Australian Bicentennial, six of the bells were {{converted}} to 'full circle' swinging operation from the original chiming operation. The original metal tower louvres were then replaced with wooden shutters which can be opened or closed to alter decibel levels and the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> was made accessible by a spiral staircase.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} {{topped by a}} shingle spire set within the battlements. Fine views are afforded all round, but access is through the bell chamber which is {{difficult}} and not open to the public. There are three stages, the lowest being a west end porch, above that the present <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> and above that the bell chamber.|$|R
50|$|The {{lists of}} {{members from the}} first century of the Society's {{existence}} shows that at that time it attracted {{some of the great}} names in ringing history, such as John Reeves, George Gross and William Shipway, and records of the many first performances achieved at that time still exist in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chambers</b> of City churches.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} six bells. The bells {{naturally}} sound very loud inside the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> (from where the bells are rung); to combat this the bells are permanently fitted with leather muffles {{on both sides}} of the clapper. When ringing the bells they have a strange sound because of this; almost as if they are ringing inside a large tank of water.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the church}} there are wagon roofs, {{plastered}} in the nave and aisles and ornately {{painted in the}} chancel and transepts. The chancel has piscina, sedilia and aumbry, above which the continuous east window sill string forms a hood. Some of the wall panelling in the north aisle, and the boxing in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> probably re-used woodwork from the 17th century pews.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} {{numerous}} examples of early graffiti. The {{restoration of the}} church in 1895 sympathetically used as much stone as possible from the original building, although it was not always possible for it to be repositioned in the right place. As a result graffiti appears in wall spaces where they would not normally be expected. There are good examples in the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber,</b> the Oakley Room and in the gallery.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{there was}} a ring of eight bells, but this was replaced, in 1762, by Lester & Packe of Whitechapel Bell Foundry, London, with a ring of ten bells. In 1909 all ten bells were {{completely}} restored by Taylors Eayre & Smith Ltd (Loughborough) and re-hung on a new steel frame. The <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> is on the second level of the tower, and the belfry is on the fourth.|$|R
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20th Century red carpets were {{fitted in}} the church, the choir pews removed, and a balcony added - {{although}} no additional stairs were added, so access to the balcony was still via the stone bell tower steps and through the <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b> [...] Sound systems were also installed during this period as was a large screen - initially to use with an overhead projector and later with a digital projector.er [...]|$|R
500|$|Until 1952, {{the church}} had a ring of fivebells hung for change ringing; and at this time, a sixth bell was added and one bell was recast, {{replacing}} a 1727 bell by Henry Penn of Peterborough. The oldest bell as of 2010, is the [...] number fourbell of 1796 by Joseph Eayre; the newest are of 1951 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. This set of sixbells are rung from a first-floor <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> above the recently constructed servery and toilets.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{of the church is}} based on the 1824 preaching chapel design. The rectangular interior is reduced in width at the East end by vestries and stairs. The galleries down both sides contribute to an impression only of a cruciform shape. The supporting wooden columns are in Doric style below and are carried up to the ceiling as Ionic style. The base of the tower is a few steps lower than the nave and is the current <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It became {{traditional}} for {{the bells}} to be rung when important visitors, especially monarchs or {{other members of}} the Royal Family, came to the town; a series of tablets preserved {{at the base of the}} <b>ringing</b> <b>chamber</b> give details of each [...] "special occasion" [...] on which the bells were rung for an extended period, such as Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. More recently, the bells were rung half-muffled for the funeral of Henry Allingham on 30 July 2009.|$|R
