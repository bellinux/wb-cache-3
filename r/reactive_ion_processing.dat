40|$|We {{report on}} the use of {{conventional}} non-Bosch, non-cryogenic <b>Reactive</b> <b>Ion</b> Etching (RIE) <b>processing</b> to produce a range of low optical reflection morphologies on silicon wafer. Tapered structures and nano dendritic-pillars are patterned into silicon over a pressure range of 550 - 700 mTorr at various run times. Low pressure RIE conditions yield tapered profiles while at higher pressures nano-pillars are produced. The optimized condition of 650 mTorr for 20 - 30 minutes yields uniform distribution of nano dendritic pillars resulting in a low average reflectance of 4. 2 % – without an additional antireflective coating. A simple kinetic Monte-Carlo model shows that nano-dendritic structures can be formed due to low etching rate of side walls and evolve into tapered structures over a longer run time. Refractive index profiles built from our simulated patterns and surface morphology of the samples yield calculated reflectance curves that correlate well with experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of deep <b>reactive</b> <b>ion</b> etching (DRIE) technology has greatly expanded the accessible design space for microscopic systems. Structures that {{are hundreds of}} micrometers tall with aspect ratios of 40 : 1, heretofore impossible, can now be achieved. However, this technology is primarily a forming technology, sculpting structures from a substrate. This work seeks to complement deep <b>reactive</b> <b>ion</b> etching by developing an electrical isolation technology to enable electro-mechanical function in these new deep <b>reactive</b> <b>ion</b> etched structures. The objective of the research is twofold. The first is to develop and characterize an electrical isolation technology for DRIE, single crystal silicon (SCS) micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) using temperature gradient zone melting (TGZM) of aluminum junctions for diodic isolation.
