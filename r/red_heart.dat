5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a <b>red</b> <b>heart,</b> and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have {{become a part of the}} Scout's life and character.|$|E

2500|$|There {{also exist}} standard-issue {{specialty}} plates. For instance, {{a number of}} states issued plates recognizing the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976.

Tennessee commemorated its 1996 bicentennial celebration by issuing standard plates labeled [...] "BicenTENNial" [...] in the place of the state's name; these plates remained standard issue until 2001, five years after the celebration had ended.

50|$|Some decks, {{while using}} the French suits, give each suit a {{different}} color to make the suits more distinct from each other.

A pack occasionally used in Germany uses green spades (compare to leaves), <b>red</b> <b>hearts,</b> yellow diamonds (compare to bells) and black clubs (compare to acorns).
