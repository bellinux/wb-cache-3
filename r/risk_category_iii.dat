Many of these new designs incorporate only a single system for resisting lateral seismic loading. is design approach {{has not yet been}} tested by a significant earthquake in the western United States. For instance, the August 24, 2014 Napa earthquake (M 6. 0) generated peak ground acceleration on the order of three percent gravity (or less) at ground zero for San Francisco’s relatively new concrete ductile core high-rises, nowhere near the level of ground acceleration expected in DBE or MCE earthquakes with epicenters inside 15 miles of ground zero. ASCE 7 provides guidance to the developer when threshold seismic performance tar-gets are selected, specifying appropriate “Risk Categories ” and “Importance Factors”. When the expected occupancy use is residential, most owners and structural designers use Risk Category II, with an Importance Factor of 1. 00. In contrast, when the structure is expected to be used as an office building, many owners and structural designers use <b>Risk</b> <b>Category</b> <b>III,</b> with an Importance Factor of 1. 25. Using <b>Risk</b> <b>Category</b> <b>III</b> and an Importance Factor of 1. 25 for new high-rise resi-dential projects employing the concrete ductile core design approach should increase the seismic resiliency and simultaneously reduce the owner’s legal risk profile because of expected improved seismic performance in DBE and MCE events. Taking into account the extra costs of construction, adhering to <b>Risk</b> <b>Category</b> <b>III</b> design criteria should yield substantial long-term benefits for owners of these high-rises and help to manage their seismic risk in the legal arena...|$|E
40|$|The pathway {{from the}} flash of a {{technological}} invention until its use as a medical device in every day care is tedious and burdensome. But the often postulated acceleration has to balance the speed of innovation and the indispensable product safety by an improved understanding of the innovation cycle. While several studies investigated {{the time course of}} pharmaceutical innovation, a comparable empirical analysis of medical devices is lacking. Thus we evaluated the time between the patent priority date and the corresponding receipt of the CE mark as a function of a medical device risk class in 61 cases. The statistical analysis yielded a time increment (trend) from medical devices in risk category I (median = 5. 8 years) compared to <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> <b>III</b> (median = 10. 4 years), which is close to literature reported values for drug development (9 – 12 years). The difference between products in risk classes I and II did not reach significance. To investigate the underlying facts, a text-mining approach especially to resolve the ambiguity of, e. g. patents, CE Marks etc. is suggested for increasing the sample size...|$|E
40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), {{also know}} as prion diseases, {{represent}} {{a group of}} fatal neurodegenerative disorders in humans and several free-ranging and captive mammalian species. A report of scrapie in mouflon from England {{and the fact that}} Germany’s free-ranging mouflon population is the second largest in the world raised the question if mouflon in Germany are affected by TSEs. Therefore, the aim of this survey was (1) to examine the prevalence of prion diseases in mouflon from Germany, and (2) to determine the genetic susceptibility of the populations. Thus a population screening for prion diseases and a sequence analysis of the prion protein gene (PRNP) were carried out. According to the results, a detailed risk assessment was aimed for. All administrative districts in Germany were divided into risk categories defined by the number of reported scrapie cases in domestic sheep, the number of hunted mouflon per year, and the abundance of sheep. Screening included districts of risk categories III and II where the probability to discover TSEs in mouflon was highest. Mouflon ewes and rams older than 18 months collected from hunting bags during the hunting seasons 2006 / 2007 and 2007 / 2008 were sampled. In order to detect classical and atypical scrapie cases, samples were taken from brain stem, cerebellum and retropharyngeal lymph nodes. The samples were analysed by an accredited laboratory using a highly sensitive rapid test (IDEXX HerdChek BSE-scrapie). Mouflon of all screening districts were chosen at random for PRNP genotyping. Brain tissue samples were used for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR amplification and sequencing of an 862 base pair long DNA fragment. All sequences received were compared with gene bank submissions of sheep and mouflon and translated into their amino acid sequences. Focus was the 771 base pair long prion protein coding sequence, especially codons 136, 154, and 171, since these are associated to TSE susceptibility. A total of 2. 453 tissue samples of 823 mouflon from 39 administrative districts were analysed. Protease resistant prion protein (PrPSc) was not detected in any of the examined brain and lymph node samples; all mouflon were TSE negative. All samples from districts of the same risk category were pooled for further analysis and estimation of the detection limits with a probability of 95 percent. TSE prevalence in adult mouflon during the sample period was less than 0. 56 % in districts of <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> <b>III</b> and 1. 2 % in districts of risk category II. Genotyping of the PRNP sequence of 246 mouflon was performed. The sequence-based analysis showed that all tested mouflon carried the same ARQ/ARQ genotype. Thus the genotype is independent of the geographic origin and appears to reflect naturalisation history. Accordingly, it can be assumed that ARQ/ARQ is the only existing genotype in mouflon in Germany. This study represents the most comprehensive survey on TSE and prion protein genotypes in free-ranging mouflon. At present, evidence of prion diseases in the German mouflon population has not been found. However, it cannot be entirely ruled out that prion diseases are present in the populations at very low prevalence, since a sample survey was performed. Results of the genotyping indicate that mouflon are genetically highly susceptible to classical scrapie and BSE and susceptible to atypical scrapie. In addition a potential direct and indirect contact to scrapie-infected domestic sheep results in a high exposure risk for mouflon in certain areas. Mouflon {{should be included in the}} TSE surveillance to ascertain a sound free-ranging population and to meet the precaution principle. Passive surveillance should be performed on all clinically conspicuous mouflon, including a veterinary examination and a rapid test. Active surveillance, i. e. examination of all hunted and fallen mouflon, is advisable for all areas with a high exposure risk to classical scrapie...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) {{guidelines}} {{for the prevention of}} atherosclerotic diseases 2012 (JAS 2012) proposed lipid management targets; however, less data is available regarding the attainment rates of each target in community-based settings. Therefore, we assessed the attainment rates of lipid management targets among subjects who underwent Japanese specific health checkups. Methods: A total of 85, 716 subjects (male= 29, 282, 34. 2 %) aged 40 – 74 years who underwent specific health checkups from 2012 to 2014 in Kanazawa city, Japan, were included in this study. We evaluated the attainment rates of the lipid management targets according to the JAS 2012 guideline and investigated the clinical characteristics of the subjects without achieving the targets. Results: The target for LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) was the least attained in all <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> 89, 72, 50, and 34 % for <b>category</b> I, II, <b>III,</b> and secondary prevention, respectively, in 2014. In addition, these rates inversely correlated with the grade of <b>risk</b> <b>categories</b> (p-value for trends ＜ 0. 001). Attainment rate of the LDL-C target in the suspected chronic kidney disease (CKD) group was significantly lower than in the groups with diabetes, stroke, or absolute <b>risk</b> in <b>category</b> <b>III</b> (49. 2, 60. 3, 63. 5, 54. 4 %, respectively, p-value ＜ 0. 001 for each). Moreover, the attainment rate of the LDL-C target was significantly lower in subjects that did not receive lipid-lowering therapy than in those who received it in the secondary prevention (27. 7 and 40. 6 %, respectively, p-value ＜ 0. 001). Conclusions: Lipid management is inadequate in community-based settings, particularly, in subjects with CKD and secondary prevention. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} and characterize an exercise test {{for use in}} routine spinal cord injury clinical review, and (ii) to describe levels of, and factors affecting, cardiopulmonary stress performance during exercise in the chronic paraplegic population in Scotland, UK. Cross-sectional study Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit (Glasgow, Scotland) 48 subjects with chronic paraplegia resulting from spinal cord injury at neurological levels T 2 -L 2 Peak oxygen uptake, peak power output, gas exchange threshold and peak heart rate were determined from an incremental arm-cranking exercise test. Using a general linear model, the effects of gender, high (injury level above T 6) versus low paraplegia, time since injury, body mass and age on peak oxygen uptake and peak power output were investigated. All 48 subjects completed the arm-cranking exercise test, which was shown to be practical for fitness screening in paraplegia. Men (n= 38) had a peak oxygen uptake of 1. 302 +/- 0. 326 l. min- 1 (mean +/- s. d.) and peak power output of 81. 6 +/- 23. 2 W, which {{was significantly higher than}} for women (n= 10), at 0. 832 +/- 0. 277 l. min- 1 and 50. 1 +/- 27. 8 W, respectively. There was large intersubject variability in cardiopulmonary performance during arm-cranking exercise testing, but the overall mean for the Scottish population was lower than reference values from other countries. Arm-cranking exercise tests are feasible in the clinical environment. The motivation for their implementation is threefold: (i) to determine cardiopulmonary stress performance of individual paraplegic patients, (ii) to stratify patients into cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> and (<b>iii)</b> to monitor the effects of targeted exercise prescription...|$|R
