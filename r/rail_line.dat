5|$|The HSRC {{continued}} to operate this <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> until December 11, 1911, {{when it was}} purchased by the Moorefield and Virginia Railroad Company. The Moorefield and Virginia Railroad Company assumed the $700,000 mortgage against the <b>rail</b> <b>line.</b> Cornwell and Eugene Ailes, the son-in-law of his brother John Jacob, served as officers of the conveyancing company for the transaction.

5|$|From that junction, M-71 turns easterly {{and then}} southeasterly out of town. The highway {{continues}} to run alongside the <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> through farmland to {{the outskirts of}} Vernon. M-71 crosses the Shiawassee River for a second time. The <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> and the highway diverge and run on opposite sides of town; the highway rounds the northeast side and the <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> runs along the southwest side. This section of trunkline through Vernon had the lowest AADT value in 2009 with 4,371vehicles. M-71 continues to the interchange with I-69 at exit118 northwest of Durand, where the highway designation terminates. No part of M-71 has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E

5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

5|$|North of Artesia Boulevard, the <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> descends {{into the}} 10-mile (16km) Mid-Corridor Trench, with two streets {{straddling}} it at ground level: Alameda Street {{to the west}} and a local frontage road to the east. All cross streets are thus grade-separated from the <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> while intersecting the streets at grade, except for Rosecrans Avenue, which bridges over all three. Crossings along this segment include the Century Freeway (I-105, no access), Imperial Highway, Firestone Boulevard (former SR 42), and Slauson Avenue. Just south of 25th Street, the <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> curves northeast out of the trench, and the two roadways join to become a single Alameda Street, which soon interchanges with the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), {{at the north end of}} what is legislated as Route 47. The street continues north through the east side of downtown Los Angeles, crossing the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) just west of Union Station, and ending soon after at Elmyra Street, where it becomes Spring Street.|$|E

5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>line</b> would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E
