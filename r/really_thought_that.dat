[...] Soon afterward, Winehouse's father commented that when he had made public statements regarding her problems he was using the media because it seemed {{the only way to}} get through to her. In an interview with The Album Chart Show on British television, Winehouse said she was manic depressive and not alcoholic, adding that that sounded like [...] "an alcoholic in denial." [...] A US reporter writes that Winehouse was a [...] "victim of mental illness in a society that doesn't understand or respond to mental illness with great effectiveness." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Heath telephoned Margaret Thatcher to {{tell her}} {{that he was going to}} sack Powell, she responded: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis". Heath sacked Powell from his Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech and he never held another senior {{political}} post. Powell received almost 120,000 (predominantly positive) letters and a Gallup poll at the end of April showed that 74 per cent of those asked agreed with his speech and only 15 per cent disagreed, with 11 per cent unsure. One poll concluded that between 61 and 73 per cent disagreed with Heath sacking Powell.|$|E

2500|$|Garbage's {{intention}} is to make pop-like songs which mixed a variety of genres, with Steve Marker saying that the band wanted to [...] "take pop music and make it as horrible sounding as we can." [...] These genres include trip hop, grunge, 1980s rock music, techno, power pop and shoegazing. Shirley Manson has stated that the band itself [...] "used to describe [...] as sci-fi pop, because {{we felt it was}} taking a futuristic approach." [...] Vig has said the crossover-heavy sound was inspired by the band's background with remixes, where songs would be rearranged to every musical style to which they held interest, and also that he [...] "grew up listening to everything from pop radio and opera to country music and polka, so I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Garbage would be an interesting and eclectic thing to do." ...|$|E

I’m just really honored. If anything at all, I hope I can be an inspiration to any one or any group that has not seen themselves in certain positions. We all want to see people who look like us doing certain things to give us inspiration. Hopefully, I can inspire someone to be able to say, 'I can do that.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{organization}} {{became known}} {{for having the}} finest equipment run by expert engineers led by Catero and Jones. Mastering engineer Paul Stubblebine stayed on at the studio, changing employers from CBS to Rubinson. Other gold- and platinum-level engineers who polished their craft at the Automatt include Jim Gaines, Maureen Droney, Ken Kessie, David Frazer, Michael Rosen and John Nowland. Jones said that, at one time when the studio had six engineers on staff, [...] "three of them were women"; no other major recording studio could boast such feminist equality at the time. She said, [...] "the funny thing is, I don't think that David Rubinson even <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about <b>that.</b> You see, the integrity and vibe came from the top down." [...] Three of the studio's managers were women: Susan Skaggs, Janice Lee and Michele Zarin. All three went on to manage or operate other recording studios.|$|R

For the first two years of my married life, I <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> the girl <b>that</b> was for me was still that girl that was in high school.

6000|$|With {{regard to}} some of these {{subjects}} Lincoln modified his position at a later period, and {{it has been suggested that}} he would have professed more advanced principles in his debates with Douglas, had he not feared thereby to lose votes. This view can hardly be sustained. Lincoln had the courage of his opinions, but he was not a radical. The man who risked his election by delivering, against the urgent protest of his friends, the speech about [...] "the house divided against itself" [...] would not have shrunk from the expression of more extreme views, had he really entertained them. It is only fair to assume that he said what at the time he <b>really</b> <b>thought,</b> and <b>that</b> if, subsequently, his opinions changed, it was owing to new conceptions of good policy and of duty brought forth by an entirely new set of circumstances and exigencies. It is characteristic that he continued to adhere to the impracticable colonization plan even after the Emancipation Proclamation had already been issued.|$|R

The album, which Common revealed was originally {{going to be an}} EP, is set to feature Vince Staples, James Fauntleroy and [...] "some new artists from Chicago." [...] The concept of the album was inspired by his troubled hometown of Chicago: [...] "We came up with this concept 'nobody's smiling.' It was <b>really</b> a <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> came about because of all the violence in Chicago," [...] he says. [...] "It happens in Chicago, but it's happening around the world in many ways."

Some even expressed sympathy for Rockefeller. While they said they had no fears of the accident recurring, and indeed some said it was safer than driving, one woman was surprised that there had been no fail-safe systems that could have prevented the derailment.
