5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, <b>regional</b> <b>economy,</b> tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E

Refining and manufacturing grew rapidly in the area, particularly around Baytown, Pasadena, and Texas City. The opening of the Port of Texas City, and later Barbours Cut and Bayport, gradually established the region as an important shipping center. As wealth increased in southeast Texas, resorts and other tourist draws developed in the Bay Area. During the 1960s the area became home of the Johnson Space Center, headquarters for the nation's manned space program, which helped diversify the <b>regional</b> <b>economy</b> and began the development of an aerospace industry, and later other high-tech industries.|$|E

Salford City Council purchased the docks in 1984 and since then they underwent regeneration as a centre of tourism in Salford, which included the construction of the Lowry Centre. More than 10,000 people are employed in the Quays in jobs such as retail, construction, and e-commerce. In 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC would be moving five of its departments to a new development on Pier 9 of Salford Quays, to be called MediaCityUK.

Compared to the period before decentralization, the share of GRDP and local government finance has increased in Java, though investment and bank borrowing have expanded to the outer islands.

40|$|Structural {{decomposition}} techniques {{based on}} input-output table {{have become a}} widely used tool for analyzing long term economic growth. However, due to limitations of data, such techniques have never been applied to China's <b>regional</b> <b>economies.</b> Fortunately, in 2003, China's Interregional Input-Output Table for 1987 and Multi-regional Input-Output Table for 1997 were published, making decomposition analysis of China's <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> possible. This paper first estimates the interregional input-output table in constant price by using an alternative approach: the Grid-Search method, and then applies the standard input-output decomposition technique to China's <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> for 1987 - 97. Based on the decomposition results, the contributions to output growth of different factors are summarized at the regional and industrial level. Furthermore, interdependence between China's <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> is measured and explained by aggregating the decomposition factors into the intraregional multiplier-related effect, the feedback-related effect, and the spillover-related effect. Finally, the performance of China's industrial and regional development policies implemented in the 1990 s is briefly discussed based on the analytical results of the paper.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a statistical model for measuring spatial interactions when estimating macroeconomic regimes and regime shifts. The model {{is applied to}} study the contagion and propagation of recessions in small <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> in the United States from 1990 to 2015. The empirical analysis identifies two geographical concentrations (or clusters) where small <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> were affected by recessions in similar ways. These clusters are interpreted as groups of regions that are potentially at-risk to collective economic distress, which is useful for national and regional policy makers. The first identified cluster is characterized by <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> with important roles in the financial sector, while the second cluster {{is characterized by the}} oil and gas extraction sector. The empirical findings uncover an important propagation dynamic that would be overlooked if one were to apply the model without the spatial extension developed in this paper. Specifically, the evidence shows significant spatial spillovers between small <b>regional</b> <b>economies,</b> meaning that shocks to regions are expected to be higher, when shocks to neighboring regions are high on average. The magnitude of this effect is amplified for the period spanning and following the Great Recession...|$|R

40|$|As Internet access grows at {{different}} rates across regions, the Internet has had variable effects on <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> through agglomeration and spillover effects. This paper uses province-level panel data from 2000 to 2013 to study inequality in Internet access, its spatial effect on <b>regional</b> <b>economies</b> in China and the channels through which the spillover effects are most evident. We find that the Internet has dispersed quickly from core cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, to coastal provinces; and has had increasingly significant effects on neighboring regions. However, the Internet speed is still comparatively low outside the core cities. We then use endogenous growth models to quantify the effect of Internet access on <b>regional</b> <b>economies.</b> Our results show that, while Internet dispersion is positively associated with economic growth, the spillover effect varies significantly by region and is more pronounced in developed regions.
