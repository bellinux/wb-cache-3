2500|$|LaHaye is {{best known}} for the Left Behind series of apocalyptic fiction that depicts the Earth after the pretribulation rapture which Premillennial Dispensationalists believe the Bible states, {{multiple}} times, will occur. The books were LaHaye's brainchild, though Jerry B. Jenkins, a former sportswriter with numerous other works of fiction to his name, did the actual writing of the books from LaHaye's notes. Jenkins has said, [...] "I write the best I can. I know I'm never going to be revered as some classic writer. I don't claim to be C. S. Lewis. The literary-type writers, I admire them. I wish I was smart enough to write a book that's hard to <b>read,</b> <b>you</b> know?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} {{emerged on}} May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted {{a clip of}} King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters. [...] King, talking to high-school students, had said: [...] "If you can <b>read,</b> <b>you</b> can walk into a job later on. [...] If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that." [...] The comment was described by the blog as [...] "another {{in a long line}} of liberal media members bashing the military," [...] and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. [...] King responded later that day, saying, [...] "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." [...] King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, [...] "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. [...] Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds." [...] King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a [...] "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.|$|E
