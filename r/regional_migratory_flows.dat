Different econometric models are estimated for both the European waves –during the period from 1870 to 1950 – and the Latin American waves –during the period from 1945 to 1976 –. Results indicate {{a shift in the}} order of importance of the determinants of the entry rates, where the income gap, more than opportunities of employment differentials, appears to be the variable that generates the greatest reaction in the <b>regional</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>flows.</b> On the contrary, European flows seem to have been triggered by the second facto...|$|E
40|$|His study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} a discussion {{between the use of}} some of the traditional indicators such as eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of public policies, in this case, the National Policy For Regional Development (PNDR) and the dynamics of development on the area covered by the Regional Development Council (COREDE) Alto Jacuí, in Rio Grande do Sul. Through a look at economic and demographic information, this study provides a counterpoint to the proposal submitted by the Coredes in the National Conference of Regional Development (CNDR), which stipulated the use of the migration flows as one of the eligibility criteria for the new PNDR. This reflection was based on an analysis of information from censuses of years 2000 and 2010 and the population counting 2007 with information related to the performance of the regional economy. We tried to show that the economic dynamics exerts a strong impact on <b>regional</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> in the context from the PNDR.

40|$|Labour {{market is}} {{characterized}} in Spain {{by a high}} persistence in unemployment rates. One {{of the main reasons}} of this persistence is the lack of labour mobility. The present paper addresses this issue empirically and analyses the determinants of migration in Spain from a regional standpoint. We used a panel data set that includes annual bilateral <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> between the 17 Spanish regions from 1995 through 2000. For this purpose, after a descriptive analysis, we develop a nonparametric approach to show the factors that influence in the magnitude of <b>migratory</b> <b>flows.</b> Later on, semiparametric estimation techniques are applied to provide more econometric evidence regarding <b>migratory</b> <b>flows.</b> Main conclusions are as follows: first, a high inertia in the <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> exists, that it is to say, migratory movements are very persistent; second, <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> mainly respond, though weakly, to the differentials of wages, unemployment rates and house prices between regions; third, <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> are also affected, to a great extent, by non economic factors.

In relation to these phenomena, social polarization of urban space has given way to an “unstructured” and “dispersed” social geometry. The globalization processes and the deep socioeconomic transformations, as well as the enlargement of the European Union, are at the heart of a complex system of interdependent factors that have changed the relationship between countries of origin and countries of destination of <b>migratory</b> <b>flows.</b> The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between foreigners and Italian post-metropolitan areas, by studying phenomena of immigrants' spatial dispersion compared with the main cities, which are considered as catalysts of <b>migratory</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE In this paper, {{we study}} the {{determinants}} of internal migration in Italy from 1995 to 2006. METHODS To conduct this investigation, we applied an augmented version of the gravity model to the <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> of Italians and resident foreigners. In addition to the classic deter-minants of migration-i. e., the sizes of populations and the distance between places-the model considered a possible autocorrelation of flows {{and a set of}} socio-economic and demographic explanatory variables that may influence <b>migratory</b> <b>flows.</b> RESULTS Different results were obtained for the two subpopulations. Among the Italians studied, both the economic conditions and the demographic features of regions were found to have operated as both push and pull determinants of <b>migratory</b> <b>flows,</b> although the demographic characteristics were shown to have affected <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> to a lesser extent. Among the resident foreigners studied, the demographic characteristics of the regions did not appear to have acted as push factors, but they were found to have had an effect as a pull determinant. While the economic conditions of the destination regions were shown to have been particularly important in attracting the resident foreigners, the economic conditions of the sending regions were not found to have had a clear-cut effect on the decision to leave...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> between Ontario and two Atlantic provinces of Canada, from 1960 - 61 to 1975 - 76. Search theory {{is used as}} the {{theoretical}} framework and leads to predictions as to the influence on interprovincial <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> of three economic variables: relative wages, employment opportunities, and unemployment insurance (UI). Proxies for these theoretical variables are used in an ordinary least squares regression based on pooled time series and cross-section data on interprovincial migration in Canada (Family Allowances' data base). The model performs poorly in explaining short term variations in the interprovincial migration rates, and the expected return migration from Ontario to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia due to UI changes in 1971 is not found. However, the model performs relatively well in explaining long term interprovincial migration flows and the 1970 's reversal of the net <b>migratory</b> <b>flows</b> between Central Canada (Ontario) and the Atlantic provinces considered. Higher unemployment rates in Ontario, improved relative wages in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia {{as well as the}} UI revisions of 1971 explain {{a significant part of the}} observed change. ...|$|R

These range from the most common presentation of sequential, proximal to distal spread in the lower limb to the rare intra-articular form, and disease involving the axial skeleton is also recognized. Clinical and radiographical features often overlap with those of diseases such as transient osteoporosis of the hip and transient bone marrow oedema syndrome, which is reflected in confusing terminology.

Conclusions suggest that emigration remains an overall positive experience at the individual level, with constructive spill-over effects, mingling of cultures and better use of resources at the national level.
