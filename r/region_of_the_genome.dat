25|$|Human MHC class I and II {{are also}} called human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA). To clarify the usage, some of the biomedical literature uses HLA to refer specifically to the HLA protein molecules and reserves MHC for the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> that encodes for this molecule, {{but this is not}} a consistent convention.|$|E
25|$|One of the best-recognized {{theories}} {{that leads to}} copy number variations as well as deletions and inversions is non-allelic homologous recombinations. During meiotic recombination, homologous chromosomes pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to Holliday junctions. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the crossover lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the unequal crossing over event allows transfer of genetic material between the two homologous chromosomes, and as a result, {{a portion of the}} DNA on both the homologues is repeated. Since the repeated regions are no longer segregating independently, the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication. When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break. Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome.</b> During the repair of a double stranded break, the broken end can invade its homologous chromosome instead of rejoin the original strand. As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, cohesin proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends. If for any reason, such as activation of ribosomal RNA, cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.|$|E
500|$|Genetic linkage {{occurs when}} the loci of two alleles are in close {{proximity}} on a chromosome. During the formation of gametes, recombination reshuffles the alleles. The chance that such a reshuffle occurs between two alleles is inversely related to the distance between them. Selective sweeps occur when an allele becomes more common in a population {{as a result of}} positive selection. As the prevalence of one allele increases, closely linked alleles can also become more common by [...] "genetic hitchhiking", whether they are neutral or even slightly deleterious. A strong selective sweep results in a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> where the positively selected haplotype (the allele and its neighbours) are in essence the only ones that exist in the population. Selective sweeps can be detected by measuring linkage disequilibrium, or whether a given haplotype is overrepresented in the population. Since a selective sweep also results in selection of neighbouring alleles, the presence of a block of strong linkage disequilibrium might indicate a 'recent' selective sweep near the centre of the block.|$|E

50|$|Transvection is an {{epigenetic}} {{phenomenon that}} results from an interaction between an allele on one chromosome and the corresponding allele on the homologous chromosome. Transvection can lead to either gene activation or repression.

2500|$|Kress et al. (2005) {{suggest that}} the use of the COI {{sequence}} [...] "is not appropriate for most species of plants because of a much slower rate of cytochrome c oxidase I gene evolution in higher plants than in animals". A series of experiments was then conducted to find a more suitable <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> for use in the DNA barcoding of flowering plants (or the larger group of land plants). One 2005 proposal was the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region and the plastid trnH-psbA intergenic spacer; other researchers advocated other regions such as matK.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{nucleotide}} sequence variations to investigate evolutionary relationships {{is not a}} new concept. Carl Woese used sequence differences in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to discover archaea, which in turn led to the redrawing of the evolutionary tree, and molecular markers (e.g., allozymes, rDNA, and mtDNA sequences) have been successfully used in molecular systematics for decades. DNA barcoding provides a standardised method for this process via the use of a short DNA sequence from a particular <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> to provide a 'barcode' for identifying species. In 2003, Paul D.N. Hebert from the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, proposed the compilation of a public library of DNA barcodes that would be linked to named specimens. This library would [...] "provide a new master key for identifying species, one whose power will rise with increased taxon coverage and with faster, cheaper sequencing".|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two methods}} for {{repairing}} DSBs depending {{on when the}} damage occurs during mitosis. [...] If the DSB occurs after DNA replication has completed proceeding S phase of the cell cycle, the DSB repair pathway will use homologous recombination by pairing with the newly synthesized daughter strand to repair the break. [...] However, if the DSB is generated prior to synthesis of the sister chromosome, then the template sequence that is required will be absent. [...] For this circumstance, the NHEJ pathway provides a solution for repairing the break and is the main system used to repair DSBs in humans and multicellular eukaryotes. [...] During NHEJ, very short stretches of complementary DNA, 1 bp or more at a time, are hybridized together, and the overhangs are removed. [...] As a result, this specific <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> is permanently lost and the deletion can lead to cancer and premature aging.|$|E
