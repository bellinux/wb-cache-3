25|$|In appearance, Fox was dark, corpulent and hairy, to {{the extent}} that when he was born his father {{compared}} him to a monkey. His <b>round</b> <b>face</b> was dominated by his luxuriant eyebrows, with the result that he was known among the Whigs as 'the Eyebrow.' Though he became increasingly dishevelled and fat in middle age, the young Fox had been a very fashionable figure; in particular, he had been the leader of the 'Maccaroni' set of extravagant young followers of Continental fashions. Fox enjoyed riding and cricket but, in the latter case, the combination of his impulsive nature and considerable weight led to his often being run out between wickets.|$|E

25|$|Nearika {{are highly}} {{decorated}} ceremonial objects {{that can be}} circular or diamond-shaped. When Carl Lumholtz did his writing on the Huichol, he named the circular ones “frontal shields” and the diamond-shaped ones as “eyes” and giving rise {{to the concept of}} the “God's eyes,” applied to a Huichol cross. Nearika are tablets of wood or bamboo which are heavily decorated placed into certain sacred areas. Often they focus on a face of a sun, moon or person. From these the new tradition of yarn paintings developed, and the most traditional of these still show the <b>round</b> <b>face</b> of Tau, the Sun, in the middle.|$|E

The north of the street runs into the Colosseum; the south, the Circus Maximus. In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned. Villas covered the area. Gregory's family also owned working estates in Sicily and around Rome. Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by John the Deacon. Gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes.

With time, he matured, eventually being regarded by his peers {{as a very}} reasonable and honest person. He had an ordinary appearance, with a <b>round</b> <b>face,</b> brown hair, brown eyes and average height. Luís Alves' unremarkable features were compensated by his bearing. Historian Thomas Whigham described him as someone who [...] "learned the art of giving orders early in life. Immaculate in his dress, he was soft spoken, polite, and smoothly in control of himself. He seemed to radiate calm composure and authority." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{the female}} Shiba Inu {{featured}} in the original meme, was a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down. She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō, and named after the citrus fruit kabosu because Sato thought she had a <b>round</b> <b>face</b> like the fruit. Another Shiba Inu {{featured in the}} meme is Suki, a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco. His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash, making it shrink. He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{tower is}} home to two cast iron bells, one {{measuring}} [...] in height and [...] wide at the base, and the other measuring [...] in height and [...] in diameter at the base. The bells were produced by Petit & Fritsen in April 1882 and exported from Rotterdam by the Caminada brothers. Both are inscribed with a dedication, in Latin, stating that the bells were donated by a Semarang-born Frenchman named Joseph Andrieux. The bells are further decorated with engraved plants and crosses. When the bells were installed in 1882, they were accompanied by a clock. However, {{over the years the}} machinery wore down, and in 1978 it was replaced with a <b>round</b> <b>face</b> decorated with the Christogram IHS (short for [...] "Iesus Hominum Salvator", meaning [...] "Jesus, Saviour of Men").|$|E
500|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are {{primates}} {{that belong}} to the suborder Strepsirrhini. They are found throughout South and Southeast Asia and the surrounding islands, {{and live in the}} upper canopy of tropical rainforests. They are nocturnal, sleeping during the day curled up in the fork of a tree. Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers and rarely come to the ground. They have a <b>round</b> <b>face,</b> woolly fur, a dark stripe down their back, and a tail that is reduced to a stump. Their head and body length ranges from [...] Their hands and feet are strong and good at grasping for long periods of time.

500|$|The {{most common}} form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse. This design allowed the {{propelling}} charge to be stored separately until needed. The safety fougasse was constructed as follows: a small section was excavated from the side of a slope, leaving a shallow platform of earth, and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a low position with one <b>round</b> <b>face</b> pointing towards the target. At the back, a section of stove or drain pipe was placed vertically against the rear face of the barrel. The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few inches above the bottom of the barrel. The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out. This pipe is what makes it a [...] "safety" [...] fougasse because it allows later installation of the propelling charge. Soil was then built up over the weapon until all that could be seen were the front disk of the barrel and top of the pipe.|$|E
500|$|The {{canonical}} {{image of}} Mariano Moreno {{is the one}} from the portrait Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo (...) [...] It {{was done by the}} Chilean artist Pedro Subercaseaux during the centennial of the May Revolution in 1910. The historian Adolfo Carranza asked him to design various allegorical pictures of the event. Carranza belonged to the mainstream line of historians who professed great admiration for Moreno, who he described as follows: [...] "He was the soul of the government of the revolution of May, his nerve, the distinguished statesman of the group managing the ship attacked the absolutism and doubt, anxious to reach the goal of his aspirations and his destiny. Moreno was the compass and that also grabbed the helm, as he was the strongest and the ablest of those who came to direct it". He asked for a picture that was consistent with this image. The portrait depicts him as a friendly man with an open and <b>round</b> <b>face,</b> a wide forehead, and a serene look. Subsequent interpretations, like those of Antonio Estrada, would follow this style, as would portraits of other members of the Junta. However, as this portrait was made a hundred years after the death of the subject, with no known depictions done during his lifetime, it was thus based on the artist's imagination. It was known that Moreno had clearly visible smallpox scars from the age of eight, but not {{to the point where they}} disfigured his face.|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim, who also directed the video for the group's subsequent single [...] "Do or Die", and shows the Super Furry Animals waiting to leave Mars having played a concert on the planet. The video begins with Gruff Rhys standing alone on the Martian soil, singing along to the song. A silver, computer generated, spaceship is seen landing behind Rhys. Around one minute into the track the camera pans back to reveal {{the rest of the}} Super Furry Animals sitting down to the left of Rhys. Guitarist Huw Bunford is sat on the floor playing an acoustic guitar {{while the rest of the}} group are sat on three metal seats which are connected together. Two aliens are seen walking from the spacecraft towards the band while drummer Dafydd Ieuan pours some of the Martian sand through his hands. When the aliens arrive, one of them, with a bald head, sunglasses and pointy ears, places his left hand on Rhys's right shoulder. Rhys turns around and looks at the other alien who has one eye in the centre of a large <b>round</b> <b>face</b> and is wearing a blue hoodie. The alien smiles at Rhys who then turns around and looks up to see the Earth in the sky above. Ieuan and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are also shown looking at the Earth before the camera moves behind them to reveal hundreds of aliens stood in front of several minaret-like towers, waving at the group. The band are shown picking up a suitcase and guitar before walking towards the spaceship as the song finishes. The aliens were designed by regular Super Furry Animals collaborator Pete Fowler, who acted as [...] "creative advisor" [...] for the video. According to Rhys the aliens were animated by the same special effects team that worked on [...] Rhys has stated that he considers his performance in the video to be [...] "wooden" [...] as he was forced to take painkillers during the shoot due to a [...] "stiff neck".|$|E

2500|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, Vera Constantinova {{appeared}} small and dumpy with a fat, <b>round</b> <b>face.</b> She wore her hair very short, which gave her a masculine look.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti was another challenging aspect of casting; Afolayan had to {{research on the}} Kutis for some {{time in order to}} learn about some dominant physical features that might be common with the family. He also announced it on Twitter that he was looking for an actress with close resemblance to the late Funmilayo Kuti, but to no avail. When the director met designer, Deola Sagoe for the costume design of the film, he would always [...] "see this <b>round</b> <b>face</b> like the Kutis" [...] and he eventually asked her out on the role.
