5|$|Osmium {{has high}} <b>reflectivity</b> in the {{ultraviolet}} {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a <b>reflectivity</b> twice that of gold. This high <b>reflectivity</b> is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster {{that can take}} a high polish, and which is so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name. Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical <b>reflectivity</b> than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450nm, silver's <b>reflectivity</b> is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310nm.|$|E
5|$|The colours of glass, ceramic glazes, paints, pigments, and {{plastics}} {{are commonly}} {{produced by the}} inclusion of heavy metals (or their compounds) such as chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, zirconium, molybdenum, silver, tin, praseodymium, neodymium, erbium, tungsten, iridium, gold, lead, or uranium. Tattoo inks may contain heavy metals, such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper. The high <b>reflectivity</b> of some heavy metals {{is important in the}} construction of mirrors, including precision astronomical instruments. Headlight reflectors rely on the excellent <b>reflectivity</b> of a thin film of rhodium.|$|E

Airborne observations allow direct comparisons on a limited number of ocean backscatter and cloud samples, whereas the ground-based observations allow statistical comparisons on much longer time series but with some additional assumptions. Direct comparisons of the ocean backscatter and ice cloud <b>reflectivities</b> measured by an airborne cloud radar and Cloudsat during two field experiments indicate that, on average, Cloudsat measures ocean backscatter 0. 4 dB higher and ice cloud <b>reflectivities</b> 1 dB higher than the airborne cloud radar.

5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the <b>reflectivity</b> of the flats. If the <b>reflectivity</b> is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a <b>reflectivity</b> of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a <b>reflectivity</b> of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a <b>reflectivity</b> similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Leipzig in 1862–64, German {{astronomer}} Johann K. F. Zöllner {{developed a}} custom photometer {{to measure the}} <b>reflectivity</b> of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an albedo of 0.27. Between 1877 and 1893, German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf observed Mars using Zöllner's photometer. They found a small phase coefficient—the variation in <b>reflectivity</b> with angle—indicating that the surface of Mars is smooth and without large irregularities. In 1867, French astronomer Pierre Janssen and British astronomer William Huggins used spectroscopes to examine the atmosphere of Mars. Both compared the optical spectrum of Mars {{to that of the}} Moon. As the spectrum of the latter did not display absorption lines of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. This result was confirmed by German astronomer Herman C. Vogel in 1872 and English astronomer Edward W. Maunder in 1875, but would later come into question.|$|E

40|$|The <b>reflectivities</b> {{of uniform}} and broken {{stratiform}} clouds {{obtained from the}} NOAA- 9 and NOAA- 10 overpasses collected during the FIRE Marine Stratocumulus Intensive Field Observations (IFO) were compared, and these <b>reflectivities</b> were compared with those obtained through radiative transfer calculation performed for plane-parallel cloud models. The objective {{was to determine the}} extent to which plane-parallel radiative transfer calculations could reproduce the <b>reflectivities</b> observed for uniform clouds and {{to determine the extent to}} which finite cloud effects cause broken clouds to reflect differently than uniform clouds. The latter study is to provide guidance in the parameterization of finite cloud effects in general circulation climate models as well as to assess the ability of plane-parallel theory, which is used by ISCCP to retrieve cloud properties, to treat the <b>reflectivities</b> of broken clouds. Some results from this study were reported at the last FIRE Science Team meeting and some were reported elsewhere (Coakley and Briegleb, 1989). Improvements since the previous reports include: (1) the analysis of additional satellite passes, and (2) a modification to the analysis which helps to show the significance of the differences in <b>reflectivities</b> for uniform and broken clouds...|$|R

5|$|However some {{research}} shows that black carbon will increase global warming, being second only to CO2. They believe that soot will absorb solar energy and transport it to other {{areas such as the}} Himalayas where glacial melting occurs. It can also darken Arctic ice reducing <b>reflectivity</b> and increasing absorption of solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses use {{camouflage}} when hunting, and {{to avoid}} predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of the}} skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or <b>reflectivity.</b> Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and <b>reflectivity</b> are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of <b>reflectivity</b> are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} <b>reflectivity</b> of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E

Germanium {{is useful for}} monochromators for beamlines used in single crystal neutron scattering and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The <b>reflectivity</b> has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy X-ray applications. Crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy {{and the search for}} dark matter. Germanium crystals are also used in X-ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur.|$|E
40|$|Differences {{between the}} <b>reflectivities</b> of uniform layered clouds and of broken clouds {{taken from the}} same layers of the Californian coast were {{investigated}} using 1 km data obtained by the AVHRRs on the NOAA- 9 and - 10 satellites during the FIRE Marine Stratocumulus Intensive Field Observations (June 29 - July 18, 1987). The <b>reflectivities</b> are compared at 0. 63 micron, where cloud droplets are nonabsorbing, and at 3. 7 micron, where the cloud droplets absorb and the single-scattering albedo is about 0. 9. It was found that, at visible wavelengths, the <b>reflectivities</b> of broken clouds were only 80 - 85 percent of those of the same clouds where they formed regions of extensive uniform layers. The radiation not reflected was transmitted to the surface. The {{results suggest that the}} presatellite estimates of the planetary albedo may be too large because they failed to allow for the effects of cloud boundaries on cloud <b>reflectivities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Storms on 20 May 1977 {{generated}} a vast cirrus deck. Disturbed areas at storm top had equivalent black-body temperatures (T sub BB) {{much lower than}} the tropopause temperature, indicative of overshooting tops. The area of T sub BB not greater than - 71 C represents the area of convective activity penetrating 2 km above the tropopause. This area was relatively large after cloud tops and radar <b>reflectivities</b> reached their maximum heights. It became much smaller during tornadoes when <b>reflectivities</b> were decreasing. T sub BB was at a minimum at the time of mesocyclone formation. The Del City storm had two periods of growth, as indicated both by <b>reflectivities</b> and the T sub BB areas. The mesocyclone was first detected during the second less intense period of growth; the tornado occurred during decreasing <b>reflectivities.</b> The maintenance of large areas of relatively low T sub BB after tornado dissipation is ascribed to continued convection on the flanks of the storm and to residual updrafts in a thick anvil cloud...|$|R

A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary <b>reflectivity</b> to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in radar <b>reflectivity</b> at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole.|$|E

Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the phase function (dependence of the ring's <b>reflectivity</b> on the angle between the observer and Sun), and geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of six inner moons of Neptune, including the Adams ring shepherd Galatea.|$|E

Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and <b>reflectivity</b> data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons.

The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E
