40|$|The goal {{of these}} notes is to fill some {{gaps in the}} {{literature}} about random walks in the Cauchy domain of attraction, {{which has been in}} many cases left aside because of its additional technical difficulties. We prove here several results in that case: a Fuk-Nagaev inequality and a local version of it; a large deviation theorem; two types of local large deviation theorems. We also derive two important applications of these results: a sharp estimate of the tail of the first ladder epochs, and <b>renewal</b> <b>theorems</b> [...] extending standard <b>renewal</b> <b>theorems</b> to the case of random walks.

The criterion for α∈ (1 / 2, 1) establishes the SRT in full generality and in a unified way, barring the Limit Local Theorems employed. As an application, for infinitely divisible F, an integral criterion on its Lévy measure is established for the SRT.

40|$|We study a {{catalytic}} {{branching process}} (CBP) with any finite set of catalysts. This model describes {{a system of}} particles where the movement is governed by a Markov chain with arbitrary finite or countable state space and the branching may only occur at the points of catalysis. The results obtained generalize and strengthen those known in cases of CBP with a single catalyst and of branching random walk on d-dimensional integer lattice with {{a finite number of}} sources of particles generation. We propose to classify CBP with N catalysts as supercritical, critical or subcritical according to the value of the Perron root of a specified NxN matrix. Such classification agrees with the moment analysis performed here for local and total particles numbers. By introducing the criticality set C we also consider the influence of catalysts parameters on the process behavior. The proof is based on construction of auxiliary multi-type Bellman-Harris processes with the help of hitting times under taboo and on application of multidimensional <b>renewal</b> <b>theorems.</b> Keywords and phrases: catalytic branching process, classification, hitting times under taboo, moment analysis, multi-type Bellman-Harris process.

40|$|We {{consider}} real random {{walks with}} positive increments (renewal processes) {{in the domain}} of attraction of a stable law with index α∈ (0, 1). The famous local <b>renewal</b> <b>theorem</b> of Garsia and Lamperti, also called strong <b>renewal</b> <b>theorem,</b> is known to hold in complete generality only for α > 1 / 2. Understanding when the strong <b>renewal</b> <b>theorem</b> holds for α< 1 / 2 is a long-standing problem, with sufficient conditions given by Williamson, Doney and Chi. In this paper we give a complete solution, providing explicit necessary and sufficient conditions (an analogous result has been independently and simultaneously proved by Doney in arXiv: 1507. 06790).

We show spectral gap properties for the convolution operator defined by μ on spaces of homogeneous functions of degree s≥ 0 on V, which satisfy Hölder type conditions. As a consequence of our analysis we get precise asymptotics for the potential kernel Σ_ 0 ^∞μ^k * δ_v, which imply its asymptotic homogeneity. Under natural conditions the H-space V is a λ-boundary; then we use the above results and radial Fourier Analysis on V∖{ 0 } {{to show that the}} unique λ-stationary measure ρ on V is "homogeneous at infinity" with respect to dilations v→ t v (for t 0), with a tail measure depending essentially of μ and Σ.

40|$|We {{consider}} an age replacement problem using nonparametric predictive inference (NPI) for {{the lifetime of}} a future unit. Based on n observed failure times, NPI provides lower and upper bounds for the survival function for a future lifetime Xn+ 1, which are lower and upper survival functions {{in the theory of}} interval probability, and which lead to upper and lower cost functions, respectively, for age replacement based on the <b>renewal</b> reward <b>theorem.</b> Optimal age replacement times for Xn+ 1 follow by minimizing these cost functions. Although the <b>renewal</b> reward <b>theorem</b> implicitly assumes that the corresponding optimal strategy will be used for a long period, we study the effect on this strategy when the observed value for Xn+ 1, which is either an observed failure time or a right-censored observation, becomes available. This is possible due to the fully adaptive nature of our nonparametric approach, and the next optimal strategy will be for Xn+ 2. We compare the optimal strategies for Xn+ 1 and Xn+ 2 both analytically and via simulation studies. Our NPI-based approach is fully adaptive to the data, to which it adds only few structural assumptions. We discuss the possible use of this approach, and indeed the wider importance of the conclusions of this study to situations where one wishes to combine the statistical aspects of estimating a lifetime distribution with the more traditional operational research approach of determining optimal replacement strategies for lifetime distributions that are assumed to be known...|$|R
