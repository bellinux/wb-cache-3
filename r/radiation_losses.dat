25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving <b>radiation</b> <b>losses</b> and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential is too great. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E
25|$|For {{cavities}} {{much larger}} than the wavelength of the light they contain, cavities with very high Q factors have already been realized (~125,000,000). However, high Q cavities on the order of {{the same size as the}} optical wavelength have been difficult to produce due to the inverse relationship between <b>radiation</b> <b>losses</b> and cavity size. When dealing with a cavity {{much larger than}} the optical wavelength, it is simple to design interfaces such that light ray paths fulfill total internal reflection conditions or Bragg reflection conditions. For light confined within much smaller cavities near the size of the optical wavelength, deviations from ray optics approximations become severe and it becomes infeasible, if not impossible to design a cavity which fulfills optimum reflection conditions for all three spatial components of the propagating light wave vectors.|$|E

A new design rule for cylindrical antiresonant reflecting optical waveguides (ARROWs), based on a three-step design process, is also proposed to minimize the <b>radiation</b> <b>loss</b> of the fundamental leaky mode.

40|$|The {{transient}} response of antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) is analyzed. It is found that under current modulation, the <b>radiation</b> <b>loss</b> of the transverse-leaky mode decreases during {{the state of}} the lasers but increases during the state. Numerical analysis shows that this variation in <b>radiation</b> <b>loss</b> is due to the carrier-induced refractive-index depression that arises from spatial-hole-burning of carrier concentration. It is noted that the increment in <b>radiation</b> <b>loss</b> during the state can be used to prevent net modal gain of the transverse-leaky mode from reacquiring threshold after turn-off. Hence, a new method to design ARROW, based on the variation in <b>radiation</b> <b>loss,</b> is proposed to eliminate the excitation of secondary pulsation in VCSELs.

2500|$|This {{secondary}} {{assembly device}} contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running {{down to the}} center of the secondary was a ~1.3cm thick hollow cylindrical rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the sparkplug, a tritium-boosted fission device, which had an aperture of about 0.5cm at its center. The sparkplug was charged with about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary's compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the geometric characteristics of the sparkplug (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or k, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its adiabatic compression energy determined the minimal energy required for the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper's momentum. The sparkplug weighed about 18kg, and its initial firing yielded [...] Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about [...] to the total yield. The energy required by the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary's yield because coupling of the primary’s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ~28cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular frustum, with its small diameter facing the primary's side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff air-gap about 0.9cm wide that was to increase the tamper's momentum, a levitation technique used as early as Operation Sandstone and famously quoted by Ted Taylor as hammer-on-the-nail-impact. Since there were also technical concerns that high-Z tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel, leading to unacceptably large <b>radiation</b> <b>losses</b> the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to hinder to some extent the unavoidable and undesirable Taylor mixing.|$|E
50|$|As {{particles}} {{are moving in}} a closed orbit, the lateral acceleration causes them to emit synchrotron radiation, thereby reducing {{the size of their}} momentum vectors (relative to the design orbit) without changing their orientation (ignoring quantum effects for the moment). In longitudinal direction, the loss of particle impulse due to radiation is replaced by accelerating sections (RF cavities) that are installed in the beam path so that an equilibrium is reached at the design energy of the accelerator. Since this is not happening in transverse direction, where the emittance of the beam is only increased by the quantization of <b>radiation</b> <b>losses</b> (quantum effects), the transverse equilibrium emittance of the particle beam will be smaller with large <b>radiation</b> <b>losses,</b> compared to small <b>radiation</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|E

It is demonstrated that the current convective instability can be triggered in detached inner divertor plasma for the condition when outer divertor is still attached.
