25|$|Two basic {{models were}} built: 410 (1964–1965) with a {{combination}} <b>rear</b> <b>lamp</b> set consisting of round and rectangular lenses, and 411 (1965–1967), which featured the same combination <b>rear</b> <b>lamp</b> set as the earlier 410 through 1966, changing to higher mounted rectangular tail light sets for 1967. On both, the rear direction indicators were red or amber, according to market – New Zealand, which allows either, took the 410 with both and the 411 with red only. This Bluebird {{was one of the}} first Japanese car lines assembled in New Zealand, initially imported under a tariff/duty arrangement allowing 300 cars a year (the so-called '300 Club') with CKD kits built up by Motor Holdings at Mount Wellington in Auckland. The 410 series sedan and station wagon plus a light delivery van was assembled in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria. These cars were all in CKD format.|$|E

50|$|The 2001 and 2002 models {{follow a}} recent trend among cars {{intended}} to be sold in many markets, in that their <b>rear</b> <b>lamps</b> are asymmetric, with the fog lamp and reverse lamp occupying complementary spots on the driver's side and passenger side respectively; consequently, the <b>rear</b> <b>lamps</b> differ between left- and right-hand drive examples.|$|R

2500|$|The fourth {{version of}} the Ford Escort was {{launched}} in March 1986, with {{only a small number}} of changes.

Optional new features included a mechanical anti‐lock braking system (standard on RS Turbo models), a fuel computer on fuel-injected models, and a heated windscreen. However, the check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads was no longer fitted to any model. Air conditioning was not available on cars sold in Europe although it was an option on cars sold in Argentina and Brazil.|$|E

To provide some safeguard against <b>rear</b> fog <b>lamps</b> being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop <b>lamp</b> and any <b>rear</b> fog <b>lamp.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In dense fog, the {{visibility}} of a vehicle's <b>rear</b> <b>lamps</b> is of fundamental importance. However, few studies have addressed {{the visibility}} of <b>rear</b> fog <b>lamps</b> in daytime fog. The present study evaluates the contrasts of tail lamps, brake <b>lamps</b> and <b>rear</b> fog <b>lamps.</b> An experiment was performed in 2001 at a parking lot on Mt. Fuji Parkway in Japan. A vehicle equipped with a data-recording system {{was used as the}} data measurement station. Luminance, illuminance and transmissivity in fog were simultaneously recorded at intervals of 2 minutes. Three types of tail lamp, three types of brake lamp and two types of <b>rear</b> fog <b>lamp</b> were used, with an observation distance of 50. 0 m. The recorded data showed the background luminance in fog to be affected by illuminance and transmissivity in the daytime. A multiple regression model was applied to determine the background luminance. Contrasts were calculated using this model. Tail lamp visibility was low in deep fog in daytime. Under the same conditions, the <b>rear</b> fog <b>lamps</b> had higher visibility than both the tail lamps and the brake lamps. It was found that the <b>rear</b> fog <b>lamps</b> could provide sufficient visibility in daytime fog...|$|R

25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by <b>rear</b> position <b>lamps</b> (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. <b>Rear</b> position <b>lamps</b> may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the <b>rear</b> position <b>lamp</b> function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying <b>rear</b> position <b>lamps</b> will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|R
