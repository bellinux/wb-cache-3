5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a <b>red</b> <b>tide.</b>|$|E

50|$|This species {{sometimes}} forms <b>red</b> <b>tides,</b> {{but will}} also feed on the raphidophyte, Heterosigma akashiwo, another organism responsible for <b>red</b> <b>tides.</b> Its blooms when forming <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> are likely stimulated by environmental factors, such as drops in salinity or increases in prey abundance. O. marina may also affect the environment by producing dimethyl sulfide, which is released when it grazes on some prey types, such as E. huxleyi.|$|R
50|$|Many mixotrophic {{and some}} {{heterotrophic}} dinoflagellates {{are known to}} cause <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> or harmful blooms that result in large-scale mortality of fish and shellfish. Studies on <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> have been conducted to determine the mechanism of outbreak and the persistence of <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> caused by mixotrophic dinoflagellates such as Karenia brevis, Prorocentrum donghaiense and Prorocentrum minimum in low nutrient concentration waters. In the case of serial <b>red</b> <b>tides,</b> one mixotrophic dinoflagellate species is dominated by another mixotrophic species in rapid succession over a short span of days. A {{possible explanation for the}} occurrence of different dominant mixotrophic dinoflagellates during serial <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> is the ability of mixotrophic dinoflagellates to feed on both heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria (such as Synecchococcus) spp., which provide limiting nutrients such as phosphorus, and nitrogen simultaneously. It is proposed that during serial <b>red</b> <b>tides,</b> feeding by larger mixotrophic dinoflagellates on smaller species may be a driving force for the succession of dominant species. Nitrogen and phosphorus is taken up by direct transfer of the materials and energy between the mixotrophic dinoflagellates; therefore, nutrient supply does not rely on the release of nitrogen and phosphorus by other organisms. Hence, mixotrophy can cause uncoupling between nutrient concentrations and the abundance of mixotrophic dinoflagellates in natural environments.|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} in cell abundance of Noctiluca scintillans was studied from June 2003 to November 2004 {{in the coastal}} waters off Chonburi Province, the upper gulf of Thailand. Eight stations from Bangpakong River mouth to Angsila were designed to cover the area where <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> often occurred and were {{under the influence of}} Bangpakong River.

A total of 9 N. scintillans <b>red</b> <b>tides,</b> 7 Ceratium furca <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> and 4 diatom <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> were found in this study. Noctiluca and Ceratium <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> were often found when salinity was in the range of 22 to 33 psu. and 12 to 27 psu., respectively. Those <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> were not associated with apparent negative effects to marine animals. N. scintillans cells could be observed almost all year round at offshore stations where the water depth was more than 10 meters except strong wind periods, suggesting that Noctiluca in coastal waters were supplied by cells from offshore stations. In contrast, no consistent pattern was observed in the distribution of N. scintillans in coastal waters, in particular near the river mouth. Only the relationship between phosphate concentrations and cell densities of Noctiluca has been found statistically significant. However, the high cell densities of both Noctiluca and Ceratium were often observed in the rainy season, especially on the calm day after heavy rain. These observations suggested that the <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> of those two species in coastal waters were growth response to the influence of freshwater run off from Bangpakong River...|$|R

40|$|Hong Kong {{waters in}} the {{northern}} part of the South China Sea are subjected to seasonal oceanographic processes due to monsoonal winds and Pearl River outflow. Several 100 <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> have occurred in Hong Kong waters during 1983 to 1998, and show a clear spatial and temporal distribution. Most (74 %) occurred in semi-enclosed NE bays away from the Pearl River estuary, and fewer occurred in western estuarine waters. Most <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> (70 %) occurred between December and May, and fewer in summer. However, nutrients are high in the Pearl River estuary, whereas nutrients are generally low in the NE bays (Mirs Bay and Port Shelter) and cannot support the high biomass of <b>red</b> <b>tides.</b> This suggests that there are concentrating mechanisms promoting the formation of <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> in NE waters, either by vertical migration or horizontal aggregation under suitable wind conditions (NE winds and moderate speeds around 6 m s- 1). The prevailing NE monsoon winds in winter and spring result in downwelling and a longer residence time of {{waters in the}} NE bays, creating conditions similar to those of a batch culture, and allowing local inputs of nutrients and vertical migration of phytoplankton in shallow waters to play a dominant role in favor of local <b>red</b> <b>tides.</b> This may be one of the reasons why more <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> occur in winter and spring in semi-enclosed waters. In summer, the SW monsoon winds result in upwelling along the coast, and high river discharge and rainfall cause an increased estuarine circulation in the Pearl River estuary and rapid outflow of the surface water from these semi-enclosed waters. As a result, residence time of these waters decreases, and they may be analogous to semi-continuous or continuous cultures. This may explain why there are fewer <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> in summer. The species occurring most frequently are (in descending order) Noctiluca scintillans, Gonyaulax polygramma, Skeletonema costatum, Mesodinium rubrum, Prorocentrum minimum and Ceratium furca.

50|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> in some locations {{appears to be}} entirely natural (algal blooms are a seasonal occurrence resulting from coastal upwelling, a natural result of the movement of certain ocean currents) while in others {{they appear to be}} a result of increased nutrient loading from human activities.

2500|$|<b>Red</b> <b>tide</b> algal blooms (blooms of {{single-celled}} algae) {{known as}} the Peridinium bipes, noticed to proliferate intensely at the Tsukabaru reservoir from the later part of the 1970s, is a serious environmental problem that has received due attention of the agency involved with the project. It is inferred that the algal development is not on account of eutrophication or unusual growth of plankton but is on account of accumulation of stable cyst {{on the surface of}} the reservoir caused due to the process of phototaxis at the inlet end of the reservoir and spread to cover the reservoir surface completely. Its annual occurrence was noted since 1990. This process created extensive cultivation of Peridinium bipes of dinoflagellate, which generated a foul smell and discolored the water surface area thus marring the scenic beauty of the reservoir. This necessitated instituting measures to eradicate the problem. Various alternative treatments were examined, such as cyclic aeration, treatment after collection, use of ozone and ultraviolet irradiation; the ultraviolet irradiation method has been chosen and put into practice.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dinoflagellate and diatom blooms {{often occur}} {{in spring and}} summer in ECS（East China Sea）, which we usually called <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> or HAB (harmful algal bloom). Some of the <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> can make the water toxic and anoxic and then lead to {{aquaculture}} loss. So it’s of great importance if HAB, especially those of large scales, can be continuous monitored and forecast by remote sensing methods. Both Shang et al. and Mao et al. {{came up with a}} novel <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> detection algorithm in 2014 which were put forward based on field data they collected in China. We made comparison between two algorithms by applying them to the MODIS satellite data which match with <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> issues collected from China Oceanic Information network. The result indicates that both of two algorithms can work well in ECS, but sometimes they can also be misleading. By the way, they identify the dinoflagellate bloom which broke out in Xiapu (ECS, at the end of May, 2015) correctly based on field sampling and Rrs data we collected. We also applied them in other China seas, but it turns out they did not show the same accuracy as they did in ECS. To expand their application scope we tried some ways to apply them to SeaWiFS, but unfortunately the result is not good because of their unique bands, which means we cannot simply substitute the data into the formulae. In short, more jobs need to be done to improve the accuracy of the two algorithms and keep trying to apply them to other satellite data resources. 1...|$|R
