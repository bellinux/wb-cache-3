The main focus is on supply chains that include rail, as rail causes most reliability problems in Sweden [35]. 5 In section  2 the ideas behind the modelling framework for the precautionary costs approach are presented. Our focus is on delays; too early arrivals are not addressed. Section  3 addresses the grocery company COOP Sweden AB (COOP), which has switched from road <b>transports</b> to intermodal <b>road-rail</b> <b>transports.</b> The new transport concept (section  3.1) and the transportation time variability in the form of train delays and cancellations that COOP faced during a 16 -month period (section  3.2) are described. Finally, it is shown which precautionary costs COOP pays in connection with the new system for minimizing the stock-out costs and which operative costs COOP needed to pay as a result of major train delays and cancellations during the 16 -month period. The VTTV related to the cargo component is calculated on the basis of COOP’s precautionary costs and the standard deviation for the transport time of the train.

One important type of user of intermodal transport is less-than-truck load (LTL) service providers. LTL networks often consist of a forwarder and a number of hauliers in a more or less formal organisation. They often work together for many years with the shared strategic purpose to produce transport services, an organisation form that in the construction industry is called a quasifirm. In the relationship between haulier and forwarder the direct mode choice is often made by one of them while they represent different levels of decision-making and hold different responsibilities.

Based on a literature review of the stakeholders’ perspectives on urban freight transport, a framework for sustainable urban freight transport is developed and applied on IRRT. The results show that the urban context is a threat for further growth of rail freight since an increasing transport demand faces capacity constraints in urban areas.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess whether {{intermodal}} <b>road-rail</b> <b>transport</b> has the potential to contribute to the sustainable development of the freight transport sector. To achieve this, the paper aims to clarify what sustainable freight transport is and to identify the critical issues in today’s intermodal transport system. Methodology: In a deductive approach principles for sustainable freight transport are developed based on sustainable development concepts and applied on intermodal transport. Findings: Rail has the potential to offer economically and environmentally sustainable freight transport services, but in the present intermodal transport system the economic benefits can only be realised for a minor share of the transport market, and the environmental benefits on a global and regional level are achieved at the expense of higher local impacts. Implications: This article has developed principles of sustainable freight transport and identified the critical issues regarding the sustainability potential of intermodal transport. Further research on implementing innovations in rail transport and on pre- and post haulage in urban areas is needed.

Based on theory {{defining}} the elements transport time, order time, timing, punctuality and frequency, literature on modal choice is surveyed. With few exceptions, transport time and punctuality is top ranked, while frequency and timing is re-garded as less important by respondents. Timing is excluded in some studies and order {{time is not}} found. The time elements are also used for comparing the characteristics of intermodal transport and all-road transport. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the preconditions for using intermodal transport as part of consolidation networks with subsequent terminal handlings. Since time aspects in transportation are highly contextual, the analysis is deepened within the framework of a case study focusing Schenker’s domestic transport services in Sweden. Schenker’s time requirements are matched against the times CargoNet, their main supplier of intermodal terminal-to-terminal services, can offer. It is concluded that correspondence of the transport time between the consolidation network and the intermodal network are in fact not a strong prerequisite to use intermodal transport, although correspondence of departure and arrival times is significantly higher for the inter-modal relations regularly used by the logistics service provider. Regarding timing, adjusting departure and arrival times by one hour will not increase the competitiveness for the consoli-dated cargo significantly, more profound adjustments are required. The order time of the in-termodal freight transport service is not well suited to consolidated cargo due to volume in-formation unavailability. The consolidated cargo schedule is sensitive for rather small devia-tions in punctuality...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{transport}} goods quickly, economically and reliably {{is vital to}} a nation’s prosperity and capacity to compete in global market. Ethiopia is a landlocked country in East Africa with a land area of about 1. 13 million square kilometers and {{a population of about}} 82. 8 million. 85 {{percent of the population is}} living in rural areas and the economy of the country is based mainly on agriculture accounting for 45 percent of GDP, 80 percent of exports and 80 percent of employment. Ethiopian logistics system is characterized by poor logistics management system and lack of coordination of goods transport, low level of development of logistics infrastructure and inadequate fleets of freight vehicles in number and age, damage and quality deterioration of goods while handling, transporting and in storage. This coupled with lack of sea port resulted in poor linkage of producers (farmers) to the consumers (market) and non-competitiveness of Ethiopian goods on global market, which compromised livelihood of the people and economy of the country. There is very high rate of traffic accident (first in the world) and congestion in cities and at city inlets/outlets to which freight vehicles contribute significantly. Efficient and effective logistics system needs to be put in place to solve these socio-economic problems. The objective of this work is to assess the current status of logistics practices in Ethiopia with the aim of identifying the gaps, potentials and constraints for development of effective and efficient logistics system. To meet this objective, qualitative assessment of the soft and hardware of logistics, freight logistics and transport companies, organizations dealing with documentation of import and export goods and case studies of specific supply chains of major goods in Ethiopia are made. Information from secondary sources is used to carry out the assessment. Presence of road of high density and quality makes efficient distribution of goods easy. Customer orientation, low level bureaucracy at customs and trade facilitations expedite goods flow. Availability of skilled manpower, conducive labor regulations and business Environment promotes economic activities. On most of these criteria, Ethiopian logistics system is found to be poor.

In the arena of transport it has previously used directives, which have force of law in all member states, to define air passenger rights in the Passengers Charter for Air Travel: “establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers {{in the event of}} denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights” [17]. In the area of rail freight, the EU began a process towards mandatory quality standards, such as the UIC -Freight Department [37]) authored: “Guide: Quality of rail freight transport”. Also, the European Commission proposal for a regulation of compensation, in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail freight services, eventually led, in 2003, to the industry-led UIC/CER/CIT Freight Quality Charter [9]. Notably, in the latter case, the leading rail client organisation, the International Union of combined <b>Road-Rail</b> <b>transport</b> companies (UIRR), began as supportive of market intervention, but moved to a more liberal position as time progressed. Similarly, the European Commission, transitioning from an interventionist stance, in the 2001 White Paper on Transport [16], to the more laissez-faire approach of the 2006 mid term review [15], looked to researchers to answer the question: “To what extent are specialised, international standards useful for the quality performance of freight logistics in Europe?” [...]...|$|E
40|$|Reduced energy consumption, {{optimization}} of {{the usage}} of the main strength of different modes, reduction of congestion on road networks, and low environmental impacts are considered as the main advantages of intermodal (<b>road-rail)</b> <b>transport.</b> However, there are disadvantages such as unease of monitoring due to complexity of the transport chain or high cost for pre-and post haulage. Recently sustainability has received increasing attention and with it also the role that logistics concepts can play in making transport more sustainable. One of these concepts is a concept of Longer Combination Vehicles, i. e. vehicles of up to 35 m in length, which might be good solution for pre and post haulage.

40|$|Traditionally, {{intermodal}} transport has a medium to high market share for large flows over long distances while {{the short and}} medium distances (less than 500 km) mainly remain a domain of the road transport sector. In order to allow {{intermodal transport}} {{to compete in the}} medium distance and high quality market segment, alternative network operations that allow for an intensification of rail services and expansion of geographical coverage are needed. Intermodal liner trains that operate in corridor network designs with intermediate stops between start and end terminals are regularly advocated by intermodal transport researchers as a means to compete with all-road transport on small volumes and short distance markets. Innovative transhipment technologies facilitating fast and efficient transhipments are a necessity for intermodal liner trains since the conventional terminals are not appropriate for intermediate terminals where freight volumes are low and train dwelling times need to be short. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the transhipment unit cost’s effect on the modal shift potential of intermodal liner trains based on fast and efficient transhipments.

40|$|Intermodal <b>road-rail</b> <b>transport</b> (IRRT) has a {{significant}} urban dimension that affects the environmental benefits and the modal shift potential of rail freight. A sustainable modal shift, i. e., growth in rail freight without negative consequences for the sustainability of urban areas, can only be achieved by appropriate actions that demonstrate {{an understanding of the}} urban context within which IRRT takes place. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the interactions between urban freight transport and IRRT and their implications for urban sustainability and modal shift strategies. This research combines empirical case studies to develop a framework for sustainable urban freight transport, and conceptual and analytical research to assess the potential of different measures to enhance the sustainability of IRRT, including: (i) the regulatory framework for pre- and post haulage vehicles to improve cost efficiency; (ii) fast and efficient transhipments to increase the accessibility of rail freight; and (iii) the urban spatial structure to reduce the local impacts of IRRT. The application of the framework on IRRT identifies the potential of integrating urban freight and modal shift strategies. Local authorities therefore have an important role to play if a sustainable modal shift is to be achieved. However, they often do not have sufficient logistics competence to integrate freight transport and urban sustainability strategies. The framework can guide urban planners on how to overcome the existing shortcomings in urban transport planning. It also illustrates the benefits of a rail-adapted urban planning for local sustainability, which can encourage cities to include rail freight in their sustainable development strategies. From a theoretical perspective, the identified interactions and potentials of an integrated approach provide the context for studies going beyond the usual scope of either urban freight or IRRT focusing on the interaction between these two areas.

40|$|The {{trend of}} growing road freight {{transport}} causes significant negative impacts on the society, economy and environment. A substantial share of the road freight sector’s externalities is imposed on urban areas because cities are the main destination for freight flows either for production, consumption or for transfer to other locations. City-regions that host centralized transport facilities of inter-regional networks suffer from congestion, noise and air pollution {{while at the same}} time the urban context challenges their efficient operation. Urban freight transport networks thus need to adjust to the urban environment and to balance different interest which in turn is likely to have an impact on inter-regional freight transport networks. This thesis aims to explore the relationship between urban freight transport and inter-regional freight transport networks for the sustainable development of the freight transport sector. This thesis is based on a multiple case-study. By means of in-depth interviews with freight transport stakeholders in six cities, the urban context of freight transport and how it affects inter-regional freight transport networks and vice versa is investigated. In a complementary theoretical study the case study findings are applied on intermodal rail-{{road freight transport}} with the goal to identify the urban context’s barriers and opportunities for the design of more competitive inter-regional rail transport services. The results confirm the tension in contemporary urban freight transport between local sustainable development and freight transport network performance. Economic interests on the one hand and environmental and social interests on the other hand are perceived as trade-offs and there is no long-term strategy to balance these interests. However, there is indication that adapting freight transport networks to the urban conditions can be beneficial for both the competitiveness of intermodal <b>road-rail</b> <b>transport</b> and local sustainability.

40|$|The {{demand for}} inland freight {{transport}} in Europe is mainly met {{by road transport}} leading to unsustainable impacts such as air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and congestion. Since rail transport has lower externalities than road transport, a modal shift from road to rail is an accepted policy goal for achieving a more sustainable and competitive transport system. However, intermodal <b>road-rail</b> <b>transport</b> is mainly competitive for long distance transports {{and as a consequence}} the potential for modal shift is limited. The cost-efficiency of road-rail intermodal transport is particularly sensitive to pre and post haulage (PPH) costs since this activity typically has a larger cost mass compared to its share of the total distance of the transport chain. For intermodal transportation over shorter distances, e. g. below 300 km and where there is substantial PPH activities in both ends of the chain, the competitiveness of the intermodal transport system compared to direct road is low. Improving the efficiency of the PPH activities is therefore of outmost importance for the competitiveness of the intermodal transport system. This paper looks into the issue of improving the cost-efficiency of an intermodal transport chain by implementing an innovative and flexible legal framework regarding the PPH activities in the chain. By extending the legal framework with exceptions for longer vehicles in the pre and post haulage the cost efficiency can be greatly improved. The purpose of such a framework is to allow and enable for PPH of 2 * 40 foot or even 2 semi-trailers using only one vehicle in the context of Swedish regulatory framework. Within the existing framework there are some degrees of freedom given that the cargo is divisible. This paper suggests extending that framework to the context of intermodal transport. Exceptions to the given regulations require different measures, such as accompanying car, route travelled, etc. This paper aims to investigate the consequences of such a framework and gives some normative suggestions for its setup and design. Furthermore, this paper investigates the potential associated with such a framework in terms of cost-efficiency. In sum, a more innovative and flexible legal framework regarding vehicle length in the PPH links can contribute to greater modal shift, improved cost-efficiency and more environmentally friendly transportation systems...|$|E

This paper develops a strategic calculation model for assessing and investigating the consequences of such a framework and investigates the framework's potential in terms of cost efficiency. The model in combination with a sensitivity analysis of input variables gives a comprehensive understanding of the effects of PPH under different circumstances. From the results, it is evident that there are substantial positive effects associated with a PPH framework of longer vehicles. Results indicate that a typical shipper may experience cost reductions of about 5 – 10 % of the total costs of the intermodal transport chain. In summary, a more innovative and flexible legal framework regarding vehicle length in the PPH links can contribute to a greater modal shift, improved cost efficiency and more environmentally friendly transportation systems...|$|E
40|$|Intermodal <b>road‐rail</b> <b>transport</b> has {{a medium}} to high market share for large flows over long {{distances}} and for seaport hinterland flows, and competes on cost in these markets with road transport. Due {{to the small}} size of this market segment compared to the total transport market the modal shift potential is marginal at best. It is therefore increasingly recognized that the conventional approach to intermodal transport focusing on large flows over long distances may be insufficient to address the persistent problem of a growing modal share of road freight. As a complement to the conventional approach, alternative network operations are needed that allow an intensification of rail services and expansion of geographical coverage. This innovative approach requires fast and efficient transhipment operations, which cannot be achieved by the present conventional terminals since they absorb too much time and money. Hence, technological innovations in the transhipment process will have a major role to play for achieving a modal shift. The raiload technology enables automatic transhipments of standardised loading units below catenaries and thereby makes fast and efficient transhipment operations possible, both for railrail as well as for rail‐road exchange. By that, the technology facilitates the implementation of innovative rail networks. The aim of this research is to analyse how this technological innovation can be integrated in a context of innovative intermodal transport services. The results indicate that fast and efficient transhipment technologies are a prerequisite for intermodal linertrains which can integrate short and medium distance transports in the intermodal system. Linertrains can open business opportunities for operators and cost savings for shippers in a market segment which is dominated by road transport. Furthermore, linertrains can further contribute to reaching policy goals, e. g., lower externalities from freight transport and regional development of far‐off regions. Yet, it is still too early to expect a breakthrough of linertrains. The implementation requires a system innovation but current politics and dominant actors still limit their actions to incremental improvements within the current rail production paradigm and dominant technology based on economies of scale and oppose organisational innovations. However, the fact that the implementation of intermodal linertrains seems to be unrealistic today should not discourage policy makers and stakeholders. System innovations are long‐termprocesses and there are indications that the transition process has started. Continuously increasing freight transport volumes and a significantly increased awareness for sustainable development put the dominating road freight transport paradigm under pressure. As a response, transport politics, transport buyers, and transport operators show an increased interest in intermodal transport. Hence, the current barriers should be seen as challenges to overcome rather than as impediments to progress. To manage the transition towards innovative intermodal transport services and to overcome current barriers, {{there is a need for}} connecting the existing dynamics by applying the technological innovation in the existing large‐scale production system. These niche‐applications do not require major changes of transport and logistics structures and can provide room for technological learning and development which is needed to reduce economic uncertainties and risks involved in technological innovations. A promising approach is a new‐generation large scale hub terminal for seaport hinterland flows, since the raiload technology can contribute to solving existing efficiency and capacity problems in this segment of the transport market...|$|E
