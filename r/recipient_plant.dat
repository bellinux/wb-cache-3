The EPA assesses data concerning the characterisation of the end-product of the engineered organism (presently all plants evaluated produce proteins), as well as data on mammalian toxicity, effects on non-target organisms and environmental metabolism. For Bt products the producer must also supply an insect resistance management program. For herbicide resistant plants the EPA co-ordinates with the USDA and FDA, but does not regulate the plant itself. Instead it regulates the herbicide and its use on the new cultivar. The EPA examines the construct used to transform the plant and the biology of <b>recipient</b> <b>plant.</b> The sequence of the resulting protein must be described, expression pattern and intencity verified and any modifications to the protein reported. The EPA considers the potential allergenicity of the product, issues surrounding gene flow into wild species, possible effects on non-target organisms, likelihood of it persisting in {{the environment and the}} potential for insect resistance developing when assessing submissions.|$|E

A mathematical model on the isotopic patterns of soil and a N <b>recipient</b> <b>plant</b> during root decomposition was developed and applied for testing assumptions about residue characteristics against two experimental datasets. Observed 15 N patterns of the recipient plants could be satisfactorily simulated only when the residue was assumed to consist of at least two fractions with distinct δ 15 N and decomposition rates depending on their C[*]:[*]N ratio.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of existing plant breeding techniques, such as cisgenesis, allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar quicker and {{with little to}} no genetic drag. Cisgenesis is the genetic modification of a <b>recipient</b> <b>plant</b> with natural gene(s) from a sexually compatible plant. Unlike transgenesis, which is the genetic modification of a <b>recipient</b> <b>plant</b> with gene(s) from any non‐plant organism, or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the <b>recipient</b> <b>plant,</b> the results of cisgenesis could occur naturally over time. Currently, both cisgenic and transgenic products are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and are labeled as such in countries which require mandatory GMO labeling. Critics claim that cisgenic products should be exempt from the GMO legislation and therefore no mandatory labeling should apply for cisgenic products. This study analyzes European consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards a cisgenic product, rice, and estimates consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, as cisgenic, as with environmental benefits or as any combination of these attributes. The {{data were collected from}} 3, 002 respondents through an online survey administrated in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to estimate consumers 2 ̆ 7 WTP in each country. The results highlight significant differences across countries in terms of attitudes towards and between cisgenic and transgenic rice, WTP and demographics affecting the WTP. In all the five studied countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM. In all the studied countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly different and lower WTP to avoid to consume rice labeled as cisgenic compared to rice labeled as GM. In addition, consumers in Spain and in France are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. Finally, the results suggest that consumers differentiate cisgenic and transgenic products and that they tend to have a more positive attitude towards cisgenic rice than transgenic rice. This seems to indicate that not all GMOs are the same in consumers 2 ̆ 7 eyes and thus, can have important policy implications in terms of labeling and importation of cisgenic products...|$|E

These results were contrasted with male reproductive success of these same plants following natural mating. Following equal pollination, there was a significant departure from equal siring success, indicating a potential for postpollination sexual selection. The most successful pollen donor sired more than twice the expected number of seeds, and this was largely consistent across <b>recipient</b> <b>plants.</b> However, siring success following natural mating was significantly different from siring success following artificial pollination and showed that the reproductive gains to be made from superior pollen performance did not translate into increased reproductive success following natural mating.

To facilitate use with other plant species, we investigated the mechanisms that underlie this method. In manual outcrossing experiments, application of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to pollen donor plants did not produce any transformed progeny, whereas application of Agrobacterium to pollen <b>recipient</b> <b>plants</b> yielded transformants {{at a rate of}} 0. 48 %. Agrobacterium strains with T-DNA carrying gusA (encoding β-glucuronidase [GUS]) under the control of 35 S, LAT 52, or ACT 11 promoters revealed delivery of GUS activity to developing ovules, whereas no GUS staining of pollen or pollen tubes was observed. Transformants derived from the same seed pod contained independent T-DNA integration events. In Arabidopsis flowers, the gynoecium develops as an open, vase-like structure that fuses to form closed locules roughly 3 d prior to anthesis. In correlation with this fact, we found that the timing of Agrobacterium infection was critical. Transformants were obtained and GUS staining of ovules and embryo sacs was observed only if the Agrobacterium were applied 5 d or more prior to anthesis. A 6 -fold higher rate of transformation was obtained with a CRABS-CLAW mutant that maintains an open gynoecium.

This maximum cross-pollination rate was 56. 1 %. A three-year field trial was also conducted to study the cross-pollination rates in terms of distance and orientation to an herbicide-resistant pollen source. Under field conditions, cross-pollination rates varied from 5. 5 % to 11. 6 % in plants adjacent to the pollen source and decreased with increasing distances (1. 5 to 8. 9 % at 15 m distance and up to 4. 1 % at 25 m in the downwind direction).

40|$|Background/Objective: Despite {{potential}} benefits granted by genetically modified (GM) fruit trees, their release and commercialization raises concerns about their potential environmental impact, and the transfer via pollen of transgenes to cross-compatible cultivars is {{deemed to be}} the greatest source for environmental exposure. Information compiled from field trials on GM trees is essential to propose measures to minimize the transgene dispersal. We have conducted a field trial of seven consecutive years to investigate the maximum frequency of pollen-mediated crop-to-crop transgene flow in a citrus orchard, and its relation to the genetic, phenological and environmental factors involved. Methodology/Principal Findings: Three different citrus genotypes carrying the uidA (GUS) tracer marker gene (pollen donors) and a non-GM self-incompatible contiguous citrus genotype (recipient) were used in conditions allowing natural entomophilous pollination to occur. The examination of 603 to 2990 seeds per year showed unexpectedly low frequencies (0. 17 - 2. 86 %) of transgene flow. Paternity analyses of the progeny of subsets of <b>recipient</b> <b>plants</b> using 10 microsatellite (SSR) loci demonstrated a higher mating competence of trees from another non-GM pollen source population that greatly limited the mating chance of the contiguous cross-compatible and flowering-synchronized transgenic pollen source. This mating superiority could be explained by a much higher pollen competition capacity of the non-GM genotypes, as was confirmed through mixed-hand pollinations. Conclusions/Significance: Pollen competition strongly contributed to transgene confinement. Based on this finding, suitable isolation measures are proposed {{for the first time to}} prevent transgene outflow between contiguous plantings of citrus types that may be extendible to other entomophilous transgenic fruit tree species.

However, when an E. coli strain expressing the IncN-type conjugation system was coinoculated with a disarmed A. tumefaciens strain, plant tumors arose at high frequencies. This {{was caused by a}} two-step process in which the IncN transfer system mobilized the entire shuttle plasmid from E. coli to the disarmed A. tumefaciens strain, which in turn processed the T-DNA and transferred it to <b>recipient</b> <b>plant</b> cells. The mobilizable plasmid does not require a broad-host-range replication origin for this process to occur, thus reducing its size and genetic complexity. Tumorigenesis efficiency was further enhanced by incubation of the bacterial strains on medium optimized for bacterial conjugation prior to inoculation of leaf explants. These techniques circumvent the need to construct A. tumefaciens strains containing binary vectors and could simplify the creation of transgenic plants...|$|E
40|$|Flowering plants rely on vectors for pollen transfer, and cannot {{choose their}} mates. Although <b>recipient</b> <b>plants</b> {{are unable to}} choose which pollen they receive, post-pollination {{selection}} (acting pre- or post-zygotically) may modify the outcome of pollination. Here we show that genetic variation among pollen recipients can predict the outcome of pollen competition (seed paternity) in the dioecious white campion. To investigate whether genetic variation among pollen recipients affects paternity, we applied the same pollen mixture from two males to three females, two of which full sisters and the third one chosen at random (unrelated). To control for maternal environmental effects, the plants used for these crosses were greenhouse-reared F 1. We replicated this in two populations, {{for a total of}} 51 crosses, and genotyped a total of 772 offspring to assign paternity. If genetic variation affects paternity, we expected greater similarity of paternity success of the focal male with the sisters, compared to the unrelated female. Paternity of the focal male was significantly more repeatable over sisters, compared to repeatability over the mean of sisters and the unrelated females. When populations were analyzed separately, this was significant in one of the two populations. Paternity was not significantly correlated with stigma size. This provides evidence that in at least one population, genetic variation among individual plants influences the donors’ paternity success, as assessed through genetic analysis of the seedling. Since due to gravitydispersed seeds natural patches may often consist of related plants, the observed effect may contribute to variation in male reproductive success...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of natural competence by bacteria in situ {{is considered one}} of the main factors limiting transformation-mediated gene exchanges in the environment. Ralstonia solanacearum is a plant pathogen that is also a naturally transformable bacterium that can develop the competence state during infection of its host. We have attempted to determine whether this bacterium could become the <b>recipient</b> of <b>plant</b> genes. We initially demonstrated that plant DNA was released close to the infecting bacteria. We constructed and tested various combinations of transgenic <b>plants</b> and <b>recipient</b> bacteria to show that the effectiveness of such transfers was directly related to the ratio of the complexity of the plant genome to the number of copies of the transgene...|$|R
40|$|Several {{mealybug}} and two {{soft scale}} {{species have been}} identified as vectors of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV- 3), the most abundant of the Closteroviridae associated with grapevine leafroll disease. To identify further soft scale vectors of GLRaV- 3, the ability of three species, Coccus longulus, Parasaissetia nigra and a Saissetia sp., to transmit the virus to grapevine was determined under laboratory conditions. Using cultured soft scales, first-instar nymphs of C. longulus and P. nigra were given acquisition access to GLRaV- 3 -infected rootstock hybrid LN 33. Saissetia sp. was reared on LN 33 infected with GLRaV- 3 and Grapevine virus A (GVA). Nymphs were transferred from virus source to virus-free grapevine plants (cv. Cabernet franc). <b>Recipient</b> <b>plants</b> were tested for GLRaV- 3 and GVA with nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR) and RT-PCR, respectively. The study shows {{for the first time that}} C. longulus, P. nigra and a Saissetia sp. are vectors of GLRaV- 3. Saissetia sp. did not transmit GVA. The biology of C. longulus and P. nigra on grapevine was examined at different constant temperatures ranging between 18 and 35 °C, and at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. None of the nymphs survived past the second-instar stage except for one C. longulus female at 30 °C, which produced 117 offspring. The low survival rate could explain the low abundance and patchy distribution of soft scales in South African vineyards. However, outbreaks of soft scales in European vineyards have been reported and this study shows that more soft scale insect species than hitherto thought are able to transmit the virus. We thank W. Strümpfer (University of Pretoria) for assistance with the study on the immature survival, E. Jooste (ARC-PPRI) for determining the GLRaV- 3 isolate, M. van der Merwe, K. Kasdorf (ARC-PPRI) and G. Malherbe (UP) for assistance with GLRaV- 3 diagnostics, R. Carstens (ARCInfruitec/ Nietvoorbij), Vititec for providing plants, and anonymous referees for constructive comments.
