25|$|The subregion {{contains}} many endemic plant {{species in the}} Eucalyptus, Acacia, Proteaceae such as Grevillea, Hakea and Banksia; and various Asteraceae. It contains numerous rare, endangered and priority flora. It also supports a number of rare or endangered fauna, including some that fall within the critical weight range for predation by foxes. The pig-footed bandicoot (Chaeropus ecaudatus) and crescent nailtail wallaby (Onychogalea lunata) previously occurred in the subregion, but both are now extinct. The <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> (Lagorchestes hirsutus) is now extinct in the wild, and a further ten species of mammal are extinct in the subregion. The endangered red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura) still occurs in the region, as do the vulnerable black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis) and heath rat (Pseudomys shortridgei), and the western brush wallaby (Macropus irma).|$|E

40|$|Sex ratio, reproduction, body {{condition}} and morphology of banded (Lagostrophus fasciatus) and <b>rufous</b> (Lagorchestes hirsutus) <b>hare-wallabies</b> were assessed on Dorre and Bernier Islands. Data {{are derived from}} 236 banded <b>hare-wallabies</b> and 161 <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallabies</b> captured between 1959 and 1999. The sex ratio of captured banded hare-wallabies tended to be female-biased (0. 79 : 1 male: female) but {{was not a significant}} departure from parity. In contrast, pouch young tended towards a male bias at 1. 35 : 1. Females produced 1 - 2 young per year. They were capable of producing young at 1000 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 39 % for females of 1000 - 1400 g to 80 % for females of 1401 - 1800 g, then decreased slightly to 76 % for females > 1800 g. Births occurred throughout the year but there was some indication of a decline {{in the latter half of}} the year. Captured banded hare-wallabies ranged in weight from 850 to 2300 g. Animals on Dorre Island were in significantly better {{body condition}} than those on Bernier Island, although this could be an artefact of their shorter pes length. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism and no differences in morphological measurements taken, other than pes length, between the two island populations. The sex ratio of captured <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallabies</b> was close to parity at 0. 99 : 1 and for pouch young tended to be male-biased at 2 : 1. The smallest female with young weighed 1215 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 43 % for females of 1215 - 1660 g to 61 % for females of 1661 - 2015 g and 100 % for females > 2015 g. Females carried pouch young in all months sampled (March-September) and one incidence of twinning was noted. Captured <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallabies</b> weighed 600 - 2550 g. Body condition was similar for males and females and between islands, but smaller females of reproductive age were in poorer body condition than larger females. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism but pes lengths of animals on Dorre Island were significantly shorter, head lengths longer and tail lengths shorter, than those on Bernier Island. <b>Rufous</b> <b>hare-wallabies</b> appear to show regional variation in body size, being smaller in the wetter and warmer Tanami/Alice Springs region and larger on the drier and cooler Shark Bay islands...|$|R

40|$|The diet of Wedge-tailed Eagles Aquila audax was {{assessed}} {{from a single}} nest on Bernier Island and two nests on Heirisson Prong at Shark Bay, Western Australia. The nests and their immediate surrounds were searched for mammalian skulls and the numbers of each species recorded. The nest at Bernier Island was examined annually between July 1992 and October 1995 and the two nests on eirisson Prong in October 1995. Banded Hare-wallabies were the most abundant prey item found in the Bernier Island nest over the four year period comprising 53. 0 % of all skulls, followed by <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hare-wallabies</b> at 35. 9 %, Burrowing Bettongs at 8. 5 % and fish at 2. 6 %. On Heirisson Prong, one bettong skull and 91 rabbit skulls were collected. Wedge-tailed Eagles displayed a preference for larger prey items on both Bernier Island and Heirisson Prong. They are diurnal predators but on Bernier Island their prey species are largely nocturnal. Possible hunting techniques are discussed...|$|R
40|$|As {{evidence}} mounts {{that the}} feral Cat (Felis catus) {{is a significant}} threat to endemic Australian biodiversity and impedes reintroduction attempts, uncertainty remains about the impact a residual population of cats following control will have on a mammal reintroduction programme. Also, behavioural interactions between cats and their prey continue to be an area of interest. Within the framework of an ecosystem restoration project, we tested the hypotheses that successful reintroductions of some medium-sized mammals are possible in locations where feral cats are controlled (but not eradicated) {{in the absence of}} European Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), and that hare-wallabies that dispersed from their release area are more vulnerable to cat predation compared with those that remain at the release site. We used radiotelemetry to monitor the survivorship and dispersal of 16 <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hare-wallabies</b> (Lagorchestes hirsutus spp.) and 18 Banded Hare-wallabies (Lagostrophus fasciatus fasciatus) reintroduced to four sites within Shark Bay, Western Australia. Nearly all foxes were removed and feral cats were subject to ongoing control that kept their indices low relative to prerelease levels. All monitored hare-wallabies were killed by cats within eight and 10 months following release. Significant predation by feral cats was not immediate: most kills occurred in clusters, with periods of several months where no mortalities occurred. Once a hare-wallaby was killed, however, predation continued until each population was eliminated. Animals remaining near their release site survived longer than those that dispersed. The aetiology of predation events observed offers new insights into patterns of feral cat behaviour and mammal releases. We propose a hypothesis that these intense per capita predation events may reflect a targeted hunting behaviour in individual feral cats. Even where feral cats are controlled, the outcome from consistent predation events will result in reintroduction failures. Managers considering the reintroduction of medium-sized mammals in the presence of feral cats should, irrespective of concurrent cat control, consider the low probability of success. We advocate alternative approaches to cat-baiting alone for the recovery of cat-vulnerable mammals such as hare-wallabies...|$|R
50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> has rufous-grey fur {{and is the}} {{smallest}} hare-wallaby. It is a solitary nocturnal herbivore that feeds on herbs, leaves and seeds. It is currently being reintroduced to mainland Australia, notably in the Tanami Desert in the Northern Territory.|$|E
50|$|The eastern {{hare-wallaby}} {{was a small}} macropod, {{slightly larger}} and more slender than its surviving relative the <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby.</b> It had a body length of about 50 centimeters and a 33 centimeter long tail.

5000|$|The Lake Mackay {{hare-wallaby}} created shelter using Triodia, known commonly as spinifex.

50|$|Bruce Leake, {{a farmer}} from nearby Kellerberrin, {{documented}} the rich past fauna {{of the eastern}} wheatbelt in the late 1800s. These included possum, phascogale, tammar wallaby, brush wallaby, rock-wallaby, nailtail wallaby, banded hare-wallaby, <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby,</b> woylie, boodie, pig-footed bandicoot, dalgite, numbat and chuditch. Many of these species would {{have occurred in the}} Narembeen district also. Unfortunately, very little of this fauna remains. It has only been comparatively recently that this loss of fauna has been attributed largely to predation by introduced foxes and feral cats.|$|E

40|$|Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is an {{important}} immune regulatory molecule that {{plays a significant role}} in internal and external modulation of the mammalian immune response to intracellular pathogens. Herein, we report the 492 nt expressed sequence for the coding domain of IFN-γ from the immune tissues of two Australian macropod marsupial species: the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and the vulnerable <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> (Lagorchestes hirsutus). Both 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions and the coding domain of M. eugenii IFN-γ revealed the presence of motifs responsible for transcriptional regulation, mRNA regulation, post-translational modifications, and receptor binding in other mammals. Since diagnostic kits for mycobacterial disease commonly rely on the assessment of interferon levels, we can now use this information to develop reagents that can be applied in clinical and laboratory settings to further our understanding of marsupial responses to disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{histology}} of the spleen, lymph nodes, Gut-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (GALT) and Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) are described for samples collected opportunistically from healthy and mycobacteria-affected specimens {{of the endangered}} marsupial Lagorchestes hirsutus, the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hare-wallaby.</b> The structural elements, organization and distribution of T and B lymphocytes determined by immunohistological techniques using species cross-reactive antibodies in the lymph nodes, spleen and GALT of this species demonstrated lymphoid cell distributions that were consistent with other marsupial and eutherian mammals. The tissues of animals identified as acid-fast positive displayed immunopathology consistent with the responses to intracellular bacteria displayed in some eutherian mammals and included the presence of focal lesions, giant cells in the lung and lymphoid aggregations situated adjacent to blood and airway vessels. This is the first study to describe the lymphoid tissue of this rare macropod species {{and the first to}} document the tissue bed response to mycobacteria...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Immunocytochemical {{analysis}} of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was undertaken using a streptavidin biotin–horseradish peroxidase method to detect CD 5 positive lymphocytes {{from the blood}} of several marsupial species. A monoclonal antibody raised to a conserved peptide sequence of the human CD 5 antigen positively labelled lymphocytes in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), the long-footed potoroo (Potorous longipes), the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and the <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> (Lagorchestes hirsutus). A polyclonal anti-CD 3 antibody also positively labelled circulating lymphocytes from the tammar wallaby. Whereas previous studies using flow cytometry reported labelling of T cells in koala lymphocyte preparations using a polyclonal anti-CD 3 antibody, there have been no other reports of marsupial blood immunophenotyping. The current study extends the known applications of monoclonal anti-CD 5 and polyclonal anti-CD 3 antibodies to blood lymphocytes of small wallaby species using an immunocytochemical slide technique that is simple, can be processed within a day and requires no dedicated large equipment...|$|E
40|$|The only {{substantial}} wild {{populations of}} banded Lagostrophus fasciatus and rufous Lagorchestes hirsutus hare-wallabies occur on Bernier and Dorre Islands, {{off the coast}} of Western Australia. Banded hare-wallabies were widespread in southwestern Australia but have not been recorded there since 1906; rufous hare-wallabies had a broad distribution across arid Australia but now have a single mainland population in the Tanami Desert. We assessed distribution and abundance of hare-wallabies on Bernier and Dorre Islands from spotlight sightings of animals on a series of east-west transects across each island. Abundance was estimated using line transects. The banded hare-wallaby is the more abundant species on both islands with a population of about 3, 900 on Bernier and 3, 800 on Dorre Island. This species depends on the shelter afforded by low-spreading shrubs of Heterodendrum oleifolium, Acacia coriacea, A. ligulata, Diplolaena dampiera, and Ficus platypoda. Wallabies occur mainly on the dunes that form the spine of Dorre Island and the travertine of its west coast. On Bernier Island they occur in the north, where dense thickets of Acacia coriacea, A ligulata, H. oleifolium and D. dampiera, and a tall heath of Abutilon exoneum and Scaevola crassifolia are best developed. The <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> has a population of about 2, 600 on Bernier and 1, 700 on Dorre Island. It occurs throughout both islands in most habitats, but is most abundant in the south of each. It burrows extensively on the inland sandplain and in the dunes...|$|E
40|$|Since European settlement, {{mainland}} Australia {{has experienced}} a wave of mammal extinctions and population declines. However, some species have persisted on off-shore islands, which are now viewed as important wildlife refuges. In this study, we assessed the level of genetic diversity, at 7 - 11 microsatellite loci, in island and remnant mainland populations of three endemic species of macropodid marsupial; the tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii (n = 92); <b>rufous</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> Lagorchestes hirsutus (n = 40) and black-footed rock-wallaby Petrogale lateralis (n = 164). There was a consistent pattern of {{significantly higher levels of}} microsatellite diversity in the remnant mainland population (A = 4. 9 - 13. 9; He = 0. 61 - 0. 86) of each species compared to conspecific "pristine" island populations (A = 1. 2 - 3. 7; He = 0. 05 - 0. 44). These marked differences are even apparent where island populations currently have a substantially larger census size. In addition, island populations were substantially inbred (Fe = 0. 49 - 0. 91). Although island populations have been insulated from the relatively recent threatening processes operating on the mainland, they have nevertheless been significantly impacted by increased inbreeding and the substantial erosion of genetic diversity. Despite the difficulties of ensuring the survival of remnant mainland populations, they appear to retain substantially more genetic diversity than their island counterparts and therefore are more likely to contribute to the long-term persistence of their species. These data also demonstrate that small remnant mainland populations (n < 10 - 20) are often capable of rapid recovery and are not necessarily genetically depauperate. 14 page(s...|$|E
