25|$|Ricin is {{classified}} as a type 2 <b>ribosome-inactivating</b> <b>protein</b> (RIP). Whereas type 1 RIPs are composed of a single protein chain that possesses catalytic activity, type 2 RIPs, also known as holotoxins, are composed of two different protein chains that form a heterodimeric complex. Type 2 RIPs consist of an A chain that is functionally equivalent to a type 1 RIP, covalently connected by a single disulfide bond to a B chain that is catalytically inactive, but serves to mediate transport of the A-B protein complex from the cell surface, via vesicle carriers, to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Both type 1 and type 2 RIPs are functionally active against ribosomes in vitro; however, only type 2 RIPs display cytotoxicity due to the lectin-like properties of the B chain. In order to display its ribosome-inactivating function, the ricin disulfide bond must be reductively cleaved.|$|E

40|$|Maize <b>ribosome-inactivating</b> <b>protein</b> is {{classified}} as a class III or an atypical RNA N-glycosidase. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor with a 25 -amino acid internal inactivation region, which is removed in the active form. As the first structural example of this class of proteins, crystals of the precursor and the active form were diffracted to 2. 4 and 2. 5 Å, respectively. The two proteins are similar, with main chain {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) of 0. 519. In the precursor, the inactivation region is found on the protein surface and consists of a flexible loop followed by a long α-helix. This region diminished both the interaction with ribosome and cytotoxicity, but not cellular uptake. Like bacterial ribosome-inactivating proteins, maize <b>ribosome-inactivating</b> <b>protein</b> does not have a back-up glutamate in the active site, which helps the protein to retain some activity if the catalytic glutamate is mutated.

The <b>ribosome-inactivating</b> <b>protein,</b> saporin (from {{the seeds of the}} plant, Saponaria officinalis) is bound to a targeting agent (anything that is recognized on the cell surface and internalized).
