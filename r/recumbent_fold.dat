40|$|The Devonian and Carboniferous {{strata of}} SW England were {{deformed}} during the Variscan orogeny. Differing amounts of polyphase deformation imposed upon rocks of differing rheological character {{gave rise to}} a variety of attitudes and styles of folding. The present account attempts to outline the location and development of structural zones within which the attitudes of folds are constant. Dearman (1969 a) suggested a zonal scheme based on the recognition of areas of upright primary folds passing southwards into inclined and <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> on the north Cornish coast between Bude and Padstow. Continuity of this arrangement of structures eastwards to the western margins of Dartmoor can be demonstrated (Dearman 1971 a). The zone of <b>recumbent</b> <b>folding</b> was extended, without subdivision, into south Cornwall. Simpson (1970), recognising a zone of upright folding to the south of Brixham in south Devon, correlated this with the inclined folding in the Newquay area and thus subdivided the southern zone of <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds.</b> A line between Brixham and Newquay separates <b>recumbent</b> <b>folding</b> to the north from upright or inclined folding to the south, but this simple subdivision is unsatisfactory as <b>recumbent</b> first phase <b>folds</b> (F 1) are common in the Mylor and Gramscatho Beds to the south of Perranporth (Smith 1965). Neither zonal scheme, based solely on the attitude of fold axial planes, attempts to separate the north facing primary folds of south Cornwall and south Devon from the south facing primary folds of north Cornwall. <br/...|$|R

In {{the western part of}} the Chaînons Béarnais, the newly described <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> of the Saraillé massif comprises a peridotite body and several lenses of Palaeozoic basement wrapped by the Triassic to Aptian sedimentary cover. This structure represents a remnant of the distal portion of the Pyrenean paleo-rifted margin where mantle rocks have been exhumed during Albian–Cenomanian times. In this paper, we present the first detailed mapping and microstructural analysis of the Saraillé massif, providing new geological basis for reconstructing the evolution of this part of the paleo-margin. Our mapping (i) shows that the pre-rift Mesozoic cover forms a <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> cored by mantle and crustal rocks and (ii) confirms that the prerift cover was detached from its bedrock along a layer of Triassic evaporites and slid onto the exhumed mantle rocks. Sliding of the prerift cover was associated with extreme crustal thinning and mantle exhumation along a major detachment fault, together with intense metasomatism affecting both the continental basement and the sedimentary cover. We show for the first time (1) that the Mesozoic pre-rift sediments experienced syn-metamorphic ductile thinning during mantle exhumation, and (2) that during its extreme attenuation, the continental basement was reduced to tectonic lenses some ten meters thick by ductile shearing...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} structural {{studies of}} the Kishorn and Balmacara Nappes of Northwest Scotland and the Mellene Nappe of southern central Norway. These studies have involved the mapping of the orientation, age and distribution of cleavages related to recumbent folding. Using a variety of techniques, including grain shape analysis, measurement of conglomerate pebbles, magnetic anisotropy and palaeomagnetism strain patterns have been obtained for these nappes. Different rock types control the style of folding, and, in part, the sequence of structures developed. The development of. each <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> is a multistage process and prior to each change of mechanism {{the rate of the}} current meahanism declines. It is suggested that each change of mechanism is an attempt by the developing structure to maintain the displacement rate required by the thrust belt as a whole. The suggested model {{for the development of the}} bedding parallel fabric seen in these nappes indicates the dominance of simple shear deformation on the overturned limbs of recumbent folds. In <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> nappes the passage of the thrust tip into undeformed strata is preceded by folding. The relative ease of lateral propagation may be indicated by the presence or absence of extension parallel to the fold axis or, the presence of layer normal shear strains depending upon the style of folding. The Skarvemellen Anticline or the Mellene Nappe is a non-cylindrical fold with a marked extension lineation parallel to the fold axis. It is thought that this extension lineation results from restriction to the lateral propagation of the fold and thrust. There is an average of 40...|$|E

Deviations of individual samples from the mean IC of any given diagenetic and lower anchizonal site are very large, however, without it being possible to associate deviations with any obvious rock parameter. The standard deviations of populations of IC values decrease strongly with increasing metamorphic grade (toward smaller IC values).

40|$|The Karakoram {{metamorphic}} complex (KMC) in the Braldu {{valley and}} Biafo glacier regions of northern Pakistan lies between the Main Karakoram Thrust (MKT) {{in the south}} and the Baltoro Plutonic complex in the north, and represents the middle or deep crust of the South Asian continental margin. Previous work has shown that it is characterised by a complex, polyphase history of deformation, metamorphism and leucogranite dyke intrusion (Searle and Tirrul, 1991; Fraser et al., 2001). We have carried out new field studies along the Braldu valley, the Panmah valley, the Biafo Glacier and from Askole to Shigar, via Skoro-La, which give a complete transect across the complex from the 25 - 21 Ma Baltoro granite to the MKT. The main structures in the area are two large isoclinal, <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> nappes, 1000 - 1300 m thick, which have been folded around lower, later domes (Bullah and Dassu gneiss domes) in the Braldu, Biafo and Panmah valleys. The Biafo nappe is a southward-verging <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> thrust over gneissic basement and is overlain by the Panmah nappe. The axial planes of the recumbent folds dip to the NE at ∼ 15 °. They are refolded along an E-W axis by an elongated, domal structure, the Bullah dome, which exposes sillimanite grade gniess in its core and is equivalent to the Dassu gneiss dome. The basement gneisses are Precambrian with a sillimanite grade metamorphism at 5. 4 ± 0. 3 Ma (Fraser et al., 2001) and intruded by younger leucogranite dykes. The domes are thought to be thrust-related culminations probably associated with movement on the MKT and related structures. An E-W trending thrust parallel to the MKT in the Braldu valley separates the Biafo and Panmah nappes from the rocks to the south. Previous studies divided the Karakoram metamorphic complex into Dumordu and Ganchen units. It is thought that this division is inappropriate due to the highly interbedded nature of the rocks. The complex consists mostly of biotite-rich schists and gneisses with more minor marble, pelitic schist and amphibolite. P-T work (Allen and Chamberlain 1991; Searle and Tirrul, 1991) has shown that peak metamorphic temperatures during the main phase of Barrovian metamorphism were 650 - 700 °C and peak pressures around 8. 5 1 kbar (850 MPa). Metamorphism preceded intrusion of the early Miocene Baltoro granite batholith. Thermobarometry on samples collected from throughout the area will further constrain metamorphic conditions. Together with U-Pb dating of leucogranite dykes which intrude the complex we hope to provide a detailed history of the metamorphic and tectonic events which have affected the Karakoram crust...|$|E

The profile extends from the Huw'l/Meeh subwindow in the northwestern part of the profile and crosses the Saih Hatat window, a Tertiary domal culmination that folds a major NE-facing <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> nappe, and ends along the southern boundary between the Dasir and Ibra ophiolite blocks.

Prominent structural elements in the Sheeprock Mountains are the Sheeprock Thrust, juxtaposing Proterozoic rocks above Paleozoic ones with a stratigraphic separation exceeding 10 km; the Pole Canyon Thrust, thought to be an upper plate imbrication of the Sheeprock Thrust; the Pole Canyon Anticline, a <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> vergent to the northeast and cut by the Pole Canyon Thrust; the east-northeast-striking Indian Springs (tear) Fault; and two low-angle normal faults (the Harker and Lion Hill Faults) which together account for stratigraphic omission of several kilometres.

40|$|The western Paradise Range {{of central}} Nevada exposes complexly {{deformed}} rocks comprising three imbricate nappes of the Pamlico allochthon, {{which is a}} part of the regionally extensive Luning-Fencemaker fold-thrust belt of mid-Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. Mapping and structural analysis reveal a complex deformation history involving dynamothermal metamorphism, out-of-sequence thrusting, and transition from ductile to brittle conditions during progressive deformation. The deformation reflects a spectrum of ductile-to-brittle conditions: from a tectonic thickening stage involving large <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> culminating in ductile conditions during greenschist-amphibolite dynamothermal metamorphism and the development of mylonites; to a progressive ductile-to-brittle transition resulting in the developments of kink bands, polyphase buckle folds and thrust emplacement at relatively shallow structural levels. Fold-thrust relations suggest the development of an out-of-sequence duplex with thrusts cutting the hanging-wall of older and lower thrusts. Four episodes of shortening are recognized on the basis of fold-thrust relations. Deformation commenced in the mid-Jurassic and was completed before intrusion of Late Cretaceous granitoid plutons. The first phase of deformation involves the local inversion of large tracts of Late Triassic and Early Jurassic carbonates, clastics, and volcanic rocks of the Pamlico assemblage in <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> with ultimate tectonic burial to depths of 10 - 20 km. Ductile structures, consisting of penetrative fabrics, mylonitic shear zones, and major <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> were generated at depth During progressive southeast transport, the ductily deformed rocks were carried to shallower structural levels by thrusts that truncate earlier structures. Buckle folds associated with the thrusts indicate a protracted history of motion parallel to the transport recorded in the ductile structures contained within nappes. Following emplacement the three nappes exposed in the western Paradise Range were folded in tight to open upright folds. The final phase of folds documents a shift in the regional shortening axis from northwest-southeast to southwest-northeast...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} two part {{model of the}} formation of <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> in stratigraphic layers of ice sheets such as those in Greenland and Antarctica. The initial disturbances in the stratigraphy have their roots in transient dynamic processes and local rheological inhomogeneities, but the kinematics of even a simple ice flow model can deform these disturbances enough to alter paleoclimatic interpretation of an ice core. This study focuses on this deformation, treating the disturbed strati-graphic layers as passive markers in the large-scale flow. The two major tools that I use to study overturning are core-relative isochrones (precores) and the deformation gradient tensor along a particle path. This tensor is used to calculate the rotation of stratigraphic segments of various orientations. It is also used in a stochastic model to derive the probability distribution of observing overturned segments given a probability distribution of the initial disturbances. Overturn probabilities increase downstream along a path. They also increase with depth, unless the initial disturbance processes are concentrated at a particular depth. Because of rapid rate of rotation of near-vertical segments, the probability of seeing obvious overturning in a small ice-core cross-section is low even if <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> are present. Gentle disturbances {{are more likely to be}} overturned if they occur deep in the ice where the shear is strongest. Overlaying precores on divide arch isochrones shows that ice divide movement can produce <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds.</b> This movement must have a stop-start quality, with enough stability to produce mature arching, but also enough movement to leave an orphaned disturbance on the flank where it can be overturned. Such folding may be most likely downstream from ice ridges bounded by variable ice streams. The variation in the vertical thickness of a disturbed layer is also examined. Even if a disturbance is not overturned, some portions will be thinned more than undisturbed layers while other portions will be thickened. Passive deformation may reduce or exaggerate certain aspects of dynamically produced stratigraphic disturbances, but it does not obliterate them...|$|R

All the objectives are choosing because of the geological map of study area is not updated according to current situation and there is no previous study about landslide subsurface investigation at study area. Geological field mapping is done by collecting general geology information including lithology, structural, geomorphology and stratigraphy of the study area. The geological map is updated by using ArcGis software. While for landslide subsurface investigation is done by using ABEM Terrameter LS to show the result for electrical resistivity imaging. Geological data from field observation were analysed by using rose diagram and stereonet especially in structural analysis. Petrography in observing mineral composition was used to determine the type of lithology.

The palynological data combined with a lithological comparison of different sequences have shown that: 1. - there is a possible diachronism of lithofacies at the Rn 1 a-Rn 1 b boundary between the central part of the Stavelot massif and the overturned flank of the Revinian fold in the Grand-Halleux borehole; 2. - there may be diachronism of the quartzitic rocks at the base of Rn 2 a in the normal and overturned flanks of the same borehole; 3. - a condensed sequence or, possibly, even a stratigraphic gap exists at Revin (Rocroi massif) for the horizon corresponding to acritarch zone 3 and subzone 4 a of the Stavelot massif; 4. - the Rv 2 b horizon is diachronous between the Rocroi and Givonne massifs. The stratigraphic distribution is given of several species selected on the basis of abundance, easily recognisable morphology and short ranges (Figs 3, 6, 8, 9). Sorne species which are either rare, of undifferentiated morphology or long ranging, are treated separately in Annexe I. Four plates illustrate both common and rare species of the different zonal assemblages. Annexe II deals with two new genera: Cristallinium and Timofeevia, as well as one new species: Timofeevia phosphoritica; an additional two species, Hemisphaerium ? sp. A and Timofeevia sp. A, are newly described but left in open nomenclature. Four new specific combinations are proposed, viz. Cristallinium cambriense (SLAVIKOVA, 1968), Elektoriskos cerinus (VOLKOVA, 1968), Timofeevia lancarae (CRAMER et DIEZ, 1972) and Timofeevia pentagonalis (VANGUESTAINE, 1974) ...|$|E
40|$|The Hospitalet mantled gneiss antiform {{consists}} of monzo-granitic orthogneisses, which are overlain by a predominantly pelitic, at least 2. 5 km thick succession of Cambro-Ordovician metasediments. During the Hercynian orogeny the rocks were polyphase deformed and plurifacially metamorphosed. Three stages in its tectonic evolution can be distinguished. Pre-antiform episode NE-SW trending (Dl) folds were formed and overprinted by upright EW trending (D 2) folds and foliations, defining the suprastructure around the massif. Deformation occurred at low grade conditions and NS shortening is indicated, probably accompanied by thickening of the metasedimentary pile. Gneiss antiform formation Within the massif the D 2 structures are overprinted by flat lying to gently inclined (D 3) folds and foliations, defining the infrastructure. The geometry of S 3 {{relative to the}} gneiss-cover contact limits antiform formation to vertical tectonics at {{the scale of the}} massif, accommodated by horizontal extension at the same scale. Subsequently, a low piT ratio metamorphism (650 C/km) took place in the infrastructure, associated with extensive, zonal growth of biotite, andalusite, cordierite, staurolite and sillimanite in highest grade. Structural and tectono-metamorphic considerations suggest that extension was largely accommodated by an extensional shear zone or shear zones of which the infrastructure represents the upper part. Post-antiform episode During isobaric cooling in lower amphibolite facies conditions the infrastructure has been deformed in (1) a 1 km wide zone of mylonitic strain at the gneiss-cover contacts, (2) a 1. 5 km wide zone of (D 4 / 5) refolding SW of the gneisses, (3 a) a km scale <b>recumbent</b> <b>fold</b> in the eastern hinge zone of the gneiss antiform and (3 b) small-scale recumbent (D 6) folds throughout the massif. The antiformal gneiss core acted as a relatively rigid body and the metasediments and mineral zones were draped around it, first in NNE-SSW stretching, afterwards in WNW-ESE stretching, causing (a) seemingly high thermal gradients and (b) the antiformal pattern of the isograds. The three stages {{in the evolution of the}} Hospitalet mantled gneiss antiform are considered to represent early (Westphalian), middle (Westphalian- Stephanian) and late (Stephanian-early Permian) Hercynian tectonics. The structures mentioned have been cut by high angle faults, shear zones and folds, which are accompanied by low greenschist facies metamorphic conditions and which probably reflect Alpine movements...|$|E
5000|$|In geology, a nappe or thrust sheet {{is a large}} sheetlike body of {{rock that}} has been moved more than 2 km or 5 km above a thrust fault from its {{original}} position. Nappes form in compressional tectonic settings like continental collision zones or on the overriding plate in active subduction zones. Nappes form when a mass of rock is forced (or [...] "thrust") over another rock mass, typically on a low angle fault plane. The resulting structure may include large-scale <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds,</b> shearing along the fault plane, imbricate thrust stacks, fensters and klippe.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the {{southern}} French Massif Central, the Montagne Noire axial zone is a NE-SW elongated granite-migmatite dome emplaced within Visean south-verging <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> and intruded by syn- to late-migmatization granitoids. The tectonic setting of this dome is still disputed, thus several {{models have been}} proposed. In order {{to better understand the}} emplacement mechanism of this dome, petrofabric and Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) studies have been carried out. In the granites and migmatites that form the dome core, magmatic texture {{and to a lesser extent}} weak solid-state texture are dominant. As a paramagnetic mineral, biotite is the main carrier of the magnetic susceptibility. On the basis of 135 AMS sites, the magnetic fabrics appear as independent of the lithology but related to the dome architecture. Coupling our results with previous structural and geochronological studies, allows us to propose a new emplacement model. Between 340 - 325 Ma, the Palaeozoic series underwent a compressional deformation represented by nappes and <b>recumbent</b> <b>folds</b> involving the thermal event leading to partial melting. Until ~ 325 - 310 Ma, the dome emplacement was assisted by diapiric processes. An extensional event took place at ~ 300 Ma, after the emplacement of the late to post-migmatitic granitic plutons. In the northeast side of the dome, a brittle normal-dextral faulting controlled the opening of the Graissessac coal-basin...|$|R
