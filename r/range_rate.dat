25|$|In {{terms of}} tactics, the British forces in China {{followed}} doctrines established during the Napoleonic Wars {{that had been}} adapted during the various colonial wars of the 1820s and 1830s. Many of the British soldiers deployed to China were veterans of colonial wars in India and had experience fighting larger but technologically inferior armies. In battle, the British line infantry would advance towards the enemy in columns, forming ranks once they had closed to firing range. Companies would commence firing volleys into the enemy ranks until they retreated. If a position needed to be taken, an advance or charge with bayonets would be ordered. Light infantry companies screened the line infantry formations, protecting their flanks and utilizing skirmishing tactics to disrupt the enemy. British artillery was used to destroy the Qing artillery and break up enemy formations. During the conflict, the British superiority in <b>range,</b> <b>rate</b> of fire, and accuracy allowed the infantry to deal significant damage to their enemy before the Chinese could return fire. The use of naval artillery to support infantry operations allowed the British to take cities and forts with minimal casualties.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Vickers range clock, as well as other designs using a wheel-on-disc drive for the variable speed motor, such as the electrical clock used in the Dreyer Fire Control Table, was that it could only generate ranges according to a constant <b>range</b> <b>rate.</b> In most firing scenarios, the <b>range</b> <b>rate</b> would change continuously. In such cases, the operators of the clock would periodically alter the <b>range</b> <b>rate</b> in discrete increments as conditions suggested.|$|E

5000|$|The bearing and {{altitude}} {{of the target}} was measured directly on the UD4 Height Finder/Range Finder, a coincidence rangefinder located in the High Angle Director Tower (HADT). The direction of travel was measured by aligning a binocular graticule with the target aircraft fuselage. The early versions of HACS, Mk. I through IV, did not measure target speed directly, but estimated this value based on the target type. All of these values were sent via selsyn to the HACS in the High Angle Calculating Position (HACP) located below decks. The HACS used these values to calculate the <b>range</b> <b>rate</b> (often called rate across in RN parlance), which is the apparent target motion across the line of sight.
