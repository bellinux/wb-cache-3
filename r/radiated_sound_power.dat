40|$|International audienceThe <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of a {{monopole}} source in free space is well known, {{and it is}} also known that the <b>radiating</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> is not only determined by the source itself, but also the immediate environment surrounding the source. In this paper, a hybrid finite element method is used to study the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>radiating</b> from a {{monopole source}} placed close to a pipe discontinuity. It is found that while the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of a monopole source in free space increases as frequency squared, the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>radiated</b> from the same source in a cylindrical pipe is constant in the plane wave region. A sharp increase in <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> is then seen to occur when the first high-order mode cuts on; <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> is then seen to decrease as a function of frequency until the second high-order mode cuts on, and so on. It is also found that a wave reflected by a discontinuity placed close {{to one side of the}} source will interact with a wave on the other side travelling away from the source. This alters the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>radiating</b> from the source and has ramifications for the placement of monopole sources in piping systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{directivity}} index {{which is currently}} used for characterizing the directional properties of transducers, refers primarily {{to their ability to}} <b>radiate</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> When transducers are used in echo ranging, the {{directivity index}} is, theoretically at least, of minor interest. Of greater interest is the ability of the transducer to discriminate between the echo from a target at which it is pointed, and the reverberation returned to it from this and other directions. This discrimination is measured by other quantities, called reverberation indices. One of these concerns volume, the other surface or bottom reverberation. The purpose of the present work was to study the relations between the three indices. Conclusions drawn from a study of typical projector patterns are as follows: 1. The volume reverberation index and the surface reverberation index of a projector are linearly related to the directivity index, provided that the directivity pattern is reasonably similar to that of a circular piston in an infinite baffle. This condition is found in the echo-ranging projectors studied when they are operated at 24 kc without domes. However, the directivity index does not provide a reliable measure of the reverberation indices when the projector pattern has abnormally strong side lobes. 2. Neither projector housing studied has appreciable effect on reverberation indices. 3. The echo: reverberation ratio depends almost entirely on the shape of the main lobe of the composite directivity pattern between zero and - 6 db. As a result, the reverberation indices of a transceiver can be determined by measuring the width of its directivity pattern at - 6 db. Half of this angle will be termed the half-width of the pattern. 4. Since the reverberation indices can be so readily calculated from the half-width, it is recommended that this quantity be specified in describing a transducer. The directivity index usually, but not always, can be calculated from the half-width to within 3 db...|$|R

The engine bay is a densely packed and partly open enclose where standard room acoustics models do not directly apply.

40|$|In modern engine design, {{downsizing}} {{and reducing}} weight while still providing an increased {{amount of power}} has been a general trend in recent decades. Traditionally, an engine design with superior NVH performance usually comes with a heavier, thus sturdier structure. Therefore, modern engine design requires that NVH {{be considered in the}} very early design stage to avoid modifications of engine structure at the last minute, when very few changes can be made. NVH design optimization of engine components has become more practical due to the development of computer software and hardware. However, there is still a need for smarter algorithms to draw a direct relationship between the design and the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> At the moment, techniques based on modal acoustic transfer vectors (MATVs) have gained popularity in design optimization for their good performance in sound pressure prediction. Since MATVs are derived based on structural modes, they are not independent with respect to <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> In contrast, acoustic radiation modes are an orthogonal set of velocity distributions on the structure’s surface that contribute to the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> independently. As a result, it is beneficial to describe structural vibration in terms of acoustic radiation modes in order to identify the velocity distributions that contribute the majority of the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> Measures can then be taken to modify the identified vibration patterns to reduce their magnitudes, which will in turn result in an unequivocal reduction of the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> A workflow based on multibody dynamic simulation and acoustic radiation modes to optimize an engine oil pan design is demonstrated in this paper.

40|$|The sound {{radiation}} from rolling tyres {{is still not}} very well understood. Although details such as horn effect or directivity during rolling have been investigated, {{it is not clear}} which vibrational modes of the tyre structure are responsible for the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> In this work an advanced tyre model based on Wave Guide Finite Elements is used in connection with a contact model validated in previous work. With these tools the tyre vibrations during rolling on an ISO surface are simulated. Starting from the calculated contact forces in time the amplitudes of the modes excited during rolling are determined as function of frequency. A boundary element model also validated in previous work is applied to predict the sound pressure level on a reference surface around a tyre placed on rigid ground as function of the modal composition of the tyre vibrations. Taking into account different modes when calculating the vibrational field as input into the boundary element calculations, it is possible to identify individual modes or groups of modes of special relevance for the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> The results show that mainly low-order modes with relative low amplitudes but high radiation efficiency in the frequency range around 1 kHz are responsible for the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> at these frequencies, while those modes which are most strongly excited in that frequency range during rolling are irrelevant for the <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> This fact is very essential when focusing on the design of quieter tyres...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} investigates a {{new technique}} for measuring the modal amplitude distribution, <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> transmission and radiation, and far field directivity of the broadband noise from hard walled ducts. The innovative aspect of this method is that it only requires the measurements of the two-point complex coherence function between the acoustic pressures at two closely spaced points on the duct wall. This method is therefore very useful when direct measurements of <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> and directivity are not possible. This paper describes detailed measurements of the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> spectrum and coherence function from a hard walled circular duct excited at one end by a diffuse sound field.

40|$|A linear {{quadratic}} regulator based optimization problem is formulated {{in order to}} minimize the broad-band low-frequency domain vibration and acoustic response of a baffled simply supported plate by means of multiple optimally tuned mass–spring–damper systems. To this end, we propose a robust method to obtain a (stable) state–space model describing the far-field <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power,</b> also known as the radiation filter. The Kirchhoff plate equation, which describes the plate vibrations, is discretized based on the Rayleigh–Ritz method. The resulting state–space models of the plate and the mass–springdamper systems are coupled to the radiation filter. Finally, the optimal spring stiffness and damping values of each mass–spring–damper system are successfully obtained by minimizing the kinetic energy or the far-field <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of the plate for low computational cost. In general, the results indicate that tuned mass-spring-damper systems have great potential to reduce the broadband low frequency vibration and acoustic response of vibro-acoustic systems.

Unfortunately, none of these methods directly guides the changes necessary to reduce noise radiation. Radiation mode analysis has previously been primarily associated with forward prediction of <b>radiated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> Since radiation modes contribute independently to sound power radiation, it is only necessary to modify the surface vibration so that it does not strongly couple with those modes in order to ensure sound power reduction.

In this paper, the results of the experimental investigations into the sound radiation of vibrating rectangular plates containing tapered indentations of power-law profile are reported. Such tapered indentations materialise two-dimensional acoustic black holes for flexural waves that result in absorption of {{a large proportion of the}} incident flexural wave energy and, therefore, cause efficient damping of plate’s flexural vibrations.

Consideration of a partial receiver surface allows the structural surface contributions to a specific far-field location to be identified. For the scattering problem, non-negative intensity and back-calculated non-negative intensity are derived to identify the surface contributions of a rigid scatterer to scattered <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> Three numerical examples of a rigid sphere, a rigid cylinder and a rigid hemispherical shell submerged in a heavy fluid medium are examined. Results for back-calculated non-negative intensity evaluated for different receiver surfaces are compared to non-negative intensity and scattered intensity. The analysis is then extended to consider scattering from elastic structures. Fluid-loaded and fluid-filled spherical shells are examined. Fully coupled finite element/boundary element models are used to solve both the exterior and interior acoustic-structure interaction problem. For the radiation problem, non-negative intensity is compared to numerical supersonic intensity, which is calculated using a two-dimensional convolution between a spatial radiation filter and the sound field. Numerical examples of a baffled plate, a cylindrical shell and an engine crankcase are presented. The two intensity-based techniques are compared both in terms of a <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> ratio and the modal assurance criterion, in order to identify the optimal values of the cut-off coefficients that result in better convergence between the intensity techniques. Non-negative intensity for a plate is also compared to results for supersonic intensity and acoustic intensity obtained experimentally using near-field acoustic holography measurements. Back-calculated non-negative intensity evaluated from a range of different partial far-field receiver surfaces is then compared with non-negative intensity and acoustic intensity. In contrast to acoustic intensity, non-negative intensity and back-calculated non-negative intensity are always positive and as such avoids the cancellation effects between positive and negative values of acoustic intensity from adjacent areas. Thus non-negative intensity directly identifies surface areas of a structure that contribute to <b>radiated</b> <b>sound.</b> Back-calculated non-negative intensity can identify the surface contributions to a specific receiver surface.
