40|$|Investors in <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> {{evaluate}} them {{based upon}} financial considerations such as coupon rate, time-to-maturity, callability, convertibility, and financial {{condition of the}} issuer. These investors regard promised yield as only a rough measure of the reward a bond offers to compensate them for the pure time-value-of-money and the financial risks {{to which they are}} exposed. Hence, they need a more meaningful measure of reward to facilitate comparisons among <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe an alternative heuristic approach to the task of making such comparisons. The approach produces a simple "ordinal" measure of reward, called the 'indifference spread,' that considers implicitly the potential sources of return to, as well as many of the risks associated with, investment in <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> For any <b>coupon</b> <b>bond,</b> the indifference spread method permits assessment of "relative" reward offered for the combined exposures to price and call risks, while also reasonably accommodating possible sale anytime prior to maturity. Once an investor (e. g., money manager) identifies indifference spreads for all bonds under consideration as of any moment in time, he/she can then draw conclusions regarding their relative values at that time based, in large part, on these spreads.

So long as none of the underlying assets crosses a lower barrier, the investor receives the payoff of a <b>coupon</b> <b>bond.</b> Otherwise, there is a cash settlement at maturity which depends on the lowest stock return. Thus, the products consist of a knock-out <b>coupon</b> <b>bond</b> and a knockin minimum option.

Without considering the trivial case of one underlying, the price of the knock-in minimum option is to be calculated numerically. Alternatively to exact pricing, we derive semi–closed form upper price bounds. These bounds are the lowest upper price bounds which can be derived without the usage of numerical methods. In addition, the bounds are especially tight with respect to the market convention that the certificates are traded at a discount of the corresponding <b>coupon</b> <b>bond.</b> This is also illustrated with market data...|$|R
