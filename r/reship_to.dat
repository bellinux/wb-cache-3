50|$|Shahab {{brought an}} old notepad, on which, {{a few days}} after the tragedy had occurred, he had written down the names of the drowned he knew. He told how he spent $7000 to travel from Karachi to Damasco and Latakia, where he boarded a ship called Alex, being later <b>reshipped</b> <b>to</b> the Ena, the Friendship, and finally the Iohan. He stated he was to pay another $7000 after {{disembarking}} in Italy.|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} design, fabrication, assembly, operation, economic analysis, {{and process}} support R and D for an Experimental Process System Development Unit (EPSDU) are reported. About 95 % of purchased equipment is received {{and will be}} <b>reshipped</b> <b>to</b> the West Coast location. The Data Collection System is completed. In the area of melting/consolidation, to the system using silicon powder transfer, melting and shotting on a pseudocontinuous basis is demonstrated. It is proposed to continue the very promising fluid bed work...|$|R

John C. H. Lee, with the flats of the Cheltenham Racecourse becoming a giant storage depot for countless trucks, jeeps, tanks and artillery pieces. Most of this materiel was <b>reshipped</b> <b>to</b> the continent for and after the D-Day invasion. Lee and his primary staff had offices and took residence at Thirlestaine Hall in Cheltenham.|$|R
25|$|After a stay {{of nearly}} a year, he was sent, along with 600 {{officers}} from various prisons, to Fort Delaware, in accordance with a scheme <b>to</b> <b>reship</b> them <b>to</b> Morris Island in South Carolina, a place under constant fire from Confederate cannon. Archer and the others would be hostages to prevent further shelling. Ultimately, Archer {{was not one of}} the Immortal Six Hundred who were the subjects of this event.|$|R
50|$|Haggar Apparel Co., the respondent, designs, manufactures, {{and markets}} apparel for men. The matter arose from a refund {{proceeding}} for duties imposed on men's trousers shipped by Haggar to the United States from an assembly plant it controlled in Mexico. The fabric {{had been cut}} in the United States and then shipped to Mexico, along with the thread, buttons, and zippers necessary to complete the garments. There the trousers were sewn and <b>reshipped</b> <b>to</b> the United States. If {{that had been the}} full extent of it, there would not have been a dispute, for if there were mere assembly without other steps, all agree the imported garments would have been eligible for the duty exemption Haggar claimed.|$|R

50|$|British {{diplomacy}} {{during the}} war focused on new initiatives {{in cooperation with the}} leading allies, promote propaganda efforts with neutrals, and initiatives to undermine the German economy, especially through a naval blockade. In 1915, an Allied conference began operations in Paris to coordinate financial support for allies, munitions productions, and rationing of raw materials to neutrals who might otherwise <b>reship</b> them <b>to</b> Germany. Britain established a blacklist, a shipping control commission and a ministry of blockade.|$|R

25|$|These were {{ships that}} made voyages from the Philippines to Mexico, whose goods were then transported {{overland}} from Acapulco to Veracruz and later <b>reshipped</b> from Veracruz <b>to</b> Cádiz in Spain. So then, the ships that set sail from Veracruz were generally loaded with merchandise from the East Indies originating from the commercial {{centers of the}} Philippines, plus the precious metals and natural resources of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver received from New Spain.|$|R

40|$|New drug {{development}} follows an extended sequence of steps (discovery, animal trials, FDA application (IND), product and process development, three phases of clinical trials, FDA filing and approval and launch) {{as a result}} of which it takes many years and considerable expense (upwards of 1 Billion) to bring a new drug to market. The clinical trials constitute a critically important and very expensive part of the development process as it involves producing, distributing and administering the candidate therapy to an increasing number of patients located in different geographic zones. A number of different approaches are being pursued to reduce clinical trial costs, including innovations in trial organization and patient pool selection. This thesis focuses attention not on the design of trials but on more effective management of the clinical trial supply chain. ^ The key challenges is to fully satisfy the stochastic demands of clinical sites, while minimizing oversupplies and leftovers since unused materials cannot be recycled or <b>reshipped</b> <b>to</b> other sites at the end of clinical trials. Moreover, most supply chain management research deals with uncertainties in the planning models by using expected values of uncertainties to generate period plans to buffer the effects of uncertainties. However, the horizon of a clinical trial supply chain is only 1 - 2 years, at which point the trial is terminated. In traditional commercial supply chains the horizon can extend to 10 years or more and there is no explicit point at which the supply chain is terminated and residual material in inventory was discarded Therefore, the strategy used to buffer uncertainties in commercial supply chains become ineffective as expected values cannot be effectively used as targets. In this thesis, a simulation-optimization approach combined with risk pooling strategy, keeping a centralized inventory at a distribution center instead of with several retailers, is presented for clinical trial supply chain management to increase its operation efficiency and reduce the cost. ^ The entire approach includes four modules; namely, demand forecasting which mimics the stochastic patient arrival process, a decentralized or integrated planning and optimization which formulates and solves a Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programs (MILP) based planning and scheduling problem, a discrete event simulation model which simulates the entire clinical trial supply chain, and an outer loop search process to optimize the pooled safety stock levels. The operational plans developed via the MILP planning model serve as driver for the execution of the discrete event simulation of the supply chain, and the sum of deviations from target CSL is reduced by optimizing the 2 ̆ 2 pooled safety stock levels 2 ̆ 2 and re-executing the Simulation-Optimization cycle. Case studies are reported and compared to demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach and the combined risk pooling strategy. ...|$|R
