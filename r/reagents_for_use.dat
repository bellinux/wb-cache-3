40|$|The {{production}} {{and testing of}} 10 rat monoclonal antibodies specific for strains of potato virus X (PVX) are described.

The reactions of the PVX isolates with the MAbs were compared with the classification f PVX strains based on their effects in plants carrying different resistance genes; a preliminary serological classification issuggested. It is possible to distinguish PVX-HB from all other isolates tested using two MAbs (MAC 67 and MAC 59), and these, together with MAC 58, were produced in large quantities in ascitic fluids.

40|$|Breast mucin is {{secreted}} by breast {{tumor cells}} {{and serves as}} a marker for breast cancer. Thus, antibodies against breast mucin will be valuable in the development of immunotherapy and laboratory diagnostic tests. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against breast cancer–associated antigen were generated and characterized. Balb/c mice were immunized with breast cancer-associated antigen CA 15 - 3, and subsequently splenocytes from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells. After fusion, culture supernatants from hybridomas surviving HAT medium were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of eight hybridomas producing MAbs against breast cancer showed significant levels of antibody activity against CA 15 - 3. Two selected stable hybridomas were adapted into CELLine CL 350 bioreactors, and the MAbs produced were characterized for their subclass, specificity, and affinity.

40|$|A peptide {{nucleic acid}} (PNA) {{antisense}} for the AUG translation initiation region of prepro-oxytocin mRNA was synthesized and coupled to a r etro-inverso peptide that is rapidly taken up by cells. This bioconjugate was internalized by cultured cerebral cortex neurons within minutes, according to the specific property of the vector peptide. The PNA alone also entered the cells, but more slowly. Cell viability was unaffected when the PNA concentrations were lower than 10 microM and incubation times less than for 24 h. Magnocellular neurons from the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, which produce oxytocin and vasopressin, were cultured in chemically defined medium. Both PNA and vector peptide-PNA depressed the amounts of the mRNA coding for prepro-oxytocin in these neurons. A scrambled PNA had no effect and the very cognate prepro-vasopressin mRNA was not affected. The antisense PNA also depressed the immunocytochemical signal for prepro-oxytocin in this culture in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These results show that PNAs driven by the retro-inverso vector peptide are powerful antisense <b>reagents</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on cells in culture...|$|E
40|$|First {{observed}} in 1972 in Crassostrea virginica, herpes-like viruses of bivalves were more recently {{found to be}} associated with high mortality rates in other cultured oyster species, such as Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea edulis. The diagnosis of herpes-like virus infections is performed currently by laborious histological and transmission electron microscope examinations. Prep-aration of specific <b>reagents</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in more amenable diagnostic techniques prompted purification of virus particles and investigation of the viral genome. This paper is the first description of the purification of a virus pathogen from a bivalve mollusc. A procedure was developed which facilitated purification of large amounts of virus particles on the 40 – 50 % interface of sucrose gradients. Transmission electron microscopy showed that a purified virus suspension contained capsids and enveloped virus particles. High molecular mass viral DNA was extracted, and the genome size was estimated by the summation of the sizes of restriction endonuclease fragments to be approximately 180 kbp. Partial cloning of the virus genome was achieved and the specificity of certain cloned fragments was established by dot blot hybridization...|$|E

40|$|In vivo transcription-based assays for protein-protein {{interactions}} {{such as the}} {{two-hybrid system}} are powerful methods for identifying novel proteins based on their physical association with known proteins of biological interest, or for characterizing the degree and nature of interactions between sets of proteins.

40|$|An {{intestinal}} protozoan parasite, Cryptosporidium parvum, is a {{major cause}} of waterborne gastrointestinal disease worldwide. Detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in potable water is a high priority for the water treatment industry to reduce potential outbreaks among the consumer populace. Anti-Cryptosporidium oocyst polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were tested as capture and detection <b>reagents</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in a fiber optic biosensor assay for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Antibodies were validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, flow cytometry, Western blotting and fluorescent microscopy. Oocysts could be detected at a concentration of 105 oocysts/ml when the polyclonal antibodies were used as the capture and detection reagents. When oocysts were boiled prior to detection, a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was achieved using th e polyclonal antibody. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed that both the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies recognize a large (> 300 kDa) molecular weight mucin-like antigen present {{on the surface of the}} oocyst wall. The polyclonal antibody also reacted with a small (105 kDa) molecular weight antigen that was present in boiled samples of oocysts.

40|$|Background. Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) is a Gram {{negative}} diplococcus causing {{bacterial meningitis}} and fulminant septicemia. In {{order to allow}} efficient characterization of infecting strains, antibody <b>reagents</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as analytical tools {{have proven to be}} invaluable tools. Similarly, antibodies against relevant bacterial antigens may guide in the selection of components to be included in developing vaccine strategies. Methods. We have thus developed mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for class 1, 3 and 5 antigens expressed by the B: 4 :P 1. 15 isolate CU 385 / 83, also being used in a recently developed protective vaccine. In particular, two antibodies CB-Nm. 1 and CB- Nm. 2 recognize epitopes partly overlapping the subserotype (class 1 antigens) and serotype (class 3 antigen) specificities detected by the previously defined antibodies C 6 and 15 - 1 -P 4 respectively, were evaluated. Results. As judged by strain recognition, the absolute requirement for binding differs between both the class 1 -specific and class 3 specific antibodies suggesting the importance of using multiple antibodies when evaluating subserotype/serotype characteristics of clinical isolates of Nm by serological methods. Conclusion. Furthermore, the development of antibodies crossreactive with subserotype/serotype antigens may partly explain the ability of outer membrane protein vaccine to induce protective activity against strains considered as carrying different class 1 and 3 antigens as determined by available (sub) serotyping reagents...|$|E
