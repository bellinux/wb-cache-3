5|$|In January 2015, Daniel Bryan {{returned}} to the ring having recovered from his injury. That month at the Royal Rumble event, Brock Lesnar retained his title in a triple threat match against John Cena and Seth Rollins; the New Age Outlaws' return to the <b>ring</b> <b>saw</b> them lose to the Ascension, while Roman Reigns won the Royal Rumble match. The live audience booed Reigns' win and Bryan's early elimination from the match. In February, Reigns defeated Bryan at Fastlane to receive a WrestleMania main event title match against Lesnar, while Cesaro and Tyson Kidd won the Tag Team Championship from the Usos.|$|E
25|$|In 1951–1952 the Windies visited Australia. The first Test saw {{a narrow}} defeat by three wickets, {{with the two}} spinners {{seemingly}} continuing their form with twelve wickets between them. The second Test was lost by seven wickets, as Australia replied to the Windies 362 and 290 with 567 (which included centuries from Lindsay Hassett and Keith Miller) and 137 for 2. 6 wickets from Worrell in the third Test saw Australia dismissed for only 82, and the Windies eventually won by six wickets to pull back to two-one down in the series. The fourth Test saw the series lost in a narrow defeat. Worrell, batting with an injured hand, scored 108 and helped the Windies to 272 before Australia made 216 in reply. 203 from the Windies left Australia a target of 260. 5 wickets from Valentine helped reduced the Aussies to 222 for 9, 38 short with 1 wicket remaining. It didn't happen, as some brilliant running between the wicket for Australia by Bill Johnston and Doug <b>Ring</b> <b>saw</b> West Indies lose their composure and the match. The fifth Test saw three batting collapses, as Australia (116 and 377) beat Windies (78 and 213) by 202 runs to finish the rubber four-one winners. The West Indies {{then went on to}} New Zealand. In the first Test encounter between the two teams, the visitors scored a five wicket victory. In the second and final Test, Allan Rae scored 99, Jeffrey Stollmeyer 152, Frank Worrell 100 and Clyde Walcott 115 as the West Indies put on 546 for 6 declared. There wasn't enough time to bowl out the opposition twice though, as the hosts made 160 and were following-on at 17 for 1 when stumps were drawn, leaving the Windies series winners.|$|E
2500|$|When king Sigurd <b>Ring</b> <b>saw</b> this he {{encouraged}} his warriors {{and said that}} it was not possible that no one could defeat Ubbi. He then asked [...] "where is Starkad?". The old warrior answered [...] "it is difficult to win sire. However, I will do my best and do what I can, but Ubbi is a tough fighter". Starkad engaged with Ubbi and a fight began that was long and the most fierce of the entire battle. Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that no one had been closer to kill him before. The two champions were separated by the pushing throng of warriors, and Ubbi finally fell riddled with arrows from the archers of Telemark.|$|E

50|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a form}} of bandsaw {{where the}} band is rigid, rather than flexible. This {{requires}} the band to be circular, rather than the bandsaw's usual oblong of straight runs between two (or three) guide wheels.|$|E

50|$|A {{circular}} saw is a power-saw using a toothed or abrasive disc or blade to cut different materials using {{a rotary motion}} spinning around an arbor. A hole saw and <b>ring</b> <b>saw</b> also use a rotary motion but are different from a {{circular saw}}. Circular saws may also be loosely used for the blade itself.

50|$|The {{series was}} created by Takehiro Ando as a {{traditional}} role-playing game created within the restrictions of a mobile environment. Subsequent games adopted slightly different styles: Omega was an expansion on Chaos Rings story using the original engine, while the subsequent two games used rebuilt engines. Chaos <b>Rings</b> III <b>saw</b> the biggest shift for the series, with gameplay more similar to conventional role-playing games and a lighter tone to its story. The series has met with positive reception, and as of 2015 the series has received one million downloads worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The first {{match was}} between Kurt Angle and Rey Mysterio.

The two entered the <b>ring,</b> which <b>saw</b> Mysterio execute a headscissors takeover. Mysterio attempted the 619 but Angle ducked and dominated Mysterio. However, Mysterio was able to execute a senton from the ring to the floor on Angle. Mysterio then delivered the 619 and the West Coast Pop for a near-fall. Angle reversed a diving hurricarana into the ankle lock, to which Mysterio submitted.|$|R
50|$|The main form of <b>ring</b> <b>saw</b> uses a ring or {{wire that}} is like a flat disk. The non-cutting side of the blade is behind of the cutting edge, so limits {{the depth of the}} cuts that may be made. Wire-saws are coated with an {{abrasive}} on all sides and so may cut in any direction. With the ring behind the cutting edge, cuts in the main direction will treat the blade (in mechanical terms) as an arch, which is stiffer than a sideways force on a cylindrical blade. This geometry also gives a vertical cut in thick materials, although the cut must be kept straight and unlike a bandsaw, curves cannot be sawn if the material is thick. They may be used for mineralogy and slabbing.|$|E

50|$|Many {{makers of}} ringsaws offer a similar blade as a bandsaw too. The ringsaw blade in {{comparison}} {{may be made}} rigid, thus stronger and less flexible under cutting loads, giving a more accurate cut. Some make a particular feature of the ring saw's ability to cut forwards, backwards and sideways. As the bandsaw blade must be flexible enough to pass around the wheels, its blades are limited to cutting on the forward edge. The oblong bandsaw has a blade that is supported on two large wheels. The interval between the two wheels is supported by blade guides immediately behind the cutting zone. Ring saws {{do not have the}} same straight run of blade, nor the opportunity to support much of the blade as with the wheels of a bandsaw. A <b>ring</b> <b>saw</b> is thus a somewhat fragile machine and excess pressure on a thin blade is likely to damage it.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his early}} days as Aníbal Mil Mascaras and Black Shadow acted as his padrinos or mentors. In 1966 Aníbal won the Distrito Federal Light Heavyweight Championship, then lost it to Pepe Casas as he signed a {{contract}} with Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL). He spent {{the next couple of years}} working his way up the ranks in EMLL, honing his high flying skills into a top level competitor. 1970 was Aníbals breakthrough year. He defeated Mashio Koma to win the NWA World Middleweight Championship on December 6, 1970, and was named El Halcón Magazines [...] "1970 Wrestler of the year". Aníbals run with the NWA Middleweight title lasted over a year and saw him successfully defend the title in several high-profile main events. During his title reign Aníbal developed a heated rivalry with René Guajardo, a rivalry that saw the two face off in several main events all around Mexico. On March 30, 1973, Guajardo ended Aníbals NWA Middleweight title reign. [...] On June 28, 1974, Aníbal defeated Adorable Rubí to win the Mexican National Middleweight Championship in the main event of a show in Mexico City, Mexico. On September 20, Aníbal became a double champion, defeating El Cobarde in a match for the vacant NWA World Middleweight Champiohship. Aníbals run as a double champion ended when he lost the Mexican National Middleweight Title on November 29, 1974, to Ringo Mendoza. His success in the <b>ring</b> <b>saw</b> him named [...] "Wrestler of the year" [...] in 1974.|$|E

40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Broadway Campus {{recently}} hosted {{an afternoon}} of interactive and theatrical history {{as part of the}} festival, Peepshow: Chippendale [...] . behind closed doors. The festival encouraged local businesses to open their doors to the community and to show people the creative industries and artists existing in the eclectic and historic suburb of Chippendale. The day consisted of four themed tours each taking audience to four different locations across the suburb. Notre Dame was one the official Peepshow tour sites. Visitors to the Campus were invited to take a ‘step back in time’ and learn about the origins of the buildings which date back to 1845. The University’s theatre studies program played a large role on the day, with a number of students acting out parts of the tour. A ‘town-crier’ herded the groups together and the ‘Hunchback of Notre Dame’ welcomed the tour into St Benedict’s church. Theatre studies coordinator, Ms Jane Bergeron, said the Chippendale Peepshow was a great initiative and a big success for the University. “The students did a fantastic job reenacting parts of Notre Dame’s history and giving over 70 visitors from the local community unique insight into the Campus. “Whilst on the tours people met an opera singing ghost, heard Australia’s second oldest set of church bells <b>ringing,</b> <b>saw</b> a 1870 s primary school class in action and bumped into a few nuns along the way,” said Ms Jane Bergeron. The Notre Dame Broadway site started as St Benedict’s School and Parish in the 1840 s. St Benedict’s Parish and church are still flourishing and the school buildings have now been adapted for the University’s use. Media contact: Moira Saunders 02 8204 440...|$|R
