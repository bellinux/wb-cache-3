5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the <b>roadway</b> itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the <b>roadway</b> was built; however, until the cables were in place the <b>roadway</b> could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the <b>roadway</b> built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the <b>roadway</b> dropped into place.|$|E
5|$|A <b>roadway</b> {{has existed}} since before 1926, {{connecting}} Toppenish and Prosser near the current alignment of SR22, however the <b>roadway</b> was incomplete, with a gap existing between Satus and Mabton. The {{gap in the}} <b>roadway</b> was completed by 1933, and the segment between Toppenish and Prosser was numbered Secondary State Highway 3A (SSH3A) by 1939, while the segment between the current I-82 and US97 was originally numbered as part of Primary State Highway 8 (PSH8). These designations remained until the 1964 state highway renumbering, when SSH3A and the small segment of PSH8 were renumbered SR22. Before the completion of I-82 through the area, SR22 continued into the town of Buena, however now that the interstate has been completed, SR22 has been truncated to the interstate.|$|E

5|$|M-68 was {{designated}} along {{a segment of}} its current <b>roadway</b> in 1936. The <b>roadway</b> connecting Alanson and Indian River was given the M-68 designation, while US23 was routed between Rogers City and Afton.

40|$|Shared <b>roadways</b> are a cost {{effective}} method for providing bicycle facilities {{in areas with}} limited right-of-way; shared <b>roadways</b> have automobiles and bicycles operating in the same traveled way. However, shared <b>roadways</b> may negatively affect traffic operations and there is limited guidance on appropriate shared <b>roadways</b> implementation. This thesis has three objectives: evaluate the impact of shared <b>roadways</b> on automobile quality of service, compare automobile quality of service to bicycle quality of service on shared <b>roadways,</b> and provide guidance on the implementation of shared <b>roadways.</b> The author hypothesizes that shared <b>roadways</b> should only be implemented when automobile Level of Service (LOS), bicycle LOS, and facility safety are "acceptable. " The author accomplishes the objectives by generating data using microsimulation models. The author uses microsimulation model data to evaluate automobile quality of service on shared <b>roadways.</b> In the evaluation of automobile quality of service, the measures of effectiveness are automobile LOS threshold (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in automobile LOS) and automobile average travel speed (the average travel time divided by the segment length, a space mean speed). To compare automobile and bicycle quality of service, the author uses the bicycle LOS model in NCHRP Report 616 to generate bicycle LOS thresholds (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in bicycle LOS). After generating bicycle LOS thresholds, the author compares the bicycle LOS thresholds to the automobile LOS thresholds. Finally, the author uses {{the findings of the}} investigations to provide guidance on the implementation of shared <b>roadways.</b> In this thesis, the author finds automobile quality of service on shared <b>roadways</b> decreases as automobile free-flow speed, automobile volume, and bicycle volume increase. For most conditions, the author finds bicycle quality of service is better than automobile quality of service on shared <b>roadways.</b> Bicycle quality of service is lower than automobile quality of service with increases in unsignalized access points per mile, signalized intersection crossing distance, and heavy vehicle percent. The author provides guidance on the implementation of shared <b>roadways</b> based upon automobile quality of service...|$|R

30|$|Based on {{geological}} {{and mining}} characteristics, <b>roadways</b> under complex conditions {{were divided into}} five types (Kang and Wang 2007): (1) Loose and soft type.

The structural planes in the surrounding rocks of <b>roadways</b> develop maturely, coal and rocks are broken and instable; (3) High stress type. One sub-type is the <b>roadways</b> with depth more than 800  m and high in situ stresses, in which bumps and other disasters are easy to take place; the other sub-type is the <b>roadways</b> experiencing two-time or multi-time strong mining disturbances, causing high mining stresses and severe deformation.
