40|$|Motion {{estimation}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} bottlenecks in real-time performance scalable video coding applications due to high computational complexity of exhaustive search. To address this, researchers so far focused on low-complexity motion estimation and rate-distortion optimization in isolation. Proliferation of power-constrained handheld devices with image capturing capability has created demand for much smarter approach where motion estimation is integrated with rate control such that rate-distortion-complexity optimization can be effectively achieved. It is indeed crucial to provide such performance scalability in motion estimation to facilitate complexity management in such devices. This chapter presents an overview of motion estimation. Beginning with an introduction to the importance of motion estimation, it systematically examines various motion estimation techniques and their strengths and weaknesses, focussing primarily on block-based motion search. It then examines the limitation of the existing techniques in accommodating performance scalability, introduces a promising approach, Distance-dependent Thresholding Search (DTS) motion search, to fill in this gap, and concludes with future research directions in the field. The authors suggest that the content of the chapter will make a significant contribution and serve as a reference for multimedia signal processing <b>research</b> <b>at</b> <b>postgraduate</b> <b>level...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the development, use {{and evaluation of}} a website to supplement face-to-face teaching of <b>research</b> methods <b>at</b> <b>postgraduate</b> <b>level.</b> Diversity as well as disparity in student backgrounds presented challenges in providing appropriate educational support at multiple levels. The site {{was developed to meet}} the diverse student needs with scarce teaching resources and represented an innovative use of Information Technology in a small higher education institution in Scotland. Formative evaluation methods that included questionnaires and focus groups were used to investigate the student learning experience. Positive student evaluations showed the effectiveness of developing a website to enable and empower students. Lessons drawn from the project include the importance of pedagogical principles, simplicity and user-friendliness in web design. The study showed the feasibility and desirability of integrating World Wide Web resources with on-site teaching for students who seek attendance-based courses and for initiating them to more effective use of the Internet. However, technical support and appropriate infrastructure for faculty who develop web resources remains essential. It is hoped that this case study may encourage others to harness the strengths of web technology to meet contemporary challenges in teaching students with diverse needs...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of work-based <b>research</b> {{projects}} <b>at</b> <b>postgraduate</b> <b>level.</b> The focus of this paper is to measure the impact of masters- and doctoral-level work-based projects which was the specific contribution of one group of researchers to the Nixon et al. ’s (2008) study. Design/methodology/approach. This paper is based on data generated as part of a wider study that examines the impact of work-based learning projects across undergraduate through to doctoral level from the perspective of employers and from the employees perspective. The research study is based on a sample of alumni who had graduated from work-based masters and professional doctorate programmes and their corresponding employers in a UK higher education institution. Findings. At masters and doctorate level the work-based project can often make an impact on the work context and also have a developmental effect on the employee who becomes a practitioner-researcher to undertake the project. Originality/value.

40|$|A recent {{assessment}} of 4400 postgraduate courses in Brazil by CAPES (a federal government agency {{dedicated to the}} improvement of the quality of and <b>research</b> <b>at</b> the <b>postgraduate</b> <b>level)</b> stimulated a large amount of manifestations in the press, scientific journals and scientific congresses. This gigantic effort to classify 16, 400 scientific journals in order to provide indicators for assessment proved to be puzzling and methodologically erroneous in terms of gauging the institutions from a metric point of view. A simple algorithm is proposed here to weigh the scientometric indicators that should be considered in the {{assessment of}} a scientific institution.

40|$|Although Feng Shui {{has been}} built upon ancient Chinese philosophy, in particular, the Yi ling of Daoism, it has still been treated as a branch of metaphysics and being viewed by most people as {{something}} superstitious.

40|$|Students are {{becoming}} more and more mobile globally and Mainland Chinese students (MCSs) contribute a big part to this mobility. Hong Kong, emerging from the colonial era with a blended social system of the East and West, shares significantly similar cultural heritage with Mainland China while differs as well in some cultural dimensions for historical reasons. It attracts a lot of MCSs every year, especially <b>at</b> <b>research</b> <b>postgraduate</b> <b>level.</b> Things central to the mobility of the sojourning students are their adaptation to the new environment and how this adaptation may shape who they become. Amundson (1996) suggested that adaptation was usually accompanied with an increasing complexity and changes in intelligence and conceptions. It is in nature a continuing developmental process as a result of human’s constant confrontation with the new environment. This study adopted a developmental approach in looking at the adaptation of MCSs in a sibling cultural environment, Hong Kong. Qualitative data were collected from 25 MCSs studying in a Hong Kong university through focus group discussions. The analytical framework of conceptual change which deeply rooted in developmental theory was applied to deconstruct the types of cognitive conflicts MCSs experienced in their adaptation to Hong Kong, how they responded to the conflict points, and at which level the experience shaped their conceptions. The implications of the study were discussed in the chapter...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to increase}} awareness of the potential of BIM for heritage conservation in academic studios and professional practice. This dissertation investigates {{the current state of}} knowledge on BIM in an extensive literature review in chapter 2, which establishes the theoretical and technical foundations of the field and looks at existing knowledge from both the new-build and conservation sectors. The literature review highlights the need for more dedicated research on the practical aspects of BIM for heritage and suggests practical research as a method for further investigation. Following the literature review, chapter 3 examines creative practice methodologies employed in academic <b>research</b> <b>at</b> <b>postgraduate</b> and doctoral <b>levels</b> in the UK and abroad. This review of existing methodologies was used as a basis for developing the research methodology of this dissertation, in accordance with the third research objective. Chapter 4 presents the core module of the research methodology, referred to as ‘practicum’, which involved situated practical work under professional studio conditions in Summerhall, Edinburgh. In this chapter, following a justification of the research methodology employed for this dissertation, the results of practice are presented, including the BIM strategies developed in response to project conditions and goals, as well as an overview of practical work. In the end, these results are evaluated in relation to the wider theoretical and technical context provided by the literature review. The last chapter presents a discussion as {{to the success of the}} research methodology in relation to the particular research question, aim, and objectives. BIM for heritage conservation is a relatively new field of research and presents many opportunities for future investigation. In response to the research question, the dissertation concludes with a justification for the following argument: although BIM philosophy is ideally suitable for heritage purposes, BIM adoption in conservation practice is hindered by the current limitations of BIM software...|$|R
