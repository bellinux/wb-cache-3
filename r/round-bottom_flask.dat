50|$|The round bottoms {{on these}} types of flasks allow more uniform heating and/or boiling of liquid. Thus, <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> are used {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} where the contents are heated or boiled. <b>Round-bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> are used in distillation by chemists as distilling flasks and receiving flasks for the distillate (see distillation diagram).

50|$|A {{pressure}} reactor {{can offer}} several advantages over the conventional <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flask.</b> Firstly, it can conduct a reaction above {{the boiling point}} of a solvent. Secondly, the pressure can reduce the reaction volume, including the liquid phase, and in turn increase concentration and collision frequency, and accelerate a reaction.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the round}} bottom, cork rings are {{needed to keep the}} round bottom flasks upright. When in use, <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> are {{commonly}} held at the neck by clamps on a stand.|$|R
50|$|<b>Round-bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> {{are shaped}} like a tube {{emerging}} {{from the top of}} a sphere. The flasks are often long neck; sometimes they have the incision on the neck, which precisely defines the volume of flask. They can be used in distillations, or in the heating a product. These types of flask are alternatively called Florence flasks.|$|R

These enemies generally move in regular patterns, and can take various amounts of damage. Some enemies can be destroyed (though they will eventually respawn), whereas others can merely be stunned for a few seconds.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chemical}} synthesis begins by selection of compounds {{that are known}} as reagents or reactants. Various reaction types {{can be applied to}} these to synthesize the product, or an intermediate product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel such as a chemical reactor or a simple <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flask.</b> Many reactions require some form of work-up procedure before the final product is isolated.|$|E

The most common solvents used are tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether. Whatever solvent is used should be anhydrous and pure. Alkoxyaluminium hydrides should be kept as dry as possible and represent a significant fire hazard, particularly when an excess of hydride is used (hydrogen evolves during workup).|$|E

50|$|Special {{electrically}} powered heating mantles {{are available in}} various sizes into which the bottoms of <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> can fit so that {{the contents of a}} flask can be heated for distillation, chemical reactions, boiling, etc. Heating can also be accomplished by submerging the bottom of the flask into a heat bath, water bath, or sand bath. Similarly cooling can be accomplished by partial submerging into a cooling bath, filled with e.g. cold water, ice, eutectic mixtures, dry ice/solvent mixtures, or liquid nitrogen.|$|R
5000|$|Florence flask: A flask {{similar to}} the {{flat-bottomed}} flask that has round bodies and either a round bottom or a flat bottom so that one can stand the flask on a level surface. Florence flasks typically have one neck which is longer and may be somewhat wider than the usual neck of a round bottom flask. The necks of traditional Florence flasks often {{do not have a}} ground glass joint like modern round bottom <b>flasks</b> do. <b>Round-bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> are used more commonly by professional chemists than Florence flasks.|$|R
30|$|The {{extraction}} {{of the soil}} samples {{was carried out by}} the method described by Frimpong et al. (2013), with slight modification from the Ghana Standard Authority (GSA) Pesticide Residues Laboratory Protocols. Ten grams (10  g) of the sub-soil samples were weighed and transferred into 250  ml separating flasks. A 10  ml of acetonitrile was added and the corked flasks sonicated (Grant XUB 18 UK) for 5  min. An additional 10  ml of acetonitrile was added, and the separating flasks closed tightly. The content of the flasks were placed on a horizontal mechanical shaker (Ika-Werke HS 501 Digital), and was set to shake continuously for 30  min at 300 mot/min, and allowed to stand for 10  min to sufficiently separate the phases or layers. The supernatants (organic layers) were carefully transferred into 50  ml centrifuge tubes for centrifugation (Thermo/CR 3 i Multifunction) at 3000  rpm for 5  min. A 10  ml aliquot of the supernatants (organic phases/top layers) equivalent to 5.0  g soil weight were pipetted and dried/passed over 5  g anhydrous sodium sulphates through a filter paper into 50  ml <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flasks.</b> Then, 5  ml of acetonitrile was used to rinse the salt into the <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flasks.</b> The concentrates were then adjusted to about 2  ml using the rotary film evaporator (Buchi Ratovapor R- 210, USA) at 35  °C, and made ready for the clean-up step.|$|R

50|$|<b>Round-bottom</b> <b>flasks</b> {{often have}} one or more conically tapered ground glass joint openings, or necks. Conventionally, these joints at the flask necks are outer joints. Other adapters, such as {{distillation}} heads and vacuum adapters, are made with joints that fit in with this convention. If a flask or other container has an extra outer ground-glass joint on it, which needs to be closed off for an experiment, there are often conically tapered inner ground-glass stoppers for that purpose. In some cases, small hook-like glass protrusions may be fused onto {{the rest of the}} glass item near a joint to allow an end loop of a small spring to be attached, so the spring helps keep joints temporarily together. The use of a special very small size of conically tapered fitting for glass, plastic, or metal parts called a Luer fitting or adapter has become more widespread. Originally, Luer fittings were used to connect the hub of a needle to a syringe. Where the use of ground glass presents a problem, as in the production or distillation of diazomethane (which may explode on contact with rougher surfaces), equipment with smooth glass joints may be used.|$|R
30|$|In {{a typical}} synthesis, Cd(CH 3 COO) 2 · 2 H 2 O (0.133 g) as {{precursor}} was dissolved in {{the mixture of}} TCB (16 mL) and DMSO (8 mL) in a three-neck <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flask.</b> After magnetically stirring for 30 min, different amounts (0, 10, 50, or 100 mg) of P 3 HT were added into the mentioned solutions, {{and the color of}} the solution became dark red immediately.

40|$|The {{performance}} of heterogeneous catalysts in multiphase reactions {{in general is}} governed by different types of extrinsic and intrinsic structural effects on all length scales, i. e., on the macro- (m to cm), meso- (mm to µm), and microlevel (nm). This PhD research, with a catalysis-engineering approach, focused on several of these multiscale structure-performance relationships of supported palladium (Pd) catalysts applied in, industrially important, multiphase hydrogenations. The structure-performance relationships were studied in various batch and continuous reactors of which most are related to important topics in process intensification such a monolithic reactors and flow chemistry. The {{performance of}} monolithic Pd catalysts was enhanced by combining {{a new type of}} structured highly porous monoliths with a pressure pulse generating gas-liquid flow (i. e., Taylor flow). This induced a convective flow inside the ‘open’ monolith walls thereby enhancing the mass exchange with the Pd catalyst. This favourable result opens the avenue to higher catalyst loadings without increasing internal mass transfer limitations. Furthermore, a proof of concept study showed that a cheap and readily available gas chromatography capillary, wall-coated with an alumina-supported Pd catalyst and operated in the Taylor flow regime, can be used to synthesize high-value products and to rapidly produce (visual) information about catalytic hydrogenations. This Pd capillary flow device is an excellent alternative for expensive microchip technology and bulky <b>round-bottom</b> <b>flasks.</b> Finally, the intrinsic property of Pd to absorb hydrogen into its crystal lattice was shown to have a strong influence on its performance in the hydrogenation of aromatic nitriles. The transformation into stable Pd ?-hydride above a certain threshold hydrogen pressure induced a persistent change in activity and by-product selectivity. Chemical EngineeringApplied Science...|$|R
