40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to identify whether the recent foreign reserve accumulation in Asian economies {{has been too}} extraordinary to recover the moderate level of reserves which depleted {{at the time of}} the currency crisis in 1997 - 1998. First of all, the level of reserves numerated by various economic fundamentals such as broad money, imports and short-term external debt in Asian economies was examined in order to judge whether the level was high enough to weather speculative pressures at the onset of the crisis in 1997. The analysis is based on a Brownian motion model with an absorbing barrier. Although most Asian economies appeared to have larger reserves (<b>reserve</b> <b>indicators)</b> than the estimated threshold {{at the time of the}} crisis of 1997, reserves in terms of short-term external debt were apparently not sufficient to avoid speculative attacks. Then, based on the estimated threshold of <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators,</b> the likelihood of a 25 % devaluation within three months ahead is calculated. Probabilities of currency devaluation vary from time to time, among countries, and among <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators.</b> The devaluation likelihood was modest in the mid 1990 s, but then it showed a big jump in 1997 in Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, and Philippines. foreign reserves, accumulation, Asia, threshold, currency crisis...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} reproductive aging on oocyte mitochondrial quantity, function, and DNA (mtDNA) integrity. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: IVF clinic in a tertiary academic care center. PATIENT(S) : One hundred two oocytes from 32 women undergoing IVF. INTERVENTION(S) : None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, mtDNA number, and mtDNA deletion occurrence in individual oocytes. RESULT(S) : Oocyte ATP content increases with maturation (786 ± 87 fmol, 1, 037 ± 57 fmol, and 1, 201 ± 59 fmol for prophase 1 [P 1], metaphase 1 [M 1], and metaphase 2 [M 2] oocytes, respectively), whereas mtDNA copy numbers do not change (64, 500 ± 20, 440, 180, 000 ± 44, 040, and 143, 000 ± 31, 210 for P 1, M 1, and M 2 oocytes, respectively). Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified developmental stage as a determinant of oocyte ATP, whereas number of oocytes retrieved and cycle day 3 FSH level were determinants of mtDNA copy number.

40|$|Abstract Background Little {{is known}} about adult health and {{mortality}} relationships outside high-income nations, partly because few datasets have contained biomarker data in representative populations. Our objective {{is to determine the}} prognostic value of biomarkers with respect to total and cardiovascular mortality in an elderly population of a middle-income country, as well as {{the extent to which they}} mediate the effects of age and sex on mortality. Methods This is a prospective population-based study in a nationally representative sample of elderly Costa Ricans. Baseline interviews occurred mostly in 2005 and mortality follow-up went through December 2010. Sample size after excluding observations with missing values: 2, 313 individuals and 564 deaths. Main outcome: prospective death rate ratios for 22 baseline biomarkers, which were estimated with hazard regression models. Results Biomarkers significantly predict future death above and beyond demographic and self-reported health conditions. The studied biomarkers account for almost half of the effect of age on mortality. However, the sex gap in mortality became several times wider after controlling for biomarkers. The most powerful predictors were simple physical tests: handgrip strength, pulmonary peak flow, and walking speed. Three blood tests also predicted prospective mortality: C-reactive protein (CRP), glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Strikingly, high blood pressure (BP) and high total cholesterol showed little or no predictive power. Anthropometric measures also failed to show significant mortality effects. Conclusions This study adds to the growing evidence that blood markers for CRP, HbA 1 c, and DHEAS, along with organ-specific functional <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators</b> (handgrip, walking speed, and pulmonary peak flow), are valuable tools for identifying vulnerable elderly. The results also highlight the need to better understand an anomaly noted previously in other settings: despite the continued medical focus on drugs for BP and cholesterol, high levels of BP and cholesterol have little predictive value of mortality in this elderly population. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Main {{causes of}} {{infertility}} include diminished ovarian reserve. Diminished ovarian reserve is about availability of number of good quality pre ovulatory oocytes in the ovaries. As a woman ages, her ovarian reserve decreases. In recent years assessment of and ldquo;ovarian reserve and rdquo; became a strategy in treatment of female infertility. Although the true and functional ovarian reserves reflect {{different stages of}} follicular development, they are inherently linked and both decline in parallel with increasing age. Accurate measurement of the ovarian reserve {{has long been a}} quest in reproductive medicine. The objective {{of the study was to}} find out the ovarian reserve and also to correlate the ovarian <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators</b> with different age groups of infertile women. Methods: This prospective study was conducted at Karpaga Vinayaga Institute of Medical Sciences, Madhurantagam, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India during the period of January 2014 to April 2016. The study comprises of 100 newly diagnosed PCOS women and they were all divided into three age groups. Group I consists of infertile women who were under the age of 26 years or less than 26 years. Group II consists of infertile women of age range between 27 to 35 years. Group III consists of infertile women who are 36 years and greater than 36 years of age. Results: In the present study, ovarian reserve markers had shown significant variation with age in infertile women. Of the markers considered, progesterone, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) exhibited significant correlation with age. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with AFC did not show any significant association with age compared to AMH, progesterone and AFC. Conclusions: Our study results also indicate that serum AMH measurement is better predictor for the number of early antral follicles than conventional hormone measurements. Using AMH measurement in combination with AFC may improve the assessment of ovarian reserve for evaluating the fertility potential and monitoring infertility treatment.

40|$|Objective: To {{find the}} level of {{effectiveness}} and reliability of AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) in indicating the over reserve of IVF patients in comparison with other <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators</b> used. 	Materials and Methods: Our study was prospectively planned in the Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Cukurova University, School of Medicine. 89 infertile couples with ages between 18 and 45 who applied to the Assisted Reproduction Treatment Center of our hospital between September of 2009 and July of 2010 were evaluated for the study. Basal serum FSH, LH, E 2, prolactin, fT 3, fT 4 and TSH levels of female patients were measured in the 3 rd day of menstruation. In the same day, blood samples were collected for AMH and AMH values were measured by use of the ELISA method. Over volume and AFC(antral follicle count) were determined through transvaginal ultrasound. In our study, all patients were subjected to long protocol with GnRH agonist. Oocyte collection was performed for patients who developed follicles larger than 18 mm and the level treatment success was determined {{based on the number}} of oocytes collected. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the number of oocytes collected. Oocyte numbers equal to or higher than 4 were included in the and ldquo;good response and rdquo; group and oocyte numbers lower than 4 were included in the and ldquo;poor response and rdquo; group. Afterwards, the results obtained were statistically compared with other parameters used for determination of over reserve. In addition, it was discussed if there is a relationship between AMH and pregnancy rate. 	Results: No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of average values of period of infertility, body mass index, LH and E 2 levels. On the other hand, two groups proved to display statistically significant dissimilarity in terms of age, serum FSH, AMH levels, hCG day E 2 levels, number of antral follicles, hCG day follicle numbers and mature oocyte numbers. When the cutoff value for AMH was taken to be 0, 24 ng/ml, sensitivity and specifity were determined to be 82. 1 % and 72. 7 % respectively. Number of pregnancies were founded to be 24 (39. 3 %) in the group with AMH value higher than 0. 24 ng/ml, and 3 (10. 7 %) in the other group. These two groups were determined to be statistically different. Number of live pregnancies were founded to be 17 (27. 8 %) in the group with AMH value higher than 0. 24 ng/ml, and 2 (7. 1 %) in the other group. These two groups were determined not to be statistically different. 	Conclusion: It was seen that there is a strong relationship between serum AMH level and the over response of the patients. Besides, AMH levels were determined to be in relation with the pregnancy rate. However, a relation between live births and AMH could not be established with this study.
