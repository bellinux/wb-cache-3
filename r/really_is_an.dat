5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> <b>an</b> apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known of}} which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
25|$|Due to the site's {{location}} {{beneath the}} Antarctic ice sheet {{there are no}} direct samples to test for evidence of impact. There are alternative explanations for this mass concentration, such as formation by a mantle plume or other large-scale volcanic activity. If this feature <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> impact crater then, based {{on the size of}} the ring structure, it has been suggested by Frese's team that the impactor could have been four or five times wider than the Chicxulub impactor, which is believed to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
500|$|On defense, the Longhorns held A to only 118yards passing {{but gave}} up 277yards rushing; the highest {{allowed by the}} Longhorns all season. Despite the poor outing, Texas {{finished}} the regular season undefeated. Gene Chizik, UT's defensive coordinator, said [...] "This <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> eye-opening experience. Obviously, we've got to get better. But I'll tell you what, we're all going to drive home 11–0." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Belldandy {{was sent}} to grant Keiichi a wish and nothing more, Belldandy expresses many times that she has enjoyed her time with Keiichi and that her purpose is to make him happy. The {{contract}} <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> excuse for her to stay since her rival Marller, a first class demon, has stated that [...] "she can cancel a contract with a human anytime". Belldandy had then stated {{that she did not}} want to, because Keiichi was a special person in her heart. This was reinforced at the conclusion of chapter 39: with the [...] "System" [...] down, Belldandy's contract with Keiichi is effectively suspended, yet she chooses to stay because, as Fujishima has her explain in the manga, [...] "... I'm here now because I love you".|$|E

2500|$|The popular Adult Swim show Robot Chicken made {{a parody}} of {{a parody of}} the MADtv skit in which Big Bird is shown having the bird flu. Snuffy is also seen, {{although}} in this skit he <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> imaginary friend. Elmo, Grover and the Count make brief speaking cameos, and Ernie, Bert and Cookie Monster {{can be seen in}} the background at one point, receiving vaccines from the Count. A brief parody of [...] "One of These Things" [...] is seen, with three dancing kids and one dead kid.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{appointed}} day, May 14, 1787, only the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations were present, {{and so the}} convention's opening meeting was postponed {{for lack of a}} quorum. A quorum of seven states met and deliberations began on May 25. Eventually twelve states were represented; 74 delegates were named, 55 attended and 39 signed. The delegates were generally convinced that an effective central government {{with a wide range of}} enforceable powers must replace the weaker Congress established by the Articles of Confederation. Their depth of knowledge and experience in self-government was remarkable. As Thomas Jefferson in Paris wrote to John Adams in London, [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> assembly of demigods." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time Hewitt and Williams decided to hold a contest in the Orlando Sentinel {{newspaper}} to get names for their new franchise. Out {{of a total of}} 4,296 submitted entries, the names were subsequently narrowed to four, [...] "Heat", [...] "Tropics", [...] "Juice", and [...] "Magic". The last one, which had been submitted by 11 people, was picked after Williams brought his 7-year-old daughter Karyn to visit in Orlando. On July 27, 1986, it was announced that the committee chose the Magic to be the new name of the Orlando franchise in the NBA. The name [...] "Magic" [...] alludes to the area's biggest tourist attraction and economic engine Walt Disney World, along with its Magic Kingdom. Hewitt added that [...] "You look at all the aspects of Central Florida, and you find it <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> exciting place, a magical place." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{negative}} reviews, Tiny Mix Tapes called the album [...] "a sad {{portrait of a}} band that has been totally destroyed by fame and the pressures that come along with it," [...] and The A.V. Club saying: [...] "If the so-called 'Red Album' <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> elaborate goof on an all-too-forgiving fan base, that doesn't make Weezer's newest worst album any less insipid." [...] Pitchfork gave the record 4.7/10, lamenting that [...] "like the YouTube culture the 'Pork and Beans' video depicts so well, the song-- and this album-- relies on a high quantity of short-lived pretty good ideas to distract from a shortage of great ones." [...] Prefix Magazine {{said that if the}} Red Album's [...] "songs were formulaic, shiny, and easily digestible like everything on Green or Maladroit, the vacuity of the new songs wouldn't be as big a problem. But 'Heart Songs,' 'Thought I Knew'--these are just plain bad." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{factory that}} employs us is {{something}} {{very different from the}} ordinary earthly model. Our business is to finish making little wooden toys--bears, cattle men, and the like--for children. The things are made in the rough by machinery, and then finished by hand, because the work of unskilful but interested men--and it <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> extremely amusing employment--is found to give a personality and interest to these objects no machine can ever attain.|$|E
6000|$|The first church rate book only {{begins in}} 1776, {{but it is}} curious as showing to whom the land then belonged.
