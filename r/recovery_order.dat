40|$|Family Law within Australia has {{undergone}} extensive legislative and operational changes since its inception. It {{is an area}} of law that impacts upon a number of stakeholders such as children, parents, law enforcement agencies, the Government and judicial officers. The research took a small facet of the operation of the Family Law Act 1975, namely the enforcement of parenting orders by police services. The focus of the research was to unfold the process and difficulties encountered by police services when executing a <b>recovery</b> <b>order</b> issued by the Courts under s. 67 of the Family Law Act 1975. It further explored police perspective, training and organisational service delivery, in carrying out their duties. Two qualitative methodological approaches were used in this research. The main approach used was Grounded Theory. Narrative Inquiry was also incorporated into the research. The objective of Narrative Inquiry is to create social context from story telling. Participants were asked to describe their experiences when executing recovery orders. Interviews were undertaken with members from the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who have had experience with the execution of recovery orders. These participants were also asked to construct the process when a <b>recovery</b> <b>order</b> is executed and to describe the atmosphere. In addition, journaling and observations were used. These observations took place in the Family Court and Federal Magistrates&# 039; Court in Victoria. The findings and relevant literature indicated that police disliked becoming involved in executing recovery orders. The Police perceived family law in general not to be a central area of policing. These findings parallel earlier findings from an Australian Parliamentary report in 1992. Furthermore, the findings indicated that little organisational commitment was placed on the function of enforcing recovery orders. This was indicated by the limited and inconsistent resources provided by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to fulfil their obligations, and the lack of training offered to police members. The findings indicated that the Police would take initial steps prior to executing the order. They would contact the applicant parent to assist with inquiries to locate a child, assess variables such as the potential for violence and arrange with the applicant parent where the child would be delivered. In addition, even though the findings outlined that recovery orders were fairly non-complex to execute, at times there would be difficulties in locating a child and finalising arrangements for a child to be returned to a parent. The findings also indicated that there was no clear practice as to which section of the Victoria Police would execute a <b>recovery</b> <b>order</b> if requested by the AFP. Whilst the findings need to be considered carefully in light of the small sample group, it did indicate that there are some difficulties with the process and value placed by police services within Australia on the execution of recovery orders...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTraining {{in sports}} is a {{practical}} activity that requires {{a certain level of}} effort. Energy has various organi sources in accordance with the activities performed. Under current conditions, both the training and competitions pose significant demands. The nutritional resources that release energy are used up during effort. One of the priorities in training is to ensure the complete recovery of the tired body. Recovery is a condition for success in sports achievements. Some means of recovery are widely known and are frequently used by athletes. Other means are newer, more refined and less used, but they may prove to be necessary and useful in order to speed up recovery. Recovery targets anatomical and physiological mechanisms and it is managed by the neurological and endocrine systems.

30|$|Figure  8 {{shows the}} oil {{recovery}} variation in reservoirs of different types. The oil <b>recovery</b> <b>order</b> is homogeneous reservoir > compound-rhythm reservoir > reverse-rhythm reservoir > positive-rhythm reservoir. The oil recoveries in compound-rhythm and reverse-rhythm reservoirs are close, but {{higher than that}} in positive-rhythm reservoir. Oil recoveries {{at the end of}} steam stimulation processes in the five reservoirs are about 19 %, indicating that reservoir rhythm has little impact on steam stimulation. The ultimate oil recovery in homogeneous reservoir after hot-water flooding is about 38.19 %, however, those in the other reservoirs positive-rhythm, reverse-rhythm, compound-rhythm (Ι) and compound-rhythm (II) are 32.61 %, 36.02 %, 36.66 % and 36.10 %, respectively. The results show that heavy oil recovery can be further improved by hot-water flooding after steam stimulation. The development effect in positive-rhythm reservoir is relatively poor. But this technique is suitable for reverse-rhythm and compound-rhythm reservoirs.|$|E
40|$|A speedy {{recovery}} of damaged digitized photographs based on orientation driven multi structure morphology is proposed. The <b>recovery</b> <b>order</b> {{plays an important}} factor for human visualization and hence it is guided by the orientation of edges at the surrounding known regions of the missing domain. The image is edge detected by thresholding the image gradient along the eight possible orientations. These eight edge images are represented as eight edge planes. The edge-plane-sliced information is used twice manifold for reconstructing the regions within the missing part, {{as well as for}} guiding the integration that follows. The damaged regions are morphologically eroded using the structuring elements of corresponding orientations dictated by the edge-planes. The resultant filled image is obtained using local isotopic driven integration. The novelty of our approach is to explicitly specify the direction of filling herby ensuring ease in convergence in different orientations and then streamlining the process to guarantee complete and natural look. By implementing region-filling through morphological erosion, several pixels instead of one can be restored at every inpainting step, making the method faster than many traditional texture synthesis inpainting algorithms and successfully recovers images with better Peak Signal to Noise ratios even for massive damages...|$|E
40|$|Caching and {{recovery}} of food by corvids is well-studied, but some ambiguous results remain. To help clarify these, {{we built a}} computational cognitive model. It is inspired by similar models built for humans, and it assumes that memory strength depends on frequency and recency of use. We compared our model’s behavior to that of real birds in previously published experiments. Our model successfully replicated the outcomes of two experiments on recovery behavior and two experiments on cache site choice. Our “virtual birds ” reproduced declines in recovery accuracy across sessions, revisits to previ-ously emptied cache sites, a lack of correlation between caching and <b>recovery</b> <b>order,</b> and a preference for caching in safe locations. The model also produced two new explanations. First, that Clark’s nutcrackers may become less accurate as recovery progresses not because of differential memory for different cache sites, as was once assumed, but because of chance effects. And second, that Western scrub jays may choose their cache sites {{not on the basis}} of negative recovery experiences only, as was previously thought, but on the basis of positive recovery experiences instead. Alternatively, both “punishment ” and “reward ” may be playing a role. We conclude with a set of new insights, a testable prediction, and directions for future work...|$|E

40|$|Maximum {{strength}} is {{the capacity to}} generate force within an isometric contraction. It is a valuable attribute to most athletes because it acts as a general base that supports spe-cific training in other spheres of conditioning. Resistance training program variables can be manipulated to specifi-cally optimize maximum strength. After deciding on the ex-ercises appropriate for the sport, the main variables to con-sider are training intensity (load) and volume. The other fac-tors {{that are related to}} intensity are loading form, training to failure, speed of contraction, psychological factors, interset <b>recovery,</b> <b>order</b> of exercise, and number of sessions per day. Repetitions per set, sets per session, and training frequency together constitute training volume. In general, maximum {{strength is}} best developed with 1 – 6 repetition maximum loads, a combination of concentric and eccentric muscle ac-tions, 3 – 6 maximal sets per session, training to failure for limited periods, long interset recovery time, 3 – 5 days of training per week, and dividing the day’s training into 2 sessions. Variation of the volume and intensity {{in the course of a}} training cycle will further enhance strength gains. The increase in maximum strength is effected by neural, hor-monal, and muscular adaptations. Concurrent strength and endurance training, as well as combination strength and power training, will also be discussed.

40|$|This case {{arose from}} a {{decision}} of the Italian authorities to extend an existing regional aid scheme – a social security concession for the south of Italy - to the cities of Chioggia and Venice in the north, which fell outside the designated regional aid areas approved {{on the basis of}} Article 107 (3) (a). This measure was not notified to the Commission in advance and, following an investigative procedure, the Commission reached a decision requiring the recovery of aid except insofar as it had been paid either to SMEs, to firms located in designated assisted areas, concerned the employment of ‘hard-to-place’ employees or to specified municipal companies. The recovery decision was contested before the General Court. The Commission claimed that the applicants lacked standing, but this was rejected by the Court which found that belonging to a closed class of actual beneficiaries of an aid scheme affected by the obligation to repay aid was sufficient to differentiate them from all other persons. On substance, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the measures were compensation for additional costs arising from their location in the Venice lagoon (not State aid), that the Commission had failed to account of the situation of undertakings other than selected municipal companies, and that the Commission had infringed Article 107 (3) (c) in relation to regional aid. The substantive claims were rejected by the General Court. The applicants also challenged the legality of the <b>recovery</b> <b>order,</b> arguing that the measure was a mere extension in time and territory of a measure dating back to the 1970 s. This was not accepted by the General Court which accordingly dismissed the actions. The applicants appealed the General Court’s judgment before the Court of Justice. For its part, the Commission, by cross appeal, sought the annulment of the General Court’s judgment insofar as it declared the applicants’ actions admissible. The Court of Justice upheld the General Court’s ruling on the standing of the applicants, though it found that the General Court had erred in law in finding that it was not for the national authorities to verify in each individual case whether the conditions for the existence of aid were met. The Court of Justice dismissed the main appeals of the applicants against the judgment of the General Court and confirmed the order for the recovery of the unlawful aid...|$|E
