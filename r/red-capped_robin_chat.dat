5|$|The {{position}} of the <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the songbird infraorder Passerida. The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> is a predominantly ground-feeding bird and its prey consists of insects and spiders. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.|$|R
40|$|Data on the {{dispersal}} {{and recruitment}} of juvenile birds following fledging are largely unreported for Australian birds. In this study, we investigated the short-distance dispersal {{of a sample}} of colour-banded, juvenile <b>Red-capped</b> <b>Robins,</b> Petroica goodenovii, in Terrick Terrick National Park, Victoria, Australia. Of 67 colour-banded juvenile birds that successfully reached independence during the 2000 – 01 breeding season, eight were recruited into the study area or adjacent areas for the following breeding season. A ninth bird was resighted in Gunbower State Forest, 36 km from where it was banded. This is the furthest recorded dispersal movement of a <b>Red-capped</b> <b>Robin.</b> Of 59 colour-banded juvenile birds that reached independence during the 2001 – 02 season, four remained within the study area {{for the remainder of}} the breeding season, but these birds were not present in the study area during the following breeding season. Juvenile birds that successfully reached independence and dispersed were heavier as nestlings, when controlled for age and date, than birds that disappeared (assumed dead) before reaching independence. Estimates of <b>Red-capped</b> <b>Robin</b> abundances within Terrick Terrick National Park were greater than those of nearby eucalypt woodlands, suggesting that the White Cypress-pine, Callitris glaucophylla, woodlands within the park offer good-quality habitat for <b>Red-capped</b> <b>Robins</b> and may be saturated with breeding territories. Thus, juveniles may be forced to establish breeding territories far from their natal territories. These results are discussed in relation to avenues for further research on juvenile dispersal in Australian birds and their conservation implications. <br /...|$|R
5|$|Officially {{known as}} the <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin,</b> {{it has also been}} {{referred}} to as redhead, redcap, robin red-breast or red-throated robin. Kuburi is a name used in the Kimberley. Across southwestern Australia, it was known as menekedang by the local indigenous people.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel Goodenough ( [...] - 12 August 1827) was the Bishop of Carlisle from 1808 {{until his}} death in 1827, and an amateur {{botanist}} and collector. He is honoured in the scientific names of the plant genus Goodenia and the <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> (Petroica goodenovii).|$|R
500|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> {{was later}} {{moved to the}} genus Petroica; the generic name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek words petro- [...] "rock" [...] and oikos [...] "home", from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks. Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as [...] "red robins" [...] as {{distinct}} from the [...] "yellow robins" [...] of the genus Eopsaltria. It is not closely related to the American robin or the European robin; however, it is named after the European robin. Molecular research (and current consensus) places the <b>Red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> and its relatives—the Australian robin family Petroicidae—as a very early offshoot of the Passerida, or [...] "advanced" [...] songbirds, within the songbird lineage.|$|R
50|$|Mammal {{species in}} the nature {{conservation}} reserve include eastern grey kangaroo, black-tailed wallaby, koala, brush-tailed possum and short-beaked echidna. Over 160 bird species have been sighted in the nature conservation reserve including the barking owl, crested bellbird, diamond firetail, jacky winter, <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> and speckled warbler.|$|R
5000|$|Birds {{recorded}} on Greenly Island include the Cape Barren goose, white-faced heron, ruddy turnstone, Australian raven, Australian kestrel, white-bellied sea eagle, sooty oystercatcher, welcome swallow, silver gull, Pacific gull, rock parrot, little grassbird, <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin,</b> great cormorant, short-tailed shearwater, crested tern, fairy tern, silvereye and little penguin.|$|R
5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> {{typically}} perches in {{a prominent}} location {{low to the}} ground, often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it regularly supports significant numbers of regent honeyeaters and swift parrots, {{as well as many}} other woodland bird species. [...] It holds one of the only two remaining populations of <b>red-capped</b> <b>robins</b> in the Sydney region.|$|R
50|$|Crested bellbirds feed on {{invertebrates}} and seeds. They hop rapidly, foraging on {{the ground}} or flying low between low shrubs or into low branches of trees. They are usually solitary foragers but may feed in pairs during breeding season or in mixed feeding flocks with chestnut-rumped thornbills and <b>red-capped</b> <b>robins.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> was {{described}} by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, having been collected in the northern Spencer Gulf in South Australia. They named it Muscicapa goodenovii, and placed it among the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The specific epithet goodenovii honours the Reverend Samuel Goodenough, Bishop of Carlisle and first treasurer of the Linnean Society.|$|R
5|$|The {{feral cat}} {{is known to}} prey on the <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin,</b> and several bird species {{including}} the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus) and white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus) raid nests and take young. There is one record of a brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris) feeding on an egg. Predation is the commonest cause of nest failure.|$|R
5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> {{is found}} across Australia except for Tasmania, Cape York, the Top End {{and most of}} the Kimberley (there have been {{occasional}} sightings in the southernmost parts). Offshore populations exist on Rottnest Island, as well as Greenly and Pearson Islands off the Eyre Peninsula, but it is not found on Kangaroo Island. Although widespread, it is uncommon in many areas; it is rare east of the Great Dividing Range, in coastal regions in the south of the continent, and in the northern parts of its range—it is seldom encountered north of 20°S. Its movements are generally poorly known, particularly outside the breeding season. It is sedentary in much of the southern parts of its range, although the <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> is a spring and summer visitor to the Nullarbor Plain and Adelaide region in South Australia, and central Victoria. It is a winter visitor in the northern parts of its range.|$|R
5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch {{may be used as}} a vantage point in hunting.|$|R
5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> is {{territorial}} {{during the}} breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2ha (0.6–3acres). A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn. The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion. Two males {{have been seen}} to face one another 30cm to 1m (12–40in) apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display while the female is incubating her eggs. Both sexes also react to the playback of song recordings. The male will also defend against incursions by male scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories. Most juvenile <b>red-capped</b> <b>robins</b> are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded to date has been 36km (22mi), from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to Gunbower State Forest in northern Victoria.|$|R
5|$|The {{smallest}} of the red <b>robins,</b> the <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> is 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) long with a wingspan of 15–19.5cm (6–8in), and weighs around 7–9g (0.25–0.31oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have a reddish tint to the breast. Both sexes have a small black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around or {{just over a year}} of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.|$|R

5|$|The brush cuckoo (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid cuckoo (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared cuckoo (C.osculans) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. <b>Red-capped</b> <b>robins</b> have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.|$|R
5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> is {{generally}} encountered {{alone or in}} pairs, although groups of up to eight birds—a mated pair and their young—may be seen in autumn and winter. The species may join mixed-species flocks with other small insectivorous passerines; species recorded include the willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), rufous whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris) and black-faced woodswallow (Artamus cinereus) in Queensland, and the chestnut-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza uropygialis), buff-rumped thornbill (A.reguloides) or inland thornbill (A.apicalis) in Western Australia.|$|R

5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> prefers more arid habitat {{than its}} relatives, and inhabits dryer areas while the scarlet robin {{occupies}} wetter forests where they co-occur. The red-capped robin's preferred habitat is dry Acacia, Callitris or mixed scrubland or woodland, dominated by such species as mulga (Acacia aneura), Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae), raspberry jam (Acacia acuminata), black cypress-pine (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress-pine (C. columellaris), and slender cypress-pine (C. preissii) with understory shrubs such as Cassia, hop-bush (Dodonaea), emu bush (Eremophila) and spinifex (Triodia).|$|R

5|$|The <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> (Petroica goodenovii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Australia. Found in drier regions {{across much of the}} continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.|$|R
50|$|A {{bird species}} similar to and often {{confused}} with the crimson chat is the male <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin,</b> whose scientific name is Petroica goodenovii. However, there are three main differences between their characteristics. A male crimson chat has a white throat {{as well as a}} plump body; however, the robin has a black body, white wing marks, and a dark eye. Also, the crimson chat's bill is skinnier and longer than the robin's. When a crimson chat is seen, a saltbush, Spinifex, or mulga woodland plant can usually be found, as they are plants associated with this type of bird. According to Federal and NSW organizations, the conservation of this bird is secure. Its only real threat is being killed by predators.|$|R

5|$|Several birds prey on meat ants. The masked woodswallow (A. personatus) and the white-browed woodswallow (Artamus superciliosus) {{will gather}} around meat ant nests and swoop at them, {{catching}} several ants before eating them. Pieces of meat ants {{have been found}} in the faeces of the <b>red-capped</b> <b>robin</b> (Petroica goodenovii), rufous whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris), hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata) and the red-browed treecreeper (Climacteris erythrops). Meat ants that forage on Ventilago viminalis trees are often eaten by the apostlebird. Some large ground-feeding birds, such as currawongs, magpies and ravens dig out newly established colonies after a queen has found a suitable spot to nest. Small domes of excavated soil are present at such spots, revealing the queens' presence to these birds. As a result, many queens are consumed by birds, leaving many abandoned nest chambers.|$|R
5|$|The colour {{alone is}} not a {{reliable}} guide to determine the species, as some scarlet robins (P.boodang) take on an orange hue, but while male scarlet and <b>red-capped</b> <b>robins</b> (P.goodenovii) have red breasts and black throats, the flame robin's breast plumage extends {{right up to the}} base of the bill. It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|R
