In this investigation, a number of phenolic compounds were completely removed from solution using excess concentrations of soybean peroxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Partial treatment of phenol was also carried out using limited enzyme doses. Supernatants were characterized in terms of their acute toxicities using the 5 -minute Microtox assay.

30|$|Hydrocarbons in {{petroleum}} {{may serve}} as electron donors for sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), which use sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor for respiration, resulting in sulfide production. The biogenic sulfide production results in metal biocorrosion and reservoir souring, and SRB are typically the main bacterial group involved in these harmful processes in petroleum industries. The biogenic hydrogen sulfide production causes the acidulation and plugging of petroleum reservoirs and biocorrosion of metal surfaces of pipelines and tanks (Nemati et al. 2001 a). Moreover, the sulfide is explosive in high concentrations. SRB may grow in pipes and tanks forming biofilms, leading to the biodegradation of the metal surface (Zuo 2007). Finally, the accumulation of SRB biomass causes reduced oil recovery (Muyzer and Stams 2008; Nemati et al. 2001 b; Postgate 1965). Therefore, in petroleum industries, it is mandatory to control and inhibit SRB growth, which is usually done by biocide dosage (Korenblum et al. 2010; Videla 2002).

This <b>residual</b> <b>toxicity</b> can be effectively removed by treatment with formaldehyde in solution. Storage of the formaldehyde-treated mTcdB as a liquid can result in reversion over time back to the mTcdB level of toxicity, with the rate of reversion dependent on the storage temperature. We found that for both the “forward” mTcdB detoxification reaction with formaldehyde, and the “reverse” reversion to toxicity reaction, mouse toxicity correlated with several biochemical assays including anion exchange chromatography retention time and appearance on SDS-PAGE. Maintenance of a low concentration of formaldehyde prevents reversion to toxicity in liquid formulations. However, when samples with 0. 016 % (v/v) formaldehyde were lyophilized and stored at 37 °C, formaldehyde continued to react with and modify the mTcdB in the lyophilized state. Lyophilization alone effectively prevented reversion to toxicity for formaldehyde-treated, formaldehyde-removed mTcdB samples stored at 37 °C for 6 months. Formaldehyde-treated, formaldehyde-removed lyophilized mTcdB showed no evidence of reversion to toxicity, appeared stable by several assays, and was immunogenic in mice, even after storage for 6 months at 37 °C...|$|E

The experiments {{were carried out}} during 2012 and 2013 cotton seasons at Lakana village, Shobrakeate, El-Beheira Governorate. Results showed that, statistically, all tested insecticides were comparable against B. tabaci adults except chlorantraniliprole which recorded the least reduction percentages at 2012 and 2013 cotton seasons. The same results also were recorded with B. tabaci immature stages at 2012 and 2013 cotton seasons. Concerning A. gossypii, the neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and acetamiprid) recorded the highest mean reduction (89. 99, 88. 79 and 76. 86 %) at 2012 and (95. 05, 94. 61 and 94. 90) at 2013. On the other hand, the chitin synthesis inhibitors (pyriproxyfen and novaluron) achieved the least reduction percentages against A. gossypii in both seasons. The neonicotinoids revealed a <b>residual</b> <b>toxicity</b> higher than, the chitin synthesis inhibitors on B. tabaci and A. gossypii, while chitin synthesis inhibitors revealed a <b>residual</b> <b>toxicity</b> higher than chlorantraniliprole against B. tabaci. Under the same conditions, all treatments have moderate toxic effects on the natural enemy Chrysopa vulgaris except chlorantraniliprole which recorded low toxic effects in both seasons.

40|$|The {{ability of}} hyperantigenic {{preparations}} of synthetically produced Escherichia coli heat-stable toxin (ST) {{to provide an}} immunogenically more potent vaccine when cross-linked by the glutaraldehyde reaction to the heat-labile toxin B subunit was assessed. Three synthetic ST preparations were evaluated: ST(S) had the same antigenicity and toxicity (secretory potency in the suckling mouse assay) as native ST, ST 1056 had 3. 5 -fold more antigenicity and 1 % toxicity, and ST(C) had 15 -fold greater antigenicity and 31 % toxicity. Vaccines that contained equal antigenic proportions of ST and B subunit, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, consisted by weight of 52 % ST(S), 25 % ST 1056, and 9 % ST(C). The initially lower toxicity and smaller proportions by weight of hyperantigenic ST preparations yielded vaccines that had nearly 10 -fold less <b>residual</b> ST <b>toxicity</b> than the ST(S) vaccine. Immunization of rats with graded dosages of vaccines containing 9 % ST(C) and 51 % ST(S) by weight, but equal amounts of ST(S) antigenicity, raised {{to the same degree}} dose-dependent increases in mucosal immunoglobulin A antitoxin titers to ST(S) which correlated with the amount of protection against challenge with a viable LT-/ST+ strain. These observations indicate that hyperantigenic synthetic ST preparations provide immunologically more potent vaccines than those obtained with the previously used synthetic ST(S) preparation, which has the same biological properties as native ST...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{relevance}} of a photocatalytic pretreatment {{prior to a}} biological process for removal of organic pollutants was examined. Owing to the significant <b>residual</b> amount and <b>toxicity,</b> amitrole was not relevant. High mineralization allowed to remove bisphenol A and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Isoproturon and diuron cannot be considered due to the slight evolution of chemical oxygen demand/ total organic carbon (COD/TOC) and average oxidation state during irradiation. After photocatalysis, the ratio of biological oxygen demand (BOD 5) /COD remained below the biodegradability limit (0. 4) {{for the rest of}} the molecules. A favorable COD/TOC trend (decrease during irradiation) was recorded for dimethoate and antibiotics. However, dimethoate and sulfamethoxazole seemed not pertinent due to the long time span for their removal. Since a decrease of toxicity was only recorded for tylosine, it can be selected for subsequent tests...|$|R
40|$|Identification {{of novel}} {{effective}} mosquitocidal compounds {{is essential to}} combat increasing resistance rates, {{concern for the environment}} and food safety, the unacceptability of many organophosphates and organochlorines and the high cost of synthetic pyrethroids. An increasing number of researchers are reconsidering botanicals containing active phytochemicals in their efforts to address some of these problems. To be highly competitive and effective, the ideal phytochemical should possess a combination of toxic effects and <b>residual</b> capacity. Acute <b>toxicity</b> is required at doses comparable to some commercial synthetic insecticides while chronic or sub-chronic toxicity is required to produce growth inhibition, developmental toxicity and generational effects. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge on larvicidal plant species, extraction processes, growth and reproduction inhibiting phytochemicals, botanical ovicides, synergistic, additive and antagonistic joint action effects of mixtures, residual capacity, effects on non-target organisms, resistance, screening methodologies, and discuss promising advances made in phytochemical research...|$|R
