5|$|For the 2013 {{model year}} revision, Aston made minor {{changes to the}} {{bodywork}} by adapting designs from the Virage, including enlarging the recessed headlight clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime strips, widening the front splitter, updating the grille and side heat extractors, updating the LED <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> with clear lenses and integrating a new rear spoiler with the boot lid.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar XJ220 Pininfarina is {{a special}} XJ220 built in 1995 for the Sultan of Brunei and his brother Prince Jefri, who {{commissioned}} a number of rare and one-off heavily modified cars based on expensive luxury cars. This car was modified by Pininfarina, with modifications including fixed headlights, new <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> with a redesigned double-vane rear wing, and a new interior package. The car also comes with dark green exterior paint.|$|E

50|$|The 12M and 15M {{shared the}} same body, but the front grill and {{headlamp}} treatments differed as did the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters. The <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters on the 12M, reminiscent of those of the previous model, {{took the form of}} an extended lozenge. The <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters on the 15M were rectangular.|$|R
50|$|The Northport Range Lights were a set {{of range}} lights on Prince Edward Island, Canada. They were built in 1885, and the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> was {{deactivated}} around 1970; the front light is still active as the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> of the new range.|$|R

25|$|In September 2009, the Grande Punto was facelifted, {{with the}} {{replacement}} {{known as the}} Punto Evo. It received a new front end in addition to revised <b>rear</b> <b>lights,</b> and a new interior.|$|E
50|$|Baker Shoal Range Rear Lighthouse {{originally}} {{served as}} the Port Penn-Reedy Island Range <b>Rear</b> <b>Light</b> in Port Penn. It became the Baker Shoal Range <b>Rear</b> <b>Light</b> in 1904 when the old range was discontinued due to the channel moving. It is an active aid to navigation.|$|R
50|$|The Delaware Breakwater Range <b>Rear</b> <b>Light</b> (also {{known as}} the Green Hill Light) was a {{lighthouse}} west of Lewes, Delaware. It was made obsolete by the shifting of Cape Henlopen and was disassembled and moved to Florida to become the Boca Grande Entrance Range <b>Rear</b> <b>Light.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this report, the {{magnitude}} of the problem of rear-end collisions is described. The report also draws up a test framework based on a theoretical approach and a judgement of various recent provisions for improving the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration. These provisions include: regulation of <b>light</b> intensity; <b>rear</b> fog lights; braking-dependant lights; early-warning brake lights; lights activated by emergency stopping; and solutions reducing the wearing out of lamps. The test framework makes it possible to judge inventions on their necessity, functioning, and optical features. Adjustments to the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration during the last decennia involved addition of a component (third brake <b>light,</b> <b>rear</b> fog <b>light).</b> In this, existing functions were improved so that a gradual introduction could be applied (only new cars). As an adjustment often has consequences for the whole <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration, it is concluded that `Europe' was justly reserved. Once good arguments for introducing a new function or component (necessitating) are presented, the complete renewal of the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration can be considered. Matters such as integration, standardisation, and adaptive regulation then become relevant. Recommendations are made for further adjustments to the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration. These adjustments are also aimed at improving the present functions, so that retrofit is unnecessary. These are: making two <b>rear</b> fog <b>lights</b> mandatory; voluntary regulation of light intensity; voluntary alarm lights for emergency stops; and voluntary alarm lights after an emergency stop...|$|R
25|$|Safety was {{emphasized}} with wrap-around <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> {{designed to}} illuminate alternate warning signals in green, yellow, and red. A built-in roll bar reinforcement {{allowed for the}} thin pillar posts and roof panel. Exterior door handles were replaced with flush, push-type door buttons.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, the Punto {{name was}} brought {{back when the}} Punto Evo was facelifted and given a similar front end to the 2005 Grande Punto. The new Punto kept the revised <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> and {{interior}} of the 2009 Punto Evo, {{but not on the}} base 'Pop' trim level which reverted to the older Grande Punto interior.|$|E
25|$|Wanting {{to bring}} the concept to production, Mercedes joined with their Formula One partner, McLaren, thus {{creating}} the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. The final production model was presented on 17 November 2003 featuring some minor design adjustments respect the initial design, like a more complex vents in both sides, a redesign of the front part, with the three pointed star plunged in the nose and red tinted <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> sets.|$|E

25|$|In most jurisdictions, {{bicycles}} {{must have}} functioning front and <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> when ridden after dark. As some generator or dynamo-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear reflectors are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a car horn {{can be used}} when a 12 volt battery is available.|$|E
25|$|Panniers {{or special}} luggage {{carriers}} (including waterproof packing bags) enable {{the transport of}} goods and are useful for shopping. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats and/or an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar to transport children. Trailers of various types and load capacities may be towed to greatly increase cargo capacity. In many jurisdictions bicycles must be fitted with a bell; reflectors; and, after dark, front and <b>rear</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Panorama Elite III was {{the last}} in the Elite series. Improvements {{continued}} to the basic Elite design; this included rear lighting, rear emergency door and subtle changes to the front grill. The rear emergency door was brought about by changes in legislation and did improve the offside appearance of the Elite, however some early Mark IIIs were completed with front emergency doors. The <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> abandoned the soup plates in favour of tall lozenge shaped lights and the name badges were re-located from between the side bright metal strips at the {{back to the front}} just behind the front door.|$|E

50|$|Vaucluse Bay Range Front Light is {{an active}} {{lighthouse}} located {{on the east side}} of the entrance to Vaucluse Bay in Vaucluse, New South Wales, Australia. It serves as the front range light (Vaucluse Bay Range <b>Rear</b> <b>Light</b> serving as the <b>rear</b> <b>light)</b> into Vaucluse Bay. The distance between the lights is 945 m.|$|R
25|$|Many jurisdictions {{require the}} use of a {{headlight}} and a rear light or reflector after dark. Most European countries and some US states require front and <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> at night, while others allow reflectors only at the rear. Some jurisdictions impose requirements on light output and the size of lamp and reflector lenses; some require compliance with standards defined by third parties; some simply stipulate a minimum distance from which any lighting device should be visible. In some jurisdictions such as Germany and the Netherlands, flashing red tail lights are illegal, in others they are allowed.|$|E
25|$|The {{facelift}} for the Corolla {{was launched}} on 11 April 2011. Initially only the XLi and GLi trims were available, with {{modifications to the}} front and <b>rear</b> <b>lights,</b> front grill, and bumpers, along with a revised interior colour scheme. The 1.8L Corolla Altis with 1ZZ-FE engine was suspended replaced with the 1.6L Corolla Altis with the 1ZR-FE engine producing 124bhp. The facelift Altis was launched in May 2011. The Altis comes equipped with sideskirts, wooden inserts in the interior, optitron speedometer, 5-spoke alloy rims, fog lamps, power windows, power seats, ABS with EBD, driver side SRS airbag and a 6-speed (forward) manual transmission. Optional on the Altis is a 4-speed super ECT automatic transmission and sunroof.|$|E
25|$|The LC10 was {{introduced}} with great fanfare {{and a large}} marketing campaign, which included television commercials. First reaching dealerships on 27 May 1967, market response was immediate and strong. While the original target production was 3000 per month, this was soon nearly tripled. Monthly production remained above 8000 {{until the end of}} the LC10's life. A new, additional factory in Iwata was opened in August 1967 to add supplementary capacity. While in overall a fairly simple and light car, the triple carburettors were awkwardly located at the front of the engine, behind the rear seat. To adjust them, a mechanic would have to reach through a small egg-shaped opening from the rear seat. Another complaint touched on the car's near absence of luggage space. The <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> and the front indicators used the same lenses, only of different colors. There was even a brochure made of a US-market Fronte 360, complete with miles-per-hour speedo and uncovered sealed-beam headlights, but most likely none were brought over. The Fronte soon received a very minor update reflecting stricter safety laws; as of October 1968 it sported a driver's side integrated headrest, seat belts up front, and turn signal flashers on all four corners.|$|E
5000|$|The Chapel Hill <b>Rear</b> Range <b>Light</b> is a {{lighthouse}} located off of Middletown Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States, which functioned as the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> of the now-discontinued Chapel Hill Range.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> units {{each had}} an all-red cover and {{contained}} only two bulbs. One of the bulbs operated as a conventional brake <b>light.</b> The other <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> bulb contained two filaments, {{one of which}} came one with the light switch and the second of which flashed when the turn indicator switch was used, so following traffic saw just a single light becoming successively and rhythmically brighter and less bright when the car was about to turn. The effect will have been unremarkable to North American drivers, but triggered comment in Europe. Here, even where single piece <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> units are fitted, <b>rear</b> indicator <b>lights</b> were and are normally included in their own separate {{part of the overall}} light cluster units.|$|R

500|$|Toyota Australia {{released}} the special edition [...] "Touring SE" [...] in October 2007, {{based on the}} AT-X. Features gained over the AT-X comprised 16-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, six CD stacker, a trip computer, dual zone climate control air-conditioning and a leather steering wheel and selection lever. Front and rear parking sensors, and dual-zone air conditioning were also fitted. The Touring SE was reintroduced in identical form in April 2008, again in October 2008, and then finally in April 2009. These 2009 versions differed slightly, with 17- in lieu of 16-inch wheels, the Sportivo grille, and sports front and <b>rear</b> <b>lights.</b> The price remains unchanged from the 2007 original. At the same time, a Touring SE variant of the Camry sedan was released with similar upgrades.|$|E
500|$|To commemorate Aston Martin's GT1 {{victory at}} the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, Aston Martin {{released}} the DB9 LM (Le Mans) {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. The DB9 LM comes standard with the DB9's optional sports pack and is only available as a semi-automatic coupe. The LM is painted Sarthe Silver, named after the Circuit de la Sarthe, where Le Mans is run, and has red brake calipers, a chromed mesh grill, and a special black leather interior, with red stitching and the Le Mans track stitched on the central console. The car is also fitted with the DBS clear <b>rear</b> <b>lights.</b> Only 124 DB9 LMs were authorized, one per dealer. [...] However, some dealers did not take their allocation with the result that only 69 DB9 LM's were finally built by the factory.|$|E
500|$|The E Series Senator is [...] {{long and}} [...] wide, and the {{stopping}} distance from [...] is about 36 metres. The Senator {{is equipped with}} 19-inch, 10-spoke chrome shadow alloy wheels. The cabin features carbon fibre and imitation metal highlights. For the first time there are no visible wood grain trims that have featured in previous models. The <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> on the Senator are full LED and were repositioned, lowering them by [...] to help differentiate the car from its Holden donor, creating sporting flair yet keeping the luxury image. The development cost to redesign the rear taillights cost HSV $3 million. The designers of the Senator have also attempted to add a more of a luxury feel to the car instead of favouring the aggressive side. The entry level price for the Senator Signature is $76,990, down $4,000 from the previous model.|$|E

Horizontal <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters were fitted low down. The rear end underwent a major redesign in 1993 following complaints about leaks. The revised design had a flat rear window, separated from the roofline, and vertical <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> clusters mounted at the body corners.|$|R
