5|$|The National Hockey League All-Star Game is a mid-season {{exhibition}} game held annually between {{many of the}} top players of each season. Sixty-two All-Star Games have been held since 1947, {{with at least one}} player chosen to represent the Red Wings in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|The National Hockey League All-Star Game is a mid-season {{exhibition}} game held annually between {{many of the}} top players of each season. Thirty-seven All-Star Games have been held since the Islanders entered the league in 1972, {{with at least one}} player chosen to represent the Islanders in each year except 2001 and 2011. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games.

5|$|Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists {{on various}} pieces, Tzara {{himself was a}} subject for visual artists. Max Ernst depicts him as the only mobile {{character}} in the Dadaists' group portrait Au <b>Rendez-vous</b> des Amis ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922), while, in one of Man Ray's photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an androgynous Nancy Cunard. Years before their split, Francis Picabia used Tzara's calligraphed name in Moléculaire ("Molecular"), a composition printed {{on the cover of}} 391. The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows. In 1949, Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with lithography. Portraits of Tzara were also made by Greta Knutson, Robert Delaunay, and the Cubist painters M. H. Maxy and Lajos Tihanyi. As an homage to Tzara the performer, art rocker David Bowie adopted his accessories and mannerisms during a number of public appearances. In 1996, he was depicted on a series of Romanian stamps, and, the same year, a concrete and steel monument dedicated to the writer was erected in Moinești.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, the All-Star Game was pre-empted {{in favour}} of <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87, held at Le Colisée in Quebec City. Like the Challenge Cup before it, <b>Rendez-Vous</b> '87 was an event where the best the NHL could offer played against a Soviet squad which had an entire year to prepare. To reduce the {{possibility}} of the NHL being embarrassed again, <b>Rendez-Vous</b> '87 was a two-game affair. The series was split between the two teams with a game won by each.|$|E

25|$|On April 5, 1986, {{the entire}} Downtown area was {{transformed}} {{as part of}} a concert by French musician Jean Michel Jarre. Called <b>Rendez-Vous</b> Houston, the open-air show used the skyscrapers as giant projection screens, and as launchpads for fireworks. The show celebrated 25 years of NASA, 150 years of Texas, and was a tribute to the astronauts killed in the recent Challenger Disaster. The show attracted a then-record live audience of 1.3million people.|$|E
25|$|Bourque {{played for}} Team Canada in the Canada Cup in 1981, 1984 and 1987.

Bourque also played for the NHL All-Stars in <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87 against the Soviet Union, and played for the Canadian team in the 1998 Winter Olympics, leading all defencemen in scoring, with a goal and two assists in six games.|$|E

This was Téchiné’s sixth film released in the USA (in 1995—following French Provincial (Souvenirs d'en France), Barocco, Hôtel des Amériques, <b>Rendez-vous</b> and Scene of the Crime) and his most autobiographical picture to date. Wild Reeds won the New York Film Critics Award and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
25|$|Jordan's first band, drawn {{mainly from}} members of the Jesse Stone band, was {{originally}} a nine-piece group, but he soon scaled it down to a sextet after landing a residency at the Elks Rendezvous club, at 464 Lenox Avenue, in Harlem. The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing, as Louie Jordan's Elks <b>Rendez-vous</b> Band, his name was spelled Louie so people would know not to pronounce it Lewis.|$|E
25|$|The 1972 Summit Series and 1974 Summit Series, two series pitting {{the best}} Canadian and Soviet players without IIHF {{restrictions}} were major successes, {{and established a}} rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five Canada Cup tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996 and 2004. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Despite Bailey's {{hopes of}} an annual All-Star Game, {{it did not}} become an annual {{tradition}} until the 1947–48 NHL season. In 1966, the All-Star Game was moved {{from the start of}} the season to its current position in the middle of the season. In 1979, the Challenge Cup series replaced the game, and in 1987 it was replaced with <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87. Lockouts disrupted the NHL season in 1995, 2005 and 2013 and resulted in the cancellation of the game in those years. As part of the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that expired in 2014, the NHL agreed with the NHLPA not to hold an All-Star Game during Winter Olympic years, consequently the contest was cancelled in 2006, 2010 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 1969, local {{merchants and}} {{residents}} held {{a meeting to}} discuss possible uses for the derelict site. At the time, student activist Wendy Schlesinger and Michael Delacour (a former defense contractor employee who had become an anti-war activist) had become attached to the area, {{as they had been}} using it as a <b>rendez-vous</b> for a secret romantic affair. The two presented a plan for developing the under-utilized, university-owned land into a public park. This plan was approved by the attendees, but not by the university. Stew Albert, a co-founder of the Yippie Party, agreed to write an article for the local counter-culture newspaper, the Berkeley Barb, {{on the subject of the}} park, particularly to call for help from local residents.|$|E
25|$|The {{army was}} fixed at 16,000 troops, with 1,300 horse. Among {{the troops were}} 2,000 {{veterans}} from the Netherlands campaign, led by Henry Dowcra, which it was proposed to distribute in garrisons. The plan provided for reinforcements of 2,000 troops from England every three months {{to make up for}} expected losses, and a regular postal service was established between Dublin and London via Holyhead. Essex also had command of a squadron of five warships with an assortment of fly-boats, which was intended for a landing at Lough Foyle in the north. An emergency <b>rendez-vous</b> for the squadron was appointed at Berehaven (or Baltimore) in the southern province of Munster, in the event of Spanish aggression. Ultimately the ships were confined to southern waters and played no part in the northern campaign.|$|E
25|$|After {{making a}} {{television}} production: La Matiouette ou l'arrière-pays, (1983), Téchiné returned to critical attention with <b>Rendez-vous</b> (1985), a sexy noir melodrama replete with the seductive {{surface of the}} era. In the film a would-be actress, Nina, fleeing her provincial home for Paris, enters a turbulent love relationship with a sadistic, self-destructive young actor, who caused {{the death of his}} former girlfriend. When the actor himself is killed in an accident, or possible suicide, his former mentor/director, and father of the dead girlfriend, determines to cast the inexperienced Nina as the female lead in 'Romeo and Juliet', a role his deceased daughter played. The film is ultimately a vehicle for exploring the violent intensity of certain emotional attachments and their ability to cause one's life to spin off in unexpected directions. By now a key director of the post-New Wave, this film earned Téchiné the Cannes Festival Best Direction Award while helping launch the career of Juliette Binoche.|$|E
25|$|La Folle Journée (The Mad Day, an {{alternate}} title of Pierre Beaumarchais' play The Marriage of Figaro) is a classical music festival held each winter. The original one-day festival now lasts for five days. Its programme has a main theme (past themes have included exile, nature, Russia and Frédéric Chopin), mixing classics with lesser-known and -performed works. The concept has been exported to Bilbao, Tokyo and Warsaw, and the festival sold a record 154,000 tickets in 2015. The September <b>Rendez-vous</b> de l'Erdre couples a jazz festival with a pleasure-boating {{show on the}} Erdre, exposing the public to a musical genre considered elitist; all concerts are free. Annual attendance is about 150,000. The Three Continents Festival is an annual film festival dedicated to Asia, Africa and South America, with a Mongolfière d'or (Golden Hot-air Balloon) awarded to the best film. Nantes also hosts Univerciné (festivals dedicated to films in English, Italian, Russian and German) and a smaller Spanish film festival. The Scopitone festival is dedicated to digital art, and Utopiales is an international science fiction festival.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Cold War" [...] {{culminated in}} 1987 with <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87, as the Soviet {{national}} team played a two-game {{series against the}} NHL all-stars {{in place of the}} NHL All-Star Game. The series was split, with the NHL winning the first game 4–3, and the Soviets the second, 5–3. The 1987 Canada Cup followed, and was won by Canada two games to one, with the third game being described as the greatest in hockey history. The winning goal was scored by Mario Lemieux on a pass from Wayne Gretzky.|$|E
500|$|In 2002 he {{released}} Sessions 2000, {{a set of}} experimental synth-jazz pieces distinct from his previous work. [...] Sessions was well received by Billboard Magazine, which said [...] "He's created a deeply nuanced soundscape that invites repeated listening." [...] A concert in September 2002 at a wind farm near Aalborg in Denmark proved problematic when 22mm of rain fell on the venue, causing long delays for spectators. It also marked a change in direction in Jarre's live concerts; from <b>Rendez-vous</b> Houston onwards he had been accompanied by {{a full complement of}} live musicians, but at Aalborg he was accompanied only by Francis Rimbert, and having guests like the Klarup Girls Choir, Safri Duo and the Aalborg Symphonic Orchestra.|$|E
500|$|About 2,000projectors shone images onto {{buildings}} and giant screens up to [...] high, transforming the city's skyscrapers into spectacular backdrops for an elaborate display of fireworks and lasers. <b>Rendez-vous</b> Houston entered the Guinness Book of Records for its audience of over 1.5million, beating his earlier record, set in 1979. The display was so impressive that a nearby freeway {{was blocked by}} passing vehicles, forcing the authorities to close it {{for the duration of}} the concert. Several months later he performed to an audience of about a million at his home city of Lyon, in celebration of a visit by Pope John Paul II. Watching from Lyon Cathedral, the Pope began the concert with a good-night blessing, a recording of which appears on Cities in Concert – Houston/Lyon.|$|E
500|$|The NHL took {{a greater}} {{interest}} in international play. [...] The Canada Cup, a tournament that featured the top professional players in the world, was held first in 1976, and then four more times until 1991. [...] It was succeeded by the World Cup of Hockey in 1996. [...] Beginning in 1975, Soviet club teams began touring North America, playing NHL clubs in exhibition games that were known as the Super Series. [...] The Calgary Flames and Washington Capitals similarly toured the Soviet Union in 1989 in the first [...] "Friendship Series". The Soviet national team defeated an NHL all-star team in a 1979 challenge series, two games to one, and split <b>Rendez-vous</b> '87, a two-game series held in Quebec City.|$|E
500|$|Musique pour Supermarché {{was created}} for a planned {{performance}} at the [...] "Supermarché" [...] art exhibition. Jarre allowed Radio Luxembourg to broadcast it uninterrupted, in its entirety, before he auctioned off a single vinyl print on 5 July 1983, at the Hôtel Drouot in Paris. The sale raised about 70,000francs, and in protest at the [...] "silly industrialisation of music", Jarre promised to burn the original tapes {{in the presence of}} a bailiff. Parts of the destroyed album were reworked into works in subsequent releases (including Diva and Blah Blah Café from Zoolook, and sections of the Fifth <b>Rendez-Vous).</b> Both Music for Supermarkets and Zoolook made heavy use of the Fairlight CMI's ability to sample audio. Zoolook features snippets of words and speech from languages across the globe. Laurie Anderson provided the vocals for the track [...] "Diva". A long list of musicians, including Adrian Belew and Marcus Miller, also made significant contributions. The album was somewhat less successful than Jarre's previous works, reaching only number47 in the UK album charts.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rendez-Vous</b> {{was created}} {{over a period}} of about two months and, as with Zoolook, {{contains}} elements of his 1983 album Musique pour Supermarché. Its three movements represent Houston's development, from a rural economy to its role as a leader in space technology. Baroque in style, the album uses a mixture of French horns, trombones, and violins; and it features heavy use of the Elka Synthex, notably so on [...] "Third Rendez-Vous", a track Jarre often performs using a laser harp. Jarre worked with several Houston-based astronauts, including Bruce McCandless II and Ronald McNair, an accomplished musician who was to have played the saxophone on [...] "Rendez-Vous VI", recorded in the weightless environment of space. The live performance was curtailed by McNair's death in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on 28 January 1986. Consideration was given to the cancellation of the concert; but McCandless contacted Jarre and urged him to proceed, in memory of the shuttle's crew. McNair's saxophone piece was recorded by French saxophonist Pierre Gossez and retitled [...] "Ron's Piece". At Jarre's giant concerts in Houston and Lyon, the part was performed by McNair's friend, American saxophonist Kirk Whalum ...|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the achievements of}} Scott and Amundsen, most polar historians generally accept that Amundsen's skills with ski and dogs, his general familiarity with ice conditions, and his clear focus on a non-scientific expedition gave him considerable advantages {{in the race for}} the Pole. Scott's verdict on the disaster that overtook his party, written when he was close to death, lists the initial loss of pony transport, weather conditions, [...] "a shortage of fuel in our depots for which I cannot account", and the sickening of Evans and Oates, but ultimately Scott concludes that [...] "our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather [...] on the Barrier [...] in the day, [...] at night". Presumably with regard to the failed <b>rendez-vous</b> with the dog teams requested for 1 March 1912, Scott furthermore wrote [...] "No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we have lacked support". Cherry-Garrard, whom Atkinson placed in charge of the dog teams which started late, failed to meet Scott and turned for home, observes that [...] "the whole business simply bristles with 'ifs'"; an accumulation of decisions and circumstances that might have fallen differently ultimately led to catastrophe. But [...] "we were as wise as anyone can be before the event." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was to be}} {{later in}} 1985 that Binoche would fully emerge as a leading actress with her role in André Téchiné's <b>Rendez-vous.</b> She was cast at short notice when Sandrine Bonnaire had to abandon the film due to a {{scheduling}} conflict. <b>Rendez-vous</b> premiered at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, winning Best Director. The film was a sensation and Binoche became {{the darling of the}} festival. <b>Rendez-Vous</b> {{is the story of a}} provincial actress, Nina (Binoche), who arrives in Paris and embarks on a series of dysfunctional liaisons with several men, including the moody, suicidal Quentin (Lambert Wilson). However it is her collaboration with theatre director Scrutzler, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant, which comes to define Nina. In a review of <b>Rendez-Vous</b> in Film Comment, Armond White described it as [...] "Juliette Binoche's career defining performance".|$|E
