The Danes and Swedes rush at the front of Olaf's line and are repulsed, suffering heavy casualties and loss of ships. Jarl Eirik attacks the flank and forces his vessel, the Iron <b>Ram,</b> <b>up</b> against the last ship of Olaf's line, which he clears with a fierce attack and then proceeds onto the next ship. In this way, Olaf's ships were cleared one by one, till the Long Serpent alone was left.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} non-English {{language}} magazines have also reviewed Europa Barbarorum. The Italian PC Gaming magazine Giochi per il mio computer [...] reviewed the modification in April 2005 and March 2008. The 2005 review {{reported that the}} modification, whose development team included two historians, was to replace the [...] "economic system, [...] equipment and the provinces" [...] of Rome: Total War; the latter review praised the mod for having [...] "altered and deepened" [...] the gameplay of the original title, and wrote that Europa Barbarorum was the best substitute for a Rome 2: Total War game prior to the actual release of such a title. Dutch magazine , reviewing the mod in March 2008, also wrote that the mod was [...] "perhaps the best candidate for the title Rome: Total War II" [...] "until the official announcement" [...] {{and went on to}} note that the list of changes that the modification had made to the original game almost constituted [...] "a history book of its own". The German magazine GameStar wrote in April 2007 that the Europa Barbarorum team had [...] "banned all historical mistakes from the game"; in January 2011, another German publication, PC Games, also noted the mod's historical accuracy, singling out its [...] "more realistic, more [...] " [...] battles for praise, although it did note that the mod was squarely aimed at experienced Rome: Total War players. Reviewing version 0.74 of the mod in November 2006, Romanian publication LeveL concurred that the mod was aimed at experienced players, adding that the modified version of the game put greater demands on the player's computer than the original Rome: Total War, requiring 512 MB of <b>RAM,</b> <b>up</b> from the original's 256. Despite this, the reviewer praised the mod's complexity, the [...] "painstaking detail" [...] that went into making the units and the mod's soundtrack.|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder whether}} those little silver pencil-cases with a movable almanac at the {{butt-end}} are still favorite implements with boys, and whether pedlers still hawk {{them about the}} country? Are there pedlers and hawkers still, or are rustics and children grown too sharp to deal with them? Those pencil-cases, {{as far as my}} memory serves me, were not of much use. The screw, upon which the movable almanac turned, was constantly getting loose. The 1 of the table would work from its moorings, under Tuesday or Wednesday, as the case might be, and you would find, on examination, that Th. or W. was the 23 1/2 of the month (which was absurd {{on the face of the}} thing), and in a word your cherished pencil-case an utterly unreliable time-keeper. Nor was this a matter of wonder. Consider the position of a pencil-case in a boy's pocket. You had hard-bake in it; marbles, kept in your purse when the money was all gone; your mother's purse, knitted so fondly and supplied with a little bit of gold, long since--prodigal little son!--scattered amongst the swine--I mean amongst brandy-balls, open tarts, three-cornered puffs, and similar abominations. You had a top and string; a knife; a piece of cobbler's wax; two or three bullets; a Little Warbler; and I, for my part, remember, for a considerable period, a brass-barrelled pocket-pistol (which would fire beautifully, for with it I shot off a button from Butt Major's jacket);--with all these things, and ever so many more, clinking and rattling in your pockets, and your hands, of course, keeping them in perpetual movement, how could you expect your movable almanac not to be twisted out of its place now and again--your pencil-case to be bent--your liquorice water not to leak out of your bottle over the cobbler's wax, your bull's-eyes not to <b>ram</b> <b>up</b> the lock and barrel of your pistol, and so forth.|$|E
