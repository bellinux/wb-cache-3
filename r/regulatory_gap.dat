40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the legal regime of high seas fisheries {{with a view}} to identifying <b>regulatory</b> <b>gaps.</b> The main research questions are as follows: 1. What general principles are applicable to high seas fisheries?; 2. What implications do these general principles have for new challenges in the conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas, including deep-sea fisheries?; 3. How have states, collectively or individually, addressed alleged <b>regulatory</b> <b>gaps</b> in the regime of high seas fisheries at the global, regional and national levels? Part I deals with the development of the general principles of high seas fisheries in two chapters: the evolution of the general principles up to the adoption of the LOSC (Chapter 1), and the general principles in the LOSC in the light of subsequent developments (Chapter 2). Part II consists of Chapters 3 - 5. This Part first examines the practice within international organizations at the global level (Chapter 3). The next chapter of this Part focuses on the practice of RFMO/As (Chapter 4). The final substantive chapter examines other practices at the regional and national levels (Chapter 5). The study is concluded with a synthesis of the analysis of the substantive chapters and some suggestions on action for the international community to address <b>regulatory</b> <b>gaps</b> in high seas fisheries (Chapter 6) ...|$|R

The literature on political CSR focuses mostly on how large multinational corporations (MNCs) can address environmental and social problems that arise globally along their supply chains. This article addresses political CSR of {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). SMEs represent a major share of economic value creation worldwide and are increasingly exposed to <b>regulatory</b> <b>gaps.</b> Although SMEs differ substantially from MNCs in terms of organizational characteristics, behavioral guiding principles, and financial and human resources, they should still tackle such <b>regulatory</b> <b>gaps</b> by accepting a political role. Drawing on Zadek’s model of CSR-based organizational learning and Young’s concept of social connection, this study develops a conceptual framework as the basis for discussing why SMEs should become involved in political CSR, how they can manage political CSR internally and systematically, and how their progress can be assessed by third-party observers externally...|$|R

The article explores whether the medical product regulations are robust enough, whether there are certain <b>regulatory</b> <b>gaps,</b> and whether the competent bodies have the expertise to evaluate nanomedicinal products when approval is applied for. Based on a social-constructive approach the article identifies signifi-cant regulatory actors, their ideas on regulatory problems and preliminary gov-ernance responses to them. It finds that the current dynamic regulatory structure seems robust enough to adapt to some of the technological challenges that are be-ing posed by nanomedicines. It concludes that regulators have not yet responded adequately to <b>regulatory</b> <b>gaps</b> related to definitions, classification and specific safety, quality and efficacy standards nanopharmaceutical development seems to require.

40|$|Anti-discrimination and {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} laws historically targeted the employment relationship. The recently enacted national Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth) (WHS Act) has rejected the employer and employee relationship as the primary relationship warranting regulation. The WHS Act instead adopts a wider regulatory focus and requires persons conducting businesses or undertakings (PCBUs) to manage health and safety in a range of work relationships that are not regulated by other workplace laws. The WHS Act reforms substantially alter how anti-discrimination and health and safety laws interact. In this study we argue that the expanded coverage of the WHS Act is resulting in a <b>regulatory</b> <b>gap</b> between workplace health and safety (WHS) and anti-discrimination laws. This gap is creating situations where PCBUs are managing health and safety issues in work relationships that are not protected by anti-discrimination laws. We analyse the possible implications of this disparity through a case study on workplace violence and workers with mental disabilities. We conclude that this <b>regulatory</b> <b>gap</b> is a recipe for future discriminatory health and safety policies and maintain that more research is required to ascertain how the different statutes operate in the workplace and the consequences of this interaction.

40|$|States hire Private Military or Security Companies [PMSCs/contractors] in armed {{conflict}} and occupation to fulfil tasks formerly exclusively handled by soldiers, including combat, guarding and protection, and detention and interrogation. PMSC personnel, like soldiers, {{can and do}} violate or act incompatibly with International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law. Relying on the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility, the article compares the responsibility of states for such conduct of their soldiers with that which states incur {{with respect to the}} conduct of contractors they hire. It reveals a <b>regulatory</b> <b>gap</b> which states seeking to reduce their exposure to international responsibility can exploit. Positive obligations of states under International Humanitarian Law narrow this gap to some degree. An analysis of the duty to prevent demonstrates that the potential of positive Human Rights Law obligations to bridge the gap – although important – remains limited by their due diligence nature, and problems of extraterritorial applicability. It is then argued that the conduct of certain contractors exercising coercive functions {{can be attributed to the}} hiring state as that of ‘persons forming part of its armed forces’ in the sense of the customary provision enshrined in Article 3 of Hague Convention IV of 1907 and Article 91 of Additional Protocol I. Where this is the case, the state will be responsible for their conduct as it would be for that of its soldiers, which fully eliminates the <b>regulatory</b> <b>gap.</b> The ‘Regulating Privatisation of “War”: The Role of the EU in Assuring the Compliance with International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights” (PRIV-WAR) project is funded by the European Community’s 7 th Framework Programme under grant agreement no. 217405...|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} regulatory gaps that are created through imprecise preemption rulings. It begins with a detailed case study of how railroads were able to enter the highly regulated solid waste industry, to claim that all state oversight is preempted by a federal statute intended to deregulate railroad economics, and to obtain the economic benefits of operating in a <b>regulatory</b> <b>gap.</b> The net result of current preemption doctrine in those cases has been to strip citizens of the power to ensure that waste transfer stations are safe, and this fundamental injustice serves as a backdrop to analyzing current preemption jurisprudence. The Court’s reliance on a presumption against preemption of state laws to interpret federal statutes has declined over time, and this article provides an additional explanation for the presumption’s decline based upon flaws in the original formulation of the doctrine. The article also explores the Court’s current use of regulatory gaps as marking the plausible limits of Congressional intent to preempt, particularly {{when faced with the}} preclusion of all tort remedies for individual victims, and argues that the Court’s concern about regulatory gaps should extend to preventive measures that are also based on the states’ police powers and that are the expression of collective rights of self-protection. In addition to the standard federalism concerns that animate restraints on preemption, the article builds on scholarship that suggests additional Constitutional limitations on Congress’s powers to strip remedies from citizens. Finally, the article proposes to correct these trends through a revitalized presumption against preemption, whereby courts would consider whether a preemption ruling will create a <b>regulatory</b> <b>gap,</b> and in those circumstances should require a clear statement that Congress intended to strip remedies designed to prevent the underlying conduct at issue. Such a prudential rule of construction would avoid potential Constitutional issues...|$|E
