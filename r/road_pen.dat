6000|$|As {{they came}} along the <b>road,</b> <b>Pen</b> had formed {{acquaintance}} with a cheery fellow-passenger in a shabby cloak, who talked {{a great deal}} about men of letters with whom he was very familiar, and who was, in fact, the reporter of a London newspaper, as whose representative he had been to attend a great wrestling-match in the west. This gentleman knew intimately, as it appeared, all the leading men of letters of his day, and talked about Tom Campbell, and Tom Hood, and Sydney Smith, and this and the other, {{as if he had been}} their most intimate friend. As they passed by Brompton, this gentleman pointed out to Pen Mr. Hurtle, the reviewer, walking with his umbrella. Pen craned over the coach to have a long look at the great Hurtle. He was a Boniface man, said Pen. And Mr. Doolan, of the Star newspaper (for such was the gentleman's name and address upon the card which he handed to Pen), said [...] "Faith he was, and he knew him very well." [...] Pen thought it was quite an honour to have seen the great Mr. Hurtle, whose works he admired. He believed fondly, as yet, in authors, reviewers, and editors of newspapers. Even Wagg, whose books did not appear to him to be masterpieces of human intellect, he yet secretly revered as a successful writer. He mentioned that he had met Wagg in the country, and Doolan told him how that famous novelist received three hundther pounds a volume for every one of his novels. Pen began to calculate instantly whether he might not make five thousand a year.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the subject}} of the album, Erna told LAUNCH Media: [...] "It's a bit more musical at times, it's a bit more melodic, but it's still raw," [...] Erna said. [...] "It's still tough. It's still got that Godsmack edge to it, but it's not quite as angry, maybe, as the past stuff has been. But it's still got its rawness...Well, I shouldn't say that. There's a couple of nasty fuckin' songs on this record. But all in all I think it's just really, I think, some well written stuff. I'm really proud of it." [...] Erna found {{inspiration}} after reading Rush drummer Neil Peart's book Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing <b>Road,</b> and <b>penned</b> the new song [...] "Serenity", which Merrill says is similar in motif to the tribal-drum sound of Godsmack's past hit [...] "Voodoo".|$|R

50|$|In October 2009 {{the cost}} {{estimate}} {{had risen to}} £1.3b with work due to start in 2012 and being completed in winter 2015/2016. The Campaign for Better Transport was opposed to the plans, listing their reasons for objection as the carbon emissions the road would induce, the cost, and its negative impact on non-car travel. The coalition government suspended the scheme when it came into power, with Philip Hammond, the Secretary of State for Transport, suggesting that the scheme would be 'axed', {{and that the only}} way it would get built was as a toll road. That government money would not pay for the scheme was confirmed at the end of October, when <b>Roads</b> Minister Mike <b>Penning</b> said that the scheme was unaffordable and no longer offered acceptable value for money. The scheme was officially cancelled in 2010.|$|R
