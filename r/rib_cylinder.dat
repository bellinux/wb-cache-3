40|$|Analyzing {{double layer}} <b>ribbed</b> <b>cylinder’s</b> {{underwater}} vibration {{is of great}} importance to the design and evaluation of vessels’ dynamic performance of operation and human comfort level. The two main traditional methods that are applied to solve this work are Flügge’s equations of motion and numerical method, such as FEM. Even though both methods have their own special advantages, complicated model developing process and comparative low accuracy (compared with data from real measurement) are their common drawbacks. In this paper, Neural Network is {{used to analyze the}} dynamic character of this double layer <b>ribbed</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Real measurement data are used to construct Neural Network, and after this Neural Network model is well built, comparison studies are processed between the vibration data of some positions of interest on the cylinder acquired from Neural Network and real test, respectively. The results show that Neural Network can be used to analyse the dynamic character of double layer <b>ribbed</b> <b>cylinder</b> and is of high accuracy and timesaving. The next step of this research will be concentrated on using more representative vibration data to develop Neural Network model...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study the {{stabilising}} effect which vertical ribs may have on a tall cylindrical structure, with {{the focus on the}} proposed Solar Chimney. The report begins with a brief introduction to the Solar Chimney concept. A study is made of flow regimes which exist for flow around a circular cylinder and these flow regimes, together with their characteristics, are described. Various threats to the Solar Chimney are identified and will be investigated. The natural shape and strength of the Saguaro Cactus leads to the investigation of vertically <b>ribbed</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Experimental wind tunnel tests are performed in Tokyo, Japan to obtain external pressure distributions. A smooth cylindrical model, as well as two different configurations of vertically <b>ribbed</b> <b>cylinders</b> are tested. These external pressure distributions are numerically integrated in order to obtain calculated drag coefficient values for the cylinders. The drag coefficients for a smooth cylinder and <b>cylinders</b> with vertical <b>ribs</b> are obtained experimentally by means of total drag force measurements. These tests were performed in the wind tunnel at the University of Stellenbosch. The effect of aspect ratio of a smooth cylinder is also addressed. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses are carried out using the CFD software program, FLUENT. Both the drag coefficient and the external pressure distributions were investigated in this way. The differences between theoretical conditions and those of real life conditions of a smooth cylinder are discussed. The report ends by concluding the stabilising effect of vertical ribs on tall cylindrical structures and how these ribs may eliminate some of the present threats to the proposed Solar Chimney...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study is to measure complex shapes of tested objects by using a priori {{information}} given by their CAD model via stereocorrelation. To follow a 3 D object during its deformation and to determine 3 D surface displacement elds, a rst measurement of the object shape is necessary. It is achieved by updating the CAD reference via a global approach to stereocorrelation. Once the 3 D shape has been determined, {{the next step is to}} measure 3 D displacement elds during loading. The kinematics of the deformed shape is assumed to be written within the same isogeometric framework. Isogeometric stereocorrelation is applied to analyze a compression test on a <b>ribbed</b> <b>cylinder</b> in two dierent congurations of the stereo rig...|$|R

The potential benefit for the hysteresis absorber is that the diameter can be decreased and operating RPM of the absorber may be increased.|$|R

40|$|The chest wall, {{like other}} {{regional}} anatomy, {{is a remarkable}} fusion of form and function. Principal functions are the protection of internal viscera and an expandable cylinder facilitating variable gas flow into the lungs. Knowledge of the anatomy of the whole <b>cylinder</b> (<b>ribs,</b> sternum, vertebra, diaphragm, intercostal spaces, and extrathoracic muscles) is therefore not only important in the local environment of a specific chest wall resection but also in its relation to overall function. An understanding of chest wall kinematics might help define the loss of function after resection {{and the effects of}} various chest wall substitutes. Therefore, this article is not an exhaustive anatomic description but a focused summary and discussion...|$|R

5000|$|The {{classical}} reticello {{pattern is}} a small uniform mesh of white threads in clear glass, with a tiny air bubble in every mesh rectangle. To make an object in this pattern, the glassblower first uses white single-thread vetro a fili [...] canes to blow a cylindrical cup shape, twisting as he forms it so the canes are in a spiral, and using care not to totally smooth the inside ribbing that remains from the canes. Setting this cup aside (usually keeping it warm in a furnace, below its softening point), he then makes another closed cylinder in the same pattern, but twisted in the opposite direction, and retaining some of the <b>ribbing</b> on the <b>cylinder’s</b> outside. When this cylinder is the right size, the glassblower plunges it into the warm cup, without touching any of the sides until it is inserted all the way. Air is trapped in the spaces between the ribs of the two pieces, forming the uniformly spaced air bubbles. The piece may then be blown out and shaped as desired. The term reticello is often loosely applied to any criss-cross pattern, whether vetro a fili [...] or vetro a retorti , white or colored, and with or without air bubbles.|$|R
40|$|The {{topology}} and {{geometry of}} microstructures {{play a crucial}} role in determining their heat transfer performance in passive cooling devices such as heat pipes. It is therefore important to characterize microstructures based on their wicking performance, the thermal conduction resistance of the liquid filling the microstructure, and the thin-film characteristics of the liquid meniscus. In the present study, the free-surface shapes of the static liquid meniscus in common microstructures are modeled using SURFACE EVOLVER for zero Bond number. Four well-defined topologies, viz., surfaces with parallel rectangular <b>ribs,</b> horizontal parallel <b>cylinders,</b> vertically aligned cylinders, and spheres (the latter two in both square and hexagonal packing arrangements), are considered. Nondimensional capillary pressure, average distance of the liquid free-surface from solid walls (a measure of the conduction resistance of the liquid), total exposed area, and thin-film area are computed. These performance parameters are presented as functions of the nondimensional geometrical parameters characterizing the microstructures, the volume of the liquid filling the structure, and the contact angle between the liquid and solid. Based on these performance parameters, hexagonally-packed spheres on a surface are identified to be the most efficient microstructure geometry for wicking and thin-film evaporation. The solid-liquid contact angle and the nondimensional liquid volume that yield the best performance are also identified. The optimum liquid level in the wick pore that yields the highest capillary pressure and heat transfer is obtained by analyzing the variation in capillary pressure and heat transfer with liquid level and using an effective thermal resistance model for the wick...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of a numerical predictive procedure for turbulent flows around full-scale buildings. Two different turbulence models were considered: a complete Reynolds stress model with two alternative proposals for the pressure-strain correlations and a k-E model {{used in conjunction with}} both linear and nonlinear stress-strain relationships. The governing differential equations were discretized using finite-volume techniques and a co-located variable-storage arrangement. A multigrid method was introduced and was found to reduce the computational time by nearly a factor of ten. Both the Reynolds-stress transport model and the non-linear k-€ model were implemented in a form suitable for use with body-fitted coordinates on a co-located grid. When using the Reynolds-stress models, a number of techniques were utilized to stabilize the solution process and attain rapid convergence. The atmospheric boundary layer at inlet to the computation domain, traditionally specified from empirical correlations, was simulated here using a full Reynolds-stress model in conjunction with a marching integration procedure. Due account was taken of the terrain roughness which matched that for the full-scale tests. The outcome of those simulations consisted of profiles of mean velocity and turbulence quantities that were self sustaining and in close accord with the few full-scale measurements available. The turbulence models' performance was assessed first through detailed comparisons with various benchmark flows including the backward-facing step in both straight and divergent channel, the two-dimensional <b>rib,</b> the circular <b>cylinder</b> and the three-dimensional cube. Detailed model verification was then carried out by comparisons with full-scale measurements on various structures including a single-span low-rise building, a semicylindrical greenhouse and a multi-span glasshouse. It was found that the Reynolds-stress models consistently produced more accurate simulations than the k-E models. Moreover, it was demonstrated that a recently proposed model for the pressure-strain correlations yields very satisfactory results without the use of wall-reflection terms. Parametric studies were performed to determine the sensitivity of the average pressure loading to various design parameters such as the height and width of the building, the eaves geometry (sharp or curved) and the height and location of a solid windbreak placed upstream of the building. Finally, a method is proposed for representing the unsteady nature of the flow around full-scale buildings. The unsteady pressure loading is recovered and so is the peak loading which far exceeds the steady-state value. The method utilizes classical turbulence modelling techniques and is shown to yield results that are in qualitative accord with the field measurements...|$|R
