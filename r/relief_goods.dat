Long focal-length eyepieces usually have ample eye relief, but short focal-length eyepieces are more problematic. Until recently, and still quite commonly, eyepieces of a short-focal length have had a short eye <b>relief.</b> <b>Good</b> design guidelines suggest a minimum of 5-6 mm to accommodate the eyelashes of the observer to avoid discomfort. Modern designs with many lens elements, however, can correct for this, and viewing at high power becomes more comfortable. This is especially the case for spectacle wearers, who may need up to 20 mm of eye relief to accommodate their glasses.|$|R

5|$|After {{the scale}} of the damage became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> were distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food and logistical support. Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E

The reservoir is made up of a series of turbidite sands of the Miocene to Pliocene age which is deposited within a mini-basin. It was a good candidate for secondary recovery because the reservoirs have limited aquifer influx, was very over-pressured and compacting and was undersaturated. The reservoirs also have <b>good</b> structure <b>relief,</b> <b>good</b> connectivity and directional permeabilities. Its sands are generally characterized as sheet sands and channelized deposits, but massive fine- and very fine-grained sands are also observed. The sheets have excellent lateral pressure communication, and shales at the internal zones do not necessarily divide the reservoir into compartments as seen from production and pressure history.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Eline struck Mozambique, {{there was already}} {{incoming}} assistance from the international community, responding to the earlier flooding. Mozambique's president at the time, Joaquim Chissano, requested for additional aid after the storm struck, asking for $65 million for both reconstruction and emergency aid, and later increasing the request to $160 million. By the end of February 2000, various countries had pledged $13.5 million to Mozambique, well short of the required needs, but that rose to nearly $119 million by March 17. By March 4, 39.6 tons of various <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> reached the country, to be distributed from the towns of Bilene and Magul. The supplies nearly overwhelmed the small airport at Maputo, as lack of distribution caused food to decay in the sun.|$|E
5|$|In all, {{the storm}} {{directly}} affected 3,027,601people, or 318,968families. Nationwide, 146people were injured. Infrastructure damage totaled $106.2million (1988 USD), while damage to agriculture accumulated to $16.5million and damage totaled $8.9million in private properties. Overall, Skip {{was responsible for}} $131.8million in damage. Additionally, 144,136people or 28,824families were evacuated to shelters {{as a result of}} the flooding. In all, 237people were killed due to Typhoon Skip. Since many roads in the devastated area were impassable, officials were forced to ferry <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> to stranded residents by small boats and military helicopters. The Canadian Red Cross donated CD$5,000, while the city of Ottawa donated CD$150,000.|$|E
5|$|When Megh passed near Socotra, {{residents}} {{were just beginning}} to return after the previous cyclone, and many had to evacuate again. Additional heavy rainfall and high winds lashed the island, which destroyed 500homes and damaged another 3,000. The consecutive storms damaged 785fishing boats, left 80% of the roads impassible, and caused an island-wide power outage. Megh killed 18people on Socotra and injured another 60. The heavy damage on the island prompted nearby countries and international organizations to deliver <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> and medical teams. Later, Megh brought torrential rainfall and high waves to northern Somalia, killing livestock and damaging schools. The storm's final landfall in Yemen marked little rainfall or effects.|$|E

5|$|Damage {{assessments}} in the Philippines began on October31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked off or washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross {{assisted in the}} immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> to more than 16,000people in Aurora. The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.|$|E
5|$|Four storms struck Madagascar in {{the season}} between December and March, collectively killing 100people and causing $250million (1982 United States dollars) in damage. The storms caused {{widespread}} flooding and a state of disaster for four months, compounded by floods in January. About 180,000people were forced to evacuate, and there were increased levels of flood-related diseases. The storms closed down many roads and destroyed widespread crops, forcing the government to import 400,000 metric tons of rice. After the floods, workers repaired damaged roads and dykes while the government provided relief supplies. However, the ongoing floods strained the Madagascar's resources, and the government appealed for aid {{to the international community}} on February4. The United States Agency for International Development provided nearly $9million in aid, mostly for rice and rebuilding roads. Other countries donated about $7.5million in money or <b>relief</b> <b>goods,</b> such as building materials, food, clothing, and medicine.|$|E
5|$|In {{mainland}} China, officials used {{helicopters to}} airdrop <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> to Guangdong. By {{three days after}} the storm, workers distributed 2,000tents and 1,000beds. Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50tons of disinfectant {{to prevent the spread of}} disease, while the provincial government allocated ¥240million (CNY, US$35million) for rebuilding. About 1,000soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming. The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient. Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident, which ultimately totaled ¥245million (CNY, US$38.7million). After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided ¥1million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.|$|E

On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, towels, and emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> valued at $70,000 to the Cuban Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government reported that they had allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E
5|$|On October27, the Yemen {{government}} requested {{assistance from}} the international community, unable to provide disaster assessments or cope with the rebuilding. The storm affected areas of Yemen that already had poor infrastructure and lack of food, and were generally under a state of political unrest, which made recovery difficult. In some areas, relief distribution was duplicated {{due to lack of}} coordination while some areas did not receive help. Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister for Internal Affairs coordinated the relief efforts, in conjunction with the governors of the most affected areas. The government focused on streamlining disaster activities and toward future mitigation. However, there was no coordinated disaster plan as of September 2009, and the scale of the disaster proved too great for ministries to handle. The Ministry of Public Works helped reopen roads, which allowed for the transport of <b>relief</b> <b>goods,</b> and the damaged Sayun Airport was repaired to withstand future floods. By December 2008, most roads, power systems, hospitals, and communication services were restored. The government also enacted the Fund for Hadramout and Al-Mahara Reconstruction, which failed to promptly distribute aid assistance.|$|E

In addition to revenue, the Department of Social Welfare and Development provided over 3 million bottles of antibiotics. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs awarded a $25,000emergency cash grant {{for the purchase}} of medicines, canned food, and clothing to the country. The United Nations Development Programme granted $50,000worth of medicines, canned food, clothing, blankets, and cooking utensils. In addition, the UNICEF acquired $55,000 worth of medicine to the island chain. The United States federal government donated 13,000packages of <b>relief</b> <b>goods.</b> The League of Red Cross Societies donated 4,000bags of rice, 2,500containers of milk (combined worth $158,000), as well as more than $250,000in onetary contributions.

In Guatemala, the president organized the National Emergency Committee to coordinate disaster relief, but after few organizations complied, there was duplicate relief work in some areas and no assistance in other areas. The Guatemalan Red Cross and the country's air force and army helped in the relief efforts. Citizens throughout the country donated over $200,000 worth of food and clothing. The government made widespread road and bridge repairs following the floods {{with the assistance of}} the United States, installing two Bailey bridges that were completed by early November; there were delays installing the bridges due to persistent unsettled weather. The United States ultimately provided $281,659 in aid to the country, mostly through the road reconstruction and C-rations. Other countries and Red Cross chapters sent money to Guatemala, including 10tons of medicine from Brazil, 500blankets from Chile, and 200bottles of snake bite serum from Costa Rica. El Salvador also received assistance from the United States, including food and blankets.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing <b>relief</b> <b>goods</b> to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} storm struck, CARE {{operated}} airlifts of food to flooded areas. The World Food Programme approved $2 million to help airlifting 53,000 metric tons of food. A fleet of 29 helicopters had rescued 14,204 people by March 7 as well as operating airlifting missions. This included 12 planes and helicopters from South Africa, six helicopters with crews along with 100 motorboats from the United Kingdom, ten helicopters from Germany, and two from Malawi. Many residents in flooded areas initially had to hold onto trees and roofs {{due to lack of}} helicopters, with 100,000 people needing rescue as of March 1. After the floodwaters receded, the need for rescue diminished, allowing families to return home, although helicopters were still required to airlift <b>relief</b> <b>goods.</b> Emergency road repairs allowed supplies to be delivered by road in some areas by March 5. The United States sent a crew of 700 soldiers in what became Task Force Atlas Response, a $37 million operation to coordinate disaster relief, rebuild roads, deliver crop seed, and drop off aid. This was ordered by U.S. President Bill Clinton on March 2 after criticism that the international assistance was insufficient. The Save the Children organization helped reunited separated children from their families, while World Relief flew seeds and tools to help 26,260 farmers regrow their damaged crops. The United Kingdom assisted by canceling the country's $150 million debt earlier than scheduled, and urged other nations to follow suit; Italy canceled its $500 million debt in March. On February 24, the World Bank provided $2.5 million to rebuild roads, and later provided an additional $15 million. The same agency delayed debt payments for one year. Portugal and Spain canceled $150 million and $20 million worth of debt, respectively. Through the Jubilee 2000, most wealthy nations postponed debt payments for one year on March 16.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{three-dimensional}} 3 D photoelastic interaction {{involved in}} the detection mechanism of picosecond ultrasonics is investigated in micrometric metallic films. In pump-probe experiments, the laser source beam is focused to a spot size of less than 1 μm. A 3 D diffracted acoustic field is generated at high frequencies of several tens of gigahertz, containing longitudinal and shear waves altogether. Their propagation changes the dielectric permittivity tensor and the material becomes optically heterogeneous. Consequently, the detection process is modeled through the propagation of the laser probe beam in a material with dielectric properties varying in all directions. Thus, the solution of Maxwell's equations leads to a differential system, the source term of which {{is proportional to the}} acoustic field itself. In the frame of small perturbation theory, the latter is decomposed into a continuous sum of monochromatic plane waves. The scattered electromagnetic field is described using the matricant, and the ensuing analytical solution then allows analyzing the 3 D photoelastic interaction. The contribution of acoustic diffraction and shear wave detection to the reflectometric signal is put into <b>relief.</b> <b>Good</b> agreement with experiments performed in a 1 μm thick aluminum film is found...|$|R
