5000|$|Niger {{is governed}} through a four layer, semi-decentralised series of Administrative divisions. Begun 1992, and finally {{approved}} with {{the formation of}} the Fifth Republic of Niger on 18 July 1999, Niger has been enacting a plan for Decentralisation of some state powers to local bodies. Prior to the 1999-2006 project, Niger's subdivisions were administered via direct appointment from the central government in Niamey. Beginning with Niger's first municipal elections of 2 February 1999, the nation started electing local officials for the first time. Citizens now elect local committee representatives in each Commune, chosen by subdivisions of the commune: [...] "Quarters" [...] in towns and [...] "Villages" [...] in rural areas, with additional groupings for traditional polities and nomadic populations. These officials choose Mayors, and from them are drawn representatives to the Department level. The same process here chooses a Departmental council and Prefect, and representatives to the Regional level. The system is repeated a Regional level, with a <b>Regional</b> <b>Prefect,</b> council, and representatives to the High Council of Territorial Collectives (Le Haut Conseil des Collectivités Territoriales HCCT). The HCCT has only advisory powers, but its members (Regions, Departments, and Communes) have some financial, planning, educational and environmental powers. The central government oversees this process through the office of the Minister of State for the Interior, Public Safety and Decentralization.|$|E
50|$|Constantine {{built upon}} the {{administrative}} reforms introduced by Diocletian. He stabilized the coinage (the gold solidus that he introduced became a highly prized and stable currency), and made {{changes to the}} structure of the army. Under Constantine, the Empire had recovered much of its military strength and enjoyed a period of stability and prosperity. He also reconquered southern parts of Dacia, after defeating the Visigoths in 332, and he was planning a campaign against Sassanid Persia as well. To divide administrative responsibilities, Constantine replaced the single praetorian prefect, who had traditionally exercised both military and civil functions, with <b>regional</b> <b>prefects</b> enjoying civil authority alone. In the course of the 4th century, four great sections emerged from these Constantinian beginnings, and the practice of separating civil from military authority persisted until the 7th century.|$|R

However, his demission on December 12, 2011 raised questions on {{the viability of the}} bid. On January 10, 2011, Charles Beigbeder was named as the new CEO for the Annecy bid. In addition, Olympic champions Jean-Pierre Vidal and Pernilla Wiberg were appointed as Vice Presidents of the bid. Beigbeder said he would seek more financial support for the bid from the private sector. Also announced with Beigbeder's appointment was the selection of Pierre Mirabaud as Director General of the bid.

5000|$|The Beijing {{government}} {{broke off}} {{diplomatic relations with}} the Holy See in 1951 after a complicated incident. Throughout 1950 and 1951, China had been putting pressure on the Vatican by threatening a breakaway of [...] "independent Catholics", but many priests opposed the movement, and Zhou Enlai sought a middle ground. A deadly controversy was then manufactured: a priest working at the Holy See internunciature (legation) had thrown out an old 1930s-era mortar in a trash pile out of his home. A businessman named Antonio Riva discovered the mortar and took a non-functioning piece of it back to his house to display as an antique. When Communist officials saw Riva's curio in his home, they arrested him for conspiracy to assassinate Mao Zedong, which Riva denied. Riva was executed and the Holy See's diplomatic mission was banished from the country for [...] "espionage". Tarcisio Martina, the <b>regional</b> apostolic <b>prefect,</b> {{was sentenced to life}} in prison and died in 1961, while four other [...] "conspirators" [...] were given shorter sentences. The Beijing government has set two conditions for reestablishing the relations: that the Holy See [...] "not interfere in religious matters in China" [...] and that, in line with Beijing's One-China policy, it break the ties with the Taipei government that it established after the expulsion of Archbishop Riberi, ties that, since the United Nations' recognition of the Beijing government as the government of China, it now maintains only at the level of chargé d'affaires. The Holy See has indicated that it would have no difficulty about the second condition, but requires discussion about the concrete meaning of the first. The main point of contention concerns the appointing of Catholic bishops in mainland China, who are now named by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), at some periods in agreement with the Holy See, at other times in direct opposition to its declared wishes. The PRC government's position is that bishops should be appointed by itself; the Holy See's position is that bishops can only be appointed by the Pope, while envisaging in some cases a form of consultation with the civil authorities.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 19 th century, the {{territorial}} presence of the French state administration has been embodied by the Prefect, heading an apparatus structured at the département level. However, the unity of that local government, personified by this high-ranking civil servant, is actually a legal fiction. In point of fact, the vertical integration of the French administration {{goes hand in hand with}} pronounced horizontal compartmentalization, the outcome of methodical, increasingly thorough segmentation of its action in the post-war decades, as its fields of intervention were extended. The state's territorial administration may in fact be seen as a complex whole comprised of executive branches, departments, agencies and agents, whose missions are a combination of authoritarian acts, checks on legality, political and economic regulation, production of public property and community service. This whole, peopled by the majority of government workers (with 966, 000 employees in 2007, not counting the huge Education department, or twenty times the central administration personnel) received little attention until recently from French political scientists, who viewed them as simple go-betweens in the downward transmission of national rules, uniformly applied to the entire French territory. This legalistic vision was demolished in the late sixties by sociologists from the Center for sociology of organizations led by Michel Crozier, who pointed up the interdependence between employees of the administration's local services, rooted in their territory, and local elected officials. The latter's action was entirely dependent on the resources controlled by the former, and in return, state bureaucrats needed the legitimacy afforded by the local elected officials so as to implement the policies entrusted to them and to maintain a degree of independence from their superiors. Until the 1982 - 83 decentralization laws, then, state field agencies played a pivotal role in political and social regulation by safeguarding a combination of the interests of the center and those of the periphery. The state's territorial administration, unsettled by those laws, had to adjust to the changed environment, and showed remarkable resiliency in doing so. The 1964 administrative reforms had structured it around regional administration services and broad département-level executive branches, and that structure had remained virtually unchanged for nearly a half-century. But, with the constant cuts in its resources (its authority, expertise, budgets, and so on), the mounting power of local authorities, the multiplication of participants in public action, and the development of new, complex public problems crossing the lines of administrative purviews, its role had changed substantially. These changes have deprived the Prefects and state field agencies of their central role in territorial governance. Nonetheless, deconcentrated administrative services have succeeded in holding their ground on the local scene by shifting to a dual function including the territorialization of national polices and the facilitating of local partnerships. This repositioning was made possible by the deconcentration policy implemented in 1992, which reinforced the autonomy of the state field agencies with respect to the central administration. Henceforth, rather than applying norms and rules defined disconnectedly, they could adjust them, systematically negotiating goals, types of action, and even the rules, with local actors, and above all with sub-national public authorities. Marginalized with respect to defining both the goals and the substance of public policies, the state's territorial administration has developed a new role, that of facilitator of cooperation between the numerous actors working in territorial communities, backed up by projects and contractual relations at that level, both of which replace the previous regime of implicit arrangements by explicit (if not to say open) negotiation between the prefects and local elected officials. At the same time, they have made for a degree of transverse integration of government policies around priorities as defined by local authorities. The organizational stability and functional lability previously characteristic of the state's territorial administration seem to be things of the past. Institutional reform in the 2000 s, with its more binding forms of inter-communal cooperation, more complete decentralization, budget reforms, and agencification, have accelerated the weakening of state's field agencies with respect to both local authorities and the central administration. This paved the way for a broad-based reform of these agencies, begun in 2008 with the Overall Revision of Public Policies (Révision générale des politiques publiques). This reform, motivated by the twofold objective of reducing public spending and reinforcing coordinated government action at the local level, reshapes the perimeter, organization and responsibilities of state's territorial administration. The respective missions of the regional and départemental levels are clearly defined, with priority given to the former, charged with steering government programs and managing deconcentrated budgets to do so. The powers of <b>regional</b> <b>prefects</b> are extended, particularly with respect to département prefects, now accountable to them. Last, a far-reaching program for merging state's field agencies has been implemented so as to structure the administration around eight regional poles and two or three directorates at the département level. These reforms are definite indication that the central reformers have won out. They are the people who have been trying to strengthen the regional level of the administration since 1964, but whose attempts have systematically met with resistance from both the prefectural corps and local elected officials. The current bolstering of the regional level, however noteworthy, is only relatively so, in relation to the département level formerly the basic echelon of territorial administration by the central government, and which has always been the most solidly structured, acting in collaboration with local actors to make government policies operational. This evolution unquestionably marks a major change in the French political and administrative system, possibly even foreshadowing the gradual elimination of the département level. As opposed to the aftermaths of the 1982 - 83 decentralization laws, drastic cuts are now being made in the personnel and facilities of all département-level executive branches. In the deconcentrated Equipment services for instance, the number of workers, which had remained stable between 1984 and 2005, dropped by one third between 2007 and 2009. However, the declining local presence of the central administration does not imply a loss of influence on the policies conducted there. Despite the risk that the central administration will cease to be central to public management of territorial communities, there is also the possibility that these reforms may revivify its ability to orient local policy. Because département-level executive branches were better at upward transmission, setting the projects of local elected officials ahead of central priorities, than the reverse. Now rid of those cumbersome go-betweens, the state elites can govern from afar - that is, from Paris - by delegating responsibility for implementing its programs and achieving coherence to local elected officials while steering their action precisely through new tools of government such as competitive bidding, financial incitement and sanctions, completed by systems of indicators, reporting, benchmarking, and the encouragement of good practices, all the more efficient in that they no longer rest on hierarchy or negotiation, but on freely conforming autonomous actors. Depuis le début du XIXe siècle, la présence de l'Etat dans les territoires s'incarne dans la figure du Préfet, placé à la tête d'une administration structurée à l'échelle départementale. L'unité de l'Etat local, personnifiée par ce haut fonctionnaire, relève cependant de la fiction juridique. L'intégration verticale de l'administration française s'accompagne en effet d'un fort cloisonnement horizontal, résultant d'une segmentation historique de son organisation et de son action qui s'est approfondie dans les décennies d'après-guerre à mesure de l'extension de ses domaines d'intervention. L'Etat local est constitué d'un ensemble complexe de directions, de services, d'agences et d'agents, dont les missions combinent des actes régaliens, de contrôle de légalité, de régulation politique ou économique, de production de biens publics et de prestations de services. Réunissant le gros des troupes étatiques (966 000 agents hors Education en 2007, soit vingt fois plus que les effectifs des administrations centrales), ces services chargés de mettre en œuvre des politiques publiques décidées à l'échelon central ont longtemps été au cœur du modèle républicain d'administration du territoire. Les lois de décentralisation de 1982 - 83 ont marqué la fin de ce modèle. Bien que fortement affaibli par les transferts opérés vers les collectivités (communes, départements, régions) et la disparition de la tutelle qu'il exerçait sur ces dernières, l'Etat local est parvenu à conserver un rôle important, sinon prééminent, dans la gestion publique des territoires au cours des décennies 1980 et 1990. L'Acte II de la décentralisation et les réformes néomanagériales du début des années 2000 ont fortement accéléré le mouvement de déclin amorcé vingt ans plus tôt. L'administration territoriale de l'Etat, dont l'organisation était restée pratiquement inchangée depuis les réformes administratives de 1964, est désormais engagée dans une vaste opération de réorganisation, dont on voit mal comment elle pourrait inverser une tendance à la résidualisation des services déconcentrés...|$|R
