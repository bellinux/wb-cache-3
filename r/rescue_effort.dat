5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main <b>rescue</b> <b>effort.</b> Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir did {{not play}} a major role in the Lebanese Civil War; he {{confined}} himself primarily to strengthening the Lebanese National Movement, the PLO's main ally in the conflict. During the fall of the Tel al-Zaatar camp to the Lebanese Front, al-Wazir blamed himself for not organizing a <b>rescue</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between March and September 1939, {{the months}} leading up to the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Nicholas Winton, a 29-year-old Christian British stockbroker whose parents were of German Jewish descent, organised eight trains to transport mainly Jewish Czech and Slovak refugee children from Czechoslovakia to homes in Britain. The Winton trains were part of a wider British <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> from various other countries across Europe, known as the Kindertransports.|$|E
50|$|Many {{non-governmental}} organizations, including international, {{religious and}} regionally-based NGOs, immediately pledged {{support in the}} aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. NGOs contributed significantly to both on-the-ground <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> and external solicitation of aid for those <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Red Cross led <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> to find people. Twelve {{people were}} saved with only minor injuries. The {{first day of}} <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> were slowed {{by the fact that}} no heavy {{equipment}} had been assigned for cleaning refuse and looking for bodies.|$|R
50|$|One Australian Police Officer, Constable Jeff Brown, was {{six months}} later awarded the British Empire Medal for Gallantry for <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> during the event. Four Australian Police Officers were later awarded the Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct for <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> during the event.|$|R
5|$|Gurnard rose to periscope depth {{two hours}} later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and {{equipment}} from the torpedoed transports was under way. That night, the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still afloat. Gurnards attack sank transports Aden Maru (5,825 tons) and Taijima Maru (6,995 tons) {{as well as the}} cargo ship Tenshinzan Marau (6,886 tons). While the <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During {{the first days of}} the search, the Aruban {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the <b>rescue</b> <b>effort.</b> Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> {{were carried}} out by the Home Front Command's Search & Rescue Unit and the Yachtza reserve unit. <b>Rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> {{commenced}} immediately after the collapse and continued until 4pm on Saturday May 26, 2001. Three people were pulled from the rubble alive and 23 bodies were removed.|$|R

The value of rescuing scientific data is described and some examples of data <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> by the Earth science community are reviewed. Data rescue issues and scientific data centers are described along with data <b>rescue</b> <b>efforts</b> of the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC).

5|$|Although the {{reinforcement}} {{effort to}} Guadalcanal was delayed, the Japanese {{did not give}} up trying to complete the original mission, albeit a day later than originally planned. On the afternoon of 13 November, Tanaka and the 11transports resumed their journey toward Guadalcanal. A Japanese force of cruisers and destroyers from the 8th Fleet (based primarily at Rabaul and originally assigned to cover the unloading of the transports {{on the evening of}} 13 November) was given the mission that Abe's force had failed to carry outâ€”the bombardment of Henderson Field. The battleship Kirishima, after abandoning its <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> of Hiei on the morning of 13 November, steamed north between Santa Isabel and Malaita Islands with her accompanying warships to rendezvous with Kondo's Second Fleet, inbound from Truk, to form the new bombardment unit.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> was initiated.|$|E
5|$|General Lucius Fairchild, the United States consul at Liverpool, {{wrote to}} his {{government}} recommending that the gallantry of the Englishmen {{who were involved in}} the <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> be recognised. The Secretary of State supported his recommendation and the United States Congress moved to award the newly instituted Lifesaving Medal to the lifeboat men. However, a delay of 17 months followed during which a change in legislation had to be enacted to allow the medals to be issued to non-US nationals. Finally in 1877, the United States government awarded first-class Gold Lifesaving Medals to the twenty-seven men of the Mersey Docks and New Brighton RNLI lifeboat station who survived the incident, while the families of the three deceased lifeboat men were awarded a sum of $200.00 in gold in lieu of a medal. The medals were conferred in a public ceremony in Liverpool Town Hall on 27 February 1877.|$|E

5|$|On 25 February the PAVN deluged {{the base}} with {{artillery}} fire and then launched a conventional armored/infantry assault. Smoke, dust and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above 4,000 feet to avoid anti-aircraft fire. When a U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom jet {{was shot down}} in the area, the FAC left {{the area of the}} battle to direct a <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base. PAVN troops and tanks then overran the position, capturing the ARVN brigade commander in the process. FSB 31 was secured by the PAVN at an estimated cost of 250 killed, and 11 PT-76 and T-54 tanks destroyed. The Airborne had suffered 155 killed and over 100 captured.|$|E
5|$|On Rubicun III, the Edo {{explain to}} Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Worf that capital {{punishment}} {{is used to}} enforce their laws. The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to discover he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing catch with the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a lethal injection for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo interpret this stance as an attempt by the Federation to push their superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> for the boy. He says he cannot, quoting the Prime Directive.|$|E
5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed {{plans for a}} better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth <b>rescue</b> <b>effort.</b> Because of the crowded streets, {{and the number of}} response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E

5|$|When the Corregidor {{entered the}} minefield, {{there was a}} large {{explosion}} on the starboard side of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly that {{there was no time for}} large-scale panic to set in. Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the <b>rescue</b> <b>effort.</b> Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (PT-32, PT-34 and PT-35) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Although Curtis was {{personally}} opposed to British possession of Gibraltar, he took command of a marine unit during the siege, {{and in the}} attack by Spanish gunboats and floating batteries in September 1782, Curtis took his men into the harbour in small boats to engage the enemy. During this operation, Curtis witnessed {{the destruction of the}} batteries by British fireships and was able to rescue hundreds of burnt and drowning Spanish sailors from the water. This <b>rescue</b> <b>effort</b> was carried out in close proximity to the enemy force and in constant danger from the detonation of burning Spanish ships, which showered his overcrowded boats with debris and caused several casualties amongst his crews. When Lord Howe relieved the siege, he brought the much-celebrated Curtis back to Britain, where he was knighted for his service and became a society figure, featuring in many newspaper prints. He came under attack however from Lieutenant Campbell, who published a pamphlet accusing him of indecision and a lack of nerve during his time in Brilliant.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, a pro-Palestinian Lebanese MP, Maarouf Saad, {{was shot}} and killed, {{reportedly}} by the Lebanese Army. His death, from his wounds, the following month, and the massacre in April of that year of 27 Palestinians and Lebanese travelling on a bus from Sabra and Shatila to the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp by Phalangist forces, precipitated the Lebanese Civil War. Arafat was reluctant to respond with force, but many other Fatah and PLO members felt otherwise. For example, the DFLP carried out several attacks against the Lebanese Army. In 1976, an alliance of Christian militias {{with the backing of}} the Lebanese and Syrian armies besieged Tel al-Zaatar camp in east Beirut. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist stronghold where they massacred 684 people and wounded many more. The Tel al-Zaatar camp fell to the Christians after a six-month siege in which thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed. Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a <b>rescue</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
