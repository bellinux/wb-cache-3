40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the effect of audit partner tenure (PARTEN) on client managers' {{accounting}} discretion. Design/methodology/approach – The authors contend that, when a new audit partner is from the same audit firm as the outgoing audit partner (audit partner rotation), audit quality increases because the new audit partner brings “fresh eyes” to the engagement. Findings – The results confirm this conjecture. The authors find that, in the initial years of tenure of a new audit partner, client managers' accounting discretion decreases when the new partner is from the same audit firm as the outgoing partner. However, when the new audit partner is from a different audit firm as the outgoing partner (audit firm rotation), it is found that client managers' accounting discretion increases in those initial years. Originality/value – The results provide support for recent legislation in the US <b>restricting</b> <b>audit</b> PARTEN and should be of interest to other regulatory bodies contemplating mandatory audit partner rotation. 26 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{organizations}} (e. g., hospitals, social networks, gov-ernment agencies) {{rely heavily}} on audit to detect and punish insiders who inappropriately access and disclose confidential information. Recent work on audit games models the strate-gic interaction between an auditor with a single audit resource and auditees as a Stackelberg game, augmenting associated well-studied security games with a configurable punishment parameter. We significantly generalize this audit game model to account for multiple audit resources where each resource is <b>restricted</b> to <b>audit</b> a subset of all potential violations, thus en-abling application to practical auditing scenarios. We provide an FPTAS that computes an approximately optimal solution to the resulting non-convex optimization problem. The main technical novelty is {{in the design and}} correctness proof of an optimization transformation that enables the construction of this FPTAS. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that this transformation significantly speeds up computation of solutions for a class of audit games and security games. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{quantitative and}} qualitative evidence from Southeast Asia to the literature on earnings management and audit quality. The association between earnings management and audit quality is investigated primarily by a new measure of audit quality and a new probit model. The new probit model tests {{the degree to which}} audit firms can be tolerant of earnings management at different levels of the artificial audit materiality. The tests of the probit model cover time-series data from 1992 to 2011 for 2, 148 listed companies in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand with a total of 20, 757 firm-year observations. To extend the results of the probit model and to explore the stakeholders of audits’ perspectives on earnings management and audit quality, 16 semi-structured interviews with respondents from the audit firms, the listed companies, the regulators and the academic institute in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore are also conducted. This thesis finds that the term earnings management is seen differently from its extant definition. In addition, this thesis provides evidence that the different roles in the process of an audit lead to different definitions and measures of audit quality; therefore, audit quality remains an imprecise measure. The evidence of this thesis also indicates that in the context of Southeast Asia, big firms have higher quality audits than non-big firms. This is likely to be because big firms are more concerned with their reputation and the serious consequences of an audit failure and big firms are perceived to have more resources. This thesis also explores whether long audit tenure impacts audit quality. The evidence on this suggests that audit partner rotation rather than audit firm rotation is being appointed by key stakeholders. Moreover, there is evidence that in comparison to audit firms from Singapore, those from Malaysia are more tolerant of earnings management whilst those from Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand are less so. This thesis goes on to explore the possible impact of some national level factors such as the number of registrant audit firms, the use of non-English standards, corporate governance and type of legal system. From the probit model tests, it was found that non-English accounting standards and a limited number of registrant audit firms did not <b>restrict</b> <b>audit</b> quality, as perceived by some key stakeholders of audits. ...|$|R

Also, if the metadata {{is part of the}} same database as the data itself, this ensures that it will be backed up at least as frequently as the data itself, {{so that it can be}} recovered to a point in time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: System {{and process}} {{auditors}} assure – from an information processing perspective – the correctness {{and integrity of}} the data that is aggregated in a company’s financial statements. To do so, they assess whether a company’s business processes and information systems process financial data correctly. The audit process is a complex endeavor that in practice has to rely on simplifying assumptions. These simplifying assumptions mainly result from the need to <b>restrict</b> the <b>audit</b> scope and to focus it on the major risks. This article describes a generalized audit process. According to our experience with this process, {{there is a risk}} that material deficiencies remain undiscovered when said simplifying assumptions are not satisfied. To address this risk of deficiencies, the article compiles thirteen control patterns, which – according to our experience – are particularly suited to help information systems satisfy the simplifying assumptions. As such, use of these proven control patterns makes information systems easier to audit and IT architects can use them to build systems that meet audit requirements by design. Additionally, the practices and advice offered in this interdisciplinary article help bridge the gap between the architects and auditors of information systems and show either role how to benefit from an understanding of the other role’s terminology, techniques, and general work approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{burden of}} {{antimicrobial}} resistance worldwide is substantial {{and is likely}} to grow. Many factors {{play a role in the}} emergence of resistance. These resistance mechanisms may be encoded on transferable genes, which facilitate the spread of resistance between bacterial strains of the same and/or different species. Other resistance mechanisms may be due to alterations in the chromosomal DNA which enables the bacteria to withstand the environment and multiply. Many, if not most, of the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries do not have clear guidelines for antimicrobial use, and lack policies for <b>restricting</b> and <b>auditing</b> antimicrobial prescriptions. Objective The aim of this study is to review the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in GCC countries and explore the reasons for antibiotic resistance in the region. Methodology The PubMed database was searched using the following key words: antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic stewardship, prevalence, epidemiology, mechanism of resistance, and GCC country (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and United Arab Emirates). Results From January 1990 through April 2011, there were 45 articles published reviewing antibiotic resistance in the GCC countries. Among all the GCC countries, 37, 295 bacterial isolates were studied for antimicrobial resistance. The most prevalent microorganism was Escherichia coli (10, 073 / 44 %), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4, 709 / 20 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4, 287 / 18. 7 %), MRSA (1, 216 / 5. 4 %), Acinetobacter (1, 061 / 5 %), with C. difficile and Enterococcus representing less than 1 %. Conclusion In the last 2 decades, E. coli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most prevalent reported microorganisms by GCC countries with resistance data. </p...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{organizations}} (e. g., hospitals, banks, social networks, search engines) hold {{large volumes}} of personal information, and rely heavily on auditing for enforcement of privacy policies. These audit mechanisms combine automated methods with human input to detect and punish violators. Since human audit resources are limited, and often not sufficient to investigate all potential violations, current state-of-the -art audit tools provide heuristics to guide human effort. However, numerous reports of privacy breaches caused by malicious insiders bring to question {{the effectiveness of these}} audit mechanisms. Our thesis is that effective audit resource allocation and punishment levels can be efficiently computed by modeling the audit process as a game between a rational auditor and a rational or worst-case auditee. We present several results in support of the thesis. In the worst-case adversary setting, we design a game model taking into account organizational cost of auditing and loss from violations. We propose the notion of low regret as a desired audit property and provide a regret minimizing audit algorithm that outputs an optimal audit resource allocation strategy. The algorithm improves upon prior regret bounds in the partial information setting. In the rational adversary setting, we enable punishments by the auditor, and model the adversary 2 ̆ 7 s utility as a trade-off between the benefit from violations and loss due to punishment when detected. Our Stackelberg game model generalizes an existing deployed security game model with punishment parameters. It applies to natural auditing settings with multiple auditors where each auditor is <b>restricted</b> to <b>audit</b> a subset of the potential violations. We provide novel polynomial time algorithms to approximate the non-convex optimization problem used to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium. The algorithms output optimal audit resource allocation strategy and punishment levels. We also provide a method to reduce the optimization problem size, achieving up to 5 x speedup for realistic instances of the audit problem, and for the related security game instances...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} students' perceptions of work-based training and examination-based learning as it relates to the professional competence of auditors. The paper takes as its motivation the fall in the number of accountants registering as qualified auditors in the UK following fundamental changes in the audit environment. Legislation aimed at reducing red tape has resulted in a large number of UK companies taking advantage of an audit exemption, and most of these are clients of small audit firms. This legislative change has had significant pedagogic implications on the experiential learning of audit trainees and the availability of training opportunities for them. The contribution of the paper is to explain the perceived relevance and importance of training opportunities to trainees seeking to obtain audit qualifications. Using data from an on-line questionnaire and focus groups, the study reports that trainees in smaller firms lack opportunities to obtain sufficient audit experience, and there is a lack of synchronization between limited practical experience and classroom tuition provided before taking auditing examinations. The implications are that effective audit training will become <b>restricted</b> to large <b>audit</b> firms the trainees in which often choose different career paths to auditing, thereby limiting the number of qualified auditors in the UK in the future.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{empirical}} association between expected and unexpected audit fees and reported earnings quality for a sample of Big 4 (5) client companies over a period from 2000 to 2005. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a cross-sectional multiple regression model for a sample of 1, 142 firms (6, 852 firm-years) covering a time period of six years comprising 2000 to 2005 to evaluate the relationship between both expected and unexpected audit fees and performance-adjusted discretionary accruals that are estimated from the extended version of the modified Jones model. Findings – The paper finds that both expected and unexpected audit fees are associated with an increase in earnings quality, as indicated by the reduction of both absolute and signed discretionary accrual adjustments. Furthermore, in some analyses these associations are found to persist into the post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) period. The main results hold in sensitivity tests that involve using both the absolute and signed unexpected audit fees as independent variables and in tests that use both the absolute and signed current accruals as dependent variables of interest. Research limitations/implications – The results suggest that audit efforts consistent with client-specific business attributes and reflected in expected audit fees mitigate financial reporting biases, the effect of which is incrementally observable to some extent in the post-SOX period as well. Unexpected audit fees, a proxy for fee surprise arising out of auditor-client-specific contractual situations, are also associated with an increase in earnings quality. The association is, in some analyses, significant for the post-SOX years. The test results do not exhibit any evidence of auditor independence problems associated with high expected and unexpected audit fees; a result that supports the “reputation protection” argument for auditors' reporting decisions. Originality/value – In a time period surrounding the introduction of SOX when nonaudit consulting services have severely been <b>restricted,</b> and the <b>audit</b> fee growth for publicly traded companies have been dramatic, an analysis of this nature potentially produces valuable insights into the auditors' fee decision, audit efforts, and auditor independence issue. The study looks into a new perspective concerning the relationship between audit fees and financial reporting practice over the two regulatory regimes, pre- and post-SOX.

40|$|Hazard auditing, {{which is}} a formal, systematic, {{critical}} examination of a situation or set of circumstances to identify hazards, is fundamental to hazard management. Auditing is facilitated by "an audit" that details activities, procedures, systems and artefacts, where hazards might be identified. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} structure, {{in the form of a}} hierarchy, that can be used in the design of hazard audits. An examination of systems such as manufacturing and process plants, for hazards, is usually undertaken by examining the subsystems, (i. e. activities, systems, and procedures). Existing audits therefore, tend to be specific, as for example, audits of unsafe acts, unsafe conditions, technical functioning of materials and machinery, management. This type of <b>audit</b> <b>restricts</b> the examination to a closed system within observable and well described physical and organisational boundaries. It is argued in this thesis that examinations for hazards should go beyond this closed system and also look for hazards within the larger systems of society and industry. An examination of hazards can be seen as a search for evidence of proneness to failure. The hierarchy developed in this research focuses on hazard auditing for a construction project. Construction, {{which is a}}ssociated with the construction industry, is only one phase in a larger system, the project, which encompasses development, use, and withdrawal from use. It is argued that evidence of proneness to failure of a construction project may be found in these systems, (project and industry), in the larger system of a social environment, and in the subsystems that are part of a construction project. These hazards are described in terms cf concepts, and presented in the form of a hierarchy that indicates inter-dependencies between concepts. This hierarchy is a basic structure to be used in the design of hazard audits. The concepts incorporated into the hierarchy are discussed and described in terms of their potential to provide evidence of proneness to failure. Sections of hierarchy are built up and presented at appropriate positions in the thesis. It is proposed that this approach to hazard auditing will allow for flexibility in dealing with specific situations, yet provide for the identification of hazards that can exist and develop outside of those situations. It is suggested that such an approach should be regarded as a specialist activity of hazard management. Further, it is argued that the activity of hazard engineering should be recognized as a separate discipline within its own right...|$|R
