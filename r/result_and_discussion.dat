40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use and {{discourse}} functions of context frame markers in the <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section of research articles across four disciplines. Sixteen <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> sections from four disciplines, namely, English Language Teaching, Economics, Biology, and Civil Engineering (four from each discipline) were analysed by adapting Gosden’s (1992) taxonomy. Findings showed disciplinary differences {{in relation to the}} realisation of the context frame types, frequencies, and associated discourse functions. These differences in terms of types, frequencies, and discourse functions of context frames are imposed {{by the nature of the}} rhetorical section of <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion,</b> the nature of the discipline, and both the nature of rhetorical section of <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> and the discipline, respectively. Findings suggest that context frames are an important means which the writer uses to deliver claims and arguments in results and discussion.

40|$|<b>Result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> {{sections}} play {{an important}} role in theses as one of the research reports. Writing <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section is often bothersome for some writers, it also holds true for the undergraduate students as novice writers. This study aimed to investigate the rhetorical moves of <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section of theses together with the lexical expressions that are written by the undergradu ate students. An understanding of rhetorical moves used by the undergraduate students in writing their <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section is hoped can give input for academic writing’s instructor to improve students’ writing ability in the future, particularly in writing the <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> sections of theses. The research method is descriptive qualitative study with discourse analysis method to identify the moves. Seven undergraduate theses of experimental studies were selected as subject of the research. The <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section then were analyzed based on the result model proposed by Paltridge & Starfield (2007) for result section and discussion model proposed by Dudley - Evans (1994) for discussion section. Some samples of proposition of result a nd discussion section were also used to identify the lexical expressions in the <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section. Then, the rhetorical moves were rated by the writer and two other raters for triangulation. The results showed that there are no linear rhetorica l moves emerging in the result section. At the same time, it was found that there is cyclical structure that mostly arises from the part or stages of investigation of experimental research. Whereas in the discussion sections there are also no linear rhetor ical moves found. Moreover, one unanticipated finding showed that not all discussion sections under study have cyclical structure. Only three discussion sections have cyclical structure and only one of them employed key cycle as mentioned by Dudley - Evans (1994). For the lexical expression, it was found that in the result sections the lexical expressions are more obvious in showing the function of the moves. Therefore the moves in result section are easily identified by its lexical expressions. While in the discussion section the lexical expressions are less obvious therefore in order to identify the moves the researcher used comprehension of the text. In conclusion, the rhetorical moves of <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section of theses written by the English depar tment undergraduate students of UNESA, did not follow the model proposed by Paltdrige & Starfiled (2007) for result section and Dudley - Evans (1994) for discussion section, since the rhetorical moves were not ordered like the order of each model. Accordingl y, based on the present result, it is necessary for the academic writing instructors or teachers to provide clear instructional strategies and exercises to improve the undergraduate students ability in writing their <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section...|$|E
