Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated monopolies such as electric utilities from while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries—trucking and, later, airlines—successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called <b>regulatory</b> <b>capture.</b>|$|E

It is argued that policy instruments cannot be selected only, or even primarily, on the basis of their formal properties, for these allow a number of different, often conflicting institutional realizations. The crucial choices involve not the instruments themselves, but institutionally determined ways of operating them. But to discuss institutional choice adequately, the usual model in which people pursue their self-interest within exogenously determined rules must be extended to cover the determination of the rules themselves.

40|$|Abstract: Gene <b>regulatory</b> {{networks}} <b>capture</b> {{interactions between}} genes and other cell substances, {{resulting in various}} models for the fundamental biological process of transcription and translation. The expression levels of the genes are typically measured as mRNA concentration in micro-array experiments. In a so-called genetic perturbation experiment, small perturbations are applied to equilibrium states and the resulting changes in expression activity are measured. One {{of the most important}} problems in systems biology is to use these data to identify the interaction pattern between genes in a regulatory network, especially in a large scale network. The authors develop a novel algorithm for identifying the smallest genetic network that explains genetic perturbation experimental data. By construction, our identification algorithm is able to incorporate and respect a priori knowledge known about the network structure. A priori biological knowledge is typically qualitative, encoding whether one gene affects another gene or not, or whether the effect is positive or negative. The method is based on a convex programming relaxation of the combinatorially hard problem of L 0 minimisation. The authors apply the proposed method to the identification of a subnetwork of the SOS pathway in Escherichia coli, the segmentation polarity network in Drosophila melanogaster, and an artificial network for measuring the performance of the method. ...|$|R

The European Union has a clearly articulated strategy through which to pursue what it sees as its interests in Central Asia {{and the development of a}} range of EU–Central Asia education initiatives has been given a role within this over‐arching strategy.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a model of}} the policy making process and applies it to the issue of <b>regulatory</b> agency <b>capture.</b> The model allows the possibility of substantial influence of unorganized, nonproducer groups. It shows that under certain circumstances an agency will provide benefits for these groups as long as they continue to participate electorally on the issue (i. e., as long as the regulatory issue remains a component of voters' decisions between candidates). The model is called the political cycles model because of the following two conclusions. Based on a comparative static result, it shows that if the mass group no longer generates electoral rewards, producers will dominate agency policy making. The second conclusion is that the process may work in reverse; a captured agency may be revitalized when a mass group begins to generate rewards on this issue. Following the theoretical presentation, Part III tests the political cycles model against alternative conceptions of agency capture, (the cartel-by-design and the life cycle hypothesis). The models make different predictions about Congressional appropriations behavior under specified circumstances. Budgetary patterns for several agencies are observed to determine which model most adequately explains the observations. The results, though tentative, reveal the influence of nonproducer groups in a manner which rules out both the life cycle and the cartel-by-design models while supporting the model presented here. ...|$|R
