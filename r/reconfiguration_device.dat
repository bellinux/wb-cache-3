40|$|Optical pulse shaping {{has been}} {{a useful tool for}} {{creating}} user defined optical waveforms for various applications. However, pulse shaping is often limited by fixed masks or the slow switching speeds of commonly used opto-electronic modulators used as spatial profiles within these experiments. These masks and modulators assist in performing the transformation of a short optical pulse into a desired waveform, but their properties do not change between input pulses when a high repetition rate input source is used. The ability to rapidly reconfigure the spatial profile within the pulse shaper would allow the possibility of shaping to occur on an input pulse-by-pulse basis. For our solution, we turn to the asymmetric Fabry-Perot quantum well modulator for its high-speed functionality and optical bandwidth capabilities. An array of such devices could provide a quickly changing spatial profile that would enable rapid <b>reconfiguration.</b> <b>Device</b> design, fabrication, and testing will be addressed along with pulse shaping experiments and results. ...|$|E

The square cells {{specified}} by Ruby language, called Ruby cells, can be relocated by either rotation, horizontal flip, vertical flip or shifting {{in a regular}} array structure such as FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) or Cell Matrix�. In this paper, the behaviours of those relocations have been shown at two different levels, namely architectural level and logic level. In other words, the behavioural views describe {{the function of the}} configuration relocation of the target circuits regardless of its implementation. Under the behavioural view of configuration relocation at architectural level, the cell relocations can be specified and reasoned formally by algebraic laws of Ruby algebra and Group theory to create an abstract description of the configuration relocations of the target circuit without reference to particular elements within the <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>device.</b> Under the behavioural view of configuration relocation at logic level, the above abstract description considered as a Partial Order-based Model (POM) and its dependencies are given by the transition relation and this is our approach to synthesise the algorithm for reconfiguration micro-controller automatically the information formalised in the high-level specification languages...|$|E

The STP-H 5 /ISEM (STP-Houston 5, ISS SpaceCube Experiment Mini) payload is scheduled for launch on the upcoming SpaceX 10 mission and will feature new technologies, including a hybrid space computer developed by the NSF CHREC Center, working closely with the NASA SpaceCube Team, known as the CHREC Space Processor (CSP).

Reconfiguring the logic is still an expensive operation and precludes frequent configuration changes.

Reconfigurable computing solutions are typically designed by composing lower level modules or library components.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the conception, {{design and implementation}} of new topologies of multimodal microwave resonators and filters, {{using a combination of}} uniplanar technologies such as coplanar waveguide (CPW), coplanar strips (CPS) and slotlines. The term "multimodal" refers to uniplanar circuits in which the two fundamental modes of the CPW propagate (the even and the odd mode). By using both modes of the CPW, it is possible to achieve added functions, such as additional transmission zeros to increase the rejection, or to attenuate harmonic frequencies to improve the out-of-band rejection. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by using multimodal circuits, it is possible to reduce the length of of a conventional filter up to 80 %. In addition to bandpass filters, new topologies of compact band-stop filters are developed. The proposed band-stop filters make use of slow-wave resonators to decrease the total area of the filters and achieve compact topologies. This work also addresses the development of synthesis techniques for each multimodal filter. The design equations were obtained from generalized multimodal circuits available in the literature, which have been adapted for each particular case and modeled as basic filter components, such as immitance inverters or lumped elements. By using the proposed synthesis equations, it is possible to design filters with a desired response and relative bandwidth. The use of the proposed synthesis enables a fast analysis and design of multimodal filters using circuit simulators. As an added feature, several reconfigurable and tunable filter topologies were demonstrated, using active devices (PIN diodes and varactors) or RF-MEMS. These new topologies demonstrate the flexibility of multimodal circuits. For the RF-MEMS-based tunable filters, different capacitive and ohmic switches were designed, fabricated and measured. As an example of the additional degrees of freedom using of RF-MEMS and multimodal CPW circuits, a reconfigurable filter using RF-MEMS switchable air-bridges as a <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>device</b> has been demonstrated in this work for the first time...|$|E

The platform module defines the robotic platforms and actuation methods.
