The Center of Disaster Reduction of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has cooperated with the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at the University of Maryland in the US in studying heavy <b>rains</b> <b>and</b> typhoons for over 7 years.

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav passed just {{to the east of}} Cape Hatteras, areas of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia {{experienced}} heavy <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> tropical storm force winds.
