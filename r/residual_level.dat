The steroid concentrations varied substantially in soils, ranging from below the detection limit to 109. 7 mu g. kg(- 1). Three steroids progesterone, androstendione and estrone were found to have relatively high residue concentrations in soil, with maximum concentrations of 109. 7, 9. 83 and 1330 mu g. kg(- 1), respectively.

40|$|Abstract]: Toowoomba Regional Council (TRC) {{maintains}} a distribution {{network in the}} city of Toowoomba that provides drinking quality water to over 90, 000 people. The quality of water throughout this network must be maintained to high standards according to TRC’s water guidelines. Adhering to these guidelines minimises the risk of harmful waterborne pathogens and microbial contamination within the water distribution network. Water quality monitoring is an everyday task of the TRC ground staff. Manual tests at set locations within each pressure zone are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that water quality is at an adequate standard. TRC have identified that the testing data obtained from these manual tests only give an indication of the chlorine <b>residual</b> <b>levels</b> at one location at one point in time. The only feasible method to analyse chlorine residual throughout an entire network is to construct a hydraulic model which enables chlorine residuals to be modelled at every point within the distribution system at all times of the day. The {{purpose of this study was}} to construct a hydraulic model that was able to identify low and high chlorine <b>residual</b> <b>levels</b> within the Platz pressure zone and the Trunk mains system based on the hydraulic behaviour of both areas. Options to rectify the problem areas that were identified were recommended to keep chlorine <b>residual</b> <b>levels</b> within the guidelines specified by TRC. “Pipes++”, developed by Watercom Pty. Ltd. (1990 - 2001), was the chosen hydraulic modelling software for this study. TRC’s Hydraulic Network Models for Platz pressure zone and the Trunk mains system were last updated in November 2000 and April 2001 respectively. The models required revision to incorporate more recent changes within the distribution network. In attempt to calibrate the models, field data were extracted from SCADA data and pressure loggers within the Platz and Trunk main systems.
