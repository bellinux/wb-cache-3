50|$|Bronze {{items are}} {{typically}} cast, not forged. Secondary operations involve removing {{material from the}} <b>rough</b> <b>casting,</b> polishing, {{and the application of}} decorative elements. Some Chinese swords used high-tin bronze for the edges, since it is harder, and keeps a sharp edge longer, but is more brittle than the softer, lower-tin alloy used for the blade's core. Bronze alloys with lower tin content are tougher, or more resistant to fracturing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the forging}} process, the <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> {{is placed in}} a die set while it is still hot and semi-solid. A {{hydraulic}} press is used to place the rough slug under tremendous pressure. This removes any possible porosity, and also pushes the alloy grains together tighter than {{can be achieved by}} simple casting alone. The end result is a much stronger material. Hypereutectic pistons can be forged, but typically are only cast, because the extra expense of forging is not justified when cast pistons are considered strong enough for stock applications.|$|E
50|$|After casting, the cores {{are broken}} up by rods or shot and {{removed from the}} casting. The metal from the sprue and risers is cut from the <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b> Various heat {{treatments}} may be applied to relieve stresses from the initial cooling and to add hardness - {{in the case of}} steel or iron, by quenching in water or oil. The casting may be further strengthened by surface compression treatment - like shot peening - that adds resistance to tensile cracking and smooths the rough surface. And when high precision is required, various machining operations (such as milling or boring) are made to finish critical areas of the casting. Examples of this would include the boring of cylinders and milling of the deck on a cast engine block.|$|E

50|$|Stewart {{followed}} his father William Spiers into the cabinet-making trade in Ayr, {{and when his}} father died in 1844 he apparently took over the workshop in River Street. He was later to claim 1840 as the year his plane-making firm began. How Stewart came to be a plane-maker was, according to the Ayrshire Post, purely by accident, however. He {{is said to have}} bought a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> in Edinburgh for 1/6, finished it at home and sold it to a local cabinet-maker for 18/-. This supposedly was the beginning of what soon became a successful operation in which he was selling his planes in Glasgow and Edinburgh and as far afield as North America, yet this was still little more than a sideline to his cabinet-making. Only much later did he become a full-time plane maker.|$|E
50|$|With a {{completed}} mold {{at the appropriate}} moisture content, the box containing the sand mold is then positioned for filling with molten metal - typically iron, steel, bronze, brass, aluminium, magnesium alloys, or various pot metal alloys, which often include lead, tin, and zinc. After being filled with liquid metal the box is set aside until the metal is sufficiently cool to be strong. The sand is then removed, revealing a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> that, {{in the case of}} iron or steel, may still be glowing red. In the case of metals that are significantly heavier than the casting sand, such as iron or lead, the casting flask is often covered with a heavy plate to prevent a problem known as floating the mold. Floating the mold occurs when the pressure of the metal pushes the sand above the mold cavity out of shape, causing the casting to fail.|$|E
50|$|Wood {{craftsmen}} {{begin by}} making {{a model of the}} desired metal object from hardwood, using lathes, saws, and planes, which were all powered by the Knight Wheels. The model, called a pattern, is then placed in a casting flask, in its simplest form a topless and bottomless box split in half around its perimeter. The flask is placed on a board and a sand mixture (containing seacoal, bentonite clay, and pitch) poured and rammed around the pattern. The additives harden and stabilize the sand so that the flask can be split apart and the pattern removed leaving an exact impression or mold in the sand. The pattern can be reused almost indefinitely to create more molds in additional casting flasks. A channel or gate is left in the sand so that when the flask is rejoined, the ironworkers can pour the molten iron into it through the opening. When the iron has solidified the flask is broken apart, destroying the sand mold in the process, to reveal the <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study and theoretical analyses on the monotonic and fatigue performance in bending of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber-reinforced engineered cementitious composite (ECC) overlay system. The {{influence of the}} interfacial characteristics between overlay and old concrete substrate on the overall bending performance is investigated. The experimental results show that when ECC is used as overlay material, both load carrying capacity and deformability represented by deflection at peak load of the overlaid beams in flexure are significantly increased compared to those of plain concrete (PC) overlaid beams. The fatigue life of ECC overlaid beams in flexure is not influenced by the layer/base interfacial characteristics, such as smooth cutting surface or sand-blasted rough surface. However, the deformation ability of the overlaid beams, such as deflection at midpoint of beam, in both static and cyclic loading cases {{are influenced by the}} interfacial property. The smooth casting surface leads to larger deformation at peak load under monotonic loading and at failure under fatigue loading than the corresponding values for beams with a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> surface. The present study demonstrates that reflective cracking failure in pavement overlays can be eliminated by the use of a ductile material such as ECC. D 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This {{inspection}} cell {{consisted of}} an ultrasonic flaw detector, transducer, robot, immersion tank, computer, and software. Normal beam pulse-echo ultrasonic nondestructive testing, using the developed automated cell, {{was performed on}} 17 bosses on each <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b> Ultrasonic transducer selection, initial inspection criteria, and ultrasonic flow detector (UFD) setup parameters were developed for the gray iron castings used in this study. The software were developed {{for control of the}} robot and UFD in real time. The software performed two main tasks: emulating the manual operation of the UFD, and evaluating the ultrasonic signatures for detecting subsurface discontinuities. A random lot of 105 castings were tested; the 100 castings that passed were returned to the manufacturer for machining into finished parts and then inspection. The other 5 castings had one boss each with ultrasonic signatures consistent with subsurface discontinuities. The cell was successful in quantifying the ultrasonic echo signatures for the existence of signature characteristics consistent with Go/NoGo criteria developed from simulated defects. Manual inspection showed that no defects in the areas inspected by the automated cell avoided detection in the 100 castings machined into finished parts. Of the 5 bosses found to have subsurface discontinuities, two were verified by manual inspection. The cell correctly classified 1782 of the 1785 bosses (99. 832 %) inspected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The cam-shaft for the {{internal-combustion engine}} {{needs to be}} chilled at the foundry stage to rise the cam hardness, but {{unexpected}} chilled structures could occur on the sensor plate surface. If chilled structures exist on the sensor plate, a grinding tool may break when grinding sensor plate, or the specified shape {{may be unable to}} be produced due to resistance arising from the hyper-hardness of the chilled structures. For this reason, developing an inspection technique and a device for detecting unnecessary chilled structures before grinding the cam-shaft and for determining the rejection and removal of cam-shafts with chilled structures detected was necessary. This article reports on a recently developed nondestructive method using an eddy current test and X-rays to accurately detect chilled structures on a cam-shaft sensor plate. 1. Summary In the manufacturing process of a cam-shaft for the internal-combustion engine that primarily includes casting and machining, the cam tip’s structures are chilled locally to increase durability and resistance to abrasion with other areas that are de-chilled in order to raise machinability. When hard chilled structures are in areas other than a cam, they could exert harmful influence on the manufacturing line due to bite damage, etc. However, since the surface of a cam-shaft immediately after casting is covered with oxide scales (black scales), it is difficult to confirm chilled structures from appearance. In our research, we conducted a basic examination to develop an optimum evaluation system for the actual cam-shaft manufacturing line. As a result, we succeeded in developing a system that can detect structures with a nondestructive method, even on a cam-shaft covered with a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> surface. Our report follows below. 2. Nondestructive test using eddy curren...|$|E

40|$|En 2002, un {{ensemble}} d’objets métalliques a été découvert sur la plage de l’Amélie à Soulac-sur-Mer (Gironde), localité ayant déjà fourni de nombreux dépôts de l’Âge du bronze. Treize objets en alliages à base de cuivre sont attribués à l’époque du Bronze moyen. Si la hache à rebords est classique de la production médocaine, les autres objets (bracelets, épée, anneau) évoquent la culture des Duffaits. La présente contribution propose une étude technologique de l’ensemble des objets : lecture de la surface, examen de la microstructure par la métallographie et analyse élémentaire de la composition. Les résultats permettent une appréhension plus fine des chaînes opératoires de fabrication des haches à rebords et des bracelets massifs incisés. Ils mettent aussi en évidence la série de bracelets comme pouvant provenir d’un même atelier. Enfin, la présence d’objets finis spécifiques et d’un objet à l’état d’ébauche témoigne d’une production locale tout en posant la question des modalités de circulation des objets. This study concerns metallic objects discovered in 2002 on Amélie beach, Soulac-sur-Mer (Gironde; Aquitaine). Many Bronze Age hoards have previously {{been discovered in}} this area. This find contains thirteen copper base alloy artefacts : eight massive bracelets (three of which present line decoration), a flanged axe, a broken palstave axe, an ingot, a sword fragment and a ring. The flanged axe is typical of production in the Médoc region. The other objects (bracelets, sword and ring) suggest the Duffaits culture. The present contribution concerns a technological study of all the objects : surface observations, metallographic examinations and elementary composition analysis. Fourteen metallographic sections were made according to a specific protocol which, after preparation of the samples, allows the polished sections to be examined before they are etched with a ferric chloride solution. Composition analyses were obtained with an EDXS device associated with a scanning electron microscope. The results enable us to understand the chaînes opératoires used for making these types of flanged axe and massive bracelets. The sequence of the flanged axe shaping processes can be described, and certain gestures and tools clarified. An assembled mould (made with stone or terracotta) was used. After the stripping, a grinding operation, using abrasive materials, {{was applied to the}} whole object. Then an annealing and finally a fettling operation – which leaves the metal in a partially hardened state – were applied to the object. No other thermal or mechanical treatment occurred later. This state can be qualified as rough. The technological reading of the set of bracelets confirms their morphological homogeneity by that of the manufacturing processes. The concordance of similar parameters in shape, decoration and shaping techniques allows us to suppose that all the objects were produced in the same workshop. These bracelets were manufactured by a plastic deformation, with the coiling of a bar whose thickness and section shape were certainly conceived from the very moulding. In the very last operation, the decoration was obtained by plastic deformation, on metal softened by annealing. The use of a scriber is very possible. The presence of finished objects and of a <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> certifies that a local production existed in the area of Soulac-sur-Mer. This technological study allows us to discuss the question of the circulation of metallic objects. The case of the rough axe represents a stage in the chaîne opératoire. This would have been divided into two stages : moulding/ fusion and post-casting. A particular organization would have separated these two stages which would not then have been produced in continuity. We thus submit the hypothesis according to which several types of workshops could have existed, functioning on a «cascade » effect system. An important hierarchical organization of society would in that case be highlighted, with a strong power or authority importing the metallic raw material, centralizing it and, by doing so, being able to control a particular type of workshop making rough-standard axes : the Médoc type axes express rigorous morphometric rules.
