Here we show that <b>R</b> <b>loops,</b> RNA-DNA hybrids consisting of nascent transcripts hybridized to template DNA, modulate the binding of two key chromatin-regulatory complexes, Tip 60 -p 400 and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Like PRC 2, the Tip 60 -p 400 histone acetyltransferase complex binds to nascent transcripts; however, transcription promotes chromatin binding of Tip 60 -p 400 but not PRC 2. Interestingly, we observed higher Tip 60 -p 400 and lower PRC 2 levels at genes marked by promoter-proximal <b>R</b> <b>loops.</b> Furthermore, disruption of <b>R</b> <b>loops</b> broadly decreased Tip 60 -p 400 occupancy and increased PRC 2 occupancy genome wide.

Here we show that <b>R</b> <b>loops</b> are tightly linked to histone H 3 S 10 phosphorylation (H 3 S 10 P), a mark of chromatin condensation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -on-chip (ChIP-chip) analyses reveal H 3 S 10 P accumulation at centromeres, pericentromeric chromatin, {{and a large number}} of active open reading frames (ORFs) in R-loop-accumulating yeast cells, better observed in G 1. Histone H 3 S 10 {{plays a key role in}} maintaining genome stability, as scored by ectopic recombination and plasmid loss, Rad 52 foci, and Rad 53 checkpoint activation. H 3 S 10 P coincides with the presence of DNA-RNA hybrids, is suppressed by ribonuclease H overexpression, and causes reduced accessibility of restriction endonucleases, implying a tight connection between <b>R</b> <b>loops,</b> H 3 S 10 P, and chromatin compaction. Such histone modifications were also observed in R-loop-accumulating Caenorhabditis elegans and HeLa cells.

Analysis of DNA from ASF/SF 2 -depleted cells revealed that the nontemplate strand of a transcribed gene was single stranded due to formation of an RNA:DNA hybrid, <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> structure.

In plasmid DNA sequence excess, all the complementary RNA is driven into <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> structures that can be assayed by {{electron microscopy}}. To determine the concentration of a particular poly(A) + RNA, plasmid DNA crosslinked once every 2000 - 5000 base pairs with trioxsalen and UV light is hybridized in DNA sequence excess to various known amounts of total poly(A) + RNA, and the R loops are stabilized by treatment with glyoxal. If necessary, excess nonhybridized RNA is removed by Sepharose 2 B chromatography, which enables the visualization of less abundant transcripts. Reconstruction experiments demonstrated that electron microscopic determination of the fraction of plasmid DNA molecules containing specific RNA loops gives accurate values of specific RNA weight fractions or concentrations in the total poly(A) + RNA populations. These methods were also used to determine the concentrations of five RNA species complementary to sequences on TRT 3, a recombinant DNA plasmid containing yeast histone 2 A and 2 B genes and three other nonhistone genes.

The same relatively simple complex of T 4 replication proteins {{is responsible for}} both modes of DNA synthesis. Thus the mechanism for loading the T 4 41 helicase must be versatile enough {{to allow it to}} be loaded on R loops created by transcription at several origins, on D loops created by recombination, and on stalled replication forks. T 4 59 helicase-loading protein is a small, basic, almost completely α-helical protein whose N-terminal domain has structural similarity to high mobility group family proteins. In this paper we review recent evidence that 59 protein recognizes specific structures rather than specific sequences. It binds and loads the helicase on replication forks and on three- and four-stranded (Holliday junction) recombination structures, without sequence specificity. We summarize our experiments showing that purified T 4 enzymes catalyze complete unidirectional replication of a plasmid containing the T 4 ori(uvsY) origin, with a preformed <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> at the position of the <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> identified at this origin in vivo. This replication depends on the 41 helicase and is strongly stimulated by 59 protein. Moreover, the helicase-loading protein helps to coordinate leading and lagging strand synthesis by blocking replication on the ori(uvsY) <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> plasmid until the helicase is loaded. The T 4 enzymes also can replicate plasmids with R loops that do not have a T 4 origin sequence, but only if the R loops are within an easily unwound DNA sequence...|$|E
40|$|With {{this work}} I elucidated new and {{unexpected}} mechanisms of two strong and highly specific transcription inhibitors: Triptolide and Campthotecin. Triptolide (TPL) is a diterpene epoxide {{derived from the}} Chinese plant Trypterigium Wilfoordii Hook F. TPL inhibits the ATPase activity of XPB, a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH. In this thesis I found that degradation of Rbp 1 (the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II) caused by TPL treatments, is preceded by an hyperphosphorylation event at serine 5 of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Rbp 1. This event is concomitant with a block of RNA Polymerase II at promoters of active genes. The enzyme responsible for Ser 5 hyperphosphorylation event is CDK 7. Notably, CDK 7 downregulation rescued both Ser 5 hyperphosphorylation and Rbp 1 degradation triggered by TPL. Camptothecin (CPT), derived from the plant Camptotheca acuminata, specifically inhibits topoisomerase 1 (Top 1). We first found that CPT induced antisense transcription at divergent CpG islands promoter. Interestingly, by immunofluorescence experiments, CPT was found to induce a burst of <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> structures (DNA/RNA hybrids) at nucleoli and mitochondria. We then decided to investigate the role of Top 1 in <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> homeostasis through a short interfering RNA approach (RNAi). Using DNA/RNA immunoprecipitation techniques coupled to NGS I found that Top 1 depletion induces an increase of R loops at a genome-wide level. We found that such increase occurs on the entire gene body. At a subset of loci R loops resulted particularly stressed after Top 1 depletion: some of these genes showed the formation of new R loops structures, whereas other loci showed a reduction of R loops. Interestingly we found that new peaks usually appear at tandem or divergent genes in the entire gene body, while losses of <b>R</b> <b>loop</b> peaks {{seems to be a}} feature specific of 3 ’ end regions of convergent genes. ...|$|E

Several cis elements and trans factors involved in repeat instability (expansion and contraction) have been identified. However no comprehensive model explaining large intergenerational or somatic changes {{of the length of}} the repeating sequences exists. Several lines of evidence, accumulated from different model studies, indicate that transcription through repeat sequences is an important factor promoting their instability. The persistent interaction between transcription template DNA and nascent RNA (RNA•DNA hybrids, <b>R</b> <b>loops)</b> was shown to stimulate genomic instability. Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA. Additionally, we showed that cotranscriptional formation of RNA•DNA hybrids at CTG•CAG and GAA•TTC repeats stimulate instability of these sequences in both E. coli and human cells. Our results suggest that persistent RNA•DNA hybrids may also be responsible for other downstream effects of expanded trinucleotide repeats, including gene silencing. Considering the extent of transcription through the human genome as well as the abundance of GC-rich and/or non-canonical DNA structure forming tandem repeats, RNA•DNA hybrids may represent a common mutagenic conformation.
