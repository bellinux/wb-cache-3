The entire H gene was sequenced from two strains.

40|$|AbstractTime {{independent}} inelasticity {{is often}} modelled as due to plasticity and/or damage. The difference is manifested at reversed loading; plasticity reveals itself by a <b>remaining</b> <b>strain</b> in the unloaded state while damage is revealed by {{a decrease in}} the elastic stiffness during unloading. With thin adhesive layers, the deformation is inhomogeneously distributed along the layer. Large deformations occur at the ends of the layer. In the more central parts, the layer is virtually undeformed. This makes a direct measurement of the unloading properties virtually impossible. In the present paper, novel experiments are performed in order to evaluate the inelastic properties of epoxy adhesives. The load is first increased to a level corresponding to 50, 60, 70 or 80 % of the fracture energy. The load is then reversed. The first step creates a zone of inelastically deformed adhesive {{at the start of the}} layer. During a final loading phase, the properties of this zone are analysed. Major differences due to the loading direction are observed. Some comparisons with simulation models are performed...|$|E

Fifty-seven of 58 strains obtained from the skin of 70 patients who had erythema migrams or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans were of group VS 461, whereas the genotype of the <b>remaining</b> <b>strain</b> was unidentifiable. Of 10 strains cultured from CSF (n = 3) and skin (n = 7) of 20 patients with extracutaneous symptoms of Lyme borreliosis, nine were B. garinii and one was B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Of these 20 patients, 17 had neuroborreliosis, one had arthritis and carditis, one had myalgia, and one had erythema and arthralgia. All 26 isolates from ticks were of group VS 461. In conclusion, infections due to group VS 461 and B. garinii are associated with cutaneous and extracutaneous symptoms, respectively.

40|$|Magnetorheological {{elastomers}} (MREs) {{are composed}} of magnetizable particles (iron particles) and a soft rubber-like matrix. Their mechanical properties, including modulus and damping capability, can be controlled by an external magnetic field. The damping properties of MREs, which {{play an important role}} in applications, depend mainly on particle content. This paper aims to investigate MRE’s damping capabilities by studying two categories of cis-polybutadiene rubber-based MREs: isotropic and structured MREs. Both isotropic and structured MRE samples with various iron particle contents (60, 70, 80 and 85 wt%) were fabricated and their damping properties were measured by using a modified dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and a universal testing machine. The results show that the loss factor in the glass transition region decreases with the increment of iron particle content. The loss factors of structured MREs are lower than those of isotropic MREs when the iron particle contents are the same. Furthermore, dynamic testing was conducted to study the effect of strain amplitude, frequency and magnetic field on the loss factor of MREs. In addition, the stress-softening experiments indicate that the ratio of <b>remaining</b> <b>strain</b> energy versus initial strain energy shows a decreasing trend with iron particle content and loading time...|$|E

40|$|Over a 6 -month period, eight {{strains of}} Citrobacter diversus (Citrobacter koseri) {{resistant}} to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams were isolated from seven colonized and/or infected patients {{from the same}} intensive care unit. All strains harbored a single large conjugative plasmid which mediated an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase of the SHV- 4 type (ceftazidimase phenotype; enzyme pI, 7. 8; plasmid DNA hybridization with a blaSHV-specific probe). All strains were characterized by antibiotic resistance pattern analysis, beta-lactamase content analysis, plasmid profiling, ribotyping with EcoRI, and arbitrarily primed (AP) -PCR with primers O 8 and O 12. Among the eight C. diversus strains, strains Cd 5 to Cd 12, six isolates (isolates Cd 6 to Cd 11) were identical by all markers; one strain (strain Cd 5) differed by two markers (antibiotype and AP-PCR pattern with primer O 8), and the <b>remaining</b> <b>strain</b> (strain Cd 12) differed by two other markers (ribotype and AP-PCR pattern with primer O 12).

MethodsFive B. bacilliformis were studied: four isolated before 1957, prior to the introduction of quinolones in clinical practice. The <b>remaining</b> <b>strain</b> was isolated in 1977. A fragment of the gyrA and parC genes was amplified and sequenced. Susceptibility to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin was established by the E-test method. ResultsAll the strains were resistant to nalidixic acid (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 256 mg/l). Three isolates presented decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and two were highly resistant (MIC > 32 mg/l). All the strains presented an Ala at position 91 of GyrA and position 85 of ParC. ConclusionsB. bacilliformis presents a constitutive resistance to quinolones, which {{may be related to the}} presence of Ala at position 91 of GyrA and 85 of ParC.
