This paper details four phases of PV programme planning: the preparation of PV programme, programme design, implementation and monitoring / evaluation. This should also be used once the programme developer has a clear concept for a feasible plans and should be useful to all the decision-makers in the process of developing programme, may be they are host governments in developing countries, PV programme developers and sponsors, PV producers and suppliers, entrepreneurs, or NGOs. This Paper is deals with preparation for PV programmes, including needs assessment, stakeholder consultation, social context analysis, supply options and national policy considerations and Design of PV programmes, including establishment of goals, delivery modes, timelines, and logistics and quality assurance. A number of methodologies have been developed over the years with the aim of improving programme design and implementation. This paper is intended to highlight the issues related to a <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> <b>programmes</b> in developing countries rather than providing an in-depth step by step methodology to standard programmed design, planning and implementation. Though the focus of this paper is on PV technologies, much of the discussion will apply to other <b>rural</b> decentralized <b>energy</b> systems. Solar-based electricity for our houses is essential nowadays as the monthly power bills are escalating regularly. Also, the whole world is now facing the challenge ‘global warming’. By using eco friendly and green technologies, we would help reduce global warming and help climate change mitigation.

This report deals with a general view of biogas in developing countries and treat to compare different kind of design plants in developing countries with a practical case in India. The thesis contains study of microbiological process and {{the selection of a}} particular design or model of biogas plants with advantages and disadvantages of each kind. The thesis’ objectives are to study the different kind of biogas plants in developing countries with particular emphasis in India and China. The microbiological process, social and economic aspects have been included in the study in order to look for the appropriate technology in each practical case. Other objective is to study the structural development of the socially / economically marginal groups in developing countries with the application of biogas like sustainable energy. The structural development will at least include the long-term accessibility to basic needs and the reduction of inequalities and dependence at an individual and village level. For this reason, it is really important to find the adequate and profitable design of biogas plant. This thesis follows the ordinary methodology. First of all, we started with literature review in order to look for information in the library of SLU and in scientific websides. Secondly, we did a study visit in order to consult the biogas plant in Uppsala. Finally, we had some interviews and discussion with experts about biogas in the Department of Microbiology and Agricultural Engineering. The results of the thesis are a complete review about biogas in developing countries. In this review we compared the different kind of biogas plants with their social and economics aspects. Also, we have studied about the microbiological process of biogas and how we can design the digestors, in order to look for the highest efficiency for the families with low cost. The main conclusion of this report is there is no unique answer and we realized that there is no global solution, because each case is different in every country, location or climate. A deep study is necessary if we want to get good results and {{improve the quality of life}} of population who live with basic needs. Biogas is expensive for poor people, we have tried to look for the way in order to do a biogas plant profitable and sustainable. Development of biogas technology is a vital component of alternative <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> <b>programmes</b> in India, whose potential is yet to be exploited. A concerted effort is required by all if this has to be realized. The technology will find ready use in domestic, farming and small-scale industrial applications. The diminishing agricultural land may hamper biogas energy development but appropriate technological and resource management techniques will offset the effects. We have proved in this thesis that India or China has their particular style in order to design, build or use the biogas plants, because their necessities are totaly different. It depends of the culture and social and economic aspects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{our views}} on innovative approaches for financing <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> services (RES), based on CORE International, Inc. ’s extensive worldwide {{experience in this}} area. The paper focuses on overall policy, institutional, and management approaches that we believe should be followed in creating the necessary market environment for large scale RES development in the SADC region and beyond. The general discussion focuses {{on the need for}} major changes in philosophy, principles, and institutions engaged in providing massive sustainable RES financing; changes dictated by the substantially changed environment for RES and rural electrification (RE) during the last decade. New, very important players – private sector, consumers, and regulators – are joining the team of RES and RE stakeholders, while the traditional ones – government, utilities, and donors – need to redefine their roles in this new structure and as a team should challenge poverty and make sustainable growth happen. Key Words: Sustainable <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> service delivery, policies for increasing access to <b>rural</b> <b>energy,</b> <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> and poverty alleviation, rural electrification authority, new approach to rural electrification financing, <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> markets, public private partnerships for <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> service delivery, central role of smart subsidies...|$|R

40|$|This article argues {{the case}} for {{introducing}} new energy policies in Ethiopia that will ensure <b>energy</b> initiatives for <b>rural</b> development meet the desired expectations. A review of the <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> sector in Ethiopia is presented. Rural communities have for centuries relied solely on traditional biomass energy sources, human and animal power. In addition, sample findings show that the basic stock of traditional biomass energy resources is dwindling fast for two reasons: one, due to rapid population growth; and two, due {{to the absence of}} energy substitutes for traditional energy sources. Renewable energy technologies (RETs) and other modern energy technologies are almost non-existent. In terms of budgetary allocation, <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> development has not received a fair share of public investment in comparison to education, rural road construction and health. A key policy recommendation made in this article is the need for commitment from concerned authorities to the use of renewables for spurring rural development. This could be through increasing the budget allocation to <b>rural</b> <b>energy,</b> which is currently negligible. Other policy recommendations include the modification of existing institutional frameworks for <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> delivery, and the design and implementation of appropriate <b>rural</b> <b>energy</b> initiatives suitable for productive activities and sustainable development...|$|R
