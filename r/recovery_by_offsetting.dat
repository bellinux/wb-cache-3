30|$|Chen and Fong (1997) {{simulated}} a Saskatchewan type reservoir {{with different}} well pattern including conventional SAGD, 2 -offset SAGD and 3 -staggered SAGD. They suggested that an incremental amount of 10 – 15  % oil can be recovered <b>by</b> <b>offsetting</b> the producer from injector. An additional 5 – 10  % oil recovery over the off-set <b>recovery</b> is possible <b>by</b> staggering the well in SAGD process, however, {{at the expense}} of deteriorating SOR.|$|R

Register machines handle this with a register+offset address mode, but use a wider offset field.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} tool {{eccentricity}} on the joint strength in clinching process was investigated. The {{objective is to}} understand the mechanical behavior of the clinched joint where proper control on the alignment setting of tools can be considered. In this research, a clinching process to form a round joint was carried out <b>by</b> <b>offsetting</b> the centre line between the upper punch and lower die. The experimental results were compared between offset conditions. Coated mild steel sheet {{were used for the}} evaluation.

K. distribution sector. At the same time, U. K. manufacturers experienced margin swings in the opposite direction, largely due to their role as exporters. Thus, sterling depreciation boosted the profits of U. K. manufacturers and squeezed the profits of U. K. distributors, while sterling appreciation had the opposite effects.
