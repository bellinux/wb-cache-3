5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} the {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government.

5|$|Madison {{was deeply}} {{read in the}} history of {{government}} and used a range of sources in composing the amendments. The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right {{to keep and bear arms}} (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E

5|$|The Free Press Clause protects {{publication}} of information and opinions, and applies {{to a wide variety}} of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and New York Times v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint—pre-publication censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E

5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition,</b> raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E

25|$|Petitions {{for freedom}} were {{lawsuits}} filed by enslaved persons against slaveholders asserting {{their right to}} freedom. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> for freedom descended from English common law and allowed people to challenge their enslavement or indenture.

500|$|The {{convention}} {{was called to}} order by John Austin, one of the alcaldes of San Felipe de Austin. In his remarks, John Austin laid out four key points that the convention needed to address: the [...] "misrepresentations" [...] made by [...] "enemies of Texas" [...] that the settlers desired independence from Mexico, an appeal of the restrictions on immigration from the United States, a method to grant land titles to residents in {{certain areas of the}} province, and reduction of tariffs on many imported items. [...] The first order of business was the election of officers. [...] Stephen F. Austin and William H. Wharton, a known hothead, were nominated to lead the convention; Austin won, 31–15. Frank W. Johnson, who had led the armed resistance at the Anahuac Disturbances, was elected secretary. [...] In his acceptance speech, Austin praised the delegates for exerting their constitutional <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the government.|$|R
25|$|The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> {{for freedom}} descended from English common law and allowed people to {{challenge}} their enslavement or indenture. Petitioners challenged slavery both directly and indirectly, even if slaveholders generally viewed such petitions {{as a means}} to uphold rather than undermine slavery. Beginning with the colonies in North America, legislatures enacted slave laws that created a legal basis for “just subjection;” these were adopted or updated by the state and territorial legislatures that superseded them after the United States gained independence. These codes also enabled enslaved persons to sue for freedom based on wrongful enslavement.|$|E
25|$|By custom, all {{males of}} full age have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the king {{directly}} through the traditional tribal meeting {{known as the}} majlis. In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule. Tribal identity remains strong and, outside of the royal family, political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation, with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events. As mentioned earlier, in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as {{the establishment of the}} Consultative Council in the early 1990s and the National Dialogue Forum in 2003.|$|E
25|$|In most states, the {{decision}} of whether an inmate is paroled is vested in a paroling authority such as a parole board. Mere good conduct while incarcerated {{in and of itself}} does not necessarily guarantee that an inmate will be paroled. Other factors may enter into {{the decision}} to grant or deny parole, most commonly the establishment of a permanent residence and immediate, gainful employment or some other clearly visible means of self-support upon release (such as Social Security if the prisoner is old enough to qualify). Many states now permit sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (such as for murder and espionage), and any prisoner not sentenced to either this or the death penalty will eventually have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> for release (one stateAlaskamaintains neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without parole as sentencing options).|$|E

25|$|Henry Blackwell {{was born}} May 4, 1832, in Bristol, Gloucestershire, England, the seventh of nine {{children}} of Samuel Blackwell and Hannah Lane Blackwell. Blackwell's father, a sugar refiner whose livelihood conflicted with his abolitionist principles, experimented with making beet sugar {{as an alternative}} to slave-grown cane sugar. In 1832, the family – including eight children and their father's sister Mary – emigrated to the United States. The family settled first in New York, where Blackwell's father established a sugar refinery and the ninth child was born, and then just outside New York in Jersey City. Blackwell's father took an interest in the nascent abolition movement, and William Lloyd Garrison other leaders were visitors in the family's home. Blackwell's eldest sister, Anna, participated in the emerging agitation for women's rights, attending the 1837 Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women and drafting its letter to John Quincy Adams thanking him for his support of women's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within Chapter 11 of the Virginia Act of Assembly, {{a number}} of acts were made law in order to {{consolidate}} and strengthen the regulations associated with a slave's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> for freedom in the state. Any person who believed himself or herself to be illegally detained was given {{the right to make}} a complaint in court, order the clerk to issue a warrant summoning the owner, and be provided with an appointed legal counsel who, without fee, would prosecute the suit. In addition to further outlining the right of enslaved persons in the courts, the new laws also enacted stricter penalties against persons who were found illegally aiding slaves in trying to achieve freedom. Any person in the state of Virginia found abetting, making, forging, or counterfeiting materials for use in court by a slave attempting to win their freedom was sentenced to suffer one year's imprisonment without bail. While the laws did create a space for the illegally enslaved to file suits for freedom, it isolated the enslaved from persons with the power and means to assist their cases.|$|E
25|$|However, if the tsar’s {{policies}} were too extreme or too disliked, {{he was not}} considered the true tsar. In these cases, {{it was necessary to}} replace this “fake” tsar with the “true” tsar, whoever he may be. Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to get their message across. But usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the tsar, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned tsar and misinterpreting his decrees. However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession, because she had annulled an act by Peter III that had essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church. Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> her because they felt as though she had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her. Far away from the capital, they were also confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.|$|E
