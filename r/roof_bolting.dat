40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> is {{the most}} popular method for {{underground}} openings in the mining industry, especially in the bedded deposits such as coal, potash, salt etc. In fact, all U. S. underground coal mine entries are roof-bolted as required by law. However, roof falls still occur frequently in the roof bolted entries. The two possible reasons are: the lack of knowledge of and technology to detect the roof geological conditions in advance of mining, and lack of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems. This research is to develop a method for predicting the roof geology and stability condition in real time during <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> operation. Based on such information, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems will be developed for implementation in real time. A new mechanical approach to estimate rock strengths using the acquired drilling parameters has been proposed. This approach takes a number of important factors, that have never been studied in the previous researches, into the considerations. Good results have been shown using the new approach on the testing data...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a human factors analysis of hazards associated with roofholting activities in underground coal mines. Emphasis {{was placed on}} hazards related to {{the movement of the}} drill-head boom or mast of a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine. The objective was to identify hazards and recommend solutions. The data-collection effort consisted of analysis of U. S.

A set of recommendations to increase the safety of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> operations was developed. In particular, the following list of recommendations was presented in ranking order: (1) use an interlock device to cut off power to controls when an operator is out of position, (2) place fixed barriers at pinch points, (3) provide appropriate control guarding, (4) reduce fast-feed speed, (5) use automatic cutoff switches at pinch points, (6) redesign control bank to conform to accepted ergonomic principles, and (7) use resin insertion tools and resin cartridge retainers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolt</b> {{system design}} means the {{selection}} of the type, length, capacity, and pattern of bolts for a particular application. Despite research efforts dating back 50 years, no design methodology has found wide acceptance. This paper begins by identifying four mechanisms that <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> use to reinforce the ground. It argues that the reinforcement mechanism is determined by the roof geology and stress level, not by the type of bolt. Next, the attributes of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are discussed in the light of recent research, including anchorage mechanism, installed tension, length, capacity, timing of installation, and installation quality. Several significant areas of controversy are identified. Design methods from around the world are discussed, including those based on empirical research, numerical modeling, and roof monitoring. Finally, some simple guidelines for preliminary design of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> systems are proposed based on statistical analysis of roof support performance at 37 U. S. mines...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) The study {{investigated}} whether non-destructive impact testing, aided by {{supervised machine learning}} methods, {{could be used to}} identify improper <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> installations, related to insufficient grout coverage. The testing method involved the installation of four <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> with varying installation properties, into a 1511 × 940 × 1350 mm rock test block. Three fully grouted bolts served as examples of proper installations, with the fourth bolt grouted only up to half the length of the borehole serving as an improper <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> installation. The testing procedure involved placing sensors directly onto the bolts and mechanically impacting a chosen bolt while measuring the response on all the bolts. The focus was on gaining understanding of the working principle of the testing technique and how the measured response was influenced by the presence of signal-modifying factors of the physical test block geometry, such as changes in material properties, boundary changes, cracks or empty boreholes. It was shown that the <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> integrity testing method aided by supervised machine learning methods could identify and classify both properly and improperly grouted <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> on the small sample of test bolts, in a series of tests conducted at the CSIR Centre for Mining Innovation premises.

Based on this information, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems will be developed for implementation in real time. For the prediction of roof geology and stability condition in real time, a micro processor was used and a program developed to monitor and record the drilling parameters of roof bolter. These parameters include feed pressure, feed flow (penetration rate), rotation pressure, rotation rate, vacuum pressure, oil temperature of hydraulic circuit, and signals for controlling machine. From the results of a series of laboratory and underground tests so far, feed pressure is found to be a good indicator for identifying the voids/fractures and estimating the roof rock strength. The method for determining quantitatively the location and the size of void/fracture and estimating the roof rock strength from the drilling parameters of roof bolter was developed. Also, a set of computational rules has been developed for in-mine roof using measured roof drilling parameters and implemented in MRGIS (Mine Roof Geology Information System), a software package developed to allow mine engineers {{to make use of the}} large amount of roof drilling parameters for predicting roof geology properties automatically. For the development of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> criteria, finite element models were developed for tensioned and fully grouted bolting designs. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the mechanisms of modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems including both the tension and fully grouted bolts. Parameters to be studied are: bolt length, bolt spacing, bolt size/strength, grout annulus, in-situ stress condition, overburden depth, and roof geology (massive strata, fractured, and laminated or thinly-bedded). Based on the analysis of the mechanisms of both bolting systems and failure modes of the bolted strata, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria and programs for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems were developed. These criterion and/or programs were combined with the MRGIS for use in conjunction with roof bolt installation...|$|E

40|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> {{system of}} a mine, if {{properly}} selected and installed, can allow for better roof control {{and reduce the}} potential for roof falls. Because of this potential to reduce roof falls and improve ground control conditions, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{has an interest in}} the types of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> that are used by the coal industry. Further, NIOSH has conducted research into how various support parameters can affect the number of roof falls that occur, including support type. Today, the five main types of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> installed in U. S. coal mines are mechanical anchor bolts, point-anchor or resin-assisted mechanical anchor bolts, torque-tension bolts, combination bolts, and fully grouted resin rebar. This paper describes each support in detail. Because of the importance of resin in the functioning of the majority of bolts installed, resin grouts are also discussed. Further, trends in the types of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> used are reviewed. Over the last 10 years, the significant trend has been the large reduction in the relative number of mechanical anchor bolts that are installed. These bolts have been replaced mainly by the resin-grouted rebar system. Data are also presented to show the impact of these changes in bolting on the number of roof falls...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} assist in the {{evaluation}} and selection of <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> using in situ measurements of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> loading has been developed by researchers of the Spokane Research Center, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Both axial and bending forces are measured by strain gauges at many locations along the length of fully grouted bolts during various stages of mining. This information is then used to (1) predict bolt loading for variations in bolt spacing, grade, and diameter, (2) calculate the design changes necessary in zones where bending loads are high, and (3) determine if bolt length is adequate. Results from several case studies of full-column bolt loading in coal mine gate roads are used to illustrate the design method.

However, due to the weight of the components of the two systems, it is imperative that the force in each <b>roof</b> <b>bolt,</b> suspension chain and steel support capable of suspending the weight of the heaviest component is determined.

40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> {{typically}} {{follows the}} extraction of a commodity {{to help keep the}} roof from collapsing. During 2004 to 2013, roof bolter operators had the highest number of machinery-related injuries, accounting for 64. 7 percent, at underground coal mines. This paper analyzes U. S. roof bolter fatal and nonfatal lost-time injury data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were bolting, handling of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions. This research provides a data-driven foundation from which future research can be conducted for safety interventions to reduce the frequency and severity of incidences involving the roof bolter activities of bolting, handling of materials, and setting the TRS.

40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of various underground coal mining equipment, an example of which is a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine (RBM). After the removal of coal or rock, the remaining strata may be subject to fall, either from overhead (the roof) or from the side (the rib). One method used in underground coal-mines to prevent failures requires the installation of roof bolts. The <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operator trams the machine to the required location, drills a hole into the strata, and then installs a roof bolt, supporting the roof or the rib, as the case may be. Field studies support the premise that, on average, drilling noise is the loudest noise that a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operator would be exposed to and contributes significantly to the operators 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 noise exposure. NIOSH has determined that the drill steel radiates a significant amount of noise during drilling. NIOSH is developing bit and chuck isolators to reduce vibration, and thus noise radiation of the drill steel, with the longer-term goal of reducing <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operator noise exposure. Laboratory testing has shown that operator ear sound pressure levels may be reduced by 3 to 7 dB(A), depending upon the test configuration and drilling media...|$|E
30|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> is {{the primary}} roof support system in US {{underground}} mines. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> usually consists two major processes: drilling and bolting. In the drilling process, a hole is drilled to the desired length into the mine roof at the required location. In the bolting process, bolts, either conventional bolts, cable bolts or resin roof bolts are inserted into the drilled hole for roof support. The fundamental problem of rock drilling is the breakage of fragments out of {{the face of a}} solid wall of rock (Teale 1965). The breakage of fragments generates particles of a wide size range out of the face of the rock surface.|$|E

The report identifies problems encountered in applying pulsed-phase-Iock-Ioop technology to <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> load measurement and provides potential solutions to many of them. A key assumption of pulsed-phase-lock-loop theory is that driving and reflected signal frequencies will always be equal.

40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{discusses}} how pull-test {{data can}} help establish polyester resin column length criteria for <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in evaporite minerals. The study evaluates {{the effectiveness of}} partial to full columns of resin in anchoring 4 -ft, No. 6, grade 40 rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in potash, salt, trona, gypsum, and borate mine roofs. Pull tests were performed on over 600 <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in 11 evaporite mines. Column lengths ranging from 6 to 48 in (fully grouted) were evaluated for each test site. In general, comparative results among all test sites indicate that pull-out loads in excess of 10 tons (force) were attained with resin-grouted bolts having 13 to 75 pet less than a full column of polyester resin. Ten tons (force) of load-carrying capability compared favorably, in terms of strength, with the calculated yield strength of the rebar used in the tests, which was 8. 8 tons (force). The site-specific nature of each test site, due to the unique combinations of geology, mine-induced stresses, and other unknown parameters, prevented the establishment of valid generic column-length criteria. For these reasons, data to evaluate resin-column-length effectiveness are best obtained on a mine-specific basis...|$|R
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} development in coal mine ground control during the last century was the introduction of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> during the late 1940 s and 1950 s. From an engineering standpoint, roof bolts are inherently {{more effective than the}} wood timbers they replaced. Roof bolts promised to dramatically reduce the number of roof fall accidents, which then claimed hundreds of lives each year, and they were initially hailed {{as one of the great}} social advances of our time. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> also emerged at a time of rapid technologic transformation of the coal industry, and greatly accelerated the transition to trackless, rubber-tired face haulage. The U. S. Bureau of Mines quickly became the new roof support s strongest advocate. Some state agencies and miners were skeptical at first, but nearly everyone was soon won over. Case histories were reported showing that roof falls could be largely eliminated while productivity increased dramatically. Little wonder that, in the words of one contemporary observer, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> has been adopted more rapidly than any other new technology in the history of coal mine mechanization. Yet by the end of the 1950 s, it was clear that roof fall fatality incidence rates had actually increased. It would be another decade before the superior ground support provided by roof bolts would clearly save lives. The story of how <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> was implemented by the mining industry, but took so long to live up to its promise, is a fascinating example of the interaction between economics, technology, regulation, and science.

Factors such as water-cement ratio, accelerator content, wax capsule additions to the gypsum in cartridge-installed bolts, surface area, temperature, and curing duration had little effect. In an actual roof-bolt environment, dissolution will occur in static solutions to the solubility limit of gypsum (~ 2 giL) and cease, result-ing in minimal damage; but in flows of unsaturated solution as slow as 1 L per month, a loss of up to 10 pct will occur in 2 yr. Since miners cannot readily measure the flow or ion concentration of static-appearing water at every roof-bolt site, all such water must be assumed to be pure and flowing.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{directed}} towards {{the comparison of}} active and passive bolts systems to reveal which system shows the most favorable behavior for improved performance, safety and cost. This was achieved through the incorporation of new technologies, field data, numerical modeling and established theories in ground control analysis. All in all, {{a better understanding of}} the quasi-static behavior of underground coal mine roofs has been attained. Over the summer of 2010, the Department of Mining and Mineral Resource Engineering at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, in conjunction with Andy Hyett of YieldPoint Inc., Peabody and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), installed over one hundred and seventy instrumented extensometers, closure meters, shear-meters, passive rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> tension rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> and double lock rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> at three coal mines. Two of the three coal mines were room-and-pillar mines and the other a longwall mine. Data was routinely collected over a nine-month period to analyze shearing, dilation, and axial bolt loading occurring within the rock mass, and entry closure occurring between the excavation hanging-wall and foot-wall. Based on bolt loadings, shear, axial behavior and statistical analysis, initial results indicate that active <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> do not show superior performance for the added cost. Active bolts seem to show no difference from passive bolts in the initial loading phase either, indicating that tension bleed-off is a concern soon after installation; however, this observation was not captured, as the data loggers were not intrinsically safe. Considering the modeling results, the trends in axial loading seem to be calibrated but the magnitudes are not. Computer modeling also shows the potential to accurately model in situ bolt performance; however, challenges remain in obtaining a good match between numerical modeling and field observations...|$|R

In response to this, the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has initiated a project to develop engineering noise controls for <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machines. Key to this research is {{an evaluation of the}} duty cycle of a typical <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operation and this paper presents the results of such an exercise for data collected at two cooperating coalmines.

NIOSH post processed the data to determine which tasks the operator devotes the most time to and the noise dosage accumulated during those tasks. These results provide insight into which portion of the operators' duty cycle is the most prominent contributor to noise exposure and thus, where research activities for the development of engineering noise controls should be focused.

40|$|It is arguable {{that the}} {{development}} of reinforcing <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems has largely stagnated in recent times primarily due to the prevailing industry view that few, if any further improvements can be made to {{the current state of the}} art. On the contrary, this paper will contend that reinforcing <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems can be further refined by considering both the specific manner by which horizontally bedded roof strata loses its natural self-supporting ability and the specific means by which reinforcing roof bolts act to promote or retain this natural self-supporting ability. The Australian coal industry’s seeming insistence on minimising bolt-hole diameter to maximise load transfer and targeting full-encapsulation by any means has led to a significant, albeit unintended consequence in terms of overall <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> effectiveness, namely the promotion of increased resin-pressures during bolt installation and the associated potential for the opening up of bedding planes that may otherwise remain closed during the bolt installation process. Given that the natural self-supporting ability of roof strata is strongly linked to whether bedding planes remain open or closed, it stands to reason that minimising resin pressures should be of significant benefit. Three issues are primarily focused on three key issues that relate directly to the function of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> system itself, namely: (i) the importance of proper resin mixing in the context of maximising load transfer strength and stiffness, (ii) the importance of minimising resin pressures developed during bolt installation and (iii) the importance of maximising the effectiveness of the available bolt pre-tension. The logic being that if: the reliability of resin mixing with varying hole diameter is substantially improved, if resin pressures generated during bolt installation are substantially reduced, if the length of the bolted interval directly influenced by high resin pressures generated during bolt installation is substantially reduced, and if roof bolt pre-tension levels are increased, why wouldn’t individual roof bolt effectiveness and thus roof reinforcement improve? The potential benefits to the mining industry of improving the individual effectiveness of each installed roof bolt, even by relatively small incremental amounts, should be of interest to all mine operators and is an important topic for discussion amongst the mining community...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical design method for the truss-bolt system in reinforcing underground fractured rock roofs in coal mines. The analytical design method {{is based on}} the mechanical analysis of the fractured rock roof with reinforcement by inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and a horizontal tie-rod. The mechanical analysis for the system includes a non-linear bending model for the laterally inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and three upper and lower bounds. The lateral resistance of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in a truss-bolt-supported roadway is examined using classical theory of a non-linear beam in bending. The paper analyses the arching action by lateral behavior of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in reinforcing the fractured roof. Based on mechanical models, the design formula concerning the lateral bolt forces, tensions in the tie-rod in the truss system, as well as the reinforcement behavior have been derived. In order to ensure that the roof truss-bolt system reinforces the coal roof effectively, a lower bound of pre-tightening forces must be applied on the tie-rod for stabilizing the fractured roof by arching action. The pre-tightening forces exerted via the tie-rod also cannot be greater than its upper bound, since the excessive tightening force will cause localized failure in the rock near the bolt tail at the abutment of the fractured roof beam. The analytical formulas for both lower and upper bounds for truss pre-tightening forces are put forward in this paper. Furthermore, the paper also {{presents an}}alytical equations for designing the axial forces and dimensions for bolts in this kind of system. Parametric studies and optimization analysis are also carried out {{on the basis of the}} proposed approach. A flow chart and procedures are presented to show the analytical design method for this truss-bolt system. Case studies are presented to show how the method can be used in actual coal mining tunnels.

40|$|Roofbolts – cable bolts – support {{stiffness}} – rock confinement <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> {{technology in}} Australian coal mines has advanced considerably during the 40 years since introduction. However, there is constant {{need for more}} efficient strata control in mining {{in order to improve}} safety, maximise productivity and decrease costs. Therefore, the changes introduced to roofbolting technology are being assessed and the directions for further future development are discussed. The main area where the majority of improvements have taken place is in the stiffness of the support. The gradual increase of the support stiffness has been achieved mainly by the introduction of chemical anchors and full encapsulation of bolts, higher grades of steel with more efficient deformations and the introduction of cable bolts and resin grouted strand bolts. Another important development occurred in the area of direct application of confinement to the rock mass by applying high support pre-tension. All the changes introduced to <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> technology which have resulted in better rock reinforcement are analysed and the directions for further future development are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Silicosis {{and coal}} worker's {{pneumoconiosis}} are serious occupational respiratory diseases {{associated with the}} coal mining industry and the inhalation of respirable dusts that contain crystalline silica. Silica exposure is an occupational health priority even when exposure has ceased or is below the occupational exposure limit (0. 1 mg/m 3). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the individual contributions of the underground coal mining tasks to the total amount of respirable dust and respirable silica dust concentrations found in this environment. The tasks that were identified were continuous miner (CM) cutting, construction, the transfer point, tipping and <b>roof</b> <b>bolting.</b> Respirable dust sampling was conducted at the intake and return of each task, as well as at the intake and return of the section and the intake airway to the section. The five occupations that perform these tasks were also sampled to determine the personal exposure levels. Respirable dust concentrations and small concentrations of respirable silica dust were found in the intake airway and intake of the section, indicating that the air that enters the section is already contaminated. The respirable dust-generating hierarchy of the individual tasks was: transfer point>CM right cutting> CM left cutting> CM face cutting> construction> <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> > tipping. For respirable silica dust the hierarchy was: CM left cutting> construction> transfer point> CM right cutting. CM face cutting, tipping and <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> generated concentrations of below quantifiable levels. The personal exposures also differed and the eM and stamler operators had the highest exposure to respirable dust (3. 417 ± 0. 862 mg/m 3) and respirable silica dust (0. 179 ± 0. 388 mg/m 3) concentrations, respectively. Recommendations have been included for lowering the respirable dust and silica dust concentrations that are generated and that the workers are exposed to underground. Master...|$|E
40|$|Groundfalls {{are much}} more likely to occur in coal mine intersections than in entries. NIOSH is using the {{experience}} of U. S. coal mines to determine the factors which influence intersection instability and provide guidelines for the safe excavation and support of intersections. Detailed field investigations have resulted in a database of U. S. coal mines containing 12 mines and 639 roof falls so far. By using the roof fall rate as the outcome variable, correlations between roof geology (CMRR), intersection span, and roof support have been established. Case studies have indicated that replacing 3 - way intersections with 4 -way intersections may not reduce the total number of roof falls. Additionally, the size of intersection spans tend to decrease with lower (weaker) CMRR. Protocols have been established for the collections of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> parameters. The performance of individual <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> can now be tracked with roof fall rate...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a laboratory investigation designed {{to evaluate the}} stress and deformation characteristics of fully grouted <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> subjected to various magnitudes of end loadings. The experiment and subsequent analysis were completed, utilizing axial deformation data obtained -ultrasonically from forty-one 4 -ft, grade 40 <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{with a total of}} 132 measurement locations along the lengths of the bolts. The ultrasonic measurement instrumentation used in this investigation allowed for elongation measurements without requiring extensive bolt modifications. The results indicate that approximately 39 pct o{ the applied end load dissipated within the first 3. 4 in of the bolts. However, only 3 pct of the applied load was realized beyond 28 in of the grout column. Data are presented individually for every 6 -in increment of bolt length, and analysis was performed using statistical, nonlinear equations developed for 5, 000 and 8, 000 lb loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|The San Juan Mine and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study to measure how development mining affected bolt loads. Twelve fully grouted, instrumented <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> were installed at two three-way intersections {{as part of the}} standard bolting pattern. Newly developed miniature data acquisition systems (MIDAS) were used to measure bolt load changes during initial face advance and cross-cut breakthrough. The effects of cut placement and depth on <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> loads were studied. This test showed how bolt loads increased at five positions along the bolt length during initial mining. Both entry advance and cross-cut breakthrough produced a similar percentage of increase in bolt loads. Geologic differences between the test sites were probably responsible for the differences in amounts of bolt loading. The test site with more top coal and a higher rock quality designation (RQD) had lower bolt loads...|$|R
