50|$|Since April 2014 SIGG started {{manufacturing}} bottles made of high-grade100% <b>recyclable</b> <b>Polypropylene</b> (one of the safest, {{durable and}} eco-friendlyplastics available today). As {{part of the}} philosophy of the company means tokeep the swissness of its products, the SIGG VIVA bottles are produced inSwitzerland. SIGG ensures that these bottles are free of BPA and they areproduced with the same ecological standards of the aluminum bottles. Thesesport orientated bottles have the advantage that they are transparent allowingto see the inside and they are very resistant against dent and scratches.|$|E
50|$|Lush {{products}} {{are made in}} factories around the world including Poole, Dorset; Toronto, Canada; Düsseldorf, Germany and Vancouver, Canada, Lush marks its trademark black tub products with stickers of the actual creators of the product being sold, a unique trademark stamped on their <b>recyclable</b> <b>polypropylene</b> plastic black pots. The company also offers customers a way to recycle used black pots by bringing empty ones back to the store for a free Fresh Face Mask for every five returned. Most Lush {{products are}} to be stored at room temperature, {{with the exception of}} their Fresh Face Masks, which require refrigeration due to the absence of preservatives and the main ingredients being fruits and vegetables. Stores do not typically sell products older than four or five months and most products have a shelf life of approximately 14 months, depending on the particular item.|$|E
40|$|To control {{problematic}} vole {{species in}} organic orchards farmers can choose between different measures. Some methods like gassing, trapping {{and even the}} support of natural vole antagonists target to reduce vole population by killing individuals. Other methods like protective guards or migration barriers exclude voles from single trees or whole orchards. Recent {{combinations of the two}} approaches worked well but had some drawbacks in practice. Nevertheless, efficiency of migration barriers can be improved by attracted natural predators. Here we present first practical experiences and field observations of a vole-trapping-fence prototype. The new construction consists of prefabricated <b>recyclable</b> <b>polypropylene</b> pieces which are mounted to modules and assembled to fences of any length. It has a H-shaped profile with the horizontal line at ground level. The two „legs“ are pushed into the ground and the two „arms“ building a double wall fence above ground. Through one-way doors voles can enter the space between the walls they are trapped in. In contrast to wire mesh fences it allows the seasonal use in annual cultures due to its fast mounting and dismantling features. For the long term protection of orchards, however, an additional wire mesh to prevent deep tunnelling is still recommended. The above ground construction has shown some additional advantages as maintenance is easier with a decreased risk of penetration by mowing devices. Most important the new construction improved the accessibility by predators as not only terrestrial but also avian predators were attracted and were able to take the captured voles...|$|E

2500|$|The {{banknotes}} {{are manufactured}} by Ottawa-based company Canadian Bank Note Company {{and by the}} former BA International. They are made from a single sheet of polymer substrate branded as [...] "Guardian" [...] manufactured by Innovia Films, {{which is the only}} supplier of the substrate for the Frontier Series, based on a polymer developed in Australia and used by Note Printing Australia to print the banknotes of the Australian dollar since 1988. The material is less likely to tear than cotton-based paper, and is more crumple resistant and water resistant. The polymer notes are made of <b>recyclable</b> biaxially-oriented <b>polypropylene</b> (BOPP).|$|R
