5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants.

This is especially the case for technological innovations where the public has no direct experience with the technology and its applications. In such cases, expert views are the main source for public opinion formation. Stakeholder <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception, <b>and</b> their effect on attitudes towards a new technology (nanotechnology) and its applications were examined in two studies. In a survey, the effect of <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception on attitudes to nanotechnology in specific application domains (energy, water, food and medicine) was examined. While <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception predicted much {{of the variance in}} attitude, experts were more positive about medicine applications and more negative about food applications than could be explained through <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perception. In the second study, expert focus groups were asked for reasons why food and medicine were seen as more negative and positive than based on the <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> perceptions as measured in the survey. For medicine, the urgency and unique potential of nanotechnology was seen as a reason as why this domain was liked more. For food, the high level of uncertainty about <b>risk</b> assessment <b>and</b> about exposure of consumers and the lack of urgency in applying nanotechnology to food was seen as a reason this domain was liked less. In addition, experts voiced concern about potential negative public response to food applications as reasons for their negative attitude.

40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: Nearly all fish {{consumption}} advisories for methylmercury (MeHg) {{are based}} only on risk. There {{is a need to}} also address benefits, especially those from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in neurodevelopmental function and cardiovascular health. However, because MeHg and PUFA generally act on these same end points, disentangling <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> is challenging. Objectives: We propose an approach for balancing <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> that is based on the use of statistically dissociated measures of <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> Discussion: Because of mutual coexposure of MeHg and PUFAs in population-based studies and their opposite effect on many of the same end points, MeHg <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> PUFA <b>benefit</b> are tightly linked statistically, which results in mutual (negative) confounding. Thus, neither MeHg risk nor PUFA benefit can be accurately quantified without taking the other into account. A statistical approach that generates unconfounded <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> coefficients for each end point can permit their subsequent recombination to describe the overall risk–benefit profile of each species of fish or fish diet. However, it appears that some end points may be adversely affected by MeHg without experiencing counterbalancing benefit from PUFAs. Such end points may drive consumption advisories and may preclude balancing of <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> on the basis of other end points. Co n c l u s i o n s: Our thinking about fish consumption advisories now recognizes the need to balance <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> However, although statistical analysis of the appropriate data can eliminate mutual confounding, care is required to address the most sensitive end points that may be sensitive to <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> not <b>benefit.</b> Key w o r d s: fish, fish consumption advisories, MeHg, methylmercury, n- 3 fatty acids, omega- 3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFA, risk–benefit.

25|$|In the US, this {{doctrine}} places a legal obligation on {{a doctor to}} make a patient aware {{of the reason for}} treatment, the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of a proposed treatment, the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of alternative treatment, and the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of receiving no treatment.

The form states how many treatments are recommended and also makes the patient aware that consent may be revoked and treatment discontinued at any time during a course of ECT. The US Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health states that patients should be warned that the benefits of ECT are short-lived without active continuation treatment in the form of drugs or further ECT, and that there may be some risk of permanent, severe memory loss after ECT.

40|$|In {{this study}} the moderating role {{of trust and}} {{negative}} affective associations on the inverse relationship between <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> judgements is investigated. A survey (N = 406) {{was held in the}} Netherlands on the public perception of new hydrogen systems, during the time that a demonstration project with hydrogen buses was being undertaken. The data of the survey show that for the group of respondents with a negative evaluation of trust in actors involved, an inverse relationship between <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> judgements can be observed. Furthermore, for the group of respondents that had elicited negative affective spontaneous associations with hydrogen in general, the inverse relationship was also found. The inverse relationship between <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> judgements was not observed in the group not making these spontaneous associations. The strongest negative correlation between <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> judgements was found for those who had a negative evaluation of trust and had elicited negative affective spontaneous associations. In all cases the general affective evaluation of hydrogen systems was the mediating factor in this inverse relationship between <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> judgements.

Little work has been done examining the implications of the explosion of new media and web technologies, which may offer potential for improving food <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> communication. First, this study examines the views of stakeholders (n= 38) and experts (n= 33) in the food domain on the potential use of these emerging media for food risk/benefit communication. Based on in-depth interviews in six European countries (Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Spain and The Netherlands), strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of social media in food <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> communication were identified.

40|$|Summary The {{security}} of access and information flow {{carries with it}} the risk that resources will be misused – intentionally or accidentally. Static Access Control (AC) policies based on qualitative judgements are insufficient for scenarios where roles and access requirements are subtle and change frequently. We propose using quantified <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> estimates {{in the design and}} management of AC policies. The first step is to build models for estimating <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> Many factors may affect <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit,</b> <b>and</b> the relationship among them and their impacts are usually complex and hard to determine analytically. Therefore we decided to use machine learning techniques to learn the models from AC data. Due to the sensitive and evolving nature of real AC data, we must generate synthetic data to begin demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Given that no sets of AC data could cover all possibilities, we must also show that the models learned can be applied to data outside the training sets. We start examining these problems by first creating a parametrised simulation model, designed to capture certain properties related to the <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> of information transfer, including how risk aggregates over time. We then explore how different choices of the model parameters affect our ability to predict this <b>risk,</b> <b>and</b> describe some preliminary results of transferring learning between different instantiations of the model. Motivation Access control has traditionally focused on static sets of roles, and this implies a fixed mapping from users to permissions. The JASON report [7] indicated that this approach is too rigid for modern organisations...|$|R
