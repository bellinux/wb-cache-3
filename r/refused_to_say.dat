5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E
5|$|According to the police, the {{passengers}} behaved very calmly, given the circumstances. Keč allowed several of {{the passengers}} to use their mobile telephones, allowing {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had been called to the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft if the situation escalated. After the incident, the police <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if they would have stormed the aircraft if Keč followed through his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E

Possessed with faith and courage, they were {{determined}} that national strength could be regained, and that the fraternity would once again be able to pursue its mission of shaping young Jewish men into community leaders.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Bush {{administration}} banned torture including waterboarding on detainees. In January 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama {{issued a}} similar {{ban on the}} use of waterboarding and other forms of torture in interrogations of detainees. In April 2009, the U.S. Department of Defense <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether waterboarding is still used for training (e.g., SERE) US military personnel in resistance to interrogation.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a Montgomery County, Maryland, teacher berated and had school police {{remove a}} 13-year-old girl who <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom. The student's mother, {{assisted}} by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, sought and received an apology from the teacher, as state {{law and the}} school's student handbook both prohibit students from being forced to recite the Pledge.|$|E

25|$|The War Office {{contacted}} Matthews in February 1924 {{to request}} a demonstration of his ray. Matthews did not reply to them but spoke to journalists and demonstrated the ray to a Star reporter by igniting gunpowder from a distance. He still <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how the ray actually worked, just insisted that it did. When the British government still refused to rush to buy his ideas, {{he announced that he}} had an offer from France.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} suggest Donati's death resulted {{more directly}} from specific crimes {{he was engaged}} in. Some reports suggest he was an occasional informant to authorities and thus was killed for that reason; In 1997, a federal prosecutor who had been threatened with contempt of court charges if he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether Donati was an informant told a judge {{that he had not}} been, at least not to any federal agencies. Donati's FBI files also note that he had some large gambling debts at the time.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, {{perhaps because the}} show focused little on cookinga {{major part of the}} Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her {{apartment}} by the KGB. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the Korean poet Won Tu-Son. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya {{was taken to the}} Lubyanka Prison and repeatedly interrogated, where she <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the GULAG.|$|E
25|$|In July 1924, Matthews {{left for}} the USA to market his invention. When he was offered $25,000 to {{demonstrate}} his beam to the Radio World Fair at Madison Square Garden, he again refused and claimed, without foundation, {{that he was not}} permitted to demonstrate it outside England. US scientists were not impressed. One Professor Woods offered {{to stand in front of}} the death ray device to demonstrate his disbelief. Regardless, when Matthews returned to Britain, he claimed that the USA had bought his ray but <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> who had done it and for how much. Matthews moved to the USA and began to work for Warner Bros.|$|E
25|$|Otto Berman, {{the oldest}} and least {{physically}} fit of the four men, {{was the first to}} die, at 2:20 that morning. At the hospital, Landau and Rosencrantz waited for surgery and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything to the police until Schultz arrived and gave them permission; even then, they provided the police with only minimal information. Abe Landau died of exsanguination eight hours after the shooting. Meanwhile, Rosencrantz was taken into surgery; the doctors, incredulous that Rosencrantz was still alive despite voluminous blood loss and ballistic trauma, were unsure of how to treat him. He survived for 29 hours after the shooting before succumbing to his injuries.|$|E

25|$|The bad {{election}} result in 2001 was quickly {{followed by a}} leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether he would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators {{as a sign that}} he probably would seek the leadership position. In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been briefly hospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave, said that he would not seek reelection as leader. In November 2002, Stoltenberg was unanimously elected new leader at the party's congress.|$|E
25|$|During his {{original}} trial, Reynolds had challenged two jurors, {{both of whom}} stated that they had formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Reynolds before the trial. The court held that universal education and press reports {{made it hard to}} find jurors who had not formed some opinion. It found that Reynolds had failed to meet the requirement that he, as challenger of a juror's objectivity, demonstrate that a juror had developed a real and strong opinion. The prosecution had discharged two potential jurors who <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{whether or not they were}} living in polygamy. The Court held that it would not overturn a case based on the legality of challenges to dismissed jurors.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the year, Alpha Oumar Konaré, the {{chairman}} of the commission of the African Union and former president of Mali, reportedly urged Bozizé not to stand for election. Bozizé gave an interview to Radio France Internationale on May 17 in which he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether or not he would run, but he confirmed that Konaré had spoken to him about it, while criticizing Konaré for what he called interference in the country's affairs, and wondering whether he had consulted the opinions of the Central African people before getting involved. He stressed that the matter would depend on the will of the people. Some of his supporters campaigned prominently for him to stand. About 5,000 people walked in Bangui on June 19 to support his candidacy; Bozizé thanked them and asked for time to reflect.|$|E

25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper {{using the new}} Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E
25|$|The CIO then {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} AA from within. If the AA changed its mind about organizing along industrial lines, Green and the AFL—which above all else respected each member union's autonomy—could do little to prevent the organizing campaign. The CIO approached President Tighe on April 15 and asked to speak to delegates at the AA's convention, but Tighe <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether he would permit a CIO address. Fewer than 100 delegates gathered at the AA's convention in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on April 28, 1936. Tighe locked {{the doors of the}} convention hall to keep the CIO officials out. Tighe then asked the members to vote on whether they wished to hear the CIO offer. The delegates voted 42 to 43 (with seven abstentions) to refuse to hear the proposal. But the CIO found a way to end-run the AA leadership. When the Pennsylvania State Federation of Labor sent a delegation to deliver greetings to the AA, the delegation included John Brophy, the newly hired organizing director of the CIO. Tighe initially refused him entrance, but was forced to give Brophy access under pressure from the delegates. In his remarks, Brophy explained the offer of the CIO: $500,000 for the organization of the steel industry, provided the campaign occurred along industrial lines. A motion was made and carried to appoint a committee to study the proposal.|$|E
