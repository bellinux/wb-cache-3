5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> was historically {{the case when}} denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} maneuverability as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target as rapidly as possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in the engagement. This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout the engagement. This demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> the systems used on earlier Nikes. Bell suggested that their transistor offered the solution to the data processing problem.|$|E
5|$|When endothermy first {{appeared}} in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids. Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> marsupials and placentals, but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures.|$|E

Males had higher <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|However, Psittacosaurus may {{not have}} been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking {{sections}} from the limb bones of 16 specimens of Psittacosaurus, ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that Psittacosaurus was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, Psittacosaurs would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of Psittacosaurus was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path {{at some point in their}} evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{the average}} price of a {{detached}} house in Christchurch was £323,416. On average property in Christchurch is 24% more expensive than anywhere else in England and Wales. Nearly 80% of residences are owner occupied, 3% are vacant and a further 3% are second homes. The borough has around 25,000 cars: an average of 1.21 per household. Christchurch, in common with the rest of Dorset, has lower crime <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> average for the UK. Reported crime rates per 1,000 of the population in 2006 (with figures for 2001 in brackets) are as follows: violence against the person 10.4 (4.8), sexual offences 0.7 (0.3), robbery 0.2 (0.3), burglary 2.2 (4.0), theft of vehicles 0.9 (2.5), theft from vehicles 3.6 (7.2).|$|E

These results {{raise the question of}} whether the greater Scottish mortality is a country of birth rather than a country of residence excess. Our analysis, around the 2001 Census, suggests that country of birth is more important than country of residence, indicating that early life factors may be important for the Scottish excess...|$|R

5|$|OTUs, {{employing}} as {{they did}} warplanes that were more advanced and more powerful than trainers, and teaching combat techniques that often carried high risk, generally suffered higher accident <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> other flying training schools. On 3March 1943, a Wirraway of No.4 OTU crashed near Williamtown, killing both crewmen. Two others died when their Vengeance crashed and burned near Goulburn during a cross-country exercise on 4August. On 16August, a Vengeance flew into trees after apparently pulling out late from a dive, resulting in two fatalities. A Vengeance blew up in flight during dive-bombing practice at Williamtown on 14September, killing both crewmen. On 5October, a Vengeance on a dive-bombing exercise crashed into the sea near Newcastle; both crewmen were reported as missing, believed killed. No.4 OTU suffered two more fatalities when a Vengeance struck a hill near Braidwood during a cross-country flight on 26November 1943. Another Vengeance hit the water and exploded in Nelson Bay on 7April 1944 after failing to recover from a dive, killing the two-man crew.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{slavery was}} {{not based on}} race. Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, {{including}} Gaul, Hispania, Germany, Britannia, the Balkans, Greece... Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent, while the Jewish ones never fully assimilated into Roman society, remaining an identifiable minority. These slaves (especially the foreigners) had higher mortality rates and lower birth <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves {{of the city of}} Rome was extraordinarily low: seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} and the marbled newt {{are the only}} species in the genus with a considerable range overlap (in western France). In that area, they have patchy, mosaic-like distributions and in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Individuals resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a marbled newt female had mistakenly been described as distinct species Triton blasii de l'Isle 1862, and the reverse hybrids as Triton trouessarti Peracca 1886. The first type is much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consists only of males, while in the second, males have lower survival <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely backcross with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.|$|E
