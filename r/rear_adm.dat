5|$|Union forces bombarded {{the city}} all night, from 220 {{artillery}} pieces and naval gunfire from <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> David D. Porter's fleet in the river, and while causing little property damage, they damaged Confederate civilian morale. On {{the morning of}} May 22, the defenders were bombarded again for four hours before the Union attacked once more along a three-mile front at 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard {{was unhappy}} with his new assignment, believing that he {{deserved}} command {{of one of the}} great Confederate field armies. He performed successfully, however, preventing the capture of Charleston by Union naval and land attacks in 1863. On April 7, 1863, Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, led a union ironclad attack against Fort Sumter that was repulsed by highly accurate artillery fire from Beauregard's forces. In July through September 1863, union land forces under Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore launched a series of attacks on Fort Wagner on Morris Island and other fortifications {{at the mouth of the}} harbor, while <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> John A. Dahlgren attempted to destroy Fort Sumter. Because the latter operation failed, the successful seizure of Morris Island was not effective in threatening Charleston.|$|E
25|$|Honorary pallbearers were Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, Admiral Charles P. Snyder, Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Vice Adm. Edward L. Cochrane, and <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Henry Williams, all {{retired from}} service. Active {{military}} servicemen who were honorary pallbearers were Admiral Jerauld Wright, Admiral Robert L.

25|$|On 5–6 October, {{the largest}} fast carrier force {{organized}} to that time, comprising Essex, Yorktown, Lexington, Independence, , and , <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Alfred E. Montgomery in command, struck at Wake Island. The target was also shelled by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers.|$|E
25|$|Ringgold {{was laid}} down on 25 June 1942 by the Federal Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Kearny, New Jersey. The ship was {{launched}} on 11 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Arunah Sheperdson Abell, grand niece of <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Cadwallader Ringgold. Ringgold was commissioned on 30 December 1942, Commander Thomas F. Conley in command.|$|E
25|$|Klakring {{returned}} {{through the}} Bosporus and anchored at Istanbul, Turkey, on 23 June. On 27 June, she sailed southbound through the Dardanelles, and completed an intermediate maintenance availability with Haifa Shipyard, Ltd., Haifa, Israel, from 30 June to 10 July. Following her maintenance, she {{took part in}} Noble Dina 3, a joint US-Israeli naval exercise (10–13 July). She visited Alexandria, Egypt (19–24 July), and returned to Haifa (28–31 July). <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Richard C. Macke, Commander Carrier Group 2, boarded the ship before her departure.|$|E
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Fort Morgan, the {{campaign}} for the lower Mobile Bay was complete. Canby and Farragut had already decided before the first landings on Dauphin Island that the army could not provide enough men to attack Mobile itself; furthermore, the Dog River Bar that had impeded bringing Tennessee down now prevented Farragut's fleet from going up. Mobile did come under combined army-navy attack, but only in March and April 1865, after Farragut {{had been replaced by}} <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Henry K. Thatcher. The city finally fell in {{the last days of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Following {{shakedown}} in Chesapeake Bay, Kenmore put in at Norfolk, Virginia, on 6 September and embarked men {{and equipment}} of the 13th Marine Defense Battalion and the 18th and 19th Naval Construction Battalions. Departing on 19 September, she docked at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on 24 September and steamed in convoy for the Pacific on 4 October. Arriving off Nouméa, New Caledonia, on 11 November, she debarked her troops and offloaded her cargo, then reported on 9 November to <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Richmond K. Turner, Commander, Amphibious Forces, South Pacific.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September she put to {{sea with}} the Yangtze River Patrol Force under <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> C. Turner Joy, but broke {{off from the}} main body to head for Okinawa and arrived in Buckner Bay {{on the morning of}} 5 September. That same day Captain Campbell was {{designated}} commander of the newly organized Minesweeper Task Group 73.2 with Robinson as flagship. She put to sea with six minesweepers on the night of 5 September; and, 2 days later, the task unit began minesweeping operations in the approaches to and the entrance of the Yangtze. These lasted until December. On the 12th Robinson sailed from Shanghai for the United States and reached San Diego on 30 December.|$|E
25|$|In June 1998 CCDG-3 {{deployed}} to the Persian Gulf. The deployment {{was the first}} on board the USS Abraham Lincoln. On 20 August 1998, the group took part in Operation Infinite Reach, launching Tomahawk cruise missiles against the Sudanese Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. This factory was suspected of assisting Osama Bin Laden in making chemical weapons. The Battle Group also launched a second wave of Tomahawk cruise missiles against Bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. These cruise missile strikes were ordered by President Bill Clinton 13 days after terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Rear Admiral Kevin Green transferred command of the group to incoming <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Phillip Balisle on 3 December 1999, aboard the flagship Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Union boats under <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> David Dixon Porter began landing troops near Arkansas Post in {{the evening}} of January 9. The troops started up river towards Fort Hindman. Sherman's corps overran Confederate trenches, and the {{defenders}} retreated {{to the protection of}} the fort and adjacent rifle-pits. Porter, on January 10, moved his fleet towards Fort Hindman and bombarded it, withdrawing at dusk. Union artillery fired on the fort from positions across the river on January 11, and the infantry moved into position for an attack. Union ironclads commenced shelling the fort and Porter's fleet passed it to cut off any retreat. As a result of this envelopment, and the attack by Morgan's troops, the Confederate command surrendered in the afternoon. Although Union losses were high and the victory did not contribute to the capture of Vicksburg, it did eliminate one more impediment to Union shipping on the Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|Between 17:45 and 18:00 on 9 February 1942, {{authorities}} {{considered the}} fire under control, and began winding down operations until 20:00. Water entering the ship through submerged openings and flowing {{to the lower}} decks negated efforts to counter-flood, and Lafayettes list gradually increased to port. Shortly after midnight, <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Andrews ordered Lafayette abandoned, and the ship continued to list, a process hastened by the 6,000 tons of water that had been played on her. New York fire officials were concerned that the fire could spread to the nearby city buildings. Lafayette eventually capsized during the mid watch (02:45) on 10 February, nearly crushing a fire boat, and {{came to rest on}} her port side at an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Recognising that his incompetence had caused the disaster, Admiral Andrews ordered all pressmen barred from viewing the moment of capsize in an effort to lower the level of publicity.|$|E
25|$|She got {{underway}} from San Pedro Bay on 18 January {{to escort}} the attack transport Comet (APA-166) to Humboldt Bay, Hollandia, New Guinea, and returned on 3 February escorting Wright (AG-79). After installation of fighter-director radio equipment, she cleared port with Harmon (DE-678) and Greenwood (DE-679) {{in the screen}} for amphibious command ship Blue Ridge (AGC-2) and three transports; and headed for Lingayen Gulf where she performed patrol duty. She returned to San Pedro Bay with the empty troopship on 26 February, and sailed {{the next day with}} Bancroft (DD-598), escorting <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> Forrest B. Royal's amphibious command ship, Rocky Mount (AGC-3) which reached Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, on 1 March. That same day, Robinson put to sea in the screen for Task Group 78.1 (TG78.1). The American ships arrived off the Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao early in the morning of 10 March, and Robinson took station off Coldera Point as troops stormed ashore under the cover of a rocket barrage. During the night, she teamed with McCalla (DD-488) for gunfire support, knocking out an enemy gun emplacement and hitting enemy pillboxes inland. On the 16th, she bombarded Isabela City, Basilan Island, creating a diversion while Army troops landed at Kulibato Point to the east. Assisted by spotting aircraft, she shelled a wharf and the area of suspected enemy underground trenches. On the evening of 18 March, she responded to the request of shore fire-control parties by blasting a Japanese troop concentration of about 150 men in the Gumularang River Valley of Basilan Island, giving support to American Army and guerilla troops. She anchored off the Santa Cruz Bank from 20 to 24 March.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months of}} hot weather {{and lack of}} {{maintenance}} facilities took a toll on De Soto's boilers and she returned to New Orleans, Louisiana, for temporary repairs in early October. A backlog of work and lack of funds forced <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> David Farragut to send De Soto north, however, and the steamer arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard only on 18 November. Two months of repair work followed, during which time Cmdr. Walker was promoted to Captain. At this time, De Sotos battery was also changed, to one [...] Dahlgren, one 30-pounder Parrot rifle, six 32-pound rifles and two 12-pound smoothbores.|$|E

The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years, and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014. <b>Rear</b> <b>Adm.</b> John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the Pentagon was unaware of Pakistan's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan: [...] "The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat, and they continue to go after that threat."

Senior Airman Randy Phillips, after conducting a social media campaign seeking encouragement coming out and already out to his military co-workers, came out to his father on the evening of September 19. When the video of their conversation he posted on YouTube went viral, it made him, in one journalist's estimation, [...] "the poster boy for the DADT repeal". The moment the repeal took effect at midnight on September 19, US Navy Lt. Gary C.
