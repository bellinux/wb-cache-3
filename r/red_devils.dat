5|$|Broughton Rangers {{were founded}} in 1877 {{and won the}} Rugby League Challenge Cup in the 1901–02 and 1910–11 seasons. The club folded in 1955, but were {{reformed}} as a local amateur club in 2007 {{with the support of}} Salford <b>Red</b> <b>Devils.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{knockout}} round, United were drawn against Lyon, against whom they drew the away leg 1–1, {{thanks to a}} late equaliser from Carlos Tevez. The <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> then won the second leg 1–0 – Ronaldo scoring the only goal – to ensure a 2–1 aggregate win and {{a place in the}} quarter-finals, where they were again drawn against Roma.|$|E

5|$|Salford <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> is the city's rugby league {{club and}} has been based in Salford since 1873. They {{participate}} in the European Super League. Salford now play all home games at the AJ Bell Stadium. Junior rugby league is also played within Salford's boundaries, with Langworthy Reds, Folly Lane and Salford City Roosters amongst other clubs providing playing personnel to the senior club.|$|E
5|$|Salford {{is home to}} {{a number}} of past and present rugby league teams. Founded in 1873, Salford <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> play in the Super League at the AJ Bell Stadium, in Barton, Salford. They are 6 times Champions and they won the Challenge Cup in 1938, and have {{experienced}} two previous stretches in the Super League, 1997–2002 and 2004–2007. In 2008 they won the Northern Rail Cup beating Doncaster 60-0 in the Final at Blackpool. They previously won the same trophy in 2003. They also won the National League 1 Grand Final in 2008, beating Celtic Crusaders after extra time in Warrington. Construction on a new 20,000 seat £35 million pound stadium was complete in 2012. Now named the AJ Bell stadium it is home to Salford <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> and Sale Sharks rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> {{signed off}} their disappointing {{campaign}} {{on a high}} at home to Leeds and a comfortable victory away to the already relegated Barnsley. Alex Ferguson vowed to regain the trophy next season and promised {{a whole host of}} new signings, starting with Dutch defender, Jaap Stam.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} Axis forces surrendered on 13 May 1943 {{bringing the}} Tunisian campaign {{to an end}} with a cost to the 1st Parachute Brigade of 1,700 killed, wounded or missing. They had nevertheless proved themselves in combat and been nicknamed the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> by the German forces they had fought against.|$|E
5|$|After his NFL career ended, Lillard {{joined the}} Westwood Cubs of the Pacific Coast Football League for the 1934 season, {{throwing}} the most touchdown passes of any {{player in the}} league and compiling the second-most touchdowns on runs. In 1935, he drew interest from coach Fritz Pollard, who was leading the New York Brown Bombers, a semi-professional team of African-American players. Based in Harlem, the team competed against minor league sides and clubs not affiliated with a league. Lillard had played for a Chicago team coached by Pollard before entering the NFL, and decided to join the Brown Bombers. In his first game with the team, on October 13, 1935, Lillard scored two touchdowns against the Cagle All-Stars in a 28–6 New York win. After three more victories, the Brown Bombers faced the Passaic <b>Red</b> <b>Devils,</b> a three-time champion of Eastern American football leagues. Despite suffering from an illness, Lillard converted a drop kick attempt and intercepted a pass, returning it 52yards for a touchdown. He was responsible for all of the Brown Bombers' points in their 10–3 win over the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils.</b> Lillard stayed with the Brown Bombers through the 1937 season; the team went out of business in 1938. That year, {{he was a member of}} an All-Star team of black players that played an exhibition game against the Bears, losing 51–0.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, The Telegraph {{reported}} that Miller {{would be allowed}} to leave Manchester United, should the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> receive a suitable offer. It was made clear that Miller was not part of Alex Ferguson's plans when, despite the huge number of senior players missing, he was still only a substitute in the opening game of the Red Devils' tour of South Africa against Orlando Pirates on 16 July 2006. On 31 August 2006, he moved to Sunderland for free on a three-year deal, joining up with new Sunderland manager and former team-mate Roy Keane. He left Manchester United after playing just nine league games in two seasons.|$|E

5|$|In rugby league, Wigan Warriors, Salford <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> and Leigh Centurions {{compete in}} the Super League, the {{top-level}} professional rugby league football club competition in Europe. Wigan have won the Super League/Rugby Football League Championship twenty–one times, the Challenge Cup nineteen times, and the World Club Challenge three times. Swinton Lions, Oldham Roughyeds and Rochdale Hornets play in the second tier Championship. There is also a large network of junior/community rugby league clubs across the metropolitan area which act as feeder teams to the elite sides, the most notable being Manchester Rangers. In rugby union, Stockport's Sale Sharks {{compete in the}} Guinness Premiership, and won the league in 2006. Whitefield based Sedgley Park RUFC compete in National Division One, Manchester RUFC in National Division Two and Wigan side Orrell R.U.F.C. in National Division Three North.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{suffered}} an injury-hit and frustrating {{season in the}} 2000–01 season, having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football. He managed only fivegoals in 19games in the league. The 2001–02 season was much better though; Shearer bagged 23goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth — their highest standing since 1997 — meaning they would qualify for the following season's Champions League competition. One {{of the most memorable}} incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle's 4–3 win over the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> in September 2001. Shearer also saw red {{for the second time in}} his career this season, after allegedly elbowing an opposition player in a match against Charlton Athletic. The card was subsequently rescinded by referee Andy D'Urso after reviewing video replays after the game.|$|E
5|$|Their first-ever {{appearance}} at Wembley Stadium saw the Eagles facing Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. Gary O'Reilly opened the scoring and Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch {{as a substitute}} to take the tie to extra time, before scoring again early in the extra period. Mark Hughes scored a third for United to leave the game drawn 3–3 and requiring a replay. In the replay the Eagles wore a new one-off yellow and black striped shirt because the club {{did not have time}} to find their away strip. The replay saw United left-back Lee Martin cap a 40-yard run by slotting past Martyn to win the Cup for the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the 2002 World Cup, {{the team}} {{weakened}} {{with the loss}} of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from Euro 2004 until Euro 2012, and went through an equal number of head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions Greece meant nothing but a small comfort. In between, a promising new generation was maturing at the 2007 European U-21 Championship; Belgium's squad qualified for the following year's Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the Young <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> squad finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an immediate impact. Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked Armenian team in September 2009. After Georges Leekens' second stint as national manager, his assistant Marc Wilmots became the caretaker in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed {{the chance to go}} top of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat in the league and extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E
5|$|On 11October 1900, Beerschot AC honorary {{president}} Jorge Díaz announced that Antwerp would host {{a series of}} challenge matches between Europe's best football teams. After some organisational problems, on 28April 1901, Beerschot's pitch hosted its first tournament, in which a Belgian A-squad and a Dutch B-team contested the Coupe Vanden Abeele. Belgium won, and beat the Netherlands in all three follow-up games; FIFA does not recognise these results because Belgium fielded some English players. On 1 May 1904, the Belgians played their first official game, against France at the Stade du Vivier d'Oie in Uccle; their draw left the Évence Coppée Trophy unclaimed. Twenty days later, the football boards of both countries were among the seven FIFA founders. At that time, the Belgian squad was chosen by a committee drawn from the country's six or seven major clubs. In 1906, the national team players received the nickname <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> because of their red jerseys, and four years later, Scottish ex-footballer William Maxwell replaced the UBSSA committee as their manager. From 1912, UBSSA governed football only and was renamed UBSFA. During the Great War, the national team only played unrecognised friendlies, with games in and against France.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Parachute Brigade was an {{experienced}} formation, initially under {{command of the}} 1st Airborne Division before being detached from the division to fight in North Africa. The brigade had taken part in the landings in Algeria in November 1942 and the subsequent Battle of Tunisia, during which each of the brigade's three parachute battalions had taken part in their own battalion-sized parachute landings. It was during this campaign that the 1st Parachute Brigade had been given their nickname the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> by the Germans. A British parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three rifle companies. Each of the companies were divided into a small headquarters and three platoons. The platoons had three sections; each section had a Bren machine gun and a 2-inch mortar {{as well as the}} men's own personal weapons. The only heavy weapons in the parachute battalion were in the 3-inch Mortar platoon and the Vickers machine gun platoon which were part of the battalion headquarters.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 2009 several Hells Angels {{and allied}} <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> {{performed}} {{a raid on}} an Outlaws clubhouse in Kortrijk. Shots were fired and three Outlaws were wounded before the Hells Angels and their <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> comrades fled the scene. The incident occurred after members of the Outlaws supposedly pushed over a motorcycle belonging to <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> president Johan F. in Moeskroen. The raid is also {{thought to be a}} part of a territorial dispute between the Hells Angels and the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> on one side and the Outlaws on the other. Several months before the raid, on July 24, 2009, members of the <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> and Hells Angels already retaliated by setting fire to motorcycles outside an Outlaws clubhouse. Eventually six Hells Angels and two <b>Red</b> <b>Devils</b> were convicted for attempted murder and given sentences from five to twenty years in prison.|$|E
