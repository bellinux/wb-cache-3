40|$|Abstract The {{ambition}} {{to increase the}} production of paper has made paper machine <b>runnability</b> widely studied in recent decades. Paper machine <b>runnability</b> is often measured {{by the number of}} web breaks in comparison with paper machine speed. When <b>runnability</b> is good, a machine can be run at the desired speed with the least possible number of breaks. Web break sensitivity means the number of breaks in a day, which can also be understood as a measurement of paper machine <b>runnability.</b> This study presents an application for the evaluation of web break sensitivity in a paper machine. A web break sensitivity indicator was built using the basic principles of case-based reasoning with a linguistic equations approach and basic fuzzy logic. The indicator combines on-line measurement data with expert knowledge and provides a continuous indication of break sensitivity. Web break sensitivity defines the current operating situation at the paper mill and provides new information to operators. Web break sensitivity is presented as a continuous signal with information about actual web breaks depicted as an eight-hour trend. The trend shows how the situation has developed and the current value gives a prediction for the next 24 hours if the situation stays as it is now. Together with information about the most important variables, this prediction gives operators enough time to react to the changing operating situation. From the methodological point of view, a new tool for building case-based reasoning applications for other purposes was also tested and found to be suitable for diagnostic applications...|$|E

Take-off trials using 24 standard materials on a pouch making machine type Transwrap 125 H were expected to contribute to offering remedial measures for this shortcoming. Bending stiffness, coefficient of friction and tensile strength turned out to be determinant for <b>runnability.</b> Depending on the type of machine available, there is an upper limit of bending stiffness and coefficient of friction; values above these limits will considerably complicate processing. In the present case, bending stiffness was abt. 80 mNm²/m and the coefficient of friction was abt. 0, 2. An acute risk of break was indicated, when the tensile strength of packaging materials was less than the quintuple of the relevant take-off forces.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{to gain a better}} {{understanding}} of the effect of reinforcement pulp beating on the strength of mechanical pulp-dominated paper. The main purpose of reinforcement pulp beating is to improve the <b>runnability</b> of paper. The first objective of this study was to maximize the <b>runnability</b> related strength properties by beating. It was assumed that the flaw-resisting ability of paper correlates with the <b>runnability</b> of the dry paper web. In-plane fracture properties were assumed to describe the flaw-resisting ability. The second objective was to understand the mechanism how beating affects paper strength and structure (e. g. the size of the fracture process zone). It was found that the reinforcement pulp ranking and optimisation of beating depend on the criteria used. The selection of critical strength properties affects the pulp ranking - sometimes different methods give opposite results (e. g. neutral sulphite vs. kraft). It was found that beating does not increase the in-plane fracture energy of mechanical pulp-dominated paper. Fracture toughness and elastic breaking strain increase only a little. However, tensile strength, elastic modulus and z-directional strength properties increase. It was concluded that beating does not significantly improve the flaw-resisting ability of mechanical pulp-dominated paper, while the strength of unflawed paper does increase. It was found that the fracture properties of mixture sheets cannot be estimated based only on fracture properties of pure components. The additivity behaviour of fracture properties was strongly non-linear. The fracture energy of pulp mixtures seems to correlate mainly with the average fibre length (and not with the beating level). Beating increases the fracture energy per fracture zone area in the pure chemical pulp sheets but not in the mixture sheets. Evidently beating does not increase the energy needed to open interfibre bonds in mechanical pulp-dominated paper. The results can be explained by the beating induced increase in both interfibre bonding and fibre segment activation. It was also found necessary to divide bonding into in-plane and out-of-plane components. The results largely support the activation theory originally presented in the 1960 's. However, no direct measurement of activation was used in this study. Low-freeness mechanical pulp seems to have as high (in-plane) interfibre bonding as but lower activation than beaten reinforcement pulp. Therefore reinforcement pulp beating improves bonding-related properties such as elastic breaking strain or in-plane fracture energy only marginally. On the other hand, properties strongly dependent on activation, such as elastic modulus and tensile strength, are increased by reinforcement pulp beating. reviewe...|$|E

This enables the construction of a layered model in which the information provided by measurements is propagated to infer about higher level concepts of quality, eventually supporting decision making.

40|$|Geometric and {{rotational}} {{errors of}} the paper machine rolls have a direct influence {{on the quality of}} the finished paper and may also weaken the <b>runnability</b> of the machine. In the calender section where the paper gets the final structure and finish, the surface temperature of a thermo roll may be 250 °C or even more. High temperature causes roll deformations such as bending and so-called polygon effect. The measurements of the roll geometry are usually carried out in the workshop conditions. However, to find out the true dynamic behavior of the rolls requires that the measurements should be done in the real operating conditions during the process. This is difficult and often impossible to do because of the harsh environment and issues with the sensor mounting. Many conventional displacement measuring methods are sensitive to either the target material properties or to the environment. In this study, a device and a method for the in situ measurement of a roll shell runout based on the measurement of radial acceleration of the surface was described. In this method, an acceleration sensor attached to a sliding probe is held against the rotating roll surface. Acquired acceleration signal is averaged and double integrated using a computer to get the surface displacement, i. e., runout. A number of measurements were done to demonstrate the applicability of the method. The laboratory measurements showed that it was possible to measure runout with an adequate accuracy. The case measurements showed that by using the method it was possible to detect and measure phenomena in the rotating rolls that were difficult or impossible to measure earlier. The method can be used, for example, for applications related to problem solving in the paper quality and <b>runnability</b> issues, online geometry measurement and balancing...|$|E

How has this development affected the paper selection of printing firms? Only paper suppliers who successfully anticipate the changing needs of the printing firms {{will be able to}} benefit from the industry trend. This paper employs a probability model to analyze a survey data set of 103 digital printing firms in the USA and Canada. The research idea is to link the firm s paper selection with the firm s characteristics in order to gain insights into the printing firm s paper purchase behavior and the overall industry structure. The first part of this work investigates the importance of certain paper aspects, such as price, <b>runnability</b> and print quality. Strikingly, a company s involvement in digital printing, measured by the percent of digital printers {{of the total number of}} printers in the firm, is a central determinant of the importance of all paper aspects analyzed. This finding underscores the tremendous importance of the printing firms transition to digital printing for the Paper Industry. Paper <b>runnability</b> is found to become more important the faster the firm grows and can be explained by the fact that more successful firms incur higher opportunity costs from downtime. Another key finding is that the importance of paper price is lower for firms who collaborate with their customer on the paper selection and are able to pass on cost increases in the paper price. The second part involves a more direct assessment of paper selection. Here, the firm s characteristics are utilized to explain the choice of coated versus uncoated paper for the printing job. The analysis shows that firms involved in sophisticated print services, such as Digital Asset Management or Variable Data Printing are more likely to use the high quality coated paper. Further it is found that the usage of coated paper increases with catalog printing whereas it decreases with book and manual printing. M. S.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out the reasons why the long fibres of mechanical pulp do not seem to reinforce paper as effectively as chemical reinforcement pulp. A preliminary laboratory trial showed that artificially increasing the average fibre length of TMP pulp by adding long fibres extracted from the same pulp increased the tear index, but decreased the tensile strength, internal bond strength and the fracture energy. Increasing the average fibre strength with chemical (NBSK) pulp fibres improved all of those properties considerably. In the second trial fibre properties and reinforcement ability of various mechanical pulps were investigated. It was shown that fibre dimensions of mechanical pulp fibres did not differ essentially from chemical pulp fibres. The biggest differences were in the properties characterizing the cell wall structure. This was clearly seen in fibre flexibility and fibre swelling (WRV), for instance. Mechanical pulp fibres are evidently more damaged than chemical pulp fibres which is seen as a much lower fibre strength (zero-span tensile strength). The reinforcement potential, on the grounds of fracture energy, tear strength and tensile strength of handsheets was much lower for mechanical pulp fibres than for chemical pulp. In the third trial, mechanical (MRP) and chemimechanical reinforcement pulp (CMRP) was manufactured from Norway spruce (P. abies) on a pilot scale. The focus was to increase fibre flexibility, bonding ability and maintain the fibre length and strength. The <b>runnability</b> of LWC base paper made from the trial pulps was tested using the KCL AHMA <b>runnability</b> tester. In spite of the good strength properties of the trial pulps, they did not have the same overall reinforcement ability than chemical pulp. The sulphonated trial pulp (CMRP) gave the same tensile stiffness and tensile strength as the chemical pulp. However, the fracture properties and extensibility of the paper was worse with it. The lower average length of the trial pulps did not explain the difference totally. Scaling the fibre length with the zero-span tensile strength improved the explanatory power essentially. It was concluded that the low fibre strength is the basic reason for the poorer reinforcement ability of mechanical pulps fibres over chemical ones...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the interactions of microbial activity, biocide usage and creation, and chemical changes in the papermaking process. The main focus was on oxidative biocide systems. In addition, new measurement and biocide production methods were applied to papermaking, and evaluated for the monitoring {{and control of the}} microbiological state and biocide usage. The measurement methods were based on portable handheld online equipments whereas the biocide production was based on electrochemical generation of biocides. The trials were mainly performed in pilot scale with actual process samples and complemented with a few laboratory trials. Most of the pilot results were verified in several field studies at paper machines. In the studies also the applicability of monitoring tools were evaluated. Biocide dosing itself, paper machine breaks, and poor management of broke generated chemical variations, which were detrimental to the papermaking process. Spoilage of broke due to poor broke management and poor biocide performance decreased the system pH, increased the conductivity, and caused the defects to the web. These chemical variations were also observed to cause variations in the cationic demand values. This probably caused unwanted particle flocculation generating the spots and holes to the web. Base paper defects were observed to cause <b>runnability</b> problems also at the coating machine. This cyclicity, where chemical variations cause breaks and breaks cause chemical variations, should be eliminated in order to restore good <b>runnability.</b> When revealing many such cause-effect relations and hidden phenomena, hand-held instrumentation gives additional references for existing basic measurements such as pH, conductivity, and redox potential. This work also took in use measurements which have not been traditionally used in papermaking such as measurement of halogens, dissolved calcium, and dissolved oxygen contents. ATP content measurement using a portable luminometer was found to be useful and easy-to-use method for evaluating microbial activity and optimizing biocide performance at paper mills.

Higher ratios of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) to clay in mixed pigment coatings resulted in higher static and kinetic coefficients of friction (COFs). Microroughness {{in the order of}} pigment particle size is considered to relate to COF, because cube-shaped particles of PCC resist sliding. Calendering decreased COF at larger amounts of PCC, but did not change COF of the sole clay formulation at all. Addition of ground calcium carbonate (GCC) decreased COF. The rate of decrease in kinetic COF with increasing number of sliding for the GCC-rich formulation was higher than that for the PCC-rich formulation, presumably because protruding parts, characteristic of the GCC-rich formulation, on the surface were selectively flattened. Addition of styrene-butadiene (SB)-latex up to 14 pph decreased COF, but static COF had the highest value at 18 pph. The antislip property (as a rubber) of SB-latex developed only in the static mode. Among lubricants formulated, the wax type decreased COF the most remarkably with more effect on kinetic COF than on static COF.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the probability of}} fracture in {{a system in which}} a material travels supported by rollers. The moving material is subjected to longitudinal tension for which deterministic and stochastic models are studied. In the stochastic model, the tension is described by a multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The material is assumed to have initial cracks perpendicular to the travelling direction, and a stochastic counting process describes the occurrence of cracks in the longitudinal direction of the material. The material is modelled as isotropic and elastic, and LEFM is applied. For a general counting process, when there is no fluctuation in tension, the reliability of the system can be simulated by applying conditional sampling. With the stochastic tension model, considering fracture of the material leads to a first passage time problem, the solution of which is estimated by simulation. As an example, the probability of fracture is computed for periodically occurring cracks with parameters typical to printing presses and paper material. The numerical results suggest that small cracks are not likely to affect the pressroom <b>runnability.</b> The results also show that tension variations may significantly increase the probability of fracture...|$|E

The separation efficiency of ink, stickies, and wood extractives was studied by using a flotation scheme in which the froth was generated by the white water’s inherent surface active components without any chemical addition. The removal efficiency of detrimental contaminants was considered in relation to total losses of solid materials. The results showed that while not all white waters were able to produce stabile froth, those that generated froth also exhibited substantial separation of contaminants in the froth. With a moderate removal of 10 % of total solids from white waters, removal of 45 % of stickies, 27 % of ink, and 20 to 50 % of wood extractives was observed. Higher removal of contaminants resulted in solids losses at levels that are not economically feasible in paper production. The results showed that selective white water flotation can have beneficial results for papermaking processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{trend in}} paper machines is towards an increased running speed. At the same time, the paper produced {{must have a}} higher and more even quality. In printing papers the main end-use properties and quality components are <b>runnability,</b> printability, and print quality. These coexistent requirements create new demands for the behaviour of rolls under production conditions. High quality printing paper grades are coated. In blade coating {{the thickness of the}} coating film on the paper surface is found to be heavily dependent on the run-out of the backing roll which supports the paper web against the metering blade. The run-out tolerance of backing rolls at running speed has lately been 50  µm and should be substantially reduced in the future. The new tolerances can no longer be met by tightening the traditional roll manufacturing tolerances. A new predictive 3 D grinding method has been developed to improve roll behaviour in the paper production environment. It consists of a measuring system, which can verify the rotational and geometry errors of the roll at running speed, and a 3 D grinding system, which controls the grinding process according to the information gained by these measurements. In this study, the new method was applied to the backing rolls of a coating station. The experiments were carried out in a paper mill, on a medium-weight coated (MWC) paper production line. The paper was analysed before and after the predictive 3 D grinding. The predictive 3 D grinding reduced the machine direction (MD) ash variation caused by the backing rolls by an average of 76  %. Ash variation correlates well with coating variation. As a result of a more even coating film, MD gloss variation was reduced by 82  %. Reduced gloss variation improves the print quality of LWC paper. The variation in thickness caused by the backing rolls was reduced by 74  %. More even paper thickness reduces excitations and therefore improves <b>runnability</b> in calendering, winding, and printing. A new paradigm for roll grinding was set. The applications of the technology are not limited to high-speed paper machine rolls; the method can also be applied to different kinds of nips of rolls. The method can compensate for a systematic error causing nip force variation, such as uneven thermal expansion or the uneven flexural stiffness of a roll. The technology can be applied in different industries, such as the steel, plastics, or aluminium industries. With this method, it is also possible to use rolls in applications which have requirements too high to be met by traditional technology. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Creasing and folding {{are vital}} {{processes}} in manufacturing of liquid and cartonboard packages. The {{quality of the}} crease and the subsequent folding is essential for good <b>runnability</b> and aesthetic appearance. The out-of-plane mechanical properties of cartonboard are particularly import in these processes. In this paper, recent advances in analysis of creasing and folding, using numerical simulations {{by means of the}} finite element method and the through-thickness shear strength profile of cartonboard, are presented. Existing methods to determine the out-of-plane shear strength of paper materials only give the strength in the weakest layer. In order to capture the through-thickness variation in shear strength the laminated notched shear test was introduced. In the simulations, the cartonboard was represented by a combination of continuum and cohesive models in order to capture the bulk and delamination properties, respectively. The continuum model was calibrated for each ply by testing individual plies that were isolated by grinding, and the cohesive model was calibrated using shear strength data from laminated notched shear tests. Results from the simulations are compared with creasing and folding experiments and the agreement is excellent considering the relative simplicity of the analysis. Finally, practical implications for trouble-shooting creasing and folding problems will be discussed. QC 2012060...|$|E
