50|$|Though not {{actually}} a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), Belgian society and politics were heavily {{affected by the}} conflict, {{and in particular the}} fear of invasion by either side.

5000|$|<b>Remplacement</b> militaire (French for [...] "{{military}} replacement") was {{the name}} for a policy of military conscription which originated in France and Belgium in the 19th century. Under the system, wealthy citizens chosen for military service by lot could pay a sum of money, originally enough to pay someone else to serve in their place, instead of being made to join the military themselves. It was abolished in Belgium in 1913 and replaced by a system of service militaire personnel ("personal military service"): a form of universal conscription.|$|E

50|$|Aware of the country's {{precarious}} geopolitical situation, a {{new military}} bill {{was signed by}} King Leopold II in 1909, initiating major military reforms. These {{put an end to}} the system of <b>remplacement,</b> in which wealthy conscripts could pay a replacement to take their place in the army, and introduced a more egalitarian form of military conscription based on age group. Beyond the acquisition of a few new Krupp artillery pieces, there was little attempt to modernise the army's equipment. Further reforms were launched after the Agadir Crisis in 1911 under the leadership of the Charles de Broqueville government. After several years of discussion, a major military reform bill was ratified by the parliament in 1913 by which the total possible strength of the army would be gradually increased from 180,000 to 350,000 men. Military spending also rose. This reform had only been partially implemented by the outbreak of war and Belgium's army was still considered to be weak by the German military leadership.|$|E

5000|$|The Garde mobile ("Mobile Guard"; {{also called}} Garde {{nationale}} mobile {{though it had}} nothing to do with the Garde nationale) was intended to be the body which would in effect conscript all who had been able to avoid military service. The Garde would also take in all conscripts on completion of their army service. Napoleon III took up the idea and announced on 12 December 1866 that the Garde Mobile would eventually attain a strength of 400,000 troops. Its members were colloquially known as [...] "Moblots". It origins lay in the crises that led up to the Franco-Prussian War, when Adolphe Niel, Minister of War for France under Emperor Napoleon III, attempted to bolster French military power creating a service which would provide reserves to be added to the regular French army. Although there was conscription into the army, not only was it not universal but middle-class people could purchase exemptions for their sons in a system known as <b>Remplacement.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the primary}} sources {{maintain}} that, from around 1786, Madame Saint-Huberty's voice had begun to deteriorate alarmingly. One of these was Dauvergne, {{the director of the}} Opéra, who, long before that time, had become completely exasperated by Saint-Huberty's erratic and volatile behaviour. He mentions this deterioration in a memorandum dated 21 July 1787, where he complains that she had had to withdraw from several important roles which she no longer felt capable of singing. He points to the fact that whilst she was happy to perform twice a day when on tour, she insisted on limiting her performances at the Opéra to one (or occasionally two) per week. In conclusion, he predicts that her singing career would be over within two years - or less than that, if she were to undertake another provincial tour. Another was Gossec, who, in a letter of 8 November 1786, comments that Madame Saint-Huberty was rushing inexorably towards her own destruction. However, both Dauvergne and Gossec express their concern that no obvious candidate to take Saint-Huberty's place was in sight - thus indicating that, in 1786/87, Saint-Huberty was still regarded, by the director {{and the head of the}} École de chant, as the pre-eminent soprano at the Opéra, and one whom they considered was some way ahead of M.lle Maillard (premier sujet) and M.lle Dozon (premier <b>remplacement).</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{experimental}} observation of a "devil's staircase'' {{in a time}} dependent system considered as a paradigm for the transition to large scale chaos in the universality class of hamiltonian systems. A test electron beam is used to observe its non-self-consistent interaction with externally excited wave(s) in a Travelling Wave Tube (TWT). A trochoidal energy analyzer records the beam energy distribution at {{the output of the}} interaction line. An arbitrary waveform generator is used to launch a prescribed spectrum of waves along the slow wave structure (a 4 m long helix) of the TWT. The resonant velocity domain associated to a single wave is observed, as well as the transition to large scale chaos when the resonant domains of two waves and their secondary resonances overlap. This transition exhibits a "devil's staircase'' behavior for increasing excitation amplitude, due to the nonlinear forcing by the second wave on the pendulum-like motion of a charged particle in one electrostatic wave.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The century {{following}} the capitulation of Montreal in 1760 saw {{the end of}} one British Empire and the inauguration of a second one. Though charged with the responsibility of provicling education for the people of Canada, the earlier Crown-appointed Govemors General failed to do so, but later ones were to play a larger role in having these benefits secured for the people. They were important in securing the provisions of the will of James McGill which gave to Canada its flISt undenominational university. Models derived from practices in Edinburgh, at the Royal High Schoal and the University, proved helpful in the struggle for an independent Board of Governors and in their subsequent actions. The personal characteristics of these governors, their approach to the appoint-ment of a new Principal, mer a series of temporary appointments, the·men considered for the appointment, and the final selection of].

40|$|Abstract: The {{prevalence}} of stand-replacing {{fire in the}} formation of Table Mountain pine- pitch pine (Pinus pungens Lamb. and Pinus r i g i h Mill., respectively) communities was investigated with dendrochronological techniques. Nine stands in Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee were analyzed for age structure, species recruitment trends, and radial growth patterns to determine whether they had originated as a result of stand-replacing fires. The oldest pines date from the late 1700 s or early 1800 s. Continuous or frequent episodic pine regeneration from those times to the early to mid 1900 s was evident at all sites. During {{the first half of the}} 20 th century, all sites experienced large surges in pine regeneration. However, no clear evidence of stand-replacing wildfires could be definitively linked to these surges. Rather, the regeneration appeared to have been caused by noncatastrophic surface fires and canopy disturbances occur-ring together or by the cessation of a frequent fire regime. For the past 25 - 50 years, there has been little pine regener-ation at any of the sites. Restoring the dual disturbance regime of periodic fires and canopy disturbances should help sustain 'l'able Mountairi pine- pitch pine communities in southern Appalachian Mountains landscapes.

40|$|Abstract: In the Pacific Northwest, {{the process}} of conifer {{development}} after stand-replacing disturbance {{has important implications for}} many forest processes (e. g., carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity). This paper examines conifer development in the Coast Range Province and Western Cascades Province of Oregon using repeat interpretation of historic aerial photographs from 1959 to 1997 to examine the canopy cover change of different life forms: shrubs, hardwood trees, and conifer trees. Ninety-four stands from the Western Cascades Province and 59 stands from the Coast Range Province were photointerpreted in roughly 5 -year intervals. A Chapman–Richards growth function was used to model conifer cover development for all sample stands. Based on the photo data and the Chapman–Richards function, these stands were classified into one of seven early forest successional trajectories defined by the vegetation physiognomy. Succession in the Coast Range Province and Western Cascades Province were compared using parame-ters derived from the Chapman–Richards growth function. Our results echo previous studies in that rates and densities of conifer regeneration varied markedly among sites; however, our results also indicate that early forest succession dif-fers in the two study regions in terms of both trajectories and rates. Conifer regeneration in the Western Cascades Province tends to have longer delays in establishing and slower rates compared with the Coast Range Province.
