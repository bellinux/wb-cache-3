When Adolf returns and hears of the supervisor's actions, he fights Frederick and knocks him out. Ervine, meanwhile, has heard that her lover has <b>returned</b> <b>and</b> {{goes to the}} hut in the woods, nearly fainting after being caught in a downpour.

5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is <b>returned,</b> <b>and</b> blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} structural oil price shocks on the covariance of U. S. stock market <b>return</b> <b>and</b> stock market volatility. We construct from daily data on <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility the covariance of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility at monthly frequency. The measures of daily volatility are realized-volatility at high frequency (normalized squared return), conditional-volatility recovered from a stochastic volatility model, and implied-volatility deduced from options prices. Positive shocks to aggregate demand and to oil-market specific demand are associated with negative effects on the covariance of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility. Oil supply disruptions are associated with positive effects on the covariance of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility. The spillover index between the structural oil price shocks and covariance of stock <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility is large and highly statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained following the testing of five hypotheses regarding conditional <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility of the most listed European stocks in the steel & iron subsector. The following elements of the stocks are analysed: time variation of volatility, seasonality of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility, relationship between <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility and volatility asymmetry. The results obtained confirm for all the analyzed stocks the existence of volatility variation in time, the lack of correlation between <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility, the existence of asymmetry phenomenon of volatility and the presence in some stocks of the seasonality effect both for <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} dynamic {{relationship}} between stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows in India by using a generalised VAR model. We find that spillover shocks-that is, stock <b>return</b> shocks <b>and</b> mutual fund flow shocks together explain as much as 20 % of the total forecast error variance of stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows. We create a spillover index of shocks emanating from stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows and tests whether it can actually predict stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows. We find it does. Using the spillover index, we forecast stock <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> mutual fund flows, devise trading strategies for a mean-variance investor, and demonstrate the economic significance of the spillover index...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} latent {{variables}} approach within a present-value model {{to estimate the}} expected <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> expected dividend growth rates of the aggregate stock market. This approach aggregates information contained {{in the history of}} price-dividend ratios and dividend growth rates to predict future <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> dividend growth rates. We find that <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> dividend growth rates are predictable with R-squared values ranging from 8. 2 % to 8. 9 % for <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> 13. 9 % to 31. 6 % for dividend growth rates.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> trading volume for three petroleum futures contracts. Using daily data on futures prices and trading volume, the study first tests for linear causality between <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volume. The results of this linear causality test show that futures <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volume have no predictive power for one another. However, because {{the distribution of the}} <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volume series provides some evidence of nonlinear dependence, the study formally tests for and finds evidence of significant nonlinearities in the <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volume for the three petroleum futures contracts.

5|$|Cyclone Cilla {{affected}} several {{islands in}} the South Pacific. The cyclone developed from a monsoon trough on January 26 northwest of Fiji, and initially moved to the east in conditions unfavourable for cyclones. After wind shear lessened, Cilla reached its peak intensity on January 28, attaining maximum winds of 75km/h (45mph) sustained over 10minutes. After slightly weakening, Cilla was able to intensify again to match this intensity on January 29. Strong vertical wind shear conditions then <b>returned,</b> <b>and</b> Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{equilibrium}} asset pricing with time-varying illiquidity.

This {{gives rise to a}} liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Further, if a security’s liquidity is persistent, a shock to its illiquidity results in low contemporaneous <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> high predicted future returns.

The study finds that equity <b>returns,</b> treasury <b>returns,</b> <b>and</b> corporate leverage are not co-integrated and, thus, a long run equilibrium relationship between the asset <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> risk does not exist.

The contemporaneous relation between <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volatility is positive. The relation between <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> one-week-ahead volatility is much weaker.

Furthermore, negative <b>and</b> positive excess <b>returns</b> are compared for each contract. Nonparametric tests are used to assess whether <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volumes are symmetric about the mean, concluding that daily <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> volumes are asymmetric. However, the results for monthly data are mixed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test suggests that although most contract returns appear asymmetric, soybean, cocoa and 10 -year US Treasury note returns are symmetric.
