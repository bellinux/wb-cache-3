50|$|In flow measurement, the {{turndown}} ratio indicates {{the range of}} flow that a flow meter is able to measure with acceptable accuracy. It {{is also known as}} <b>rangeability.</b> It is important when choosing a flow meter technology for a specific application. If a gas flow to be measured is expected to vary between 100,000 m³ per day and 1,000,000 m³ per day, the specific application has a {{turndown ratio}} of at 10:1. Therefore the meter requires a turndown ratio of at least 10:1. For example: if the meter had an advertised maximum flow of 2,000,000 m³ per day then the required turndown ratio would be 20:1.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In {{this study}} we {{demonstrate}} that a double-path ultrasonic transit-time gas flowmeter can be extended significantly in its <b>rangeability</b> by shifting the two receiving transducers by the same amount in flow direction, such that the length of one sound path is increased, the other decreased. Such an asymmetric configuration is optimized in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the range of higher flow velocities, because it compensates for the parasitic carry-along (sound drift) effect. Further, this approach enables the realization of an adaptive asymmetric UFM, where the two receiving transducers can be shifted during operation for optimum SNR depending on the gas flow velocity.

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effect of {{bifidobacteria}} combined with sulfasalazine on serum inflammatory factors and immune functions in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: A total of 126 UC patients were selected and randomly divided into observation group (66 cases) and control group (60 cases). The control group was given sulfasalazine, and the observation group was given bifidobacteria based on the control group. After treatment for 2 months, the differences of serum inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10) and immune function (T lymphocyte subsets CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 4 /CD 8 and immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM) {{between the two groups}} were observed. Results: After treatment, TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 8 in the two groups significantly decreased but IL- 10 significantly increased (P< 0. 05), <b>rangeabilities</b> of the above indexes in observation group were significantly greater than that in control group (P< 0. 05). CD 3, CD 4, CD 4 /CD 8 in the two groups significantly decreased but CD 8 significantly increased (P< 0. 05), and <b>rangeabilities</b> of the above indexes in observation group were significantly greater than that in control group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{scientific}} community has known about Fluidic Oscillation as a measurement technology for many years. Recent advances in this technology now {{make this a}} highly robust, cost-effective solution to metering needs. This paper will discuss the advances and benefits. Based on Bernoulli’s Theory- A slow moving high pressure gas becomes fast moving low pressure gas at the nozzle exit forming a jet of gas. The jet, once formed can be controlled by the Coanda effect using an obstacle in the flow {{that is designed to}} optimize the performance of the meter. Controlling the jet path enables formation of feedback nodes of pressure {{on either side of the}} jet. This provides a predictable oscillation of the jet. The metrology of the meter is only related to the mechanical design of the oscillation chamber and flow tranquilizer. The jet oscillations are detected using a thermo-resistive sensing device, which provides the data to the electronic index.

40|$|Many {{chemical}} and biological processes have pH control loops. Good pH control can be important for product quality as well as environmental compliance. The extraordinary <b>rangeability</b> and sensitivity of pH as a concentration measurement poses exceptional challenges in many aspects of pH design and implementation. Advances in dynamic modeling, basic control, and advanced control embedded in a Distributed Control System are introduced and illustrated with field test results for a plant waste treatment pH system. Examples are also presented on how these advances can be potentially used to reduce the project and operating costs for multi-stage pH systems. This paper details how models and control strategies are integrated in a DCS and used for an extensive variety of purposes. The model is used initially offline in a virtual plant to explore and prototype process control improvements running 10 to 100 times faster than real time. The improvements can be equipment, piping, and control system changes that reduce the capital and maintenance cost and reagent consumption that meet process objectives.

40|$|Flow-field {{study was}} {{conducted}} concerning vortex shedding from a circular cylinder with a slit normal to the stream. Experiments were carried out in a low-speed wind tunnel and a water channel, respectively, with emphasis {{on the impact of}} the slit width {{on the quality of the}} vortex shedding signal measured. It is found that among the cases studied, whose slit widths ranging from 0 to 0. 3 d, where d denotes the diameter of the circular cylinder, an optimal range of slit width, 0. 1 - 0. 15 d, was identified, within which not only the vortex shedding signals show the best quality, but also the relation of the Strouhal numbers against the Reynolds numbers studied appears to be the most linear. By spanwise correlation measurements made in the wind tunnel, it is further found that among the cases of s/d = 0, 0. 05, 0. 15, 0. 2, and 0. 3 studied, the vortex shedding flow structures of s/d = 0. 15 appear to be the most two-dimensional. Moreover, it is worthwhile to mention that for the slit circular cylinders, the signal quality of vortex shedding remains well acceptable for the Reynolds number as low as 2. 4 x 10 (3). Thus, the <b>rangeability</b> of flow measurement is increased significantly. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. National Science Council; Ministry of Educatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{onset of}} {{aerodynamic}} instabilities in {{proximity of the}} left margin of the operating curve {{represents one of the}} main limitations for centrifugal compressors in turbocharging applications. An anticipated stall/surge onset is indeed particularly detrimental at those high boost pressures that are typical of engine downsizing applications using a turbocharger. Several stabilization techniques have been investigated so far to increase the <b>rangeability</b> of the compressor without excessively reducing the efficiency. One of the most exploited solutions is represented by the use of upstream axial variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) to impart a pre-whirl angle to the inlet flow. In the pre-design phase of a new stage or when selecting, for example, an existing unit from an industrial catalogue, it is however not easy to get a prompt estimation of the attended modifications induced by the VIGV on the performance map of the compressor. A simplified model to this end is presented in the study. Figuring out a typical industrial pre-design phase, the model assumes the availability of the original performance data of the compressor without pre-whirl and only very few geometrical parameters. Based on fluid dynamic considerations and some additional models and correlations, a procedure is defined to correct the attended stage pressure ratio and efficiency {{as a function of the}} pre-whirl angle imposed by the VIGV. The model has been successfully validated using an experimental literature case study and is thought to represent a new useful preliminary tool for turbocharger designers...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the huge}} amount of power {{connected}} to centrifugal compressors' applications, even small <b>rangeability</b> increases of the stages would provide significant energy and money savings. In particular, industrial manufacturers pay {{lot of interest in}} better understanding the instabilities that in many cases define the minimum flow limit of their stages, but they are often hampered in the research by the short time-To-market. On the other hand, academia has historically found difficulties in approaching the problem {{due to the lack of}} dedicated experimental facilities. In this study, the concept design of a new research test rig is presented. The rig will be able to test impellers in field-like conditions (original mass flow and peripheral Mach numbers up to 0. 7), operating in open-loop configuration with ambient inlet conditions. In view of systematic test campaigns, a modular design will allow to easily replace any component of the asset and even to modify the flowpath after the impeller, so that the influence of each component can be estimated. As a research academic facility, the rig is characterized by some new design solutions, oriented to minimize the mechanical complexity, the energy consumption, the overall dimensions, and, finally, the cost. Moreover, it will be equipped with advanced experimental measurement instrumentation, e. g. a PIV system or fast response aerodynamic pressure probes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to address challenges associated with complex split-range {{control of a}} two-valves-in-parallel hybrid actuator. Split-range hybrid valve (HV) control aims {{to provide a more}} effective strategy to overcome flow problems associated with nonlinear valve flow coefficients and discontinuities while extending <b>rangeability.</b> The main issue is the trade-off between system performance, control scheme complexity, and the cost of extra equipment (multiple actuators). The hybrid configuration facilitates a large and small valve in an overlapping operating regime, providing the controller with some freedom to minimize the feedback error. The control challenge lies at the control valve boundaries where nonlinear transitions in mass flow rate occur. The aim of the complex split-range control is therefore to minimize the disturbance in the mass flow rate due to the mentioned valve non-idealities during critical valve transitions. A novel split-range control scheme is devised that comprises an integrated FLC, upper and lower boundary neural network (NN) signal predictors, a fuzzy logic inference system (FLIS), and a crisp controller to quantify all the control decisions that cannot be fuzzified. The NN predictors envisage the necessity for a large valve nonlinear transition in order to minimize its effect on the flow rate of the HV. Expert knowledge is used as basis for parameter definitions in the FLIS, thereby facilitating the implementation of control structures to address phenomena such as nonlinear mass flow transitions, valve stiction, and poor valve resolution. Simulation results indicate that the integrated FLC effectively coordinates and switches actuators for complex input requests, significantly reducing nonlinear transitions in the total mass flow rate compared to PID controlNational Research Foundation of South Africa TP 2011072600022 (UID) 72003; and M-Tech Industrial (Pty) Ltd[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 's, {{when the first}} {{commercial}} meters started to appear, Multiphase Flow Metering (MFM) has grown from being an area of R&D to representing a discipline {{in its own right}} within the oil and gas industry. The total figure for MFM installations worldwide is now over 1, 800. Field applications include production optimisation, wet gas metering, mobile well testing and production allocation. However, MFM has not yet achieved its full potential. Despite an impressive improvement in the reliability of sensors and mechanical parts (particularly for subsea installations) over the past few years, there remain unresolved questions regarding the accuracy and range of applicability of today's MFM technology. There is also a tendency to forget the complexity of multiphase flow and to evaluate the overall performance of a MFM as a "black box", often neglecting all the possible uncertainties that are inherent in each individual measurement solutions. This paper reviews the inherent limitations of some classical MFM techniques. It highlights the impact of instruments <b>rangeability,</b> empirical correlations for pressure drop devices and fluids characterisation on the error propagation analysis in the "black box". It also provides a comprehensive review of wet gas definitions for the oil and gas industry. Several {{attempts have been made to}} define "wet gas" for the purpose of metering streams at high gas-volume-fractions, but a single definition of wet gas still does not exist. The measurement of multiphase flows presents unique challenges that have not yet been fully resolved. However, the challenges are exciting and the authors have no doubts that new milestones will soon be set in this area. Today's MFM technology has already become one piece of the optimised production system jigsaw. MFM has succeeded in fitting with other technologies toward global field-wide solutions. The ideal MFM of the future is one that provides unambiguous measurements of key parameters from which the flow rates can be deduced independently from flow regimes and fluid properties.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 151 The {{essential}} elements {{to be reviewed}} when considering a centrifugal pump application are highlighted. The purpose is to ensure the procurement and/or application of a centrifugal pump which optimizes reliability, energy usage, maintenance costs, and achieves this in a safe manner. The {{need to understand the}} system hydraulics and complete process requirements is emphasized, as is the impact each system parameter has on pump design. The test is broken into three basic areas: pump boundaries conditions, flow requirements, and pump specification ? key elements. Pump boundary conditions addressed NPSH considerations as they relate to flow requirements, potential for cavitation damage, suction specific speed, and mechanical seal temperature margin. This section also addresses system resistance variations, and addresses the effects of variations in dynamic and static system heads and the potential prime causes of variations in these heads. Flow requirements discusses the determination of normal, maximum (or rated), and minimum flow requirements. A method of approximation of a pump?s minimum acceptable flowrate is presented (based on the pump?s hydraulic specifications), which utilizes suction specific speed and moderating factors such as impeller head, NPSH margin, specific gravity, etc. Attention is paid to the effect of excessive specified flow on NPSHA, flow <b>rangeability,</b> and suction specific speed. Mechanical and hydraulic interrelationships are discussed to emphasize how flowrate variations affect radial and axial thrust, impeller suction and discharge recirculation, and potential for cavitation; also covered are the effect of variation in running clearances and changes in specific gravity. Critical aspects of both parallel and series pump application are addressed. The dangers of incorrect parallel pump application are highlighted and guidelines are offered for correct application of parallel pumps. Series pump operation is discussed primarily in terms of percentage split in pumps? combined total head, pump protection and system protection. Pump Specification ? Key Elements addresses communicating to prospective pump vendors the key parameters that may determine the metallurgy, mechanical seal design and mechanical seal peripheral?s design, and pump hydraulic design best suited to the user?s requirements. The liquid specification is highlighted, the important site and operating conditions are addressed, and the importance of clearly defining the key performance requirements in full is discussed. The wrong pump, operated incorrectly coupled with poor maintenance practices, results in unsatisfactory hydraulic performance, high energy costs, high maintenance costs, poor reliability, and increases the potential for an unsafe failure. Proper specification and selection principles, coupled with the implementation of correct operating and maintenance practices, will result in optimized centrifugal pump application. The net result will be a pumping application that meets all process demands, with a minimum of energy usage, and low frequency of repair (high reliability), low overall maintenance costs, and low process debits. Key hydraulic and Performance Criteria are addressed along with their effects on performance, energy, reliability, energy, reliability, maintenance costs, and safety. The interrelationships that exist between hydraulic characteristics and the mechanical reliability is highlighted to ensure that neither are treated separately...|$|E
