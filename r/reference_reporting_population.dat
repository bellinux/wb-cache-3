40|$|Given the swath table files, {{the segment}} set for one country and cloud cover data, the SAGE program determines {{how many times}} and under what {{conditions}} each segment is accessed by satellites. The program writes a record for each segment on a data file which contains the pertinent acquisition data. The weather data file can also be generated from a NASA supplied tape. The Segment Acquisition Selector Program (SACS) selects data from the segment reference file based upon data input manually and from a crop window file. It writes the extracted data to a data acquisition file and prints two summary reports. The POUT program reads from associated LACIE files and produces printed reports. The major types of reports that can be produced are: (1) Substrate <b>Reference</b> Data <b>Reports,</b> (2) <b>Population</b> Mean, Standard Deviation and Histogram Reports, (3) Histograms of Monte Carlo Statistics Reports, and (4) Frequency of Sample Segment Acquisitions Reports...|$|R
40|$|Within a biopsychosocial approach, the {{objective}} of this research was to explore relational resources involved in coping with gastrointestinal disease. Using a battery of tests on social support, dyadic coping and closeness to others we compared a sample of 103 patients with gastrointestinal disease to the reference populations and we examined possible differences between organic or functional diagnosis. The subjects with gastrointestinal disease, in contrast to the <b>reference</b> <b>population,</b> <b>reported</b> greater perceived social support, less communication of stress, higher common dyadic coping strategies and higher negative dyadic coping (distancing from others). Subjects with functional diagnosis, compared to organic diagnosis, reported higher closeness with their significant other and higher use of negative coping towards them. Preliminary results suggest that patients with gastrointestinal disease perceive themselves well supported. Nevertheless they show a sort of relational ambivalence and do not always seem able to use social support adequately to cope with their disease...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Noise {{exposure}} {{is an important}} and highly prevalent occupational hazard in the construction industry. This study examines hearing threshold levels of a large population of Dutch construction workers and compares their hearing thresholds to those predicted by ISO- 1999. Methods In this retrospective study, medical records of periodic occupational health examinations of 29, 644 construction workers are analysed. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO- 1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and noise intensity, noise exposure time {{and the use of}} hearing protection. Results Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the <b>reference</b> <b>population</b> <b>reported</b> in ISO- 1999. Noise exposure explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily noise exposure level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown. The relation of exposure time and hearing loss found was similar to ISO- 1999 predictions when looking at durations of 10 years or more. For the first decade, the population medians show poorer hearing than predicted by ISO- 1999. Discussion Duration of noise exposure was a better predictor than noise exposure levels, probably because of the limitations in noise exposure estimations. In this population, noise-induced hearing loss was already present at the beginning of employment and increased {{at the same rate as}} is predicted for longer exposure duration...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reference</b> <b>reports</b> are a {{commonly}} used selection method in New Zealand and overseas. Although popular with practitioners, they have attracted little attention from researchers. To ascertain the predictive validity of <b>reference</b> <b>reports</b> a meta-analytic review was conducted. Results of the preliminary analysis provided a bare-bones estimated mean validity of 0. 15, and a fully corrected estimated mean validity of 0. 32. Substantial variance remained unaccounted for following corrections for sampling error. Subsequent moderated meta-analyses, based on degree of structure and psychometric soundness of the <b>reference</b> <b>reports,</b> {{was found to}} account {{for much of the}} variation in observed validity coefficients. Highly structured reports were found to be consistently superior to unstructured reports. Improvements in the validity of highly structured reports {{can be attributed to the}} control of leniency in ratings. However, no studies to date have evaluated the accuracy of referees' ratings. Drawing on the performance rating literature, an experimental study examining the influence of scale format, ratee characteristics, rating purpose, and rater affect on the accuracy of ratings was implemented. Asymmetrical, positively toned scales were found to reduce leniency in ratings compared to unstructured and Likert-type rating forms. Raters who expressed liking for the ratee were more lenient in their ratings compared to raters who expressed neutral or antagonistic feelings toward the ratee. No significant effects for rating purpose and ratee characteristics were apparent. Overall, the investigation points to deficiencies in the way <b>reference</b> <b>reports</b> are presently employed, and highlights the need for a more rigorous approach in their development and application...|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} {{of many of}} the unincorporated entities has historically been transitory, and some have rarely if ever <b>reported</b> any <b>population</b> at all. The only ones that have <b>reported</b> <b>population</b> in each census since 1900 are Dixville Township, Millsfield Township and Wentworth’s Location (bearing in mind that Wentworth’s Location was an incorporated town for many years prior to the 1960s). All three appear to have small but well-established population bases. Wentworth’s Location has <b>reported</b> a <b>population</b> of at least 37 in every post-1900 census. Dixville and Millsfield have consistently been in double figures throughout the same period (the only exceptions being Millsfield in 1960 and 1980); in both communities, a town clerk's office exist for the purpose of conducting elections for state and federal officials.
