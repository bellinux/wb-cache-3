50|$|Mixed member {{proportional}} representation (MMP), {{also called the}} additional member system (AMS), is a hybrid, two-tier system combining a non-proportional single-winner election and a compensatory regional or national party list PR election. MMP is similar to forms of {{proportional representation}} (PR) in that the overall total of party members in the elected body is intended to mirror the overall proportion of votes received; it differs by including a set of members elected by geographic constituency who are deducted from the party totals so as to maintain overall proportionality. Other forms of semi-proportional representation are based on, or at least use, party lists to work. Looking to the electoral systems effectively in use around the world, there are three general methods to <b>reinforce</b> the <b>majority</b> rule starting from basic PR mechanisms: parallel voting, majority bonuses, and extremely reduced constituency magnitude. An additional member system may <b>reinforce</b> <b>majorities</b> if the proportion of compensatory seats is too low.|$|R

5000|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} false consensus {{is closely related to}} the idea of pluralistic ignorance, and refers to the incorrect belief that others are similar, when in reality they are not.

Berkowitz, an independent consultant who works full-time to promote these ideas, describes false consensus and pluralistic ignorance as [...] "mutually <b>reinforcing</b> and self-perpetuating...the <b>majority</b> is silent because it thinks it is a minority, and the minority is vocal because it believes that it represents the majority" [...] (p. 194).|$|R

Directed by Palestinian Arab nationalists, the rebels opposed Zionism, the British presence in Palestine and Palestinian Arab politicians who called for pan-Arabic nationalism at the same time. Both the British and the Zionist organizations of the time opposed the revolt; nonetheless, the Palestinian Arab nationalists did obtain from the British a drastic reduction of Jewish immigration, legislated by the 1939 White Paper.

40|$|In the 110 th Congress (2007 - 2008) {{legislation}} {{related to}} climate change was introduced at a faster pace than in any previous Congress, yet it {{did not result in}} a corresponding increase in enacted climate-related laws. A pertinent example of the political infeasibility of climate policy change in the 110 th Congress is the case of tax credit extensions for production of renewable energy. While this issue in itself was uncontroversial, the extensions were only adopted in the 11 th hour, after innumerable failed attempts. With an analytical point of departure in Krehbiel's theory of pivotal politics, this paper seeks to identify pivotal legislators {{in the case of the}} tax credit extensions and discusses how changes in the composition of pivotal legislators in the 111 th Congress (2009 - 2010) may impact the prospects of moving climate legislation more generally. The analysis indicates that a majority of the legislative pivots in the case of tax credit extensions were Republican senators representing coal-producing states. In the case of climate change, however, the regional dimension is likely to be more significant for Democratic voting behaviour. Thus, the opportunity space for climate legislation in the 111 th Congress remains narrow even with a <b>reinforced</b> Democratic <b>majority</b> in Congress.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number and proportion {{of older people}} in our population and their migration into rural areas suggest that {{research is needed to}} examine the many socioeconomic problems unique to these persons. This study examined possible economic discrimination against the rural aged by testing the hypothesis that grocery stores in rural communities, especially in those rural communities experiencing sagging economics, may be surviving by practicing pricing policies that are adversely affecting the elderly residing in those communities. ^ The hypothesis was tested using an ordinary least squares multiple regression equation, where four community grocery food and nonfood price indices were selected as dependent variables and eleven explanatory variables were chosen. The four price indices, a dairy index, a meat index, a canned goods index, and a composite index, were generated through the use of questionnaires sent in January 1979 to 415 retail grocery stores located in 181 randomly selected Nebraska communities ranging in 1977 population from 266 to 24, 238; 140 questionnaires were returned, a response rate of 34 %. ^ With the exception of the dairy index, this study found no significant price differences in the selected food and nonfood items of the stores located in various Nebraska communities. These findings tended to <b>reinforce</b> the <b>majority</b> of similar empirical studies conducted in urban areas testing for possible price differences of similar stores located in different socioeconomic areas in cities. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBased on neuro-imaging {{studies in}} cocaine-addicted humans, it is {{hypothesized}} that increases in neural activity within several {{regions of the}} prefrontal cortex contribute to cue-induced cocaine seeking and cocaine-induced compulsive drug self-administration. However, electrophysiological tests of these hypotheses are lacking. In the present study, animals were trained to self-administer cocaine (0. 75 mg/kg) for 14 days. On the 14 th day, we conducted electrophysiological recordings of lateral orbitofrontal (LO) and ventral anterior insula (AIV) neurons. A subset of the combined population of recorded neurons showed a change in firing rate in association {{with one or more}} of the following discrete events: (1) presentation of a discriminative stimulus that signaled the onset of the self-administration session, (2) occurrence of the first cocaine-directed operant response, (3) occurrence of a cocaine-reinforced press, and (4) presentation of cues normally paired with delivery of the cocaine <b>reinforcer.</b> The <b>majority</b> of the stimulus- and response-related changes in firing involved a brief increase in firing during the stimulus and response event, respectively. In addition to these event-specific responses, approximately half of the recorded neurons exhibited a sustained change in average firing (i. e., discharges per 30 -s bin) during the cocaine self-administration session, relative to average firing during a presession, drug-free period (referred to as session changes). The prevalence of session-increases and decreases were not significantly different. These and other findings are discussed in relation to hypotheses about cue-evoked and cocaine-maintained cocaine-directed behavior...|$|R

This dissertation explores the nature and state of district representation in one case study city through the lens of a newly created citizen participation program. Elected executive and council members as well as city employees were interviewed and re-interviewed over a 2. 5 year period between 1999 [...] 2002. The dissertation suggests the possibility that underlying, even motivating, citizen participation and decentralization efforts in city government is a role definition for council representatives. Through interviewing, the study found that elected officials, including council members, make a clear distinction between city-wide and district-level representation, and a majority prefer that council representation be confined to the latter. The citizen participation effort in the case study city reflects and <b>reinforces</b> this <b>majority</b> view. A minority number of representatives were aware, however, that this role definition, and by extension the citizen participation program, limits their reach and ultimate effectiveness on issues actually vital to their constituents. Thus, while the citizen participation effort provided some needed ward assistance, by maintaining this distinction between ward and city, citizen participation efforts may disempower representatives and citizens. Because the majority in this study regards a more powerful or far-reaching district representation as negative, preferring instead a citizen participation or administrative-based approach to representation, the study suggests citizen participation itself should be made stronger and considered from a statutory perspective akin to federal bureaucratic decision-making...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA single {{proposer}} has {{the opportunity}} to generate a surplus by buying out the assets of a group of individuals. These individuals vote to accept or reject the monetary offer made to them by the proposer, who needs the agreement of a qualified majority. The voters rejecting the offer while the qualified majority is met are frozen out but they can claim compensation in exchange for their asset. This article analyses how compensation rules influence both the votes and the offer made by the proposer. The existence of a symmetric subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is ensured, and multiple equilibrium outcomes with the same offer can arise when compensation depends on the probability of acceptance by the voters. We show that increasing the offer does not always increase the probability of acceptance, in sharp contrast to many similar models. We identify the equilibrium offer when compensation does not depend on the proposal. Increasing compensation always reduces the expected social surplus and the proposer’s expected profit, but does not always benefit the voters. <b>Reinforcing</b> the qualified <b>majority</b> always increases the proposer’s expected profit, and can lower both the expected social surplus and the voters’ expected utility...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} fluid {{sovereignty}} denotes configurations of state authority in which flows {{of living and}} non-living things, within and across borders, render insecure claims of unconditional territorial control. Loss of monopoly control {{of the means of}} violence within a territory conventionally signals weak political sovereignty. Bordering Israel (including the occupied Golan Heights) and Syria, the Hasbani Basin, southern Lebanon, seems to exemplify such sovereign failings: over decades, rival security providers have provoked political instability and conflict in the region. However, fluid sovereignty brings to the fore state-nature relations neglected in scholarship on “fragile” or “failing” states. Informed by geographical work on hybrid sovereignties and vital materialism, we show how sovereign claims over the Hasbani Basin extend to (sub) terranean water sources and rainfall-dependent agricultural lands, both of which are deeply securitized. Incomplete centralization and territorialization by Lebanon of the Hasbani Basin evinces fractured state nature—the inability of the state to realize volumetric control of, and authority over, basin waters. This state nature is coproduced by the fluid materiality of the waters themselves, whose hydro-climatic circulation and contingencies are at odds with territorial designs for volumetric control. For rural communities in the Hasbani Basin economically dependent on access to agricultural water, field research reveals a practical experience of fluid sovereignty, both in adapting to water variability and also navigating use of agricultural borderlands subject to conflict-related dangers. Recent conflict spillovers from the Syrian war have <b>reinforced,</b> for the <b>majority</b> Druze population, the low legitimacy of Lebanese state nature...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Glucocorticoids {{have been}} {{reported}} to have rewarding effects in rats and may lead to drug-seeking behavior in humans under some circumstances. Objectives: The present study investigated whether glucocorticoids would be self-administered intravenously by rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Methods: Ten monkeys, 7 male and 3 female, were maintained on a fixed ratio 10 (30 or 100), time-out 10 -s schedule for 0. 1 mg/kg methohexital or saline injections. Dexamethasone (0. 03 – 0. 3 mg/kg), methylprednisolone (0. 1 – 1. 0 mg/kg) and hydrocortisone (0. 3 – 3. 0 mg/kg) were periodically substituted for methohexital or saline. Results: Dexamethasone (0. 3 mg/kg) was self-administered by all of the male monkeys on the first, but not on subsequent occasions. It was hypothesized that suppression of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) activity by these exogenous glucocorticoids following their first presentation may have interfered with their reinforcing effects on subsequent evaluation. Subsequently, plasma adrenocorticotropin and cortisol were measured in four male monkeys to ascertain that normal basal HPA activity had resumed prior to each glucocorticoid substitution. Of the ten monkeys that were tested, only one reliably self-administered dexamethasone, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone, and he did so regardless of whether his basal HPA activity was suppressed. This monkey differed from some of the other monkeys both behaviorally and in his response to intravenous corticotropin releasing hormone. None of the three female monkeys that were tested with selected glucocorticoid doses showed any evidence of glucocorticoid reinforcement on any occasion. Conclusions: The results indicate that glucocorticoids were not <b>reinforcing</b> to the <b>majority</b> of monkeys in this study; nevertheless, large individual differences may exist in proclivity of monkeys to self-inject these compounds...|$|R
