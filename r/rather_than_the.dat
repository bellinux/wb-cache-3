This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it very expensive compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E
