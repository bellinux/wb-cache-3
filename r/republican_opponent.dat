5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors {{from serving}} consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he would}} seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent,</b> Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E
5|$|Barkley won the August 6 {{election}} {{by a vote}} of 294,391 to 223,149, carrying 74 of Kentucky's 120 counties, with large majorities in western Kentucky, the city of Louisville, and rural areas. It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent,</b> Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{campaign}} made {{extensive use}} of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats {{did not want to}} lower the tariff so much that they would lose their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent,</b> James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore {{campaigned for}} Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he {{supported}} President George H. W. Bush for reelection {{and was an}} outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent</b> Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease. Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.|$|E

In the 2014 election, he lost the Democratic primary to Seth Moulton, who went on to hold the seat in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and {{there were to be}} no African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent</b> in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E

She {{positioned}} herself as a Conservative Democrat who supported balanced budgets and conservative social views, emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to offshoring. Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins, Sr., the father of another lawmaker, Don Cravins, Jr., of Opelousas. Her major <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent</b> was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette, who ran {{on a platform of}} preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill. The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off. Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied, and the election was hotly contested.|$|E
5|$|With {{only the}} two years {{remaining}} in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed {{and sent to the}} Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Democrats drubbed their <b>Republican</b> <b>opponents,</b> 26-16 in {{the first}} game and {{continued}} their winning streak for the first six games.

5|$|After winning {{re-election}} by defeating <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent</b> Mitt Romney, Obama {{was sworn}} in {{for a second term}} in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.

The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy's aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh and spent months in a hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. He suffered chronic back pain {{for the rest of}} his life as a result of the accident. Kennedy took advantage of his long convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care services. His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent</b> by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her <b>Republican</b> <b>opponent</b> in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E
