We derived linear regression models between the velocity of the bicycle and the vibrations at the handlebars {{to be able to}} classify the current road surface and consequently the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> To derive the models, we performed experiments on three different surfaces typical for cycling - asphalt, fine gravel and coarse gravel. A cyclist performed five test rides on each surface on different days at varying velocities. During the experiments power output at the pedals and velocity were measured. Additionally, vibrations at the handlebars were measured using a smartphone. Then, a curve consisting of the mathematical representation of <b>rolling</b> and air <b>resistance</b> was fitted to the experimental data and the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the surfaces and the effective frontal area of bicycle and cyclist were estimated. The magnitude of the vibrations at the handlebars was calculated for each test ride and each surface. From this data the linear regression models for each surface were derived using velocity as the predictor. Analyzing the data yielded <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 0. 01221, 0. 01468 and 0. 01832 for asphalt, fine gravel and coarse gravel, respectively, and showed significant difference. The magnitude of vibrations increases significantly with velocity and is higher for surfaces with higher <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance.</b> To validate the model the outdoor experiments were repeated with a similar prototype of a four-wheeled electric bicycle. The results can be used to classify the current surface and therefore estimate the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> We believe that this system can help improve the estimation of the residual range of electric bicycles by providing more detailed information about the environment and consequently enhance their operating distance and the usage of the bicycle...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} in road vehicle is a demand in today’s {{society in the}} view of rising fuel cost and emission regulation. An important source for losses in road vehicles is tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance.</b> For tyres with <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 012, the fuel consumption due to tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> losses can amount to 20 % - 30 % of total consumption depending on the drive cycle, according to the study ‘the tyre: <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> and fuel savings’ by Michelin, 2003. This study investigates mathematical models based on physical understanding and literature reviews of tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> phenomena. The work aims to develop a tyre model that explains the influence of tyre inflation pressure, tyre size, velocity and normal load on the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The model is based on free rolling condition without taking the longitudinal slip into account. The consideration of the model developed includes vertical tyre stiffness with geometrical belt constraint accounting for tyre vertical deflection and counter-deflection, tyre viscous and coulomb damping effect and rotational aerodynamic drag effect. The vertical stiffness model accounts for tyre geometry indirectly by means of constants in the model. The stiffness model and the simple lumped damping model together takes into account various hysteresis losses. The tyre model developed for <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> gives results which are in very good agreement with the experimental data. For example an 8. 3 % increase in tyre outer radius from 60 cm to 65 cm, the proposed model predicts a reduction of 4. 8 % in tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> compared to 5 % suggested by experimental data. Furthermore, a change to low <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> tyre in LeanNova’s energy simulation model corresponds to a reduction in the average energy consumption by 3. 8 % for a NEDC run in an electric vehicle and a reduction of 1. 3 % in average fuel consumption for a NEDC run in a conventional vehicle. Through these findings and the proposed tyre model that calculates <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> by taking a limited number of tyre parameters into consideration, a foundation for physical understanding of tyre <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> phenomena is established...|$|R
40|$|A current {{application}} in {{a collaboration between}} Chalmers University of Technology and Volvo Group Trucks Technology concerns the global optimization of a complex simulation-based function describing the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a truck tyre. This function is crucial for the optimization of truck tyres selection considered. The need to explicitly describe and optimize this function provided the main motivation for the research presented in this article. Many optimization algorithms for simulation-based optimization problems use sample points to create a computationally simple surrogate model of the objective function. Typically, not all important characteristics of the complex function (as, e. g., non-negativity) —here referred to as expert knowledge—are automatically inherited by the surrogate model. We demonstrate the integration of several types of expert knowledge into a radial basis function interpolation. The methodology is first illustrated on a simple example function and then applied to a function describing the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of truck tyres.

5000|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Crr, {{significantly}} decreases as {{the weight}} of the rail car per wheel increases. For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001). This same [...] "economy of scale" [...] shows up in testing of mine rail cars. The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.|$|R
5000|$|For {{pneumatic}} tires, {{the direction}} of change in Crr (<b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient)</b> depends {{on whether or not}} tire inflation is increased with increasing load. It is reported that, if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) [...] "schedule", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But, if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course, this will increase the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rolling {{resistance}} can {{be expressed}} by the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> (RRC or Crr), which {{is the value of}} the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> force divided by the wheel load.

The coefficient is mostly considered as independent of speed, but for precise calculations it is tabled at several speeds or an additional speed-dependent part is used. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests (SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) are usually performed on new tires.|$|R

The additional energy dissipation resulting from the contact forces and tyre vibrations due to the combined effect of the tread profile and the road texture, are determined based on a modal representation of the deformed tyre.

To achieve this, the project is following the recommendations of key predecessor projects like TYROSAFE, HERMES, SILVIA, SILENCE and MIRIAM as well as considering the ongoing work in CEN and ISO groups. Work package 1 deals with skid resistance and aims at the harmonization of skid resistance measurement following the TYROSAFE Roadmap, by deriving conversion factors for friction indices based on similar groups of devices, namely longitudinal and sideways skid resistance measurement devices. During the first project year a first round robin test {{was carried out in}} Nantes, ten different devices participated to the test. The results of this test are collected in report D 1. 2 “Analysis of data from the first round of tests and initial development of the common scale”. Work package 2 is dealing with the pavement influence on road traffic noise emission: the main objective of this work package is to combine the existing measurement methods of SPB (ISO 11819 - 1) and CPX (ISO/DIS 11819 - 2) into a stable and reliable harmonised pavement noise emission characterisation method. The project is validating procedure incorporating correction mechanisms for temperature influence and investigating its potential use for noise calculation methods like the one proposed by the CNOSSOS-EU project. Work package 3 is dealing with <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance,</b> where the ROSANNE project is mainly building on the results obtained in the MIRIAM project and is considering standardized trailer measurements of <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficients</b> of road surfaces. After a first report D 3. 1 “State of the art on <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement devices including draft standard outline” the following main report was produced “Parameters influencing <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> and possible correction procedures”.

40|$|Modern ski-treadmills allow {{cross-country}} skiers, biathletes and ski-orienteers to {{test their}} physical performance in a laboratory environment using classical and freestyle techniques on roller skis. For elite athletes the differences in performance between test occasions are quite small, thus emphasising the importance of knowing the roller skis’ <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient,</b> µR, {{in order to allow}} correct comparisons between the results, as well as providing the opportunity to study work economy between different athletes, test occasions and core techniques. Thus, one of the aims of this thesis was to evaluate how roller skis’ µR is related to warm-up, mass, velocity and inclination of the treadmill. It was also necessary to investigate the methodological variability of the <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement system, RRMS, specially produced for the experiments, with a reproducibility study in order to indicate the validity and reliability of the results. The aim was also to study physiological responses to different µR during roller skiing with freestyle and classical roller skis and techniques on the treadmill as a case in which all measurements were carried out in stationary and comparable conditions. Finally, the aim was also to investigate the work economy of amateurs and female and male junior and senior cross-country skiers during treadmill roller skiing, i. e. as a function of skill, age and gender, including whether differences in body mass causes significant differences in external power per kg due to differences in the roller skis’ µR. The experiments showed that during a warm-up period of 30 minutes, µR decreased to about 60 - 65 % and 70 - 75 % of its initial value for freestyle and classical roller skis respectively. For another 30 minutes of rolling no significant change was found. Simultaneous measurements of roller ski temperature and mR showed that stabilized mR corresponds to a certain running temperature for a given normal force on the roller ski. The study of the influence on mR of normal force, velocity and inclination produced a significant influence of normal force on mR, while different velocities and inclinations of the treadmill only resulted in small changes in mR. The reproducibility study of the RRMS showed no significant differences between paired measurements with either classical or the freestyle roller skis. The study of the effects on physiological variables of ~ 50 % change in µR,showed that during submaximal steady state exercise, external power, oxygen uptake, heart rate and blood lactate were significantly changed, while there were non significant or only small changes to cycle rate, cycle length and ratings of perceived exertion. Incremental maximal tests showed that time to exhaustion was significantly changed and this occurred without a significantly changed maximal power, maximal oxygen uptake, maximal heart rate and blood lactate, and that the influence on ratings of perceived exertion was non significant or small. The final part of the thesis, which focused on work economy, found {{no significant difference between the}} four groups of elite competitors, i. e. between the two genders and between the junior and senior elite athletes. It was only the male amateurs who significantly differed among the five studied groups. The study also showed that the external power per kg was significantly different between the two genders due to differences in body mass and mR, i. e. the lighter female testing groups were roller skiing with a relatively heavier <b>rolling</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>coefficient</b> compared to the heavier testing groups of male participants.
