5|$|By {{fine-tuning}} {{the surface}} <b>roughness,</b> {{it is possible}} to achieve a transition between both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions. Generally, the rougher the surface, the more hydrophobic it is.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of <b>roughness.</b> The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient <b>roughness</b> for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{topography}} {{and light}} scattering were measured on 15 samples ranging from those having smooth surfaces to others with ground surfaces. The measurement techniques included an atomic force microscope, mechanical and optical profilers, confocal laser scanning microscope, angle-resolved scattering, and total scattering. The samples included polished and ground fused silica, silicon carbide, sapphire, electroplated gold, and diamond-turned brass. The measurement instruments and techniques had different surface spatial wavelength band limits, so the measured <b>roughnesses</b> were not directly comparable. Two- dimensional {{power spectral density}} (PSD) functions were calculated from the digitized measurement data, and we obtained rms <b>roughnesses</b> by integrating areas under the PSD curves between fixed upper and lower band limits. In this way, <b>roughnesses</b> measured with different instruments and techniques could be directly compared. Although smaller differences between measurement techniques remained in the calculated <b>roughnesses,</b> these could be explained mostly by surface topographical features such as isolated particles that affected the instruments in different ways...|$|R

5|$|The {{penetration}} front propagates {{to minimize}} the surface energy until it reaches {{the edges of the}} drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface <b>roughness,</b> this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface <b>roughness</b> of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean <b>roughness</b> can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E

40|$|Tribological {{characteristics}} of steel combinations are observed {{in this study}} using rotating tribometer. Experiments are done under different <b>roughnesses</b> of pin slides on stainless steel disc for different operating conditions. Certain trends are obtained between friction and rubbing durations. During experiment, {{it is found that}} there are significant relationship between friction coefficient and operating parameters. In fact, at initial stage friction coefficients of tested material are increased at a particular level with time and finally the friction becomes steady for remaining investigation period. Studies indicate that lower values of friction are obtained with higher loads for SS 202 slides against different <b>roughnesses</b> of mild steel counterface. Under similar conditions, higher values of frictions are found with higher values of sliding velocity. In addition to that, wear rates show higher values with higher load and velocity conditions. Tribological characteristics are varied for different <b>roughnesses</b> of pin materials under experimental ranges of two influencing parameters...|$|R

However, few papers discuss the properties of the machining, either qualitatively or quantitatively. In this work ductile regime dicing of germanium, Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), lithium niobate and silicon for photonic applications are reported. Machining parameters are discussed, surface micrographs shown, and surface <b>roughnesses</b> are calculated for each sidewall machined. The sidewall average surface <b>roughnesses</b> (Sa) were measured to be 2. 1 nm for germanium, 3. 5 nm for YAG, 7. 9 nm for lithium niobate and 8. 6 nm for silico...|$|R

25|$|Chemical etching {{involves}} {{soaking the}} material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until {{the surface is}} etched away to a desired <b>roughness</b> as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale. Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it {{can be considered a}} surface treatment for changing the surface <b>roughness.</b> The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with nanotopographies. Silicon wafers were etched using HF, and it was demonstrated that cell adhesion was enhanced only in a specified range of <b>roughness</b> (20–50nm).|$|E

The small-angle diffraction spectrum was {{used to analyze the}} structure of the multilayers. With a combination of the experimental diffraction spectra and Apeles' theory for calculation of the interfacial <b>roughnesses</b> of the multilayers, the interfacial <b>roughnesses</b> of Co/C and W/Si are 0. 80 nm and 0. 60 nm, respectively, which are lower than that of the substrate. The reflectivity of the Co/C multilayer is measured to be about 20 % and that of the W/Si multilayer about 1 % at the grazing incidence angle of about 12 degrees...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured copper/hydrogenated {{amorphous}} carbon (Cu/a-C:H) multilayer films have been deposited {{in a low}} base vacuum system (base pressure 1 x 10 - 3 Torr) and studied for their mechanical properties. The analysis shows very low residual stress (below 1 GPa), moderate nanohardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) of the resultant films. Further these films have been studied for their plastic deformation energy and elastic recovery. Atomic force microscopic analysis reveals the nanostructured morphology and low surface <b>roughnesses</b> of the resultant films. Estimated <b>roughnesses</b> values have also been correlated with the experimental measured H values. The presence of Cu in these structures have been confirmed by time of flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{interface}} model based on two-scale homogenization {{to predict the}} coherent scattering of light by a periodic rough interface between air and a dielectric. Contrary to previous approaches where the <b>roughnesses</b> are replaced by a layer filled with an equivalent medium, our modeling yields effective jump conditions applying across the region containing the <b>roughnesses.</b> The validity of the model is inspected by comparison with direct numerics and with experimental measurements on a air/silicium rough interface near the Brewster angle. It is shown that the interface model reproduces accurately the shift in the Brewster phenomenon without any ajustable parameter, which is of practical importance in retrieval methods to get thickness or filling fraction with reliable physical values...|$|R
25|$|New {{models are}} {{beginning}} to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction. Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities; however, in many other cases <b>roughness</b> effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction. Surface <b>roughness</b> and contact area affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.|$|E

25|$|Surface <b>roughness</b> {{determines how}} much of the {{reflection}} is specular and how much diffuses, controlling how sharp or blurry the image will be. For perfectly specular reflection, the surface <b>roughness</b> must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater than an inch (2.5 cm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few millionths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce specular reflection.|$|E

25|$|Further {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of contact mechanics in the mid-twentieth century may be attributed to names such as Bowden and Tabor. Bowden and Tabor were the first to emphasize the importance of surface <b>roughness</b> for bodies in contact. Through investigation of the surface <b>roughness,</b> the true contact area between friction partners is found to be less than the apparent contact area. Such understanding also drastically changed the direction of undertakings in tribology. The works of Bowden and Tabor yielded several theories in contact mechanics of rough surfaces.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} tests {{were carried out}} to observe the deposition rates on different stainless steel substrates of different surface <b>roughnesses</b> under different operating conditions using a hot filament thermal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactor. The test parameters include gas flow rate of methane, temperature of substrate and activation heaters, distance between activation heater and substrate, pressure and duration. There are significant effects of these parameters on deposition rate of different stainless steel materials. It was found that deposition rates strongly depend on different surface <b>roughnesses</b> of the stainless steel substrates under different tested conditions within the observed range. Tribological properties, especially friction and wear of these stainless steel materials sliding against SS 314 under different normal loads and sliding velocities are also investigated before and after deposition.
