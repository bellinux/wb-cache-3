50|$|Compared {{to running}} shoes, {{badminton}} shoes have little <b>lateral</b> <b>support.</b> High levels <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> {{are useful for}} activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> {{will not be able}} to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.|$|R

Das [18] and McCurthy and David [41] asserted various factors responsible for failure of dump slopes such as geology and hydrogeology of the dumping area, gravitational force, seepage of water from dump to slope, lowering of water adjacent to a slope, changes of stress and erosion of dump (removal <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support)</b> caused by flowing water. Other factors such as dump slope angle (slope inclination), natures of the dump materials (material properties), degree of compaction, dump height and changes in cohesion of interface materials have also been pointed by other workers [34, 48, 57].|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was {{simplified}} design of diaphragm wall affected by excavation from both sides. This wall {{is a part of}} temporary shaft that serves for exchange of tunnel boring machines {{and at the same time}} it is a permanent structure of an adjacent metro station. Part of the thesis deals with description of construction sequence of diaphragm walls, excavation of the shaft, excavation of the adjacent metro station and following construction of metro tubes and backfilling of the shaft. Inseparable part of the thesis is assessment of geological conditions and geotechnical parameters. Furthermore, a study on temperature loads on struts was carried out and the results of the study were used for design of the struts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of liquefaction on modal parameters (frequency and damping) of pile-supported structures. Four physical models, consisting of two single piles and two 2 [*]×[*] 2 pile groups, were tested in a shaking table where the soil surrounding the pile liquefied because of seismic shaking. The experimental results showed that the natural frequency of pile-supported structures may decrease considerably owing to the loss <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> offered by the soil to the pile. On the other hand, the damping ratio of structure may increase to values in excess of 20 %. These findings have important design consequences: (a) for low-period structures, substantial reduction of spectral acceleration is expected; (b) during and after liquefaction, the response of the system may be dictated by the interactions of multiple loadings, that is, horizontal, axial and overturning moment, which were negligible prior to liquefaction; and (c) with the onset of liquefaction due to increased flexibility of pile-supported structure, larger spectral displacement may be expected, which in turn may enhance P-delta effects and consequently amplification of overturning moment. Practical implications for pile design are discussed...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the quadriceps femoris tendon and femoral fascia attached to the superior pole of the patella and the patellar tendon at the inferior pole, the femoral fascia, vastus medialis muscle and vastus lateralis tendon form the patellar retinaculum to aid extension of the knee. The patella works as a lever arm by separating the point of action of the knee extension system from the rotation centre to increase the extension efficiency [1]. The patella is moved like a pulley in the femoral sulcus {{by the actions of}} the quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon with the bony support augmented by medio-lateral soft tissue restraints [6, 7]; the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), medial patellomeniscal ligament (MPML) and medial patellotibial ligament (MPTL) are closely involved in the medial support system, with the MPFL having the most important role [8]. The <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> system is complex and divided into two layers: a superficial layer comprising of fibrous tissue extending from the anterior vastus lateralis muscle and posterior oblique retinaculum, and a deep layer comprising the patellar epicondylar ligament, deep transverse retinaculum and patellotibial ligament directly attached to the inferior pole of the patella. In addition, the iliotibial ligament is also involved in the stability <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> [9]. Therefore, in {{addition to}} the quadriceps femoris and patellar tendons involved in extension and flexion of the knee joint, many support systems involving soft tissues are circumferentially present around the patella.|$|R

Analysis, supported by experimentation, indicates a period of noneroding penetration for these configurations, which results from <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> exerted by the target crater upon the deforming, yet noneroding, penetrator. Experiments indicate that the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> the direct result of an interference fit between rod and crater, must be on the order of the target’s ballistic-penetration resistance, and does not vary with the impact velocity over the range studied. Analysis suggests that the duration of the noneroding portion of the ballistic event is neither governed by a fixed time, nor by a fixed depth of penetration, but rather by a fixed, permissible level of deformation in the penetrator...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: p. 82 - 83. The design <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> systems, in {{the context}} of surface excavations, are usually done using {{conventional}} (classical) methods of analysis. For these design procedures limit state assumptions are made concerning the lateral earth pressures acting on the structure to determine the support system characteristics. No information with regard to the deformation of the soil adjacent to the structure can be provided. The objective of this thesis is to examine the finite element method of analysis as an alternative design tool which is adaptable {{to a wide range of}} situations. Finite element models are developed to investigate the influence of the plastic flow rule, wall friction and the soil type on the behaviour of a cantilever support system. Subsequently, the effect of wall stiffness, prop stiffness and the application of prop loads on the performance of a multiple level support system is examined. The results from these studies focus on wall displacements, lateral earth pressures, bending moments, plastic strain patterns and surface settlements behind the wall. The investigation provides extensive information about the entire soil-structure interaction of the system. This potential of the finite element method can be used in the optimization of support system design...|$|R

40|$|Compression {{testing of}} large, thin, {{stiffened}} composite panels is complex {{due to the}} susceptibility of such panels to premature buckling and failure. Such failures are due to the artifacts of testing, such as, offset at load introduction edges, non-uniform distribution of loads, nature <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>supports,</b> crushing <b>of</b> panel edges etc. In this paper, a novel approach for compression loading of thin stiffened composite panels is proposed and validated from finite element analysis supported by tests. Compression loading of such panels (less than 2 mm thick) is challenging since the edges are susceptible to local crushing. To avoid this, loading edges of the panel were encased in mild steel casing blocks filled with finely grounded aluminium powder mixed with epoxy resin. Coupon level tests were conducted to measure mechanical properties of the interface between composite and casting mixture. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used in these tests to measure the full field strains and to validate numerical simulations. Further, finite element analysis of the actual composite test panel with end casting mixture was performed which indicated that interface shear stresses and compression stresses at maximum expected load are much lower than allowables obtained from specimen tests. Hence, the Aluminium-Epoxy cast mixture proposed in this study can be used safely to cast edges of large stiffened panels for axial compression tests...|$|R

It was a retrospective, consecutive case review of sinus mucoceles treated endoscopically by a single surgeon over a four-year period (1998 - 2002). There were 41 mucoceles in 28 patients, including 24 frontal, eight frontoethmoidal, three ethmoidal, five maxillary and one frontal mucocele. Twenty-one patients underwent the modified Lothrop procedure for frontal mucoceles, and seven underwent simple drainage and marsupialization for frontoethmoidal, ethmoidal and maxillary mucoceles. At median follow-up of 16 months, all patients had a patent mucocele opening. Patients treated by drainage and marsupialization did not have any complications or mucocele recurrence. All patients treated by the modified endoscopic Lothrop procedure had improvement in symptoms and signs. Four patients had minor complications including epistaxis and adhesions and five required further surgery. The average hospital in-patient stay was 2 ± 1. 4 days. Endoscopic techniques, including MELP are effective in the short term for the management of complex and simple paranasal sinus mucoceles.

50|$|In November 2008, NIST {{released}} its final {{report on the}} causes of the collapse of 7 World Trade Center. This followed NIST's August 21, 2008, draft report which included a period for public comments. In its investigation, NIST utilized ANSYS to model events leading up to collapse initiation and LS-DYNA models to simulate the global response to the initiating events. NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers or the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). The lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss <b>of</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> across nine floors, column 79 buckled - pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, which were fueled by office contents and burned for 7 hours, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse. Incidentally, this made the old 7 WTC the only steel skyscraper at the time to have collapsed from fire.|$|R
