40|$|In this thesis, {{improved}} and faster CFD based aero-thermo-mechanical methods {{that can be}} used to optimize engine configurations early in the design process are described. Axisymmetric models of 3 D non-axisymmetric features such as protrusions, holes and honeycomb liners are developed for use in this context, and 3 D unsteady CFD is used to investigate the flow physics. Initially, the research focussed on modelling of a rotor-stator disc cavity. Steady CFD validations for a plane disc and for a disc with protrusion were carried out and a simplified body force model was developed for including the 3 D effects of rotating and stationary bolts into the axisymmetric CFD models. The simplified <b>rotor</b> <b>bolt</b> model was verified and validated by comparing the results with Sussex Windage rig test data and 3 D CFD data. The simplified stator bolt model was verified using 3 D CFD results. The simplified <b>rotor</b> <b>bolt</b> model was found to predict the drag and windage heat transfer with reasonable accuracy compared to 3 D sector CFD results. However, 3 D sector CFD under-predicts the high core flow swirl and the adiabatic disc surface temperature inboard of the bolt, compared to experimental data. In the second part of the study, unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) calculations of the rotating bolts cases were performed in order to better understand the flow physics. Although the rotor-stator cavity with bolts is geometrically steady in the rotating frame of reference, it was found that the rotor bolts generate unsteadiness which creates time-dependent rotating flow features within the cavity. A systematic parametric study is presented giving insight into the influence of the bolt number and the cavity geometric parameters on the time dependent flow within the cavity. The URANS calculations were extended to a high pressure turbine (HPT) rear cavity to show possible unsteady effects due to rotating bolts in an engine case. Following this, the body force model was adapted to model the rotating hole velocity changes and flow through honeycomb liners. The honeycomb and hole models were verified by comparing the results with available experimental data and 3 D CFD calculations. In the final part of the study, coupled FE-CFD calculations for a preliminary design whole engine thermo-mechanical (WETM) model for a transient square cycle was performed including the effects of non-axisymmetric features. Six cavities around the HPT disc were modelled using CFD. The coupled approach provides more realistic physical convective heat transfer boundary conditions than the traditional approach. The unvalidated baseline thermo-mechanical model results were verified using the high fidelity coupled FE-CFD solution. It was demonstrated that the FE-CFD coupled calculations with axisymmetric modelling of 3 D features can be achieved in a few days time scale suitable for preliminary engine design. The simplified CFD based methods described in this thesis could reduce the computational time of transient coupled FE-CFD calculations several orders of magnitude and may provide results as accurate as 2 DFE- 3 DCFD coupled calculations...|$|E
40|$|The {{cooling air}} in a gas turbine engine is subject to windage as it flows through the {{internal}} air system. The work in this thesis focuses on the windage generated as the cooling air passes over the rotor surface, particularly for case where bolts are encountered. Reducing windage heating of the cooling air is of great importance to turbomachinery engineers, particularly in the aerospace industry, since the use of compressor air for cooling greatly reduces the thrust potential of an engine. The ability to accurately predict windage can help reduce the quantity of cooling air required, resulting in increased efficiency. A purpose built rig {{was used to measure}} both windage and rotor surface temperature as air passes through an enclosed rotor-stator cavity. A wide range of flow conditions were tested with some being close to those found in a modern gas turbine engine. A variety of both stator and <b>rotor</b> mounted <b>bolts</b> were investigated, of varying size and shape, as well as cavities in the disc surface. In addition, PIV measurements of the core tangential velocity were obtained. Test results show that windage is increased substantially with <b>rotor</b> <b>bolts</b> present, compared with a plain disc, and that it increases with increasing bolt size. For hexagonal <b>rotor</b> <b>bolts</b> a new correlation was produced between the moment coefficient and bolt diameter to pitch ratio for a range of flow conditions, characterised by the rotational and throughflow Reynolds numbers. Stator bolts were shown to generate a large increase in disc surface temperature compared with the plain disc at engine representative conditions. PIV measurements of the core tangential velocity showed an increase of up to 80...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} some differences between steady CFD predictions of flow in a rotor-stator disc cavity with rotating bolts compared to measurements. Recently time-dependent CFD simulations have revealed the unsteadiness present in the flow and have given improved agreement with measurements. In this paper unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) 3600 model CFD calculations of a rotorstator cavity with <b>rotor</b> <b>bolts</b> were performed {{in order to better}} understand the flow and heat transfer within a disc cavity previously studied experimentally by other workers. It is shown that the rotating bolts generate unsteadiness due to wake shedding which creates time-dependent flow patterns within the cavity. At low throughflow conditions, the unsteady flow significantly increases the average disc temperature. A systematic parametric study is presented giving insight into the influence of number of bolts, mass flow rate, cavity gap ratio and the bolts-to-shroud gap ratio on the time depended flow within the cavity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: 2 Cr 11 Mo 1 VNbN steel {{was mainly}} {{used in the}} {{manufacture}} of turbine <b>rotor</b> blades, <b>bolts,</b> nuts and other important parts. However, in actual production, the impact value of their products often failed to meet requirements leaving the material scrapping. In this paper, through observation and analysis of the sample microstructure, fracture morphology and the precipitated phase by electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, the results showed that: the low impact value of 2 Cr 11 Mo 1 VNbN steel ring forgings was caused by the abnormal and large grain, uneven tissue and bulky niobium carbide exhalatted from grain boundary which was serious damage to the stability of grain boundary...|$|R
40|$|Automobile {{braking system}} is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important safety systems in modern vehicles as its main intention is to stop or decelerate the vehicle. The frictional heat generated between the pads and disc during the braking application can cause various negative impacts, such as brake fade, thermal cracks, disc thickness variation and wear. This project studied the transient thermal behavior of a disc brake system during the braking phase and the followed releasing period. A three-dimensional finite element model with a moving heat source was developed with COMSOL Multiphysics to predict the temperature distribution in the disc braking system, including two pads, a <b>rotor</b> disc, <b>bolts,</b> and a section of the shaft. The maximum surface temperature on the contact surface has been found to increase in the braking period and then decrease as the rotor slows down and further decrease during the releasing period. The maximum temperature on the contact surface depends on both the car velocity and deceleration rate. The effects of convective and radiative heat transfer are also studied. It is found that heat is mainly dissipated through convective heat transfer at the disc surfaces...|$|R

The pilot's seat, the engine and <b>rotor</b> assembly are <b>bolted</b> to the same keel tube. A control stick cyclically controls rotor pitch angle. The powerplant specified is a , twin-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, single ignition Rotax 447 mounted in pusher configuration. The [...] Kawasaki 440 engine has also been used. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration, uses plastic-spoked wheels to reduce weight and does not include suspension.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} effect of <b>rotor</b> mounted <b>bolts</b> on the moment coefficient and flow structure within a rotor-stator cavity representative of modern gas turbine engine design. The CFD computations are performed using the commercial code FLUENT. The simulation methodology is first validated using experimental data from plain co-rotating disc and rotor-stator cavities from the open literature. Comparisons are then made with experimental data obtained from a test rig at the Thermo Fluid Mechanics Research Centre (TFMRC), University of Sussex. Computations were performed at Reφ = 6. 8 × 106, Cw = 5929 (λT = 0. 35) with different numbers of bolts (0 < N < 60), and also a continuous ring, at r/b = 0. 9. The study has improved the current understanding of the effect on moment coefficient and flow structure that rotor mounted protrusions have in rotor-stator systems. It is seen that the contribution of skin friction to the moment coefficient reduces as the number of bolts is increased. The size and shape of the wake created by a rotating bolt also means that the pressure loss per bolt reduces with N but the overall effect is to increase the moment coefficient because there are more bolts.

In this paper, the joint stiffness characteristics of a disc-drum structure are investigated based on the finite element model. Firstly, the nonlinear finite element model for the disc-drum structure is established, where the connecting bolts are modelled and the frictional contact of the joint components is also considered. Then, the variation of joint stiffness of the disc-drum structure with the bolt number subjected to external axial force and bending moment are studied respectively. The works proposed in this paper is helpful to enhance {{the understanding of the}} joint stiffness properties of the disc-drum type <b>rotor.</b> Keywords-joint stiffness; <b>bolt</b> number; disc-drum structure; bolted joints; FEM I...|$|R
40|$|A Jeffcott rotor {{consists}} of a disc at the centre of an axle supported at its end by bearings. A <b>bolted</b> Jeffcott <b>rotor</b> is formed by two discs, each with a shaft on one side. The discs are held together by spring loaded bolts near the outer edge. When the rotor turns there is tendency for the discs to separate on one side. This effect is more marked if the rotor is unbalanced, especially at resonance speeds. The equations of motion of the system have been developed with four degrees of freedom to include the rotor and bearing movements in the respective axes. These equations which include non-linear terms caused by the rotor opening, are subjected to external force such from rotor imbalance. A simulation model based on these equations was created using SIMULINK. An experimental test rig was used to characterise the dynamic features. Rotor discs open at a lateral displacement of the rotor of 0. 8 mm. This is the threshold value used to show the change of stiffness from high stiffness to low stiffness. The experimental results, which measure the vibration amplitude of the rotor, show the dynamic behaviour of the <b>bolted</b> <b>rotor</b> due to imbalance. Close agreement of the experimental and theoretical results from time histories, waterfall plots, pseudo-phase plots and rotor orbit plot, indicated {{the validity of the}} model and existence of the non-linear jump phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|All {{machinery}} with {{moving parts}} generates mechanical forces during their normal operation As mechanical condition of machine changes because of wear, changes in operating environment, load variations etc., so do these forces. Generator has {{one or more}} machine elements that turn with the shaft - e. g. bearings, rotors. In a perfectly balanced machine, all rotors run on their true centre-line and forces are equal. Rotor imbalance will generally be present due to uneven weight distribution or due to the imbalance between generated lift and gravity. Combination of these forces with stiffness of rotor-support system will determine the vibration level. Vibration profile that results from motion {{is the result of}} a force imbalance - there is always some imbalance in real-world applications. All mechanical equipment in motion generates a vibration profile, or signature, that reflect sits operating condition. Many vibrations are normal for rotating or moving machinery, e. g. normal rotation of shafts and other rotors, contact with bearings etc. Synchronous Generator faults such as mechanical misalignments, <b>rotor</b> imbalance, loose <b>bolts,</b> bearing faults and incipient metal fatigues cause to generate abnormal identifiable vibrations. In the research, First, the relationship between the generator mechanical faults and the vibration harmonic magnitudes are studied for particular machine problems occur previously and for that analysis the critical frequencies in the frequency spectrum of the synchronous generators are identified by using the Microlog instrument CMVA 60, which is a property of the Mahaweli Complex of Ceylon Electricity Board. Then, the magnitude ratios of the harmonics at critical frequencies to the fundamental component of the vibration profiles are determined from Experiment with using single phase motor with load coupled which had been used with originated mechanical faults, is used for the vibration analysis. Next, the results obtained from the case studies and the experiment are compared with the standards that have been evolved from the past studies and the researches in order to determine the feasibility of setting defective levels or standard on the vibrations harmonics at critical frequencies of generator faults. Finally, the possibility of developing a condition monitoring system to identify mechanical faults is investigated for synchronous generators in Ceylon Electricity Board. The results can then be extended to indicate the faults at early stage to minimize the unwanted long outages, minimize costly rotating failures & reduce maintenance inventory cost. Thus it helps to provide the necessary lead-time to schedule maintenance to suit the needs of the plant management...|$|R
