However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar.</b> For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval for food use.|$|E

In Brazil, certain factories use Lane-Eynon, others use the equipment referred to as &# 8220;REDUTEC&# 8221;, and additional factories analyze <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> based on a mathematic model. The objective {{of this paper is}} to understand the relationship between variations in millivolts, mass and tenors of <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> during the analysis process. Another objective is to generate an automatic model for this process.

We conclude that the millivolts, mass and tenors of <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> exhibit a good mathematical correlation, and the mathematical model generated was benchmarked to low-concentration <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> (< 0. 3 %).

40|$|Using the Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide) color reaction, {{a simple}} and {{sensitive}} flow injection spectrophotometric method for the determination of total <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> in tobacco is proposed. At a temperature of 110 degreesC, sucrose was on-line hydrolyzed to <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> quantitatively in 0. 5 mol l(- 1) HCl. The <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> were oxidized by alkaline potassium ferricyanide solution with equal reaction rates for glucose and fructose. The produced ferrocyanide reacted with ferric nitrate to form Prussian blue, which was detected spectrophotometrically at 690 nm for evaluation of the total <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars.</b> Using a merging zone manifold and alkaline citrate solution as carrier, the precipitation of Prussian blue oil the system tube was effectively prevented. The detection limits and linear ranges were 0. 1 mg l(- 1) and 0. 5 - 15 mg l(- 1) for glucose, and 0. 4 mg l(- 1) and 0. 5 - 20 mg l(- 1) for fructose, respectively.

2500|$|The Maillard {{reaction}} {{is a form}} of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar.</b> The cellulose fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin carbohydrate layer of starch fractions, various sugars, and other impurities. In a paper entitled [...] "The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction may explain the image formation," [...] Raymond Rogers and Anna Arnoldi propose that amines from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid decomposition products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as putrescine and cadaverine. However the potential source for amines required for the {{reaction is}} a decomposing body, and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud. Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas. Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.|$|E

40|$|Lignocellulosic {{materials}} {{are regarded as}} an alternative energy source for bioethanol production to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Pretreatment is important for improving the enzymatic digestibility of lignocelluloses to increase the yield of fermentable sugars. Alkaline (sodium hydroxide and lime (calcium hydroxide)) pretreatment of coastal bermudagrass for enhanced <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> recovery was investigated in this study. The effect of NaOH pretreatment at 121 °C using 1 %, 2 % and 3 % (w/v) NaOH for 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes was evaluated first. Lower NaOH concentrations (0. 5 % and 0. 75 %) and lower temperatures (50, 80 and 100 °C) were then examined. Lime (0. 1 g Ca(OH) 2 /g raw biomass) pretreatment of the biomass was conducted at room temperature, 50 °C, 80 °C, and 121 °C. Total <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars,</b> glucose and xylose were analyzed. The optimal NaOH pretreatment conditions at 121 °C for glucose and xylose production are 15 minutes and 0. 75 % NaOH. However, to maximize total <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> production, pretreatment at 121 °C for 30 minutes using 1 % NaOH is needed. The highest <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> yield reached up to approximate 86 % of theoretical maximum for NaOH pretreatment. Sodium hydroxide is more efficient than lime at 121 °C for improved <b>reducing</b> <b>sugars</b> yield. Increasing temperature reduced the optimal pretreatment time at the same lime loading.
