40|$|Weitzman's {{idea of a}} "share economy" {{based on}} {{profit-sharing}} has met with several objections, {{one of which is}} that it would impose unacceptable levels of risk on wage-earners. This paper answers this objection by proposing a variant <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> in which workers are given a share of national profits. It then tries to evaluate its effects on employment. Finally, the paper shows that taking into account the deleterious effects <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on investment leads to a more skeptical view <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> schemes. ...|$|R
30|$|Workers {{in plants}} which operate {{financial}} participation schemes earn significantly more:   25 % {{in the case}} <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> and   18 % {{in the case of}} share ownership. The larger effect <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on earnings is entirely unsurprising, since our measure of earnings includes bonuses.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{workers in}} German plants {{have little to}} fear from the {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> schemes. In almost all our specifications we find that profit-sharing is associated with modest increases in workers' total compensation, and we find no evidence that any particular groups of workers are significantly penalised. If the differences between plants which introduce profit-sharing and those which do not {{can be regarded as}} fixed over time, then our estimates represent causal impacts <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on worker compensation. However, if the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> is associated with simultaneous increases in plant performance from some unobserved factors, then our estimates should not be interpreted as causal impacts.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, workers' annual {{compensation}} does include any bonuses received as a result <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing.</b>|$|R
30|$|Most of {{our results}} {{reported}} in the previous sub-section suggest that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> is associated with modest increases in plant-level earnings of between   2 and   5 %. However, in a smaller sample of matched pairs the increase is insignificantly different from zero. At the very least, {{we can say that}} workers are not worse off in terms of average earnings from the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between occupation and the earnings effect <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> is less obvious. We anticipated that more highly skilled white collar workers (in particular managers) might benefit more from profit-sharing schemes. In fact, {{we find that}} while the effect is increasing in skill for blue-collar workers, it is decreasing in skill for white-collar workers, {{to the extent that}} managers compensation is not significantly affected by the presence <b>of</b> plant-level <b>profit-sharing.</b> Thus it appears that, in this data, the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> cannot be blamed for increasing dispersion in earnings between managers and workers.|$|R

30|$|However, the {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> within a plant {{may well have}} different effects on different groups of workers. As {{we have seen in}} Table   6, not all workers are covered by the profit-sharing scheme. In addition, different groups of workers may have different profit-sharing arrangements. Managers and more senior workers, for example, might have their total compensation more closely linked to the profits of the plant. This implies that {{the introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> might have effects on the distribution of earnings within plants.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generalized}} estimating equations {{approach to the}} analysis of the mean and the covariance structure of a bivariate time series process of panel data with mixed continuous and discrete dependent variables. The approach is used to jointly analyze wage dynamics and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> in West Germany. Our findings reveal a significantly positive conditional correlation of wages and the incidence <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing.</b> Furthermore, they indicate that permanent unobserved individual ability is comparatively more important in the profit-sharing than in the wage equation and show that shocks have a long-lasting effect on transitory wages but not on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing.</b> Hence, the results support theoretical predictions that selection into profit-sharing is mostly due to unobservable ability and that profit-sharing ties wages more closely to productivity.

It turns out {{that more than half of}} the observed productivity differences already exist before the system is introduced. However profit-sharing has a significant effect on performance. We also identify some of the basic reasons of the observed productivity advantages, as profit-sharing increases training intensity and process innovation.|$|R

We are also able to control for a wide range of worker and plant characteristics which might affect the use <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> schemes and total compensation. The use of linked worker–plant panel data allows us to control for unobserved plant and worker effects on compensation.

40|$|The {{importance}} of appropriate utilization of rewards for performance is still growing and therefore {{this type of}} rewards {{can be seen as}} a significant part of a total rewards package. Companies that are able to appropriately implement rewards for performance may gain competitive advantage over their competitors, but successful implementation requires a good knowledge of these rewards. The main aim of this paper is to contribute to the growth of this knowledge by identifying possible positive and negative impacts <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on various areas that are important for the performance of a company, nevertheless, addressed are also macroeconomic consequences <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing.</b> Furthermore, a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the relevant literature is provided, under-researched areas are identified and suggestions for further research are given. To accomplish these goals, we applied methods of bibliometric analysis to the articles indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge to identify the most important articles, authors and topics. According to our findings, the majority of studies report a neutral or positive impact <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on productivity and profitability. This impact may be achieved by direct influence <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on productivity <b>of</b> employees (due to the dependence of their pay on profit), but it seems that yet more important are various mediating mechanisms, especially effects on employment stability, absenteeism, quits and related issues, as well as effects on attitudes of employees and on relationships between employees.

30|$|We {{investigate}} the impact <b>of</b> financial participation (<b>profit-sharing</b> and share ownership) on workers' total compensation.

50|$|Furthermore, Waxweiler {{early on}} {{advocated}} a system <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> by which employees become co-partners with their employers (Waxweiler 1898; Gide 1899: 240; Willoughby 1899: 121), and also argued for compulsory education laws and limits on child labor in Belgium (McLean and Waxweiler 1906).|$|R
30|$|The {{financial}} participation of employees in their firm, {{in the form}} <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> or share ownership, continues to increase across almost all European countries, albeit from a low level in many of them. The fourth European Working Conditions Survey (Welz and Macias 2007) suggests that, in 2005, around   10 % of European workers participate in profit-sharing schemes, and around   2 % in share ownership schemes. To a greater or lesser extent these schemes have been encouraged by European governments via the use of tax incentives and legislation. The second “Pepper Report” (Commission of the European Communities 1996), argued that increased use <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> would encourage greater productivity, wage flexibility, employment and employee involvement, and called on member states to promote the greater use of {{financial participation}} by employees.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on product and process innovation. Profit-sharing is a credible {{commitment of the}} companies to let the employees participate in any efficiency gain. Resistance against technical progress becomes less plausible. Moreover, employees are stimulated to share their specific information advantage on possibilities to optimize the production process and products with the management. We take account of possible selectivity effects and using survey data on German companies with and without profitsharing in a conditional difference-in-differences framework, we test our hypothesis by comparing measures of innovativeness. Based on matching (selectivity on observable covariates) in a static comparison firms with a share system show both more product and process innovations. In a dynamic setting, {{we find that the}} introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> only spurs product innovation...|$|R

40|$|According to M. Weitzman, {{profit-sharing}} {{permits to}} increase employment {{and to make}} it less sensitive to the unfavourable disturbances that may affect the economy. However, some doubts have arisen about the actual existence of those benefits <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing.</b> Moreover, one does not really know if profit-sharing can appear in an endogenous way, or if it requires public intervention or incentives. This paper adresses the following issues: • how can profit sharing result from the bargaining between firms and tradeunions for the determination of wages or of wages and employment; • in which cases can this system actually reduce involunatry employment; the case of underemployment due to an efficiency wage problem is specially analyzed; • what are the agregate macroeconomic effects <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on employment and wages, and does it have stabilizing properties. ...|$|R
3000|$|First, does {{profit-sharing}} {{reduce the}} base wage? [...] If the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> is not accompanied by a reduction {{in the base}} wage, or the marginal cost of labour, then we would not expect to observe increases in the demand for labour. The empirical consensus is that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> does not reduce the base wage. For example, Wadhwani and Wall (1990) and Bhargava and Jenkinson (1995) (using firm-level data) and Hart and Hübler (1991) (using German household survey data) find no evidence that profit-sharing reduces the base wage. In some cases, in fact, profit-sharing is associated with increases in the base wage. These findings are more compatible with rent-sharing and efficiency wage theories. One exception to these findings is Estrin and Wilson (1986), who found that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> reduced total compensation {{while at the same}} time increasing employment. More recently, Buchele et  al. (2009, p.  13) note some recent high-profile examples of US workers who have accepted lower wages in return for ownership shares and stock options. However, their own empirical evidence confirms the stylised fact that there is a positive relationship between total compensation and financial participation. Finally, Cuñat and Guadalupe (2009) show that the introduction of more incentive pay increases within-firm pay differentials for executives, and thus potentially has an impact on wage inequality.|$|R
3000|$|The {{academic}} {{debate on}} financial participation initially focussed on a series of papers by Weitzman (e.g. Weitzman 1984, [...] 1987), which suggested that profit-sharing could lower the marginal cost of hiring workers and hence permanently increase {{the level of}} employment. However, a key finding of the empirical literature on profit-sharing is that the introduction of such schemes is not generally associated with reductions in the basic wage. 1 [...] This suggests that the widespread introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> schemes {{would not have the}} positive employment effects advocated by Weitzman. A second finding of the empirical literature is that the introduction of profit schemes is associated with higher productivity. Prendergast (1999) implicitly suggests that these two facts may be linked. If the introduction <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> leads to higher total compensation for workers, this might explain higher productivity, either because of worker selection or efficiency wage mechanisms.|$|R

30|$|We make a number of {{contributions}} to this literature. Instead of examining the base wage, we ask whether workers {{are better off}} overall if they work in plants which introduce financial participation in the form <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> or share ownership. We do this by measuring total compensation. We use both difference-in-differences and matching to control for non-random selection of plants into financial participation schemes. Because we use linked worker–plant data we are also able to examine the selection effects of financial participation, and to control for this selection effect in determining any change in average earnings. Finally, the use of linked worker–plant data allows us to examine whether the impact <b>of</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> on earnings varies across different types of plant and different types of worker. For example, Cuñat and Guadalupe (2009) suggest that incentive pay increases pay differentials within firms.
