500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I want people to laugh. I want people to go see the film and have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Joe 90 was {{purposely}} {{conceived and}} developed to {{be a different}} kind of Supermarionation series, placing the narrative emphasis less on action, advanced technology and visual effects and more on characterisation and plotlines subscribing more to the spy thriller genre than science fiction. Co-creator Gerry Anderson explained, [...] "The show majored on its characters, which I thought were all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware." [...] Explaining his inspiration for the series, Anderson remembered his pre-Supermarionation days when he served as an assistant editor for such films as The Wicked Lady, handling recording tape on a daily basis. While pondering on the blanking and re-use of such tape, Anderson made a connection to the human brain's electrical activities, explaining, [...] "I <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and transferring them to another brain. I was really likening it to magnetic recording, where material could be stored or transferred to another tape." [...] When it came to naming the lead character and, from that, the name of the new series, Anderson recalled that on one of his earlier productions, Fireball XL5, the surname [...] "Ninety" [...] had been an early proposal for Colonel Steve Zodiac, and selected it for the new schoolboy protagonist.|$|E
2500|$|Leone {{built upon}} the screenwriter's {{original}} concept to [...] "show {{the absurdity of}} war... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'" [...] An avid history buff, Leone said, [...] "I had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant {{of the fact that}} there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners." [...] The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by Mathew Brady. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, critic Fred Thomas {{wrote of the}} album [...] "Despite a {{somewhat}} wooden performance {{on many of the}} tracks, the hard-panned stereo production makes for a very big sound. While <b>reading</b> <b>somewhere</b> between campy and nostalgic {{in the context of the}} decades that followed, The Ventures Play Telstar is still a high point in the band's overwhelming discography, and as strong a sample of early-'60s commercially viable surf rock as you're likely to find." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Frazer Hines in an {{interview}} on the audio CD of The Invasion, Sally Faulkner's skirt kept getting blown up around her neck whilst climbing up the rope ladder to the helicopter. To avoid the same thing happening to his kilt, he remembered <b>reading</b> <b>somewhere</b> that The Queen had lead weights sewn into the hem of her skirt to stop this from happening to her. It so happened that Frazer's dresser was a keen fisherman, who sewed some lead weights into his kilt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maunderings, of course. It {{will make}} the book rather dull. I doubt if I can report him at length.... He will speak upon {{contemporary}} letters, the lack of current achievement.... I doubt if a man like Lord Reay ever reads at all. One wonders sometimes what these British literary aristocrats do with all their time. Probably he left off <b>reading</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the eighties. He won't have noted it, of course, {{and he will be}} under the impression that nothing has been written for the past thirty years." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{stopped short}} after this {{complimentary}} assertion, for uncle Rik had <b>somewhere</b> <b>read</b> or heard that joy can kill, and he feared {{to become an}} accomplice in a murder.|$|R
5000|$|... "The phrase {{itself was}} pretty cool, and <b>reading</b> it <b>somewhere</b> {{else would be}} striking, so that was what drew me to it, but {{listening}} back to the album I realised how much it represents quiet and loud, the good and evil, {{but it also has}} a lot to do with faith and some spiritual aspects of the band." [...] — Jesse Lacey discussing the album's title ...|$|R

50|$|The {{younger brother}} of former All Black Scott Waldrom, he was {{overlooked}} by the All Blacks selectors while playing in New Zealand, and after making his move to England, had aspirations of eventually {{playing for the}} England national team. Under International Rugby Board (IRB) regulations, {{he would not be}} eligible for England until being resident in the country for three years. However, as Waldrom would tell the Leicester Mercury in March 2011,My agent came round and he brought the pamphlet with the International Rugby Board's rules regarding qualifying after residency. My wife was going through the criteria. She saw the line about being able to qualify immediately if one of your grandparents was born in the respective country. I remembered <b>reading</b> <b>somewhere</b> that my grandmother was English. I rang up my mum in New Zealand, where it was four o'clock in the morning. I apologised for waking her up and asked if nana was born in England. She said yes, and that she also had the birth certificate to prove it. This development made Waldrom immediately eligible for England selection.|$|R
6000|$|I have <b>somewhere</b> <b>read</b> this remark:--'Omne meritum est voluntarium, aut voluntate originis, aut origine voluntatis'. Quaintly {{as this is}} expressed, it is {{well worth}} consideration, and gives {{the true meaning of}} Baxter's famous saying,--"Hell is paved with good intentions." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Gentlemen [...] - [...] I have <b>somewhere</b> <b>read</b> a scornful word {{regarding}} a German vassalage to Austria-Hungary.

60|$|I {{remember}} that the noble lord on the floor, not in a former debate to be sure, (it would be disorderly to refer to it, I suppose I <b>read</b> it <b>somewhere,)</b> but the noble lord was pleased to say, {{that he did not}} conceive how it could enter into the head of man to impose such taxes as those of 1767: I mean those taxes which he voted for imposing, and voted for repealing,--as being taxes, contrary to all the principles of commerce, laid on British manufactures.|$|R
60|$|There {{is little}} doubt, I think, of my <b>reading</b> at Cheltenham <b>somewhere</b> about November.

6000|$|... [323] I have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> (if I do not err, for I cannot {{recollect}} where,) that Dante was {{so great}} a favourite of Michael Angelo's, that he had designed {{the whole of the}} Divina Commedia: but that the volume containing these studies was lost by sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "How glad Matthew {{would be}} {{tomorrow}} {{if he were}} here," [...] she whispered. [...] "But I believe he does know and is glad of it--somewhere else.

60|$|I have {{founded the}} man 'who drove the gods {{out of their}} Liss,' or fort, upon {{something}} I have read about Caolte after the battle of Gabra, when almost all his companions were killed, driving the gods out of their Liss, either at Osraighe, now Ossory, or at Eas Ruaidh, now Asseroe, a waterfall at Ballyshannon, where Ilbreac, {{one of the children}} of the goddess Danu, had a Liss. I am writing away from most of my books, and {{have not been able to}} find the passage; but I certainly <b>read</b> it <b>somewhere.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A love-song I had <b>somewhere</b> <b>read,</b> [...] An echo from a {{measured}} strain, [...] Beat time to {{nothing in my}} head [...] From some odd corner of the brain.

6000|$|She had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> {{these words}} {{from a great}} philosopher: [...] "The woman who bears a child to any man should {{instantly}} be lawfully seized of one-half his goods, for by that sublime act she takes her life in her hand as truly as the soldier who charges upon an invading host.

6000|$|He {{was always}} {{influenced}} by a sentence he had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> about [...] "one of those globe-trotters you meet carrying a monkey-wrench in Calcutta, then in raiment and a monocle at the Athenaeum." [...] He would learn some Kiplingy trade that would teach him the use of astonishingly technical tools, also daring {{and the location of}} smugglers' haunts, copra islands, and whaling-stations with curious names.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{yet such}} {{questions}} have been answered before now by people far less intuitive than you," [...] I went on. [...] "Why, I've <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> how, when the war between Napoleon the First and the Prussians broke out, in 1806, Jomini predicted that the decisive battle of the campaign would be fought near Jena; and near Jena it was fought.

60|$|But {{there was}} no convincing him that I had in truth brought this game back to San Quentin across the centuries.

Thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>reading</b> of {{an interview}} between the poet Southey and a good Quaker. Southey {{was a man of}} marvellous powers of work.

6000|$|... "Ah! Gervaise, {{and what}} is the {{vigilance}} of Galleygo to that of the All-seeing eye! It is a terrible thought, at an hour like this, to remember that nothing can be forgotten.
