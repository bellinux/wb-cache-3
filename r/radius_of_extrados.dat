The concept <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature specification to modify the shape of a NURBS curve is illustrated. The difference between the NURBS curve <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature and the specified <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature is minimized by introducing the least-squares method to modify the shape of the NURBS curve. Algebraic functions such as linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, and six degrees are applied to the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution of the designed curve as the specified <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature. The <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distributions given by these six algebraic functions are considered monotone, because the independent variable of these algebraic functions is monotone to the corresponding dependent variable of these functions. Similarity is evaluated using the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution according to six algebraic functions as references and the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution of the designed curves as matches by using correlation matching. Curve shape similarity evaluation is tried using an example. Considering that a curve with a monotone variation <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution is fair, the similarity of the designed curve to a fair curve is evaluated. This measured similarity expresses fairness to the fair curve.

The difference between the NURBS curve <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature and the specified <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature is minimized by introducing the least-squares method to modify the shape of the NURBS curve. As curve fairness evaluation, <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution is used as an alternative characteristic of a curve. Algebraic functions such as linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, and six degrees are applied to the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution of the designed curve to specify the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature.

We give a simple new proof of this theorem. By this new proof also we find the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> univalence of this class and we determine all the cases which give the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> univalence and the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> starlikeness. We then use a method {{similar to that in}} this new proof to obtain the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> univalence and the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> starlikeness of some other classes of analytic functions. For each class we determine all the cases giving the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> univalence and the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> starlikeness. Then we give some similar results for the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> convexity. In Chapter II first we deal with Heawood's Lemma which was established and used by P. J. Heawood to prove the theorem known as the Grace-Heawood Theorem. The same lemma was used by S. Kakeya in the proof of another theorem. We show that Heawood's Lemma is false and we give new proofs of these results. Then for some special cases we improve the value <b>of</b> the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> univalencegiven by Kakeya's Theorem. In this connection we firstgive L. N.
