60|$|The {{conception}} of the Sun's constitution thus set forth, is like that of M. Faye {{in so far as}} the successive changes, the resulting structures, and the ultimate state, are concerned; but unlike it in so far as the Sun is supposed to have reached a later stage of concentration. As I gather from your abstract of M. Faye's paper [this referred to an article in The Reader], he considers the Sun to be at present a gaseous spheroid, having an envelope of metallic matters precipitated in the shape of luminous clouds, the local dispersions of which, caused by currents from within, appear to us as spots; and he looks forward to the future formation of a liquid film as an event that will soon be followed by extinction. Whereas the above hypothesis is that the liquid film already exists beneath the visible photosphere, and that extinction cannot result until, in the course of further aggregation, the gaseous nucleus has become so much reduced, and the shell so much thickened, that the escape of the heat generated is greatly retarded.... M. Faye's hypothesis appears to be espoused by him, partly because it affords an explanation of the spots, which are considered as openings in the photosphere, exposing the comparatively non-luminous gases filling the interior. But if these interior gases are non-luminous from the absence of precipitated matter, must they not for the same reason be transparent? And if transparent, will not the light from the <b>remote</b> <b>side</b> of the photosphere seen through them, be nearly as bright as that of the side next to us? By as much as the intensely-heated gases of the interior are disabled by the dissociation of their molecules from giving off luminiferous undulations, by so much must they be disabled from absorbing the light transmitted through them. And if their great light-transmitting power is exactly complementary to their small light-emitting power, there seems no reason why the interior of the Sun, disclosed to us by openings in the photosphere, should not appear as bright as its exterior.|$|E

40|$|A {{procedure}} for guaranteed cost control design of delayed linear bilateral teleoperation systems with nonlinear external forces is proposed. The {{assumption that the}} external forces are nonlinear functions of velocities and/or positions of local devices, and one part of these forces satisfies a sector condition has been made. A virtual tool system is introduced to 'observe' the forces at the <b>remote</b> <b>sides,</b> {{the position and velocity}} information of the master, the slave and the virtual tool are feedbacked to the controllers, hence the proposed control scheme actually has a four-channel architecture. A delay-dependent stability criterion is formulated, and then a sub-optimal guaranteed cost controller is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The behavior of the resulting teleoperation system is illustrated in simulations. (C) 2015 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Videoconferencing {{environment}} {{is one of}} the most popular ways of connecting remote people. To achieve conveyance of realistic sensation through its video image {{is one of the}} major goals. One way to implement highly realistic image is to use life-size scale image of a remote person which is presented by a large display. However at the same time, the large display hides a large area from the local person’s front view and replaces it with other <b>remote</b> <b>side’s</b> background. This might decrease the person’s full surrounding awareness. To solve these conflicting effects of the large display, we propose extracting remote person’s figure from his/her background and superimposing him/her over local person’s front view. In this way, the local person feels as if the remote person exists in front of him/her in his/her spatial environment. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of such a system and the preliminary experiment. The initial result of the experiment suggested that the proposed system achieved high realistic sensations, increased the local surrounding awareness, and minimized the remote background’s distraction compared with a conventional videoconferencing syste...|$|R

The {{first was a}} short paragraph in the local newspaper, which, beyond making by a methodizing pen formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning, contained the important testimony of a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of Budmouth, who spoke to being an eyewitness of the accident, {{in a letter to}} the editor. In this he stated that he was passing over the cliff on the <b>remoter</b> <b>side</b> of the cove just as the sun was setting. At that time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside the mouth of the cove, and guessed in an instant that there was but a poor chance for him unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular powers. He drifted behind a projection of the coast, and Mr. Barker followed along the shore in the same direction. But by the time that he could reach an elevation sufficiently great to command a view of the sea beyond, dusk had set in, and nothing further was to be seen.|$|R
