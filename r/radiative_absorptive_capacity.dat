Results from 462 business units within 150 branches show that cross-functional interfaces, participation and job-rotation especially enhance a unit’s potential <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Formalization and socialization tactics particularly develop a unit’s realized <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Regarding consequences of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity,</b> our findings show that superior financial performance originates from a unit’s ability to nurture and harvest potential <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Moreover, our study suggests that potential and realized <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> have different roles in enabling explorative and exploitative adaptations.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{strategic}} management addresses challenges that firms encounter {{in an attempt}} to remain competitive. The ability to explain variation in firm success through examination of knowledge flows has become a prominent focus of research in the strategic management literature. Specifically, researchers have sought to further examine how firms convert knowledge, a phenomenon conceptualized as <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> <b>Absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> is the firm’s ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge. Few studies have captured the richness and multi-dimensionality of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity,</b> and it remains to be understood how the dimensions of the phenomenon convert knowledge. Furthermore, how <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> influences the firm remains to be understood. To address these research gaps, this dissertation seeks to (1) determine how <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> converts knowledge, and (2) determine how <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> influences firm capabilities. The research questions are investigated using structural modeling techniques to analyze data collected from software-industry firms. The findings offer contributions to the <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> and capability literatures. For example, <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> is hypothesized to consist of complex relationships among its internal dimensions. However, findings of this study suggest the relationships among the dimensions are linear in nature. This finding is in line with the theoretical foundations of and early literature on <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> but contrary to recent conceptualizations, which suggests relationships among the dimensions are more closely related to the theoretical origins of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Additionally, to examine how <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> influences the firm, a capability-based perspective is used to hypothesize the influence of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> on firm capabilities. Findings suggest <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> positively influences each dimension of firm capabilities (e. g., operational, customer, and innovation capabilities); thus, <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> influences the firm by altering firm capabilities. Given the richness of the findings, numerous fields are likely to benefit from this investigation. Through an examination of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> and capabilities, this study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> phenomenon and offers insight into how the phenomenon influences the firm.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> {{is one of}} the main drivers of new product development. However, <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> has been treated as a concrete, uni-dimensional proxy {{targeting}} R&D context. Explicitly, <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> variables namely; acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and utilization of external information/knowledge have rarely been theoretically analyzed in relation to firm product innovativeness in the new product development (NPD) literature. Addressing this particular gap in the literature, we develop a conceptual model encapsulating the simultaneous but differential interrelationships between <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> variables and product innovation in particular. This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, the theoretical framework proposed highlights the effects of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> variables on product innovation. Hence the focus is, on distinguishing product innovation from other innovation types, and building a theoretical background for the relationship of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> variables and product innovativeness. Second, based on the extended reconceptualization of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> of Zahra and George (2002) this study aims to assess the differential roles of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> variables in NPD efforts.

Antecedents highlighting the successful implementation of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> processes have not been studied extensively so far. Therefore, this study, through critical exploration of existing success factors within pharmaceutical organisations based in Pakistan, attempts to highlight the requirements for the effective development of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> in the workplace. The results show that factors relating to employees and management, both mid-level and senior, are critical in the successful development of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Furthermore, this study explores new pathways for critical evaluation of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> in relation to employees and management within pharmaceutical organisations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{relation}} between <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> and the propensity to collaborate across geographical distance. The analysis is based on quantitative data from two neighbouring Danish regions on {{the location of the}} main partner in product-innovation activities. The findings indicate that the importance of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> in relation to collaboration across geographical distance depends on the location of the innovative firm. Firms located in the relatively sparsely populated region are more likely to collaborate with firms located outside the region; and for these firms, the level of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> matters for the distance to the collaboration partners—firms with a low level of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> tend to collaborate with domestic partners, while those {{with a high level of}} <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> are much more likely to find their main product-innovation partner abroad. Product innovation, distance, collaboration, <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity,...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Perspective Paper is to advance {{understanding}} of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity,</b> its underlying dimensions, its multi-level antecedents, its impact on firm performance and the contextual factors that affect <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Nineteen years after the Cohen and Levinthal 1990 paper, the field {{is characterized by a}} wide array of theoretical perspectives and a wealth of empirical evidence. In this paper, we first review these underlying theories and empirical studies of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Given the size and diversity of the <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> literature, we subsequently map the existing terrain of research through a bibliometric analysis. The resulting bibliometric cartography shows the major discrepancies in the organization field, namely that (1) most attention so far has been focused on the tangible outcomes of absorptive capacity; (2) organizational design and individual level antecedents have been relatively neglected in the <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> literature; and (3) the emergence of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> from the actions and interactions of individual, organizational and inter-organizational antecedents remains unclear. Building on the bibliometric analysis, we develop an integrative model that identifies the multi-level antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> as well as the contextual factors that affect <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> We argue that realizing the potential of the <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> concept requires more research that shows how “micro antecedents” and “macro- antecedents” influence future outcomes such as competitive advantage, innovation, and firm performance. In particular, we identify conceptual gaps that may guide future research to fully exploit the <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> concept in the organization field and to explore future fruitful extensions of the concept...|$|R
