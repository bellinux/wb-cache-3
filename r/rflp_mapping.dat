It requires {{a large amount}} of sample DNA, and the combined process of probe labeling, DNA fragmentation, electrophoresis, blotting, hybridization, washing, and autoradiography could take up to a month to complete. A limited version of the RFLP method that used oligonucleotide probes was reported in 1985. Fortunately, the results of the Human Genome Project have largely replaced the need for <b>RFLP</b> <b>mapping,</b> and the identification of many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in that project (as well as the direct identification of many disease genes and mutations) has replaced the need for RFLP disease linkage analysis (see SNP genotyping).

40|$|A {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism (<b>RFLP)</b> <b>map</b> has been constructed {{of the nuclear}} genome of the plant pathogenic ascomycete Cochliobolus heterostrophus. The segregation of 128 RFLP and 4 phenotypic markers was analyzed among 91 random progeny of a single cross; linkages were detected among 126 of the markers. The intact chromosomal DNAs of the parents and certain progeny were separated using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and hybridized with probes used to detect the RFLPs. In this way, 125 markers were assigned to specific chromosomes and linkages among 120 of the markers were confirmed. These linkages totalled 941 centimorgans (cM). Several RFLPs and a reciprocal translocation were identified tightly linked to Tox 1, a locus controlling host-specific virulence. Other differences in chromosome arrangement between the parents were also detected. Fourteen gaps of at least 40 cM were identified between linkage groups on the same chromosomes; the total map length was therefore estimated to be, at a minimum, 1501 cM. Fifteen A chromosomes ranging from about 1. 3 megabases (Mb) to about 3. 7 Mb were identified; one of the strains also has an apparent B chromosome. This chromosome appears to be completely dispensable; in some progeny, all of 15 markers that mapped to this chromosome were absent. The total genome size was estimated to be roughly 35 Mb. Based on these estimates of map length and physical genome size, the average kb/cM ratio in this cross was calculated to be approximately 23.

The positions of 240 translocation breakpoints were integrated as physical landmarks into linkage maps of the seven barley chromosomes. This strategy proved to be highly efficient in relating physical to genetic distances. A very heterogeneous distribution of recombination rates was found along individual chromosomes. Recombination is mainly confined to a few relatively small areas spaced by large segments in which recombination is severely suppressed. The regions of highest recombination frequency (</= 1 Mb/cM) correspond to only 4. 9 % of the total barley genome and harbor 47. 3 % of the 429 markers of the studied <b>RFLP</b> <b>map.</b> The results for barley correspond well with those obtained by deletion mapping in wheat.

40|$|Two doubled-haploid rice populations, IR 64 /Azucena and IRAT 177 /Apura, {{were used}} to {{identify}} markers linked to rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) resistance using core {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (<b>RFLP)</b> <b>maps.</b> Resistance was measured by mechanical inoculation of 19 -day-old seedlings followed by assessment of virus content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests 15 days after inoculation. IR 64 /Azucena and IRAT 177 /Apura populations, 72 and 43 lines, respectively, were evaluated, and resistance was found to be polygenic. Resistance was expressed as a slower virus multiplication, low symptom expression, and limited yield loss when assessed at the field level. Bulked segregant analysis using the IR 64 /Azucena population identified a single random amplified polymorphic DNA marker that mapped on chromosome 12 and corresponded to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) evidenced by interval <b>mapping.</b> When pooling <b>RFLP</b> data, integrated <b>mapping</b> of this chromosome revealed that the QTL was common to the two populations and corresponded to a small chromosomal segment known to contain a cluster of major blast resistance genes. This region of the genome also reflected the differentiation observed at the RFLP level between the subspecies #indica$ and #japonica$ of #Oryza sativa$. This is consistent with the observation that most sources of RYMV resistance used in rice breeding are found in upland rice varieties that typically belong to the #japonica$ subspecies.

40|$|Understanding {{of grass}} genome {{structure}} and evolution has been significantly advanced through comparative genomics. The genomes of most cool-season forage and turf grasses, {{belonging to the}} Pooideae subfamily of the grasses, remain understudied. Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) {{is one of the}} most important cool-season turfgrasses due to its low mowing tolerance and aggressive growth habit. An <b>RFLP</b> genetic <b>map</b> of creeping bentgrass using 229 RFLP markers derived from cereal and creeping bentgrass EST-RFLP probes was constructed for a comparative genome analysis. This genetic map was compared with those of perennial ryegrass, oat, wheat, and rice. Large-scale chromosomal rearrangements between the map of creeping bentgrass and the respective maps of the Triticeae, oat, and rice were observed. However, no evidence of chromosomal rearrangements between the maps of creeping bentgrass and perennial ryegrass was detected, suggesting that these recently domesticated species might be closely related than expected. Further comparative genome analysis of creeping bentgrass was performed with the genome sequences of Brachypodium distachyon using sequences of the above-mentioned <b>RFLP</b> <b>mapped</b> markers and 8, 470 publicly available A. stolonifera EST (AgEST) sequences. A total of 24 syntenic blocks were identified between the Agrostis linkage groups and the B. distachyon chromosomes. Orthologous loci of AgESTs (678) were identified in the B. distachyon genome, and these loci can be utilized in further comparative mapping of Pooideae species. Insights from comparative genomics with B. distachyon will be useful for genetic improvement of Agrostis spp. and provide a better understanding of the evolution of the Pooideae species...|$|R
