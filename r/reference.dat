An optional fragment identifier, preceded by #, may be present at the end of a URI <b>reference.</b> The part of the <b>reference</b> before the # indirectly identifies a resource, and the fragment identifier identifies some portion of that resource.|$|E
5|$|A same-{{document}} <b>reference</b> is a URI <b>reference</b> to {{a document}} containing the URI <b>reference</b> itself. A URI <b>reference</b> {{is defined as}} a same-document <b>reference</b> if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the <b>reference.</b> When encountering a same-document <b>reference,</b> document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a <b>reference</b> to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI <b>reference,</b> while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

50|$|The garbage {{collector}} can reclaim only objects {{that have no}} <b>references</b> pointing to them {{either directly or indirectly}} from the root set. However, some programs require weak <b>references,</b> which should be usable {{for as long as the}} object exists but should not prolong its lifetime. In discussions about weak <b>references,</b> ordinary <b>references</b> are sometimes called strong <b>references.</b> An object is eligible for garbage collection if there are no strong (i.e. ordinary) <b>references</b> to it, even though there still might be some weak <b>references</b> to it.|$|R

Around this time, there was an addition to the highway system, with the designation of NY915K, a short connector leading to exit33 on the Adirondack Northway. The longest <b>reference</b> route is NY910M at , running from John Brown's Grave to NY73. The other three <b>reference</b> routes are NY910K (part of the Blue Ridge Road), NY912T (the shortest <b>reference</b> route, at , and a connector to NY373), and NY913Q, which serves Mount Van Hoevenberg in North Elba.|$|E
5|$|To derive a URI from a URI <b>reference,</b> {{software}} converts the URI <b>reference</b> to absolute form by merging {{it with a}} base URI {{according to}} a fixed algorithm. The system treats the URI <b>reference</b> as relative to the base URI, although {{in the case of}} an absolute <b>reference,</b> the base has no relevance. If the base URI includes a fragment identifier, it is ignored during the merging process. If a fragment identifier is present in the URI <b>reference,</b> it is preserved during the merging process.|$|E

50|$|A table (called the <b>referencing</b> table) {{can refer}} to a column (or a group of columns) in another table (the <b>referenced</b> table) by using a foreign key. The <b>referenced</b> column(s) in the <b>referenced</b> table must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key. Also, self-references are {{possible}} (not fully implemented in MS SQL Server though). On inserting a new row into the <b>referencing</b> table, the relational database management system (RDBMS) checks if the entered key value exists in the <b>referenced</b> table. If not, no insert is possible. It is also possible to specify DRI actions on UPDATE and DELETE, such as CASCADE (forwards a change/delete in the <b>referenced</b> table to the <b>referencing</b> tables), NO ACTION (if the specific row is <b>referenced,</b> changing the key is not allowed) or SET NULL / SET DEFAULT (a changed/deleted key in the <b>referenced</b> table results in setting the <b>referencing</b> values to NULL or to the DEFAULT value if one is specified).|$|R

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the <b>reference</b> texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts.

For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional <b>reference</b> translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E

5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a <b>reference</b> temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the <b>reference</b> temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the <b>reference</b> temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the <b>reference</b> temperature.|$|E
5000|$|A {{foreign key}} {{is a field}} in a {{relational}} table that matches the primary key column of another table. The foreign key {{can be used to}} cross-reference tables. Foreign keys do not need to have unique values in the <b>referencing</b> relation. Foreign keys effectively use the values of attributes in the <b>referenced</b> relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the <b>referencing</b> relation.A foreign key could be described formally as: [...] "For all tuples in the <b>referencing</b> relation projected over the <b>referencing</b> attributes, there must exist a tuple in the <b>referenced</b> relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the <b>referencing</b> attributes match the corresponding values in the <b>referenced</b> attributes." ...|$|R
50|$|Identity allows {{comparison}} of <b>references.</b> Two <b>references</b> {{can be compared}} whether they are equal or not. Due to the identity property, this comparison has special properties. If the {{comparison of}} <b>references</b> indicates that the <b>references</b> are equal, then it's clear that the two objects pointed by the <b>references</b> are the same object. If the <b>references</b> do not compare equal, then it's not necessarily guaranteed that {{the identity of the}} objects behind those <b>references</b> is different. The object identity of two objects of the same type is the same, if every change to either object is also a change to the other object.|$|R
40|$|Rapport interne. In this partial report, {{we present}} {{the current state}} of our work in 2004 within the SmartEiffel project on the design and {{implementation}} of several kinds of object <b>references.</b> We introduce the known concept of weak <b>references,</b> reminding how this peculiar kind of <b>references</b> can be used to optimize and fine-tune the memory behavior of programs, thus potentially speeding up their execution. We show that genericity (parametric types in Eiffel) is the key to implementing weak <b>references</b> in a statically-checked hence safer and more efficient way. We compare our solution for weak <b>references</b> to similar notions in other languages and stress the advantages it offers. We present practical examples to support our claim that weak <b>references</b> can be both safe and efficient, and can help optimize programs memory-wise. We further extend our work to other kinds of <b>references</b> [...] - soft <b>references,</b> tunable strength <b>references</b> and programmable <b>references</b> [...] - that provide extra degrees of flexibility and correspond to actual practical needs...|$|R

5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without <b>reference</b> to the whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without <b>reference</b> to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through <b>reference</b> to principles of natural selection via predation without need to <b>reference</b> or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
