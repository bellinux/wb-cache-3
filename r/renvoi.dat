50|$|But if {{that second}} country {{actually}} has {{choice of law}} rules requiring it to apply the forum law, a difference in outcome might arise depending on where the plaintiff invokes jurisdiction. Whether a difference actually emerges depends on whether the other state operates a Single <b>Renvoi</b> system. A single <b>renvoi</b> forum always refers to the other law's choice of law rules. If those rules would send the issue back to the forum court, the forum court will accept the first remission and applies its own laws. Thus, equality of outcome is always achieved {{so long as the}} competing laws operate different systems. Some early French authorities support this approach (e.g. Forgo's Case (1882) and Soulié's Case (1910)). Similarly, Article 27 of the Introductory Law of the German Civil Code (1900) adopts it. But if both sets of laws operate with either no <b>renvoi</b> system or single <b>renvoi</b> systems, forum shopping will be a potential problem.|$|E

50|$|In the United States most courts try {{to solve}} {{conflict}} of laws questions without invoking <b>renvoi.</b> In Re Schneider's Estate, 96 N.Y.S.2d 652 (1950), is an example where <b>renvoi</b> is recognized as an option, in which the local court chose to apply the foreign country's laws to decide the dispute in the local court.

50|$|Hence, {{there is}} another system called Double <b>Renvoi</b> or the Foreign Courts Doctrine which will also ensure parity of result so long as no other {{relevant}} law is using it. In this scenario, the forum court considers that it is sitting as the foreign court and will decide the matter as the foreign court would. In this system, there can never be more than two remissions, e.g. English forum refers to French law (a single <b>renvoi</b> system) so English law is applied (1st remission) and France accepts the remission (2nd and final). At present, only English law uses this approach.|$|E

5000|$|There {{may be an}} [...] "inextricable circle" [...] {{between sets}} of laws using either single or double <b>renvoi</b> systems which do not have {{adequate}} safeguards built in to guarantee when to stop accepting remissions.|$|E
50|$|Under Article 19, {{where the}} choice of law rules point to a country {{with more than one}} legal system, the Convention selects the most {{appropriate}} municipal law (not {{the choice of}} law rules of that law given that <b>renvoi</b> is excluded).|$|E
5000|$|Most U.S. states frown upon <b>renvoi</b> in {{a choice}} of law situation. In this example, they would insist that the only law the courts of State X should look at is the law of {{contracts}} of State Y, not the [...] "whole law" [...] of State Y, which includes that state's law governing choice of law. The basic criticism of <b>renvoi</b> {{is that it can}} lead to an endless circle. In the above example, {{it could be argued that}} if the law of State Y points back to State X, then the law of State X would only once again require application of the law of State Y, and so forth and so on without end.|$|E
50|$|The Court can affirm a {{decision}} from below by dismissing the appeal (rejet du pourvoi) or overturn or amend {{the decision by}} allowing the appeal (accueil du pourvoi). If it finds that the lower court erred, it sets aside the lower court decision and remits the case with its opinion to an appellate court for reconsideration (cassation avec <b>renvoi).</b> If {{only a portion of}} a ruling is overturned, it is called cassation partielle, or partial setting aside. Sometimes, the Court may overturn a lower court ruling and judge the case ex proprio motu without being petitioned (cassation sans <b>renvoi),</b> as long as the merits and facts of the case are on record.|$|E
5000|$|In {{conflict}} of laws, <b>renvoi</b> (from the French, meaning [...] "send back" [...] or [...] "to return unopened") is {{a subset of}} the choice of law rules and it may be applied whenever a forum court is directed to consider the law of another state.|$|E
5000|$|To {{limit the}} damage that would result from forum shopping, it is {{desirable}} that the same law is applied {{to achieve the same}} result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of <b>renvoi,</b> which literally means [...] "send back", is an attempt to achieve that end.|$|E
50|$|To {{limit the}} damage that would result from forum shopping, it is {{desirable}} that the same law be applied {{to achieve the same}} result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of <b>renvoi</b> is an attempt to achieve that end. If a forum court is directed to consult a foreign law, the first question it must address is whether this is a reference solely to the relevant substantive provisions, or to the state's system of law as a whole which would include its choice of law rules. Forums that do not have <b>renvoi</b> provisions refer only to the specific provisions of relevant law. In this way, the same outcome is achieved no matter where the case is litigated so long as the second state would also have applied its own laws.|$|E

5000|$|Use of the [...] "better rule" [...] test, like <b>renvoi,</b> is {{frowned upon}} because {{it appears to}} be little more than a gimmick to allow a court to apply the law of its own state. The test itself presupposes that, between the laws {{presented}} by the two or more states in which the action arose, there is one set of laws which is empirically better. Because courts will almost always presume that their own state has better laws, this is effectively a device to avoid applying choice of law principles altogether.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, the {{doctrine}} of <b>renvoi</b> was revived by {{the decision of the}} High Court in Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd 2005 HCA 54 (29 September 2005). In this decision the High Court considered the situation of Mrs Neilson, who had injured herself falling down the stairs in her apartment in Wuhan, China. Her apartment had been provided by her husband's employer, Overseas Projects Corporation, and Mrs Neilson sued her husband's employer in negligence in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in June 1997, six years after the accident had occurred. Under Australian choice of law rules, the law of the place of the incident or lex loci delicti governs tort situations (following the decision of that court in 2002: Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang). This meant that the law relevant to the resolution of the dispute was that of the People's Republic of China. However under Chinese law, the claim would have been statute barred for exceeding the limitations period (Article 136 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China). However Mrs Neilson raised Article 146 of the General Principles in her defence, arguing that the provision of that article should apply making the relevant law for the dispute Australian law.

40|$|LL. M. (International Commercial Law) Abstract: The Commonwealth of Nations is a {{voluntary}} association {{that consists of}} 53 independent and sovereign states, {{most of which are}} former British colonies or dependencies of these colonies. 1 South Africa and Australia are two examples of such commonwealth countries, South Africa having its law rooted in Roman-Dutch law, English common law and customary law, as well as Australia, whose laws are also greatly influenced by the English legal system. 2 Brazil, on the other hand, {{is an example of a}} civil law system. This paper seeks to offer an analytical comparison on the different approaches that these common law and civil law countries follow when faced with the doctrine of <b>renvoi,</b> a doctrine, as will be discussed below, that applies when a court is faced with a conflict of law and must consider the law of another state. 3 The essay will journey into the different stances that South Africa, Australia and Brazil take when confronted with the doctrine. Australia, as a common law jurisdiction, accepts <b>renvoi,</b> this position will be made clear. Brazil is a civil law jurisdiction with an equally clear stance to <b>renvoi,</b> it does not accept the doctrine. South Africa, as a mixed jurisdiction, lacks authority on <b>renvoi</b> and consequently has an unclear stance to the doctrine. Since both South Africa and Australia are influenced by English common law, a discussion of English case law may be necessary to illustrate the different <b>renvoi</b> approaches, and, in turn, may provide guidance for future application of <b>renvoi</b> by South African and Australian courts [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction]: It was famously {{observed}} that '[j]uristic speculation' {{on the problem}} of <b>renvoi</b> 'has been almost infinite', and there are good reasons for it. <b>Renvoi</b> is the apogee of the most distinctive concepts of private international law — the point at which conflicts rules themselves conflict and, so, call for their own conflicts rules. Fortunately, though, it would appear from the reports that adjudication that deals with the problem is much rarer. The attention that the problem of <b>renvoi</b> has received from scholars has been mercifully disproportionate to its actual incidence, and judges often either do not see it when it occurs, or see <b>renvoi</b> and ignore it. As a result, renvoz's appearance in a Western Australian case concerning a tort in the People's Republic of China, and the case's climb to the High Court of Australia, are events of considerable legal significance. The decisions in Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd of McKechnie J at first instance in the Supreme Court, and of the Full Court of the Supreme Court, have already excited some attention in the scholarly literature. In the first volume of this journal, Andrew Lu and Lee Carroll endorsed the decision of the Full Court to reject the doctrine of <b>renvoi</b> in any of its forms. Analysing any application of <b>renvoi</b> largely {{within the context of the}} Australian choice of law rules for tort, they concluded that the recognition of <b>renvoi</b> in choice of tort law would be 'undesirable'. In John Pfeiffer Pty Lid v Rogerson in 2000 and Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhank in 2002, the High Court of Australia settled that the law of the place of the tort (the lex loci delictz) governed all interstate and foreign tort claims in any Australian jurisdiction, and allowed no exceptions to that rule — barring one based on public policy in foreign tort claims. ' Lu and Carroll argued that any allowance of <b>renvoi</b> would introduce an exception to the unbending lex loci delicti rule 'by stealth',' and would therefore be 'internally flawed'. ' About the appeal in Neilson that was pending before the High Court at the time they wrote, Lu and Carroll thought that '[t]here is no suggestion that the Court will so soon resile from the position it declared [in Renault in 2002]'. The High Court decided Neilson in September 2005, and surprised many by emphatically endorsing, by a six—one majority, the availability of the doctrine of <b>renvoi</b> in cross-border tort cases. Five of those judges embraced the doctrine of double <b>renvoi.</b> As will become apparent in this comment, there is more in the High Court's decision in Neilson (than was the case in the Western Australian courts) to suggest that the Court's doctrine and method of proving foreign law are 'internally flawed'. The rationale for endorsing <b>renvoi</b> in Neilson was, in short, the object of securing uniformity of outcome with — what was claimed to be — the outcome that a Chinese court would reach in the case. But whether inter¬national uniformity was genuinely realised in Neilson is anyone's guess. What is certain, however, is that in adopting the claimed Chinese approach to the circumstances of Neilson (which was presumed to be that the law of Western Australia applied) the High Court allowed the first reported instance of the application of the lex fori in a cross-border tort case since the Pfeiffer—Renault duo were decided. This effectively negated, for the Neilson proceedings themselves, the retroactive consequences of Pfeiffer and Renault, which otherwise would have imposed a short Chinese limitation period on a claim that, at the time it was brought, would have been tightly thought to have been subject to the long six-year limitation period of the lex fori. However, as a result Neilson might well have also given Australian choice of tort law an exception 'by stealth'. If so, the High Court could also be compensating for deficient doctrine that the Court itself has insisted that Australian choice of law must have. The Pfeiffer—Renault rule is unique in the Commonwealth in allowing no real exceptions to the lex loci delicti in cross-border tort claims, even if 'the centre of gravity' for the claim were to sit heavily over the forum state. In other countries the lex fori might be applied in a tort claim by invoking a clear, but constrained, 'flexible exception' to the general choice of law rule. In Australia, nevertheless, <b>renvoi</b> is now the only means by which a court can do this. It makes Australian choice of law method more obscure, but also suggests that other countries' courts have no reason to treat Neilson as persuasive — nor to be lured down the troublesome <b>renvoi</b> path. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper I have {{analyzed}} the institution of <b>renvoi,</b> institution specific to the international private law, because it indicates importance from theoretical {{point of view and}} practical point of view, too. Thereby, the <b>renvoi</b> interferes in case of a negative conflict of laws which take place related to a juridical report with a foreign element. In this case the question arises whether the report will be settled by the law, because both the conflict norm of the approached court of law and the foreign conflict norm are declaring themselves unqualified in solving the refered to report. Thus, <b>renvoi</b> reperesents the juridical situation emerged when the conflict norm of the approached court of law refers to a foreign law system, and this, by its own conflict norm, doesn’t get the competence which is adjudged to it and it sends back to the forum law, or sends farther to a law of a third party state.

40|$|It {{has been}} intimated that <b>renvoi</b> might be allowed as an {{exceptional}} doctrine {{with respect to}} the lex domicilii. The theory suggested is that since the adoption of the le. ~ domicilii in the Conflict of Laws arose from a desire that the rights governed thereby be subject to one law -an aim impossible of realization after many countries have gone over to the lex patrie-_courts still adhering to the old rule would be justified in interpreting the same in a <b>renvoi</b> sense. This conclusion, however, is inadmissible. Could the question be examined de novo, English and American courts, for example, might hold, in view of their tendency to subject transfers of personal property inter vivos to the lex rei site, that the same rule should govern its distribution upon death. But as long as the lex domicilii is retained as the general principle a substitution of the lex fori for the foreign law upon the sole ground that the foreign country had become a convert to the lex patrie could be supported neither upon principle nor upon grounds of policy.

40|$|Some {{years ago}} in writing on the present subject the author made the {{statement}} that the <b>renvoi</b> doctrine was {{no part of the}} conflict of laws of the United States. In the light of certain more recent decisions or judicial utterances the question may properly be asked again: Should the courts of the United States adopt the <b>renvoi</b> theory in the conflict of laws? Although no discussion of the problem is yet to be found in any American decision, there are cases in which the <b>renvoi</b> doctrine has been sanctioned either expressly or by necessary implication. The case of Guernsey v. The Imperial Bank of Canada and the case of Lando v. Lando may serve as illustrations. In the former case an action was brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Wyoming against the indorser of a promissory note. The note was made and indorsed in Illinois, but it was payable in Canada. Presentment, demand and protest were made, and notice of dishonor was given in compliance with the law of Canada; but the indorser claimed that the notice would have been insufficient to charge the indorser if the note had been payable in Illinois. The court below held that the notice was good and rendered judgment against the indorser. The latter 2 ̆ 7 s counsel insisted that the ruling was error on the ground that the sufficiency of the notice was governed by the law of the place of indorsement and not by the law of the place of payment. On appeal, the learned court made the following remarks concerning the above contention: 2 ̆ 2 To this contention there is a short and conclusive answer. The place of the indorsement was the state of Illinois. The law of that state was, when the indorsement was made, and it still is, that when commercial paper is indorsed in one jurisdiction and is payable in another the law of the place where it is payable governs the time and mode of presentment for payment, the manner of protest, and the time and manner of giving notice of dishonor, and the law of the place of indorsement is inapplicable to them. Wooley v. Lyon, II 7 Ill. 248, 250,. 6 N. E. 885, 886, 57 Am. Rep. 867. If, therefore, as counsel contend, the law of the place where the indorsement was made,- the law of Illinois, governs the sufficiency of the notice of dishonor in this case that notice was good, for it was sufficient under the law of Ca 1 zad where the note was payable, and the law of Illinois was that in a case of this character the law of the place where,the note was payable governed the time and manner of giving the notice of dishonor. 2 ̆...|$|E
