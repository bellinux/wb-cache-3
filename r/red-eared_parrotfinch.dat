50|$|The <b>red-eared</b> <b>parrotfinch</b> (Erythrura coloria) is {{a species}} of estrildid finch endemic to Mindanao in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-eared</b> <b>parrotfinch</b> is {{probably}} present on every mountain in central Mindanao. It {{is a very}} unobtrusive and secretive bird. And its high-pitched call is easily overlooked. Its voice, however, is not uncommon at Kitanglad. Unlike the green-faced parrotfinch E. viridifacies, {{it does not appear}} to be strongly dependent on bamboo, and is therefore less irruptive, unpredictable and vulnerable than that species.|$|E
