In addition, the <b>regeneration</b> <b>functions</b> decrease with age; for instance, diminished epidermal cell proliferation is age-related (Grove and Kligman 1983). Hence, one’s health situation will become worse and worse since overstimulation events-caused insensitivity cells increase, whereas the body’s self-renewal ability to replace the insensitivity cells decreases, with age. On the other hand, the data suggest that high levels of some activators remain in the body cells. IL 17 RC increases IL 17 expression and vice versa (Figures  1 and 6), suggesting that high expression of IL 17 RC is transferable between cells, especially from old cells to new cells with normal IL 17 RC expression via high concentrations of IL 17 in the tissue environments (Wei et al. 2012). IL 17 is also a PI 3 K activator (Chen et al. 2011). That is perhaps one of reasons why AMD is irreversible because high levels of IL 17 and IL 17 RC which generate insensitivity kinases still exist despite cell replacement.|$|R

Hence, unlike the usual Ramsey models, our model exhibits path-dependency, and postponement in the introduction of resource efficiency policies has long-term effects. If the resource is renewable, with a limited <b>regeneration</b> <b>function,</b> the continuum becomes a turnpike. That is, optimal paths move along it towards the unique steady state.

The model is composed of a static physical submodel describing a two-dimensional circulation pattern, {{and a series of}} dynamic biological submodels incorporating nutrient uptake, grazing, and nutrient <b>regeneration</b> <b>functions.</b> Model results were qualitatively consistent with nutrient distributions observed during an upwelling event in the 1974 JOINT-I study area.

Simulated silicate distribution patterns suggest that silica dissolution parameter estimates reported for the northwest African region may represent local conditions, but are likely overestimates at a system level of resolution. Sensitivity analysis results identify grazing threshold level as the primary regulator of grazing stress in the model, and suggest that a primarily phytophagous grazing habit for clupeoid fishes is unlikely in the northwest African upwelling area...|$|R
40|$|A {{small number}} of {{mammalian}} retinal ganglion cells act as photoreceptors for regulating certain non-image forming photoresponses. These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells express the putative photopigment melanopsin. Ablation of the melanopsin gene renders these cells insensitive to light; however, the precise role of melanopsin in supporting cellular photosensitivity is unconfirmed. Here we show that heterologous expression of human melanopsin in a mouse paraneuronal cell line (Neuro- 2 a) is sufficient to render these cells photoreceptive. Under such conditions, melanopsin acts as a sensory photopigment, coupled to a native ion channel via a G-protein signalling cascade, to drive physiological light detection. The melanopsin photoresponse relies {{on the presence of}} cis-isoforms of retinaldehyde and is selectively sensitive to short-wavelength light.

In terms of the special micro-structural properties and self-repairing capacity, concrete is one kind of regenerative construction materials. Through proper handlings, self-repairing (crack close-up) of concrete cracks is possible in the concrete hydration damaged region. Due to the effect of heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent crystal growth of calcium hydroxide, a better bonding strength forms interlocking the new and old concrete interfaces. A proposal on the relationship between the self-repairing, <b>regeneration</b> <b>function</b> of concrete and the rehabilitation of historic buildings is suggested, this is based on the formed process of the bonding strength of the interfaces and the function on concrete repairing.

Experimental Physiology © 2014 The Physiological SocietyThe {{research}} outputs in {{this collection}} have been funded {{in whole or in}} part by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), muscle damage and impaired regeneration lead to progressive muscle wasting, weakness and premature death. The Notch signalling pathway represents a central regulator of gene expression and is critical for cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptotic signalling during all stages of embryonic muscle development. Notch activation improves muscle regeneration in aged mice, but its potential to restore <b>regeneration</b> and <b>function</b> in muscular dystrophy is unknown. We performed a comprehensive examination of several genes involved in Notch signalling in muscles from dystrophin-deficient mdx and dko (utrophin- and dystrophin-null) mice and DMD patients. A reduction of Notch 1 andHes 1 mRNAintibialis anteriormuscles of dko mice and quadricepsmuscles ofDMDpatients and a reduction of Hes 1 mRNA in the diaphragm of the mdx mice were observed, with other targets being inconsistent across species. Activation and inhibition ofNotch signalling, followed by measures ofmuscle <b>regeneration</b> and <b>function,</b> were performed in the mousemodels ofDMD. Notch activation had no effect on functional regeneration in C 57 BL/ 10, mdx or dko mice. Notch inhibition significantly depressed the frequency–force relationship in regenerating muscles of C 57 BL/ 10 and mdx mice after injury, indicating reduced force at each stimulation frequency, but enhanced the frequency–force relationship in muscles from dko mice. We conclude that while Notch inhibition produces slight functional defects in dystrophic muscle, Notch activation does not significantly improve muscle regeneration in murine models of muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, the inconsistent expression of Notch targets between murine models and DMD patients suggests caution when making interspecies comparisons.

40|$|In {{historic}} {{cities around}} the world, the historic urban landscape is characterized by both rich heritage assets and conditions that challenge quality of life. The latter circumstances range from substandard living conditions, congestion, lack of public services and informality, to rising property values and commercialization. In light of this duality, historic centers present unique conditions and demands for urban regeneration. These opportunities and challenges are particularly acute in Global South countries whose governments have limited funds and resources. Meanwhile, recent global conversations have emphasized culture’s enduring contributions to creating and managing equitable, sustainable cities. There is nonetheless limited academic research investigating how this connection between urban conservation and <b>regeneration</b> <b>functions.</b> This study fills that gap and contributes to ongoing dialogues regarding sustainable urban development by identifying the conditions that foster both synergy and disharmony between these urban management approaches. It does so via the following questions: Can governments in the Global South leverage urban conservation {{as a means of}} regenerating physically and socioeconomically deteriorated historic cities? What approaches are more effective and conditions more favorable than others in serving twin goals of conservation and urban regeneration for existing residents? Through a qualitative analysis of planning documents, interviews, archival documents, census data and other sources, this study assesses current practices in Quito, Loja, Ibarra and Cuenca, Ecuador. Analysis focuses on the institutional arrangements that shape the past and present socioeconomic and spatial configurations of these historic centers, paying close attention to how heritage is configured and applied in urban governance. Results from these four cities are assessed against a model of conservation-based regeneration, defined as a process that integrates conservation and social policy such that improvements to the historic built environment can benefit local, usually low-income, communities. The research finds that a city’s ability to initiate and maintain a conservation-based regeneration process depends on local government’s institutional capacity to 1) integrate and implement both conservation and social policies consistently; 2) maintain a conservation ideology flexible enough to combine these values; and 3) a national political environment that enables and supports local conservation management. ...|$|R
