40|$|What if our {{chiropractic}} {{model is}} incomplete? As a profession, we {{are good at}} finding and <b>releasing</b> <b>joint</b> restrictions. Many of us are good at finding and releasing soft-tissue restrictions, whether we call them trigger points or use Nimmo, Active Release or Graston Technique. But what if the main pain generators are joints or structures that have too much "give"? Do {{we know how to}} identify the site and direction of excessive "give"? This critical concept {{is not part of the}} dominant paradigm of our profession. Yes, we talk about hypermobility vs. hypomobility, but I don't think we practice as if we know the importance of this concept. This is the fourth and final article in this rehab series. 1 - 3 My goal has been to give you a view of newer concepts, research and, hopefully, tools to start accessing and using these new models. Now let's look at the big picture on rehab concepts as I understand them. I know that what we do helps lots of patients. I know that when we release joint and myofascial restrictions, we are taking the load off the areas of increased give. However, it may be more effective to identify the area and direction of the increased give and then design a treatment plan to correct this. This involves rehab. It usually takes low-loa...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of throwing {{was performed in}} a controlled environment {{with the aim of}} identifying the control and order parameters of throwing as proposed by dynamic pattern theory. A pilot study was conducted to test the possibility that the mass of a ball, the distance thrown and the size of targets were the control parameters. Based upon the results of the pilot study, only the distance was manipulated as an independent variable in the principal study. Three-dimensional motion was recorded using three video cameras in the motion analysis laboratory and later analysed using the Peak motion analysis system (software version 5. 0, 1992). Sixteen right handed adult females, aged 18 - 35 years, volunteered to participate in the principal study. Subjects were seated with their trunks secured to the back support of an adjustable chair. Ten different targets (0. 6 to 6. 91 m) were labelled {{on the floor in front}} of the subjects. A large area for each target was defined so that the throwing skill of subjects could be ignored as a factor in the research design. Subjects were asked to throw a 0. 5 kg ball to ten different distances using their own styles which allowed them to change the pattern of throwing as the distance thrown increased. All 16 subjects selected either an overarm or an underarm throw or employed both patterns. No subject used other patterns of throwing. At the shortest distance, a greater number of subjects selected an underarm throw. As the distance thrown increased, some subjects switched to the overarm throw. At the distance of 3. 36 m, there were eight subjects (50 %) using each style of throwing. Alteration of the throwing pattern mainly occurred from the underarm to the overarm throw. The results suggest that the distance thrown may be one of the control parameters in the throwing movement. Furthermore, the presence of both throwing patterns for all distances ++thrown suggests the presence of a multiple stable state in throwing motions. Trajectories of movement become more uniform as the distance thrown increased. Variability was greatest when subjects threw to the shortest distance for both patterns. These results imply that as the distance thrown increased the stability of both throwing patterns increased. Moreover, these results also imply a phase transition within each throwing pattern, in addition to the phase shift between the pattern of throwing. No result could directly illustrate the period of the transition. This may be due to the fact that phase transition in a multistable system is the result of an external force which drives the system from one state to another. Alteration of the pattern does not occur as a result of loss of the stability of the previous state. Furthermore, the presence of both throwing patterns for all distances thrown suggests the presence of a multiple stable state in throwing motions. Trajectories of movement become more uniform as the distance thrown increased. Variability was greatest when subjects threw to the shortest distance for both patterns. These results imply that as the distance thrown increased the stability of both throwing patterns increased. Moreover, these results also imply a phase transition within each throwing pattern, in addition to the phase shift between the pattern of throwing. No result could directly illustrate the period of the transition. This may be due to the fact that phase transition in a multistable system is the result of an external force which drives the system from one state to another. Alteration of the pattern does not occur as a result of loss of the stability of the previous state. However, some of the results such as the hysteresis graph presented indirect evidence, which could imply a phase shift between throwing patterns. In addition the higher ++degrees of joint angle recruitment in the overarm throw suggest that the stability of the system may be better maintained in the overarm throw than in the underarm throw. Alteration of the sub-styles of throwing within the same throwing pattern seemed to occur in between the shortest and the longest distances thrown. Many of the results supported this concept, for example, data related to the relative timing, the total ROM, the <b>releasing</b> <b>joint</b> angles, the trajectories of the movement, the phase plane plots, the angle-angle plots, and relative phase. However, the presence of sub-styles in the underarm throw was not as obvious as was the case for the overarm throw. In conclusion, the changes in motor behaviour during throwing as the distance thrown increased as examined in the present study can be explained by dynamic pattern theory in some aspects. However, further investigation of the stability of the patterns and energy utilisation necessary for the execution of the underarm and overarm throw are essential to determine the most suitable order parameter and to confirm the proposed control parameter (distance thrown) identified...|$|E

50|$|Unloading <b>joints</b> or <b>release</b> <b>joints</b> are joints formed {{near the}} surface during uplift and erosion. As bedded {{sedimentary}} rocks are brought closer to the surface during uplift and erosion, they cool, contract and become relaxed elastically. This causes stress buildup that eventually exceeds the tensile strength of the bedrock and results {{in the formation of}} jointing. In the case of unloading joints, compressive stress is released either along preexisting structural elements (such as cleavage) or perpendicular to the former direction of tectonic compression.|$|R
