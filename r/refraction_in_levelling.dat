While peripheral higher-order aberrations are mirror symmetric between fellow eyes of isometropes (people with similar <b>refractions</b> <b>in</b> both eyes), they were unaffected by anisometropia (dissimilar <b>refraction</b> <b>in</b> both eyes) and refractive error group, except for spherical aberration, which showed small effects.

We develop a theory of negative <b>refraction</b> <b>in</b> homogeneous and isotropic media, based on first principles, and that includes nonlocality in its full generality. The theory shows that both dissipation and spatial nonlocality are necessary conditions for the existence of negative refraction. It also provides a sufficient condition in materials with weak spatial nonlocality. These fundamental results should have broad implications in the theoretical and practical analyses of negative refraction of electromagnetic and other kinds of waves...|$|R

40|$|Volume {{graphics}} is {{a powerful}} tool for producing images from volumetric data and scalar fields. Recent developments in this area have shown that effects such as shadows and reflections can be incorporated into volume graphics. However, an important capability that it currently lacks is the ability to deal with refraction directly without first extracting surfaces from volumetric representations. This thesis solves this deficiency, in three main ways: • By investigating several new methods for rendering <b>refraction</b> <b>in</b> discrete ray tracing, and demonstrating that direct rendering of <b>refraction</b> <b>in</b> volume graphics is feasible. • By examining a collection of methods for improving the geometry of volume objects built from noisy volumetric data and hence enhancing the quality of images featuring refraction. • By deploying parallelism as a mechanism for improving the speed of rendering volume graphics scenes featuring <b>refraction.</b> <b>In</b> this study, we have proposed several methods for sampling field-based representations of refraction attributes, and analysed these methods in terms of the quality and accuracy of the results produced. We have identified two types of anomalies that affect the correctnes...|$|R

There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the mean hypermetropia between two and three instillations.
