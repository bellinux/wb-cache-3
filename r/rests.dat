40|$|The {{repressor}} element 1 -silencing {{transcription factor}} (<b>REST)</b> {{functions as a}} master regulator to maintain neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). <b>REST</b> undergoes proteasomal degradation through β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination during neuronal differentiation. However, reciprocal mechanisms that stabilize <b>REST</b> in NPCs are undefined. Here we show that deubiquitinase HAUSP counterbalances <b>REST</b> ubiquitination and prevents NPC differentiation. HAUSP expression declines concordantly with <b>REST</b> upon neuronal differentiation and reciprocally with β-TrCP levels. HAUSP knockdown in NPCs decreases <b>REST</b> and induces differentiation. In contrast, HAUSP overexpression up-regulates <b>REST</b> by overriding β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination. A consensus site (310 -PYSS- 313) of human <b>REST</b> is required for HAUSP-mediated <b>REST</b> deubiquitination. Furthermore, <b>REST</b> overexpression in NPCs rescues the differentiation phenotype induced by HAUSP knockdown. These data demonstrate that HAUSP stabilizes <b>REST</b> through deubiquitination and antagonizes β-TrCP in regulating <b>REST</b> at post-translational level. Thus, the HAUSP-mediated deubiquitination represents a critical regulatory mechanism involved in the maintenance of NPCs.

40|$|We {{measured}} the energy expenditure weekly in patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for bile duct cancer or pancreatic tumors. Twelve patients (5 women and 7 men; mean age 70. 1 years) {{were enrolled in}} this study, and their <b>resting</b> energy expenditure levels were determined by indirect calorimetry. In these patients, a significant correlation was observed between the measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditures and the predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditures calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation. The <b>resting</b> energy expenditures measured before surgery were almost {{the same as the}} predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditures (measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure: 22. 4  ±  3. 9  kcal/kg/day vs predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditure: 21. 7  ±  2. 0  kcal/kg/day). The measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure/predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditure ratio, which reflects the stress factor, was 1. 02  ±  0. 10. After the pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy, a significant increase in energy expenditure was observed, and the measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure was 25. 7  ±  3. 5  kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 7 and 25. 4  ±  4. 9  kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 14. The measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure/predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditure ratio was 1. 16  ±  0. 14 on postoperative day 7, and 1. 16  ±  0. 18 on postoperative day 14 respectively.

40|$|<b>REST</b> is a {{transcriptional}} repressor that targets a {{group of}} neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, <b>REST</b> has been implicated in controlling the expression of transcription factor genes that are crucial for lineage determination and for maintaining ES cell potential.

40|$|The Daphnia galeata {{population}} in Lake Biwa (Japan) had almost ceased producing <b>resting</b> eggs by the 1980 s. To examine whether D. galeata {{had lost the}} ability to produce <b>resting</b> eggs, or if chemical contamination was inhibiting <b>resting</b> egg production, individuals collected in fall (November) and late winter (March), were reared in the laboratory. More than 50 % of these D. galeata individuals produced <b>resting</b> eggs irrespective of the month of collection, when reared with food supplied at a level lower than that available during the maternal generation. The results reflect that D. galeata in Lake Biwa have a high ability to produce <b>resting</b> eggs when appropriate stimuli are provided. As chemical substances, such as endocrine disrupters, are known to inhibit <b>resting</b> egg production in Daphnia and these accumulate in lake sediments, we tested whether Daphnia individuals produce <b>resting</b> eggs when reared in sediment-conditioned lake water. In sediment-conditioned lake water, only a few Daphnia that were collected in March produced <b>resting</b> eggs, while 50 % of the individuals collected in November produced <b>resting</b> eggs. Thus, D. galeata collected from Lake Biwa are able to produce <b>resting</b> eggs, but genetic variation likely leads to variation in <b>resting</b> egg production in the presence of chemical contaminants. These results suggest that the recent decrease in the <b>resting</b> egg production of Daphnia populations in lake Biwa is mainly due to a decrease in the strength of the environmental queue that stimulates <b>resting</b> egg production rather than a genetic shift to strains that have a lower ability to produce <b>resting</b> eggs; yet, we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} a chemical contamination plays a role in the decrease of <b>resting</b> egg production...|$|R
