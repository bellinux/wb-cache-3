50|$|Using the new larger General Motors C-body, with {{vertical}} windshield pillars {{and the new}} Panoramic windshield, the Super for 1954 was a big Buick for {{the budget}} minded buyer. Identified by its three VentiPorts per fender, the Super script on the quarters and the series designation within the deck ornament, the Super shared other brightwork with the Roadmaster. Interiors were nylon and were plainer than in the Roadmaster. The Super did have the more expensive car's horizontal speedometer instrument panel. The convertible was upholstered in leather and had power-operated windows, seat and top, along with an outside rearview mirror on the left, as standard equipment. New features included a lighted ignition key slot, electric windows, and a roof <b>rail</b> <b>cover.</b> The Estate wagon was discontinued. Total sales fell to 118,630.|$|E
40|$|The {{high level}} of {{intercity}} passenger travel in the Northeast Corridor is supported by densely populated metropolitan city-centers, the suitable distance between the urban areas, {{and the extent to}} which economic and social activities in these urban areas complement each other. Within the region, automobile and air travel account for the majority of the passenger traffic. The majority of the air passengers travel on the air shuttles operating in the Northeast. However, since the deregulation of the airline industry, there has been consistent traffic growth on regional carriers. The development of transport modes in the Northeast has been governed by the {{high level of}} competition which exists. A passenger's modal choice is influenced by the purpose of the trip. The majority of air shuttle passengers are non-discretionary (business) travellers, who are price insensitive and rely more on air travel because of its convenience and travel time. In 1992, there were 2. 41 million air passengers (including regional service) and 600, 000 rail passengers travelling in the Boston-New York origin-destination market. The forecasted ridership for high speed rail in this O/D market (2010) is 2. 15 to 2. 25 million passengers. Of this number, 1. 32 million passengers are expected to be diverted from air travel. Based on FAA forecasts for air travel between Boston and New York City in 2010, it is estimated that there will be a twenty-nine percent (29 %) diversion of air passengers to high speed <b>rail.</b> <b>Cover</b> titleFebruary 1994 Also issued as an M.

50|$|The Monocacy Aqueduct (#2) in Frederick County, Maryland is {{the longest}} {{aqueduct}} on the canal, crossing the Monocacy River. It was completed in May 1833. It is 516 feet m long, with seven 54 feet m arches. It was begun in March 1829 and finished in April 1833. Quartz sandstone came from nearby Sugar Loaf Mountain. Some stone was boated down the river, and the rest by a wagon tramway, having oak <b>rails</b> <b>covered</b> with iron straps.|$|R

50|$|There are 3 {{different}} handguards {{currently available}} for the X95: one that is rounded and is currently only available for military issue; it is rounded so that one can mount a suppressor and have it sit inside of the handguard. The second is a rectangular one with integrated rails at the 3, 6, and 9 o' clock positions, and has removable <b>rail</b> <b>covers.</b> The third one is an elongated version of the second, made for IWI US X95s. The rounded handguard originally has separate picatinny rails on the receiver and handguard, but IWI has produced a full length flattop rail for it; the other two handguards have integrated flattop rails.|$|R
50|$|The {{interurban}} {{cars had}} to use a pantograph rather than the trolley pole on Key System rails (electrified at 600 volts) and over the Bay Bridge (electrified at 1,200 volts for the Southern Pacific); the Key System used a <b>covered</b> top-contact third <b>rail</b> over the bridge. Because of the Key System's third rail, cars that could traverse the whole system had to have their third rail shoes removed, since the top-contact shoes would have fouled the Key System <b>rail's</b> <b>cover.</b> They were normally added or removed in Sacramento. Such all-line capable cars were switchable between 600 V and 1,200 V operation; they could also operate at half power at the 1,200 V setting on 600 V overhead.|$|R

50|$|The {{vehicle was}} armed with two launch rails for the Nord SS.11 antitank guided missile, and two MG3 machine guns. The machine guns were {{mounted in the}} bow and as an {{anti-aircraft}} weapon {{on top of the}} vehicle. The Raketenjagdpanzer 2 carried fourteen missiles, twelve of which were mounted in containers inside the vehicle while the other two were attached to the launch rails. The combined traverse of both launch <b>rails</b> <b>covered</b> 180 degrees. The vehicle's mission was to engage enemy tanks at ranges between 1.5 and 3 kilometers where the range and accuracy of tank cannon were inferior to that of the SS.11 missile. The maximum effective range of the SS.11 was around 3,000 meters. The SS.11 missile could penetrate 60 centimeters of rolled homogeneous armour.|$|R

50|$|In August 1905, a train {{going down}} the hill from Silverwood Colliery to Roundwood could not hold back its load and the locomotive, Dalton Main Colliery No.4 (Andrew Barclay, Works No. 1021, built 1904) was overpowered. The crew jumped after passing over the River Don bridge. The driver {{suffered}} only shock. The fireman was slightly injured. At {{the point where the}} colliery line passed below the Great Central line the locomotive left the rails but stayed upright through the bridge and fell into the marshy ground beyond. The wagons were totally destroyed and the track seriously damaged. The locomotive was repaired and survived a further 21 years until being scrapped.

50|$|The M27 is {{essentially}} an HK416 with accessories required by the Marine Corps. The standard optic is the Trijicon ACOG Squad Day Optic (SDO), officially designated the Sight Unit, SU-258/PVQ Squad Day Optic. It is a 3.5×35 machine gun optic that has a Ruggedized Miniature Reflex (RMR) sight screwed on top for close-quarters engagements under 100 meters. Created for the SAW, the day optic offers slightly less magnification, but longer eye relief than the ACOG Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) on M16s and M4s. The longer relief helps reduce injury risk from recoil. It is issued with the Vickers Combat Applications sling and rail sling mounts, AIM Manta <b>Rail</b> <b>Covers,</b> Harris bipod, KAC backup iron sights, a foregrip, and bayonet lug. The M27 initially had a Grip Pod, which is a foregrip with bipod legs inside, but it was later replaced by a separate foregrip and bipod.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of an oversized, ruggedized treadmill built for testing heavy loads. The design permits for speed and slope control, {{as well as a}} safety tether and emergency stops. The design description is categorized by related systems. The walking belt is powered by an electric motor, which transfers the mechanical rotation via hubs, a linkage belt and rollers. The floor and surface base are sized and designed for proper operation and clearance. The electronics board provides electric power, speed control, and a powered braking system. Safety features are designed for user protection: guard <b>rails,</b> <b>covers,</b> a gantry crane and tether, and emergency stops. Operation is possible for an incline range of - 30 ° to + 30 ° at 22 increments from the horizontal, and speeds of up to 10 mph with a granularity of 0. 01 mph. The larger than usual size and strength allows for extensive usability and testing, for a successful and well-functioning apparatus...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an ongoing research that {{is carried out}} to understand the impacts occurring at the insulated rail joints (IRJ) due to wheel passages. Part of the research involves field experimentation of insulated rail joints with both inclined cut and square cut joints, which are strain gauged carefully at the throat of the <b>rails</b> <b>covered</b> by the joint bars {{as well as at}} the foot of the rails. The paper briefly describes the strain gauge location strategy using a three dimensional finite element model of the IRJ. Data consisting of the vertical, shear and longitudinal strains are reported in the paper. The data are collected using an automated computer system powered by solar panels continuously. The data have provided valuable insight on the behaviour of the IRJs under impacts due to passage of wheels across the joints. Relative performance of the square cut and the inclined cut IRJs is also described...|$|R
