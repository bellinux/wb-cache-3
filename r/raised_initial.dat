Progress was compared with that in a similar pretreatment period and also with that of a matched untreated control group of 27 patients. The most striking effect of clofibrate was a steep and sustained fall in whole-blood viscosity measured over a wide range of shear rates. This was associated with a significant fall in abnormally <b>raised</b> <b>initial</b> plasma-fibrinogen levels.

40|$|Conduction {{velocity}} (CV) and median frequency (MDF) during tetanic {{electrical stimulation}} of the tibialis anterior muscle were evaluated in patients with uncomplicated peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Results were analyzed with respect to biopsy determination of diameter and proportion of types 1 and 2 muscles fibers. Initial MDF and CV correlated positively with type 2, but not type 1 fiber diameter. Initial MDF was reduced bilaterally in patients with unilateral peripheral arterial occlusive disease as compared to normal subjects, indicating that chronic ischemia alone cannot explain the altered myoelectric signal. Physical training increased pain-free walking distance and <b>raised</b> <b>initial</b> MDF, though CV remained unchanged. Fatigue indices were highly interrelated, but showed no correlation {{with any of the}} other evaluation variables. Thus, initial MDF, a correlate of type 2 muscle fiber distribution in chronically ischemic tibialis anterior muscles, is altered in peripheral vascular disease.

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{defected}} Zircaloy- 2 -clad uranium and uranium - 2 wt. % zircorium fuel specimens in high-purity high-pressure water at 200 to 345 deg C {{was observed in}} a windowed antcclave. Time-lapse color motion pictures were taken to provide {{a record of the}} progressive changes ending in the complete disintegration of the core material in the specimens. Continuous measurement of the pressure increase caused by accumulation of hydrogen served to monitor the progress of the reaction when clouding of the water by corrosion products made visual observation impossible. The nature of the attack of all specimens was similar, although the time at which different stages occurred varied. Following an induction period, the first evidence of attack was the slow formation of a blister in the cladding area surrounding the defect. Eventually, a copions evolution of hydrogen occurried {{at the base of the}} swollen area. In general, a crack could be seen in the cladding at this stage. Catastrophic failure of the specimen followed swiftly. The time required for each phase of the reaction was reduced as the temperature was <b>raised.</b> <b>Initial</b> swelling occurred after about 24 min at 345 deg C but only after 8 hr at 200 deg C.

40|$|Objective: The {{monoclonal}} antibody alemtuzumab {{has been demonstrated}} to reduce the risks of relapse and accumulation of sustained disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients when compared to ߭interferon. The development of autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disease, {{has been reported in}} the literature with a frequency of 20 to 30 %. In this article, we describe 4 cases of alemtuzumab-induced thyroid disease in patients with MS. We also performed a systematic review of the available literature. Methods: Four patients who had received alemtuzumab for MS and subsequently developed thyroid dysfunction are presented. We compared our patients' clinical courses and outcomes to established disease patterns. We also undertook a systematic review of the published literature. Results: All 4 patients presented with initial hyperthyroidism associated with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies (TRAb). In 2 cases, hyperthyroidism did not remit after a total of 24 months of carbimazole therapy, and they subsequently underwent subtotal thyroidectomy. The third case subsequently developed biochemical hypothyroidism and required thyroxine replacement, despite having a markedly <b>raised</b> <b>initial</b> TRAb titer. Autoimmunity following alemtuzumab therapy in MS appears to occur as part of an immune reconstitution syndrome and is more likely in smokers who {{have a family history of}} autoimmune disease. Conclusion: Management of alemtuzumab-induced thyroid disease is similar to the management of "wild-type" Graves' disease. The use of alemtuzumab in this setting will necessitate close monitoring of thyroid function and early intervention when abnormalities are developing. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The primary {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the action of pathophysiologically relevant adenosine concentrations (0. 1 - 1 μM) on adhesion of neutrophils to coronary endothelium. Further aims were to evaluate the nature and localisation of the adenosine receptor involved. and to assess the effect of endogenous adenosine. Methods: Adhesion was studied in isolated perfused guinea pig hearts by determining the number of cells emerging in the coronary effluent after intracoronary bolus injections of 600 000 neutrophils prepared from guinea pig or human blood. The system was characterised by the use of the proadhesive stimulus thrombin. Results: A 5 rnin infusion of adenosine (0. 1 - 0. 3 μM) or the A 1 receptor agonist N 6 -cyclopentyladenosine (CPA, 0. 01 μM) significantly increased adhesion from about 20 % (control) to 30 %. This effect was prevented by the A 1 receptor antagonist dipropyl- 8 -cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX. 0. 1 μM). It was not diminished by cessation of adenosine infusion 90 s prior to neutrophil injection. At a higher concentration of adenosine (1 μM), adhesion {{did not seem to be}} enhanced. However, coinfusion of the A 2 receptor antagonist 3, 7 -dimethyl- 1 -propargylxanthine (DMPX. 0. 1 μM) with 1 μM adenosine unmasked the A 1 action, adhesion rising to 39 %. Adenosine had a quantitatively identical effect on adhesion of human neutrophils. Total ischaemia of 15 min duration raised adhesion of subsequently applied neutrophils to 35 %. This effect was completely blocked by DPCPX, as well as by ischaemic preconditioning (3 X 3 min). Preconditioning <b>raised</b> <b>initial</b> postischaemic coronary effluent adenosine from about 0. 8 μM to 1. 5 μM. Conclusions: The findings suggest a bimodal participation of adenosine in the development of postischaemic dysfunction by an endothelium dependent modulation of neutrophil adhesion. Stimulation occurs via endothelial A 1 receptors at submicromolar adenosine levels, whereas cardioprotection by adenosine may in part relate to the use of pharmacologically high concentrations of adenosine or enhanced endogenous production after preconditioning. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Predicting {{at birth}} which infants with {{perinatal}} hypoxic-ischaemic injury will progress to significant encephalopathy remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lactic acidosis at birth in asphyxiated neonates could predict the grade of EEG encephalopathy {{by examining the}} relationship between time taken for the normalisation of lactate, severity of encephalopathy and seizure burden. METHODS: Continuous early video-EEG monitoring was performed in babies at risk for hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Encephalopathy was graded from the EEG data. Total seizure burden (seconds) was calculated for each baby. Initial blood gas measurements of pH, base deficit and lactate were taken within 30 minutes of delivery. Time to normal serum lactate was determined in hours from birth for each infant. RESULTS: All 50 term infants had <b>raised</b> <b>initial</b> serum lactate (median (lower, upper quartiles) 11. 7 (10. 2, 14. 9)). There {{were no significant differences}} between the initial serum lactate, pH and base deficit in infants with normal/mildly abnormal (n = 24), moderately abnormal (n = 14), severely abnormal (n = 5) and inactive EEGs (n = 7). Time to normal lactate varied significantly with EEG grade (median (lower, upper quartile) 6. 0 (4. 1, 9. 5) for mild/normal EEG, 13. 5 (6. 8, 23. 5) moderate EEG, 41. 5 (30. 0, 55. 5) severe group, 12. 0 (8. 1, 21. 5) inactive group; p< 0. 001). Time to normal lactate correlated significantly with EEG seizure burden (seconds; R = 0. 446, p = 0. 002). Mean (SD) time to normal lactate was 10. 0 (7. 2) hours in infants who did not have seizures and 27. 3 (19. 0) hours in the 13 infants with electrographic seizures (p = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Serum lactate levels in the first 30 minutes of life do not predict the severity of the ensuing encephalopathy. In contrast, sustained lactic acidosis is associated with severe encephalopathy on EEG and correlates with seizure burden...|$|E
