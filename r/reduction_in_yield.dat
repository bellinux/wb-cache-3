40|$|ABSTRACT Meloidogyne incognita {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} and damaging plant-parasitic nematodes throughout the world and substantially affects growth and yield of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L). In the present study, effects of M. incognita on yield parameters of 12 okra cultivars with varying levels of resistance or susceptibility were assessed. M. incognita caused significant <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>yield</b> parameters of okra plants of all the cultivars. Maximum reduction of 34. 1 % <b>in</b> <b>yield</b> was observed <b>in</b> highly susceptible (HS) cultivar Sharmeeli. The nematode caused 20 and 17. 6 % <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>yields</b> <b>in</b> susceptible (S) cultivars Okra Sindha and Anmol, respectively. Moderately susceptible (MS) cultivars suffered 5. 9 to 12. 9 % <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>yields.</b> <b>In</b> case of moderately resistant (MR) cultivars (Sanam, Dikshah, Arka Anamika, Ikra- 1 and Ikra- 2), the <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>yields</b> were the minimum and ranged from 2. 9 to 6. 5 %. The <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> other <b>yield</b> parameters of okra cultivars were observed in the order HS > S > MS > MR. As the MR cultivars suffered less damage by the nematode, they are recommended for cultivation in fields heavily infested with M. incognita...|$|R

25|$|After the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), which limited {{underground}} explosions to 150 kilotons or less, warheads {{like the}} half-megaton W88 {{had to be}} tested at less than full yield. Since the primary must be detonated at full yield in order to generate data about the implosion of the secondary, the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>yield</b> had {{to come from the}} secondary. Replacing much of the lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel with lithium-7 hydride limited the tritium available for fusion, and thus the overall yield, without changing the dynamics of the implosion. The functioning of the device could be evaluated using light pipes, other sensing devices, and analysis of trapped weapon debris. The full yield of the stockpiled weapon could be calculated by extrapolation.|$|E
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>yield.</b> The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E
2500|$|Sugarcane smut {{can cause}} {{any amount of}} loss to {{susceptible}} varieties. Anywhere from 30% to total crop failure could be seen. The <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>yield</b> is mainly dependent on the races of the pathogen present, the variety of sugarcane, and the environmental conditions. [...] Sugarcane plants are ratoon, meaning the plant resprouts after it is harvested providing the next crop.

40|$|The {{results of}} two field trials to {{determine}} the effect of ratoon stunting disease on the growth and yield of some widely grown and newly released sugarcane varieties are described. In the plant crop of a trial grown under full irrigation, the greatest <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>yields</b> of cane and sugar among six varieties, approximately 15 %, occurred in N 14 and NC 0376. In the first ratoon, the greatest <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> cane <b>yield</b> occurred <b>in</b> Nl 4 (25 %),Nl 7 (19 %),NC 0376 (17 %) and CP 66 / 1043 (16 %) and there were similar <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>yields</b> of sugar. The responses to infection recorded in the ratoon crop of the irrigated trial were probably under-estimated because of widespread infection detected in the control plots. In the plant crop of a trial with eight varieties grown under rainfed conditions and which received 80 % of long term mean rainfall, the greatest <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> cane <b>yield</b> occurred <b>in</b> varieties Nl 7 (50 %), Nl 4 (32 %) and NC 0376 (22 %). Significant losses were also recorded in N 19 in both trials and in N 21 in the rainfed trial. Variety N 22 was tolerant ofinfection in both the irrigated and rainfed trials, and varieties N 12 and N 23 were tolerant in the rainfed trial. <b>Yield</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> both trials were mainly due to reduced stalk mass.

40|$|Strategies {{to reduce}} {{phosphorus}} and sediment yields are identified for two Australian catchments using a nonlinear optimisation model. This provides novel {{insight into the}} cost-effective management of dual pollutants of water courses in Australia. A strong degree of complementarity between the two pollutants is highlighted, given the adsorption of phosphorus to sediment that augments the value of gully and streambank management for mitigation. However, {{the relationship between the}} two pollutants is asymmetric. A 30 per cent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> phosphorus <b>yield</b> achieves a 75 per cent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> sediment <b>yield</b> <b>in</b> one catchment, while a 30 per cent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> sediment <b>yield</b> achieves only a 12 per cent <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> phosphorus <b>yield.</b> Sediment abatement costs are low given the efficiency of gully and streambank management. A 30 per cent phosphorus reduction lowers profit by 3 – 7 per cent, while a 30 per cent sediment reduction lowers profit by around 1 per cent. Land-use optimisation requires spatial heterogeneity in land-use and gully/streambank management responses. Overall, this research demonstrates the need to determine whether one pollutant is more important than another, while recognising the potential that mitigation practices possess for the reduction of multiple emissions during their evaluation...|$|R

We confirmed that the frequency of a pronounced <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> first milk <b>yield</b> after estrus onset in our dairy cows was 21. 6 %. We subsequently examined the differences in estrus intensity, feed intake, the timings of ovulation and fertility between cows with (cows with milk reduction) and without (cows without milk reduction) a pronounced <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> first milk <b>yield</b> after estrus onset. Compared to cows without milk reduction, the percentage of cows that were milked actually during estrus tended to be higher in cows with milk reduction. However, the dry matter intake 1 day before the first milking after estrus onset was similar in both the groups of cows. In cows with milk reduction, the percentage of cows that ovulated 22 - 24 hr after the first milking following estrus onset was higher than that in cows without milk reduction. The pregnancy rate in cows with milk reduction that were inseminated 3 - 8 hr after milking during which the pronounced <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> milk <b>yield</b> was exhibited was significantly higher than that in cows with milk reduction inseminated during other periods.
