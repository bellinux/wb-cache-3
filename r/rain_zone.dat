40|$|In {{this review}} paper, we {{summarize}} mechanisms limiting poleward {{extent of the}} summer mon-soon rain zones, the Asian summer monsoon in particular. They include local processes associated with net heat flux into the atmosphere and soil moisture, ventilation by cross-continental flow, and the interactive Hodwell-Hoskins (IRH) mechanism which is defined as interaction between monsoon convective heating and baroclinic Rossby wave dynamics. The latter two mechanisms, ventilation and the IRH mechanism, also induce an east-west asymmetry of the summer monsoon rain zones. Processes that change land-ocean heating contrast, differences in net heat flux into the atmosphere rather than in surface temperature, are also discussed. Convection associated with the Asian summer monsoon is initiated by net heat flux into the atmosphere and modified by soil moisture via an evaporation process. In Asia, ventilation by moisture advection is particularly important and the IRH mechanism tends to favor interior arid regions and east coast precipita-tion. Land surface condition, such as surface albedo and topography, and ocean heat transport tend to modify land-ocean heating contrast, in term of a tropospheric temperature gradient, and then change the Asian summer monsoon circulation and its associated <b>rain</b> <b>zone.</b> The stronger meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature tends to enhance the summer monsoon rainfall and extend the <b>rain</b> <b>zone</b> farther northward.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} is to answer several important questions relating to natural draft wet cooling tower (NDWCT) modelling, design and optimisation. Specifically, the work aims to conduct {{a detailed analysis of}} the heat and mass transfer processes in a NDWCT, to determine how significant the radial non-uniformity of heat and mass transfer across a NDWCT is, what the underlying causes of the non-uniformity are and how these influence tower performance. Secondly, the work aims to determine what are the consequences of this non-uniformity for the traditional one dimensional design methods, which neglect any two-dimensional air flow or heat transfer effects. Finally, in the context of radial non-uniformity of heat and mass transfer, this work aims to determine the optimal arrangement of fill depth and water distribution across a NDWCT and to quantify the improvement in tower performance using this non-uniform distribution. To this end, an axisymmetric numerical model of a NDWCT has been developed. A study was conducted testing the influence of key design and operating parameters. The results show that in most cases the air flow is quite uniform across the tower due to the significant flow restriction through the fill and spray zone regions. There can be considerable radial non-uniformity of heat transfer and water outlet temperature in spite of this. This is largely due to the cooling load in the <b>rain</b> <b>zone</b> and the radial air flow there. High radial non-uniformity of heat transfer can be expected when the cooling load in the <b>rain</b> <b>zone</b> is high. Such a situation can arise with small droplet sizes, low fill depths, high water flow rates. The results show that the effect of tower inlet height on radial non-uniformity is surprisingly very small. Of the parameters considered the water mass flow rate and droplet size and droplet distribution in the <b>rain</b> <b>zone</b> have the most influence on radial noniv uniformity of heat transfer. The predictions of the axisymmetric numerical model have been compared with a one dimensional NDWCT model. The difference between the predictions of tower cooling range is very low, generally around 1 - 2 %. This extraordinarily close comparison supports the assumptions of one dimensional flow and bulk averaged heat transfer implicit in these models. Under the range of parameters tested here the difference between the CFD models predictions and those of the one dimensional models remained fairly constant suggesting that there is no particular area where the flow/heat transfer becomes so skewed or non-uniform that the one dimensional model predictions begin to fail. An extended one dimensional model, with semi-two dimensional capability, has been developed for use with an evolutionary optimisation algorithm. The two dimensional characteristics are represented through a radial profile of the air enthalpy at the fill inlet which has been derived from the CFD results. The resulting optimal shape redistributes the fill volume from the tower centre to the outer regions near the tower inlet. The water flow rate is also increased here as expected, to balance the cooling load across the tower, making use of the cooler air near the inlet. The improvement {{has been shown to be}} very small however. The work demonstrates that, contrary to common belief, the potential improvement from multi-dimensional optimisation is actually quite small...|$|E

40|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has been}} observed to be depleted in helium (Yatm~ 0. 24), suggesting active helium sedimentation in the interior. This is accounted for in standard Jupiter structure and evolution models through the assumption of an outer, He-depleted envelope that is separated from the He-enriched deep interior by a sharp boundary. Here we aim to develop a model for Jupiter's inhomogeneous thermal evolution that relies on a more self-consistent description of the internal profiles of He abundance, temperature, and heat flux. We make use of recent numerical simulations on H/He demixing, and on layered (LDD) and oscillatory (ODD) double diffusive convection, and assume an idealized planet model composed of a H/He envelope and a massive core. A general framework {{for the construction of}} interior models with He rain is described. Despite, or perhaps because of, our simplifications made we find that self-consistent models are rare. For instance, no model for ODD convection is found. We modify the H/He phase diagram of Lorenzen et al. to reproduce Jupiter's atmospheric helium abundance and examine evolution models {{as a function of the}} LDD layer height, from those that prolong Jupiter's cooling time to those that actually shorten it.

40|$|In {{the design}} of a modern natural draught wet-cooling tower, {{structural}} and performance characteristics must be considered. Air flow distortions and resistances must be minimised to achieve optimal cooling which requires that the cooling towers must be modelled two-dimensionally and ultimately three-dimensionally to be optimized. It is found that CFD models in literature are limited to counterflow cooling towers packed with film fills which are porous in one direction only and generally have a high pressure drop, as well as purely crossflow cooling towers packed with splash fill, which simplifies the analysis considerably. Many counterflow cooling towers are however packed with trickle and splash fills which have anisotropic flow resistances, which means the fills are porous in all flow directions and thus air flow can be oblique through the fill, particularly near the cooling tower air inlet. This provides a challenge since available fill test facilities and subsequently fill performance characteristics are limited to purely counter- and crossflow configuration. This paper presents a CFD model to predict the performance of natural draught wet-cooling tower with any type of fill configuration, which can be used to investigate the effects of different atmospheric temperature distributions, air inlet and outlet geometries, air inlet heights, variations in radial water loading and fill depth, fill configurations, <b>rain</b> <b>zone</b> drop size distributions, and spray zone performance characteristics on cooling tower performance for optimization purposes. Furthermore the effects of damage or removal of fill in annular sections and boiler flue gas discharge in the centre of the tower can be investigated. The fill performance characteristics for oblique air flow are determined by linear interpolation between counter- and crossflow fill characteristics in terms of the air flow angle. The CFD results are validated by means of corresponding one-dimensional computational model data. © 2010 by ASME...|$|E
