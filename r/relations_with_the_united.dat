5|$|Menem {{supported}} the Washington Consensus, and tackled inflation with the Convertibility plan in 1991. The plan was complemented {{by a series}} of privatizations, and was a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and developed special <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The country suffered two terrorist attacks. The Peronist victory in the 1993 midterm elections allowed him to force Alfonsín to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, which he won. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a political coalition that won the 1997 midterm elections and the 1999 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Japan has close {{economic}} and military <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as {{the cornerstone of the}} nation's foreign policy. A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010.

5|$|The Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco), a {{subsidiary}} of the Standard Oil Company of California (Socal), discovered oil in 1931 and production began the following year. This was to bring rapid modernisation to Bahrain. <b>Relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom became closer, as evidenced by the British Royal Navy moving its entire Middle Eastern command from Bushehr in Iran to Bahrain in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Bilateral <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States are {{strained}} {{because the}} U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), {{and also because}} the Belarusian government has made it increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E
5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations with Japan. Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854.

5|$|On February 15, 2008, it was {{announced}} that the pro-Western Boris Tadić won the 2008 Serbian presidential election. The 2008 elections were particularly important to Serbia's <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, as the main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (a reversal from SRS's eurosceptic position), he was being advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom has {{followed}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy and}} maintained close <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and the United Kingdom. During the first Gulf War (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process. After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.|$|E
5|$|ABC News {{reported}} that Harper's chief of staff, Ian Brodie {{was responsible for}} the details reaching the hands of the media. Harper has denied that Brodie {{was responsible for the}} leak, and launched an investigation to find the source. The Opposition, as well as Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, criticized the Government on the issue, stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama. They also alleged the leak would hurt <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States if Obama ever were to become President. Obama was elected President in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit, as president, to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.|$|E

In addition to citing various human rights violations, the CDU also believes that Turkey's unwillingness to recognise Cyprus as an independent, sovereign state contradicts the EU policy that its members must recognise the existence of one another.|$|R

5000|$|The Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 (...) was an Act of Congress of <b>the</b> 81st <b>United</b> States Congress {{signed by}} President Harry Truman in July 3, 1950.

5|$|After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke {{diplomatic}} <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. While the United States {{claimed that}} Texas's border {{stretched to the}} Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River. While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and {{the political will to}} do so. President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory ending the fighting in Texas.|$|E

5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the treaty. He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and their followers who carried out the terms of the treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

50|$|Since 1980, {{the foreign}} {{relations}} of Iraq were influenced {{by a number of}} controversial decisions by the Saddam Hussein administration. Hussein had good <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and a number of western countries such as France and Germany, who provided him with advanced weapons systems. He also developed a tenuous <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, who supported him during the Iran-Iraq war. However, the Invasion of Kuwait that triggered the Gulf War brutally changed Iraq's <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Arab World and the West. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and others were among the countries that supported Kuwait in the UN coalition. After the Hussein administration was toppled by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the governments that succeeded it have now tried to establish <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> various nations.|$|R

5|$|President Sadat {{believed}} that Egypt's economic, political, social and military problems were {{a result of}} the Six Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing the humiliation of the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem. In return Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom were tense, as American {{fishermen}} felt menaced by the British navy's increasing {{enforcement of}} Canadian waters. Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington, John Crampton, which {{would reduce the}} need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence. Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce's expansionist goals.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines values its <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.

Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E
