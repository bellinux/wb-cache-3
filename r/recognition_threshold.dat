2500|$|In wine tasting, {{there is}} a big {{distinction}} made between what is considered a flaw and a fault. Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics.

The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and Brettanomyces can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include acetaldehyde (except when purposely induced in wines like Sherry and Rancio), ethyl acetate and cork taint.|$|E

Ninety young (20 - 40 years) and 90 elderly (over 64 years) subjects evaluated chocolate mint-, lemon-, or strawberry-flavored milk. Detection and <b>recognition</b> <b>thresholds</b> were determined for sucrose and for the assigned flavor in milk systems. Sucrose was dissolved in milk, and flavors were dispersed in milk with flavor identification. Preference was determined using a 9 -point hedonic scale to evaluate all combinations of five sucrose and five flavor levels in milk. Subjects also answered a questionnaire regarding individual chemosensory function, sweet beverage enjoyment, general perception of food flavors, and circumstances that might influence their taste and smell function. Compared to young, elderly had higher detection and <b>recognition</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the tastant sucrose for the olfactants lemon and strawberry, and for the olfactory/trigeminal stimulant of chocolate mint in milk systems. This suggest elderly have lower chemosensory function regarding taste, smell, and trigeminal sense. Differences between detection and <b>recognition</b> <b>thresholds</b> were larger for elderly than for young subjects, especially for flavors, implying cognitive as well as sensory losses with aging. Despite lower chemosensory function, elderly did not report greater taste or smell dysfunction. The loss of chemosensory function may be too gradual to be noticed.

5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 10: Speech <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> (SRT) in noise.To aid {{explanation}} {{of this concept}} the CHL and the SNHL have the same magnitude of hearing loss (50 dBHL). The horizontal part of the curves is where the noise is inaudible. Thus, there is no masking effect on the SRT. The horizontal portion of the curve for the SNHL and CHL extends further than that for a normal hearing person, as the noise needs to become audible to become a problem. Thus, more noise has to be applied, to produce a masking effect. At the right hand side of the graph, to identify 50% of the speech correctly, the speech needs to much more intense than in the quiet. This is because at {{this end of the}} graph, the noise is very loud whether the person has a hearing loss or not. There is a transition between these two areas described. Factor A is a problem only in low noise levels, whereas Factor D is a problem when the noise level is high.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{indicate}} that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as chemotaxis even in motile bacteria such as E. coli. Newborn human infants also demonstrate preferences for high sugar concentrations and prefer solutions that are sweeter than lactose, the sugar found in breast milk. Sweetness {{appears to have}} the highest taste <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold,</b> being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution. By comparison, bitterness appears to have the lowest detection threshold, at about 1 part in 2 million for quinine in solution. In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate energy density, while bitterness tends to indicate toxicity The high sweetness detection threshold and low bitterness detection threshold would have predisposed our primate ancestors to seek out sweet-tasting (and energy-dense) foods and avoid bitter-tasting foods. Even amongst leaf-eating primates, {{there is a tendency}} to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fibre and poisons than mature leaves. The 'sweet tooth' thus has an ancient evolutionary heritage, and while food processing has changed consumption patterns, human physiology remains largely unchanged.|$|E

In a further 26 adults (13 male, 13 female, age range 19 - 48) a series of MSG and sodium chloride solutions were presented either to the back or the tip of the tongue in a pseudorandom order. <b>Recognition</b> <b>thresholds</b> were calculated from psychophysical function curves before and 2 hours after a single acute dose of either paroxetine (serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor), reboxetine (noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor), caffeine (active placebo) or placebo (lactose) in a double blind cross-over design.

This study {{examined}} the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on the air-conducted hearing threshold level (0. 5 – 4 kHz) and speech <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> level of the better ear as well as self-reported hearing in older women. Methods. Hearing was measured {{as a part of}} the Finnish Twin Study on Aging in 103 monozygotic (MZ) and 114 dizygotic (DZ) female twin pairs aged 63 – 76 years. Audiometric measured hearing was tested using standardized methods in soundproof conditions. Self-reported hearing was assessed by a structured question. Quantitative genetic modeling was used for data analyses. Results. No significant differences in age, exposure to noise, hearing-aid use, auditory diseases or accidents, or number of self-reported chronic conditions or prescription medicines were observed between the MZ and DZ twins. A genetic component in common accounted for 75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 67 %– 81 %) of the variance in the better ear’s hearing threshold level and 54 % (95 % CI, 43 %– 64 %) in the better ear’s speech <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> level, according to a bivariate genetic analysis.

40|$|The {{most common}} neuropsychiatric {{condition}} {{in the in}} children is {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), affecting approximately 6 - 9 % of the population. ADHD is distinguished by inattention and hyperactive, impulsive behaviors as well as poor performance in various cognitive tasks often leading to failures at school. Sensory and perceptual dysfunctions have also been noticed. Prior research has mainly focused on limitations in executive functioning where differences are often explained by deficits in pre-frontal cortex activation. Less notice has been given to sensory perception and subcortical functioning in ADHD. Recent research has shown that children with ADHD diagnosis have a deviant auditory brain stem response compared to healthy controls. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if the speech <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> differs between attentive and children with ADHD symptoms in two environmental sound conditions, with and without external noise. Previous research has namely shown that children with attention deficits can benefit from white noise exposure during cognitive tasks and here we investigate if noise benefit is present during an auditory perceptual task. For this purpose we used a modified Hagerman’s speech recognition test where children with and without attention deficits performed a binaural speech recognition task to assess the speech <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> in no noise and noise conditions (65 dB). Results showed that the inattentive group displayed a higher speech <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> than typically developed children (TDC) and that the difference in speech <b>recognition</b> <b>threshold</b> disappeared when exposed to noise at supra threshold level. From this we conclude that inattention can partly be explained by sensory perceptual limitations that can possibly be ameliorated through noise exposure...|$|E
