This linkage allows an interrogating ground station to recover the Doppler shift and thus infer range and speed from a communication signal without allocating power to a separate <b>ranging</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transponder ranging {{turn-around}} {{had to be}} manually enabled by an astronaut. It consumed an appreciable {{fraction of}} the downlink capacity {{and it was only}} needed occasionally, typically during handover from one ground station to the next. After the new uplink station achieved a 2-way coherent transponder lock in which the spacecraft generated its carrier at 240/221 times the received uplink frequency, the new ground station ranged the spacecraft. Then the <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> was turned off and the range measurement was continually updated by Doppler velocity measurements.|$|E
50|$|The Timation {{satellites}} were conceived, developed, {{and launched}} by the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. beginning in 1964. The concept of Timation was to broadcast an accurate time reference {{for use as a}} <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> to receivers on the ground. On 31 May 1967 the Timation-1 satellite was launched. This was followed by the Timation-2 satellite launch in 1969. The results of this program and Air Force Project 621B formed the basis for the Global Positioning System (GPS). The Navy's contribution to the GPS program continued to be focused on ever more accurate clocks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reciprocating}} chemical muscle {{was developed}} as a drive mechanism for the flapping wings of the entomopter. The RCM reuses energy many times before releasing it into its surroundings. [...] First, it converts mainly heat energy into flapping-wing motion in the entomopter. Then, heat is scavenged for thermoelectric generation in support of ancillary systems. Waste gas from the chemical decomposition of the fuel is then {{used to create a}} frequency modulated continuous wave acoustic <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> that is Doppler insensitive (used for obstacle avoidance). Waste gas is then passed through an ejector to entrain external atmospheric gases to increase mass flow and decrease waste gas temperature so that lower-temperature components can be used downstream. Some waste gas is diverted into gas bearings for rotational and linear moving components. Finally, remaining waste gas is vectored into the wings where it is used for circulation-controlled lift augmentation (Coanda effect). Any remaining gas can be used for vectored thrust, but if the gas budgets are correctly designed, there should be no extra gas beyond the circulation control points. The features of the RCM are tailored to the entomopter to conserve energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{system worked}} by using sites known as Y-Stations. Each station had 5 radio {{operation}} systems. Each consisted of an omnidirectional transmitter an omnidirectional receiver and a direction finder. This allowed each site to control 5 fighters. The transmitter would {{send out a}} signal which {{was picked up by}} the FuG16ZY in the fighter (known as the Y Fighter), this repeated the signal back on a frequency 1.9 MHz lower than the transmitted frequency. Using the direction finder (DF) the angle was measured. Range was calculated by a timing system connected to both the transmitter and the omnidirectional receiver. Height could not be measured. However voice could be transposed onto the <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> allowing the ground controller to talk and listen to the pilot of the plane he was controlling, hence the pilot could report altitude when requested to do so. Controlling a single fighter was of not much use in practice so the Luftwaffe developed group control, where a Y-Fighter was {{part of a group of}} fighters intercepting an allied bomber stream, The Y-Fighter was painted a distinctive colour and the rest of the flight simple followed him. The flight leader could also listen into the ground controller channel and hear what the ground controller was saying while also being able to talk to the flight. The Y-Fighter was never the group controller. the system was susceptible to jamming on the FuG16ZY wavelength but was at least partially usable for the rest of the war. Controllable range was approx 250 km depending on aircraft height. One source mentions that relay stations could be used to extend the radio range. The relay station would consist of a single transmitter/receiver/DF finder system without the rest of the communication and guidance systems of the main Y site. The radio system used was a modified FuG16 radio. The Y-Site also contained other systems such as radio communications for talking to area control.|$|E

First, a new {{orthogonal}} <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> design is proposed by which an efficient, low-complexity multi-user <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> detection is developed. Based on the <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> detector results, power estimation for the detected ranging subscriber stations is performed. Then, by utilizing the proposed orthogonal <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> design together with the redundancy introduced by cyclic prefixes, a new iterative multi-user timing offset estimator is presented. Compared with the existing methods utilizing the CDMA-type ranging codes (in frequency-domain) defined in IEEE 802. 16 - 2004, the proposed method achieves a better performance and greater robustness against multi-user interference and multi-path fading channels.

40|$|A telemetry-based ranging {{scheme was}} {{developed}} in which the downlink <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> is eliminated, and the range is computed directly from the downlink telemetry signal. This is the first Deep Space Network (DSN) ranging technology that {{does not require the}} spacecraft to transmit a separate <b>ranging</b> <b>signal.</b> By contrast, the evolutionary ranging techniques used over the years by NASA missions, including sequential ranging (transmission of a sequence of sinusoids) and PN-ranging (transmission of a pseudo-noise sequence) whether regenerative (spacecraft acquires, then regenerates and retransmits a noise-free <b>ranging</b> <b>signal)</b> or transparent (spacecraft feeds the noisy demodulated uplink <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> into the downlink phase modulator) relied on spacecraft power and bandwidth to transmit an explicit <b>ranging</b> <b>signal.</b> The state of the art in ranging is described in an emerging CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) standard, in which a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence is transmitted from the ground to the spacecraft, acquired onboard, and the PN sequence is coherently retransmitted back to the ground, where a delay measurement is made between the uplink and downlink signals. In this work, the telemetry signal is aligned with the uplink PN code epoch. The ground station computes the delay between the uplink signal transmission and the received downlink telemetry. Such a computation is feasible because symbol synchronizability is already {{an integral part of the}} telemetry design. Under existing technology, the telemetry signal cannot be used for ranging because its arrival-time information is not coherent with any Earth reference signal. By introducing this coherence, and performing joint telemetry detection and arrival-time estimation on the ground, a high-rate telemetry signal can provide all the precision necessary for spacecraft ranging...|$|E

30|$|Another {{problem we}} need to take into {{consideration}} is the interference between the ranging process and the communication process. Although the spatial diversity and the code diversity have been applied to distinguish different users, the communication signal still can corrupt the <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> for the same user because these two processes use the same SS code. Thanks to the imaging-based receiving method and the 2 -D PD array, only several certain PDs are corrupted.

Our method can also be extended for multiple target nodes. We remark that {{in a large scale}} WSN, it is common to localize target nodes in a sequential way [23]. The target nodes that have enough anchors are localized first. Then, the located target nodes can be viewed as new anchors that can facilitate the localization of other target nodes. Therefore, the multiple-anchors-one-target scenario here is of practical interest. We can even consider a case with a moving anchor, in which a <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> is periodically transmitted by the target node, and all the positions where the moving anchor receives the <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> are viewed as the fixed positions of some virtual anchors. We assume that all the anchors are synchronized, and their clock skews are equal to 1, whereas the clock of the target node runs freely. Furthermore, we assume that the target node transmits a <b>ranging</b> <b>signal,</b> and all the anchors act as receivers. We remark that other systems may share the same data model such as a passive sensor array for source localization or a GPS system, where a GPS receiver locates itself by exploring the received ranging signals from several satellites [1]. All the satellites are synchronized to an atomic clock, but the GPS receiver has a clock offset relative to the satellite clock. Note that this is a stricter synchronization requirement than ours, as we allow the clock of the target node to run freely. Every satellite sends a <b>ranging</b> <b>signal</b> and a corresponding transmission time. The GPS receiver measures the TOAs, and calculates the time-of-flight (TOF) plus an unknown offset. In this section, TOA measurements are used, and TDOA measurements are employed in the next section.|$|E
