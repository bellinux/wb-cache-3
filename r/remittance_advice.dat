5000|$|<b>Remittance</b> <b>advice</b> is {{a letter}} sent by a {{customer}} to a supplier, to inform the supplier that their invoice has been paid. If the customer is paying by cheque, the <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> often accompanies the cheque. The advice may consist of a literal letter (e.g., [...] "Gentlemen: Your shipment of the 10th inst was received in good order; accompanying is our remittance of $52.47 per invoice No 83046") or of a voucher attached to the side or top of the cheque.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{systems will}} often scan a paper <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> into a {{computer}} system where data entry will be performed. Modern remittance advises can include dozens, or hundreds of invoice numbers, and other information.|$|E
5000|$|Remittance advices are not mandatory, {{however they}} {{are seen as a}} {{courtesy}} because they help the accounts-receivable department to match invoices with payments. The <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> should therefore specify the invoice numbers for which payment is tendered.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{claim is}} {{adjudicated}} by the payer, {{some sort of}} a response is sent to the submitter. This usually comes as a paper Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or an Electronic <b>Remittance</b> <b>Advice</b> (ERA). These describe the actions that the payer took on each claim: amounts paid, denied, adjusted, etc.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally scan-based trading {{programs}} use Electronic Data Interchange solutions as the {{key component}} to synchronize information on store locations (Organizational Structure 816), items (Price/Sales Catalog 832), daily sales (Product Activity Data 852), receivings (Receiving Advice 861), billings (Invoice 810) and payments (<b>Remittance</b> <b>Advice</b> 820) between a retailer and its Scan-Based Trading suppliers.|$|E
5000|$|Specialized {{software}} {{increases the}} productivity of the banking customers allowing them to receive electronic data and images from the bank and automation exists that can quickly move the images into document-management systems, work-flow systems and accounting systems. In the health-care industry, this data is converted into edi 835 5010 ERA format (electronic <b>remittance</b> <b>advice).</b>|$|E
50|$|The CAQH CORE process {{centers on}} an {{integrated}} model consisting of rule development, testing and certification, outreach and tracking measures. In 2012-2013, the organization released operating rules for four transactions now federally mandated for all HIPAA-covered entities: eligibility, claim status, {{electronic funds transfer}} and <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> (EFT/ERA). In 2015, it announced additional voluntary operating rules for healthcare claims, prior authorization, employee premium payment and employee enrollment and disenrollment.|$|E
5000|$|The numeric entry or 10 key {{speed is}} a measure of one's ability to {{manipulate}} the numeric keypad found on most modern separate computer keyboards. It is used to measure speed for jobs such as data entry of number information on items such as <b>remittance</b> <b>advice,</b> bills, or checks, as deposited to lockboxes. It is measured in [...] "Keystrokes per hour," [...] or KPH. Many jobs require a certain KPH, often 8,000 or 10,000.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{adoption}} of {{electronic funds transfer}} (EFT) and electronic <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> (ERA) enrollment continues to challenge healthcare organizations. To simplify this process, CAQH launched EnrollHub in 2013 to offer providers a single enrollment process for EFT and ERA with multiple payers. Providers complete the standardized, electronic enrollment form and select the health plans with which they do business. CAQH notifies the health plans of the enrollment, and the health plan then accesses the provider’s banking information.|$|E
50|$|When {{making a}} direct deposit {{by means of}} {{electronic}} funds transfer, the payer would also normally enter reference information to enable the payee to easily recognise who made the deposit and which account to credit. The reference may be an account number, an invoice number, the payer's name, or some other meaningful identification. To ensure that the payee {{is aware of the}} deposit, the payer would commonly follow up by sending to the payee a <b>remittance</b> <b>advice.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Typically when {{customers}} {{pay bills}} with cheques (like gas or water bills), the mail {{will go to}} a [...] "lock box" [...] at the post office. There a bank will pick up all the mail, sort it, open it, take the cheques and <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> out, process it all through electronic machinery, and post the funds to the proper accounts. In modern systems, taking advantage of the Check 21 Act, as in the US, many cheques are transformed into electronic objects and the paper is destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{countries}} where cheques are still used, most companies' invoices are {{designed so that}} customers return {{a portion of the}} invoice, called a <b>remittance</b> <b>advice,</b> with their payment. In {{countries where}} wire transfer is the predominant payment method, invoices are commonly accompanied by standardised bank transfer order forms (like acceptgiros [...] (Netherlands) and Überweisungen [...] (German)) which include a field into which the invoice or client number can be encoded, usually in a computer-readable way. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at, or mails it to, his bank, which will then transfer the money.|$|E
50|$|After {{the claims}} {{adjudication}} process is complete, {{the insurance company}} often sends {{a letter to the}} person filing the claim describing the outcome. The letter, which is sometimes referred to as <b>remittance</b> <b>advice,</b> includes a statement as to whether the claim was denied or approved. If the company denied the claim, it has to provide an explanation for the reason why under regional laws. The company also often sends an explanation of benefits that includes detailed information about how each service included in the claim was settled. Insurance companies will then send out payments to the providers if the claims are approved or to the provider’s billing service.|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> (ERA) is {{an electronic}} data interchange (EDI) version of a medical insurance payment explanation. It provides details about providers' claims payment, and if the claims are denied, it would then contain the required explanations. The explanations include the denial codes and the descriptions, which present {{at the bottom of}} ERA. ERA are provided by plans to Providers. In the United States the industry standard ERA is HIPAA X12N 835 (HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; X12N = insurance subcommittees of ASC X12; 835 is the specific code number for ERA), which is sent from insurer to provider either directly or via a bank.|$|E
50|$|The {{insurance}} company (payer) processes the claims usually by medical claims examiners or medical claims adjusters. For higher dollar amount claims, the {{insurance company}} has medical directors review the claims and evaluate their validity for payment using rubrics (procedure) for patient eligibility, provider credentials, and medical necessity. Approved claims are reimbursed for {{a certain percentage of}} the billed services. These rates are pre-negotiated between the health care provider and {{the insurance company}}. Failed claims are denied or rejected and notice is sent to provider. Most commonly, denied or rejected claims are returned to providers in the form of Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Electronic <b>Remittance</b> <b>Advice.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Providers {{typically}} {{charge more}} for services than {{what has been}} negotiated by the physician and the insurance company, so the expected payment from the insurance company for services is reduced. The amount that is paid by the insurance is known as an allowable amount. [...] For example, although a psychiatrist may charge $80.00 for a medication management session, the insurance may only allow $50.00, and so a $30.00 reduction (known as a [...] "provider write off" [...] or [...] "contractual adjustment") would be assessed. After payment has been made, a provider will typically receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Electronic <b>Remittance</b> <b>Advice</b> (ERA) along with the payment from the insurance company that outlines these transactions.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{exchange of}} information regarding the planning and control activities (schedules, resources, materials, cost, cash flow) between the different parties involved in building and construction projects is a critical success factor to avoid projects ’ time and costs overrun and to insure better quality. However, current applications and research and development efforts on electronic {{exchange of information}} are usually restricted to the exchange of technical design information, particularly CAD exchange amongst designers and between these and contractors; and of business data (purchase orders, invoices, <b>remittance</b> <b>advice,</b> etc.), between contractors and builders, merchants and suppliers.

40|$|Small-scale grower (SSG) {{production}} in Mpumalanga province of South Africa has declined dramatically since the 2000 / 01 season. Tsb Sugar Ltd provided 811 consolidated <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> slips from the 2003 / 04 to 2006 / 07 seasons for analysis {{to obtain an}} insight into SSG financial returns. The results are indicative of the growers ’ annual cash trading account, and are expressed per unit of gross production to enable comparison. Results indicate that the sustainability of the sector is questionable, with 30 % of growers reliant on industry financial grants to generate a remuneration surplus. Scale economies do exist in the sector and a direct positive relationship exists between yield and unit returns. A grower’s choice of financial institution’s terms of trade has {{a significant impact on}} unit returns. Results show that declining yields may be a product of a reduced incentive to invest, brought about by continued poor terms of trade. Specific policy recommendations include improving performance by consolidating areas to take advantage of scale economies and increasing yields, and increasing the institutional savings to enable growers to ratoon their crops. Returns can be further improved, and sustainability enhanced, by restructuring current debt levels through lobbying financial institutions for debt restructuring...|$|E
