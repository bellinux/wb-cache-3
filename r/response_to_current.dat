[...] "She {{knew it was time}} to make a change" [...] as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more to her than the constant media circus surrounding her. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , documented that Madonna had previously stated that many of her songs have been overlooked in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>current</b> trends, with her long-time friend and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï stating [...] "she hasn't shouted about her musical abilities." [...] Taraborrelli explained [...] "So, whether Madonna released Something to Remember, a collection of previously released love songs, because she had a point to prove or simply to keep a contractual obligation, the fourteen track recording did make a statement." [...] Described as a [...] "love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike" [...] the compilation seemed to notify her contemporaries of her musical talent.

The effect is reduced after field cycling. This behavior suggests that the effect being seen is purely magnetic in origin, as only the field is being varied. A ln() type function has been curve fitted to the zero field voltage <b>response</b> <b>to</b> a <b>current</b> step before field cycling.
