5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable.

This research was aimed at investigating the effects of some <b>extraction</b> <b>process</b> parameters on some quality characteristics of parinari oil (acid, iodine and saponification values). This work reports {{for the first time the}} effects of <b>extraction</b> <b>process</b> parameters on the properties of parinari seed oil. The parinari seeds were harvested and oil was obtained from the seeds by solvent extraction method based on the experimental design. The experimental design followed central composite design (CCD). Effects of extraction parameters on the quality characteristics were investigated. The study parameters were time (2 - 6 h), temperature (60 - 70 oC), solid- solvent ratio (0. 03 - 0. 08 g/cm 3) and solvent types (n-hexane and petroleum ether). The responses were acid, saponification and iodine values. The results indicated that time and temperature significantly influenced the physicochemical properties of parinari oil. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based analysis of variance indicated that the models obtained were all significant (p < 0. 0001). The set of conditions for the optimal quality was obtained at temperature (60 oC), time (2 h), solid to solvent ratio (0. 07 g/cm 3) and n-hexane solvent with 89. 7 % desirability.

30|$|The {{constant}} {{growing demand}} for vegetable oil for biodiesel and food is raising many environmental concerns about the sustainability of its production based on crops. Oleaginous yeasts show great potential to end with those concerns due to their high lipid productivity in small areas. To evaluate their productivity in lipids, an efficient and reproducible <b>extraction</b> <b>process</b> should be used. As no standard <b>extraction</b> <b>process</b> is available for the extraction of yeast lipids, an optimized <b>extraction</b> <b>process</b> is presented. In this work, the lipids <b>extraction</b> <b>process</b> for the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Lipomyces kononenkoae is optimized using bead beating for cell rupture and introducing adaptations {{of the two most}} used extraction methods (Bligh and Dyer and Folch). For Rhodotorula g. the optimum extraction conditions are obtained by the Bligh and Dyer method applying 4.8 cycles of 47  s with 0.7  g of glass beads. For Lipomyces k. the optimum extraction conditions make use of the Folch method applying seven cycles of 42  s with 0.54  g of glass beads. These results reinforce the idea that, for each yeast, different <b>extraction</b> <b>processes</b> may be needed to correctly determine the lipid yield. The extraction procedure was further evaluated with less harmful solvents. Toluene was tested as a possible substitute of chloroform, and ethanol as a possible substitute of methanol. With the optimized <b>extraction</b> <b>process,</b> better results for Lipomyces k. were obtained using toluene and ethanol, while for Rhodotorula g. toluene proved to be a valid substitute of chloroform but ethanol is far less effective than methanol.|$|R
