40|$|The {{objectives}} {{for this study}} were to: (a) identify the percentage of independent community pharmacy prescriptions covered by major third party programs throughout the United States, (b) estimate the degree to which reimbursement rates from the major third party providers were inadequate, (c) determine the existence and amount of any cost shift subsidy paid by private-pay customers, (d) assess the relationship of eight secondary independent variables to the amount of the cost shift subsidy paid by the private-pay customers, (e) determine the importance of reasons for a pharmacy 2 ̆ 7 s participation in third party prescription programs, and (f) identify third party-induced problems experienced by independent community pharmacies. ^ Data were collected on ten prescription medications randomly selected from the top 200 prescribed drugs and the top 20 prescribed generic drugs. Prescription pricing information and third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> rates were collected for each medication. Responses from 418 independent community pharmacies provided the basis for analysis. ^ Third party prescription programs were found to cover 32. 1 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in independent community pharmacies, with State Medicaid programs as the largest single third party provider. ^ Third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> rates were significantly lower than single rate prescription prices and private-pay prices for a majority of the prescriptions examined. Medicaid reimbursement rates were responsible for 73. 6 percent of the total third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> inadequacies. ^ Private-pay customers were found to pay an average cost shift subsidy of 0. 48 per prescription due to inadequate third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> The percentage of all prescriptions filled pursuant to third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> was significantly associated with the magnitude of cost shifting. ^ Pharmacists were found to participate in third party programs because of a motivation to serve the needs of the individuals who patronize their pharmacies. Additionally, pharmacists felt trapped into participation, but hoped for better treatment by third party programs in the future. ^ Third party-induced problems identified by independent community pharmacists were classified into seven categories: reimbursement problems, administrative problems at the pharmacies, claims payment problems, administrative problems at the third party programs, contractual problems, operational problems at the pharmacies, and other problems. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> is {{the means by}} which health care {{professionals}} are reimbursed for the services they perform. Obtaining third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> is very important for all athletic training settings. Without this ability, athletic trainers {{will not be able to}} increase their revenue, and in turn may become a financial liability to their employers. The purpose of this study was threefold. The first purpose was to determine the barriers preventing certified athletic trainers, ATCs, from receiving third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> The second purpose was to ascertain the prevalence of third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of ATCs in the State of Indiana was a second purpose. The third purpose was to determine which athletic training settings have been most successful in obtaining reimbursement. All participants for this study were certified, licensed athletic trainers currently employed as an ATC in the State of Indiana. The settings in which these participants were employed varied between each of the four athletic training settings; collegiate/university, clinic/clinic outreach, industrial, and high school. Participants were selected using systematic sampling from a roster obtained through the National Athletic Trainers' Association, NATA. Fifteen names were selected from each of the four settings, thus totaling sixty participants. There were a total of twenty-four respondents. "The Status of Third <b>Party</b> <b>Reimbursement</b> for Certified Athletic Trainers in the State of Indiana" survey was created specifically for this study. The survey itself consists of 15 questions. Seven of these questions were closed-ended, five questions were based on a Likert Rating Scale ranging from Strongly Agree (SA) to Disagree (D), and three questions were open-ended. The survey was sent to all participants via postal mailings. This was a descriptive research study. The research questions in this study were analyzed using frequency counts and percentages. Results from this study indicated that a lack of education of employers and a lack of HCFA recognition were the most common barriers for athletic trainers. Only eight percent (n= 2) of the surveyed population reported that they were currently being reimbursed for their athletic training services, both of those respondents were working in the industrial setting. This study indicates that reimbursement is not being achieved on a regular basis by ATCs in the State of Indiana. All athletic training settings must overcome their barriers to begin achieving reimbursement on a regular basis. This study should be replicated using a larger sample size, and in all 50 states. ATC employers and insurance companies also need to be studied to ensure that they understand the benefits third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of ATC can bring to their companies, as well as to determine why certain ATC claims are accepted and subsequently reimbursement granted while other claims are denied.

40|$|Objective: This paper {{presents}} {{the origins and}} development of the organized chiropractic orthopedics movement in the United States from 1954 – 1973. Methods: Hand searches of early periodicals were performed and information was organized chronologically to create a timeline. Context for the timeline was provided by extracting pertinent information from audio recordings of interviews. Relevant background information was located using the cumulative index of the journal Chiropractic History and searching the MANTIS database. Historical Features: After World War I, The advent of third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for health care created a new environment for health care practitioners. For doctors of chiropractic, this event provided the impetus to begin the postgraduate chiropractic orthopedics program over 50 years ago. In 1954, Alvin A. Hancock, DC and F.

The movement generated from the desire to train and certify chiropractors to manage personal injury and workers’ compensation low back injuries. In addition to developing interdisciplinary educational programs, the chiropractic orthopedics group was responsible for producing a research agenda, some of the profession’s early orthopedic-focused research, and for starting the National Council on Chiropractic Orthopedics of the National Chiropractic Association, which later becam...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been the {{philosophy}} in modern health care that the treatment rendered should be consistent with what is felt to be the best and most common practice or which yields the most productive outcome. The determination of what constitutes best practice or most productive outcome should be based upon efficacy research. Health care in various nations follows this theme generally, although many procedures are not standardized world wide {{for a variety of reasons}} such as cost or availability, governmental regulations, and whether or not there is socialized medicine, etc. In the United States, health care costs have skyrocketed in the last 20 years and health care has evolved into a very outcome oriented service. This is driven by 3 factors: cost containment, competition, and geographic variance in treatment (Epstein, 1990). Health care cost, quality assurance standards, third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement,</b> etc. have also contributed to a need for precision assessment and precision treatment. There is a companion need for universal or standardized assessment methods and standardized treatment.

40|$|AbstractWith {{the advent}} of Medicare {{prospective}} payment systems, health care entities and physicians were forced to decrease expenses by sharing services and to increase revenue by attempting to jointly negotiate better <b>reimbursement</b> from third- <b>party</b> payers. Both activities have raised the specter of prosecution under antitrust laws that have been with us {{for more than a}} century but are poorly understood by practicing physicians. Recent monopolistic activities in the health care arena have prompted the Federal Trade Commission to file actions under specific acts of Congress, eg, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Robinson-Patman Act, and Celler-Kefauver Act. Inasmuch as it is likely that specialties such as vascular surgery as a business will undergo substantial transformation, physicians need to be aware of the severe civil and criminal sanctions imposed if they are found guilty; fines that are several times actual damages; activities that raise antitrust issues including utilization review, medical staff privileges for competing specialties, participating provider agreements, and predatory pricing; and affirmative defenses and relief available in terms of specific exemptions. As health care providers react, innovate, and adjust to stay solvent, their business strategies will surely continue to be scrutinized for antitrust behavior by federal and state officials. The physician must have a basic understanding of the groundrules that govern any contemplated business strategy so that common pitfalls may be averted...|$|R

These management functions are then applied to various community pharmacy management issues such as third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement,</b> providing pharmacy care services, personnel management, reimbursement for cognitive services, inventory management and so on. The course utilizes didactic instruction with an interactive/discussion format in conjunction with case studies to teach the various management principles and applications. This combination of techniques {{with a focus on}} current issues facing community pharmacists has resulted in a more practical than theory based management course.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{attention}} for preconception care (PCC) has grown substantially in recent years, yet PCC {{is far from}} routine in daily practice. One of the major challenges {{for the implementation of}} PCC is to identify how it can best be organized and provided within the primary care setting. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify bottlenecks and solutions for the delivery of PCC from a healthcare providers' perspective in a local community setting in the Netherlands. METHODS: Health professionals within the region of Zeist, the Netherlands, were invited for a meeting on the local implementation of PCC. Five parallel group sessions were held with 30 participants from different disciplines. The sessions were moderated based on the Nominal Group Technique, in which bottlenecks (step 1) and solutions (step 2) for the delivery of PCC were gathered, categorized and prioritized by the participants. RESULTS: Participants expressed that the provision of PCC is challenging due to lack of awareness, the absence of a costing structure and unclear allocation of responsibilities. The most pragmatic approach considered was to make interdisciplinary arrangements within the local primary care setting. Participants recommended to 1) settle a costing structure by means of third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement,</b> 2) improve collaboration by means of a local cooperation network and an adequate referral system, 3) invest in education, tools and logistics and 4) increase uptake rates by the routine opportunistic offer of PCC and promotional campaigns.

In addition, there had been almost no attempts made to design a method to chart the changes taking place in the cost of drugs used {{in hospitals and}} other health care facilities. ^ This study surveyed selected hospitals in the United States to determine what information was available concerning drug cost, what method of control was used to determine if costs were changing and what methods of charting changes were recommended by the pharmacy administrators surveyed. The writer also developed and tested a group of indices that could be used by a health care facility to chart changes in the cost of drugs and to determine why these changes were taking place. ^ The study concluded that the pharmacy administrators surveyed had very little knowledge concerning the cost of hospital operations, the cost of drugs or the reasons that the cost of drugs change. A series of indices were used to describe and chart drug changes in a selected hospital showing that changes might be due to inflation, census, patient-mix or pharmacologic drug use. ^ The importance of this information was demonstrated for the budgeting process, third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> formulas and the development of drug utilization review programs.

40|$|The {{health care}} {{industry}} in the United States has been experiencing substantial and ever increasing cost pressures. At the same time, many forces are revolutionizing the way health care is financed and delivered. Telemedicine, in this respect, offers significant potential for addressing some of the challenges faced by the {{health care industry}}. However, {{despite the fact that}} Telemedicine technology has existed since the 1920 s, the use of Telemedicine has not been widespread. The use of the diffusion of innovation theory as an organizing framework, coupled with results of a survey of telemedicine professionals at the Global Telemedicine 2000 Conference in Chicago in 1996, identifies telemedicine’s potential as well as the barriers that are impeding its wide-spread application. In general, Telemedicine’s ability to provide greater and more extensive health-care at lower costs is being hampered by social constraints in society, including i) low compatibility with existing medical practices; ii), complexity of telemedicine equipment and interfaces; iii) absence of <b>reimbursement</b> by third <b>party</b> agencies; and incompatibility of state laws regarding Telemedicine and licensure issues. A case study of the USC-ABC Telemedicine project further to elucidates how attention to some of these factors can promote the success of any Telemedicine project. Two key lessons in this case are (i) The importance of the efforts and vision of a single individual and (ii) need for suppliers to be acquainted with the needs and demands of Telemedicine users.

40|$|Insulin lispro is a {{recombinant}} insulin analog with transposed {{amino acids}} (proline and lysine) at positions 28 and 29 near the C-terminus of the B-chain. The most prominent practical advantage of insulin lispro over human soluble insulin {{lies in its}} very rapid onset of action. This property allows it to be injected immediately before meals and minimizes the demands made on patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and those with type 2 disease who require insulin, by the ongoing need for careful meal planning and timing. Numerous clinical studies have shown significant improvements in postprandial glycemic control, with some evidence of reduced rates of severe or nocturnal hypoglycemia, relative to conventional human insulin in patients receiving lispro-based insulins. Quality-of-life studies show consistent preferences by patients for and increased treatment satisfaction with insulin lispro over human soluble insulin, particularly with variations of the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. Willingness of patients and taxpayers to pay additional costs for insulin lispro or a premixed lispro-based formulation over conventional human insulins, and cost benefits favoring formulary inclusion, have been shown in well designed studies carried out in Australia and Canada. Spanish data suggest cost effectiveness in terms of episodes of severe hypoglycemia avoided, and preliminary German resource utilization data indicate cost savings related to reduced hospitalization and general practice costs, with insulin lispro relative to human soluble insulin. Conclusions: Insulin lispro and premixed formulations of lispro-based insulins offer quality-of-life improvements relative to conventional human insulins in patients with diabetes mellitus. Participants in well designed studies have expressed a preference for lispro-based insulins and {{have been shown to}} be willing to pay for the advantages they offer, and current cost-benefit data favor the inclusion of these insulins in formularies and their <b>reimbursement</b> by third <b>party</b> payers.

Advocates of these programs have stressed their cost savings and intangible benefits to the {{patients and their families}} in terms of a more humane approach to assist dying patients. As a potential competitor in the health care delivery systems, the evaluation of these programs has been sparse and provide little empirical evidence to support their allegations that cost savings do occur. ^ The purposes of this retrospective study which examined deceased patient medical and billing records were to compare and contrast the costs of dying in two types of hospice programs with two types of hospitals. Patients were selected from an inpatient nursing home hospice, a home care hospice, a teaching hospital, and a municipal hospital. In the event that costs were billed directly to the deceased patient and were not available, proxies were used. To recognize the variations in costs incurred in caring for different types of cancer, the data were categorized into twelve cancer groups which reflected usual reporting of cancer statistics. Noting that per diem cost data might be offset by extended lengths of stays in any type of institution, costs per case were also computed. ^ It was hypothesized that, {{as a result of the}} less vigorous type of medical treatment and services rendered in hospice programs, hospice care would be less costly than hospital care. Categorizing the data for each type of cancer within each institution, the findings provided support for the premise that hospices were a less costly method of providing care to the terminally ill. Regardless of which type of hospice program, inpatient nursing home or home care, the empirical evidence, both per diem cost and cost per case analyses, support the premise of lower costs in hospice programs with a high degree of statistical significance.

The athletic training education competencies delineate five competencies and one clinical integration proficiency specific to documentation knowledge, skills, and abilities. There is little research regarding athletic training students� preparation in performing patient documentation and suggestion that recent graduates and employers have identified the domain of healthcare administration as a perceived deficit in professional preparation. A descriptive study was undertaken to ascertain students� reports of their preparation in healthcare documentation in didactic, laboratory, and clinical education. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the ways in which final-year athletic training students report having received instruction, having rehearsed, and having been assessed on the documentation-related competencies in athletic training. An electronic survey was sent to final-year athletic training students across the United States currently enrolled in professional programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). A 16. 9 % response rate was obtained via 185 survey participants. These participants were from all ten districts of the National Athletic Trainers’ Association. Findings suggest that final-year students report appropriate levels of instruction, rehearsal, and assessment of their knowledge and skills in medical terminology and the security, privacy, and confidentiality of medical records, but that foundational knowledge in the use of procedural and diagnostic coding and performance of third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> activities may be lacking. Only 7 % of final-year students reported having used their documentation to communicate with insurers and bill for services. Additionally, students enrolled in professional programs at the post-baccalaureate degree level reported the inclusion of academic electronic health records in didactic coursework at statistically significant greater level than their baccalaureate degree peers. Athletic training educators should consider the timing and placement of documentation-related competencies in program curricula in order to allow for adequate instruction, rehearsal reinforced through clinical education experiences, and appropriate assessment of documentation knowledge, skills, and abilities prior to graduation. The future of the athletic training profession is dependent upon a workforce that excels in documentation in order to support outcomes-based clinical research and successfully obtain payment for services rendered...|$|R
40|$|Health care is what economists call a 2 ̆ 2 {{superior}} good, 2 ̆ 2 {{one that}} claims an increasing {{part of the}} consumer 2 ̆ 7 s dollar as his or her income rises. Economic growth, therefore, will tend to boost the share of national income devoted to health care. According to actuarial projections, the cost of hospital insurance under Medicare, 2. 97 percent {{of the social security}} wage base in 1982, will more than double by 2005 to 6. 29 percent, and nearly quadruple by 2035, to over 11 percent. It is obvious that hospitals will come under increasing cost pressures as our population base ages and the remaining work force begins paying more for the medical care of this aging population. ^ If United States citizens could be confident that the expected incremental benefit of all medical care they buy exceeds the incremental cost of those services, the growth in medical expenditures, like similar past increases in spending on automobiles, televisions and computers, would be a measure of the superior capacity of new commodities to satisfy consumer wants. But, the system of third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> precludes such rosey interpretations. Because care is essentially free when demanded, incentives encourage the provision of all care that produces positive benefits whatever the costs. ^ Because of this continuing unacceptable growth in health care expenditures, the government, business, unions and, to some extent, the general public, have voiced an opinion that HMO 2 ̆ 7 s may be an alternative form of health care delivery that provides an acceptable level of medical care at a much reduced cost. ^ The problem in the United States, as well as in all developed nations, is how to alter the behavior of providers of health care and patients so that expenditures are curtailed on care that, in some sense, is worth less than it costs and yet, not destroy the moral fabric of society. To many, HMO 2 ̆ 7 s appear to offer a vehicle whereby expenditures can be curtailed while a reasonable level of care can be maintained. ^ The impact HMO 2 ̆ 7 s have made on the health care delivery system cannot be measured in absolute numbers of HMO 2 ̆ 7 s in operation today. The real impact HMO 2 ̆ 7 s have made is to change the way health care providers, insurers and the public, view the health care delivery system and evaluate alternate forms of care delivery. ...|$|R

This study was supported by the University of New Mexico Graduate College through a General Grant Award to the first author...|$|R
40|$|Generic {{medicines}} {{are approved}} by regulatory authorities based on demonstration of bioequivalence with the innovator, however, current regulatory systems {{do not require}} direct comparison between all available generics of the same innovator to ensure interchangeability. As such, interchangeability between generics of the same drug isassumed, although {{it has not been}} addressed comprehensively by regulators. Thus, this thesis addresses three main interlinked issues with respect to interchangeability of generic medicines particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in a global context. First, this thesis shows that adjusted indirect treatment comparison is a pragmatic approach to identify interchangeable generic products by comparing the different generics that have been demonstrated to be bioequivalent with the same comparator product. Further, in contrast to the ± 20 % acceptance range used for direct comparisons, a ± 30 % acceptance range is proposed for adjusted indirect comparisons, due to the limited precision of indirect comparisons. The outcome of the indirect comparisons indicates that the antimalarial artemether/lumefantrine, first-line antituberculosis, and first-line antiretroviral generics prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) can be interchanged without any safety and efficacy concerns in the clinical settings. To ensure switchability between the generics, the generic and the comparator should not differ significantly (i. e. point estimates should not exceed the 7 % difference) and the original studies should be sufficiently powered (i. e. > 80 %). In this respect an additional point estimate constraint of ± 10 % is proposed, particularly for LMICs where the regulators may not provide guidance to health professionals on the switchability of approved products or when generic substitution is recommended by national governments or the third <b>party</b> <b>reimbursement</b> agencies. A lower point estimate constraint of ± 5 %, is proposed for NTI drugs, especially where neither generic switching of these drugs is restricted nor narrowed bioequivalence acceptance limits applied. Second, this thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} have the necessary arrangements for product registration for generic medicines that will ensure that nationally approved products are of sufficient quality and interchangeable, and to adopt resource-efficient approaches without duplications in LMICs. The collaborative case model in the context of global harmonisation efforts, not only in LMICs, but also in high-income countries demonstrates that collaboration in assessments is feasible and probably the most pragmatic approach that countries in LMICs should use to build capacity and to ensure quality and interchangeable medicines in the market. Third, this thesis shows that most countries follow the WHO recommendations for selecting comparator products and require the comparator product to be obtained from their national markets. These recommendations are only feasible in the few countries where the repetition of the bioequivalence study is profitable, but they are impracticable in all other countries, especially LMICs. Therefore, this thesis proposes that the innovator product from well-regulated markets should be the global comparator as it is ineffectual to harmonize only the requirements for performing bioequivalence studies, if such a study has to be repeated for every single country simply because of the different comparator product...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that one in four Americans lives within 3 miles of a contaminated site, many of which pose serious risks to {{human health and the}} environment. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) provided the federal government with authority to respond to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances and created a trust fund to provide for certain cleanup activities. Under CERCLA, EPA established the Superfund program to address the threats that contaminated sites pose. Although EPA has paid for the cleanup of many of these sites through the Superfund program, funding for these cleanups has diminished in recent years. In 2010, we reported that EPA's estimated costs to clean up existing contaminated sites exceed the Superfund program's current funding levels and that some sites have not received sufficient funding for cleanup to proceed in the most cost-efficient manner. Additionally, in July 2009, we reported that EPA does not collect sufficient information on the cost of cleanup activities at Superfund sites and recommended, among other things, that EPA assess and improve the data it collects on the status and cost of cleanups. EPA coordinates the cleanup of Superfund sites by identifying sites potentially requiring cleanup action and placing eligible sites on its National Priorities List (NPL). EPA may compel the parties responsible for contaminating these sites to clean them up, or the agency may, using resources from the trust fund established by CERCLA, conduct cleanups itself and seek <b>reimbursement</b> from responsible <b>parties.</b> In some cases, EPA {{may not be able to}} obtain reimbursement because the agency cannot identify a responsible party or the responsible party or parties may be insolvent or may no longer exist. One category of contaminated sites [...] landfills and other waste disposal facilities [...] made up more than one-third of the 1, 397 sites EPA placed on the NPL from 1983 through 2007, and EPA's expenditures at these 511 sites totaled about $ 3. 6 billion through fiscal year 2007. According to EPA, landfill sites on the NPL generally share similar characteristics and present similar threats to the environment. For example, these sites generally exhibit contamination in various media, such as soil, surface water, or groundwater, and many landfills at Superfund sites contain hazardous waste that may contaminate nearby soil or water. Further, some have argued that landfills used for the disposal of debris created by disasters may also contain hazardous waste that could have long-term, negative environmental impacts. Consequently, concerns have been raised by various studies and environmental groups about the potential for such landfills to become Superfund sites. For instance, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a Louisiana emergency order authorized some potentially hazardous materials to be disposed of in landfills permitted to receive construction and demolition debris rather than in landfills with liners approved for such waste. Studies by a Louisiana State University research institute and an environmental engineering firm found that these categories of waste can introduce hazardous materials into landfills, increasing the likelihood of pollution. In this context, Congress asked us to review issues related to the cost to clean up the Agriculture Street Landfill Superfund site, which received debris from Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and other Superfund sites involving landfills in the Gulf Coast region where cleanup has been completed. Our objectives were to determine (1) what is known about the nature and costs of the cleanup activities at Superfund landfill sites and (2) the costs to clean up the Agriculture Street Landfill site and two additional selected Superfund landfill sites in the Gulf Coast region, and the key factors that influenced these costs. ...|$|R
