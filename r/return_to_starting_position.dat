25|$|One {{interesting}} {{exception was}} a horizontal seven inch turntable. Although made in 1886, {{the machine was}} a duplicate of one made earlier but taken to Europe by Chichester Bell. Tainter was granted Patent No. 385886 for it on July 10, 1888. The playing arm is rigid except for a pivoted vertical motion of 90 degrees to allow removal of the record or a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> While recording or playing, the record not only rotated but moved laterally under the stylus which thus described a spiral, recording 150 grooves to the inch.|$|E

50|$|Standing on a {{platform}} with an edge where the heels can hang (e.g. a curb), lift the body {{on the balls of}} the feet. The subject then slowly <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> This trains the gastrocnemius and to a lesser degree the soleus. A seated calf-raise trains the soleus.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic rescue {{tools are}} {{powered by a}} {{hydraulic}} pump, which can be hand-, foot-, or engine-powered, or even built into the tool. These tools may be either single-acting, where hydraulic pressure will only move the cylinder in one direction, and the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> is accomplished using a pressure-relief valve and spring setup, or dual-acting, in which hydraulic pressure is used to both open and close the hydraulic cylinder. Recently, manufacturers of these rescue tools have begun offering options for electrically-powered versions as well using simple electric rotation motors or screw pistons rather than the aforementioned setup, promising greater reliability, lower cost of ownership, lower weight and better handling, greater portability, quicker and more direct operation, and greater potential power.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine how}} a cued change in motor plan {{influences}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with freezing of gait (FOG) (PD FOG; n= 10), {{compared with those}} without FOG (PD non-FOG; n= 10) and healthy controls (n= 10). Methods: Participants walked through a doorway in three experimental conditions: no cue; cue before gait initiation; and cue after gait initiation. The light cue {{was presented at the}} end of the pathway and signified that individuals must walk to the cue, turn around and <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> Results: Step-to-step variability (a known precursor to FOG) revealed a significant main effect of group (F 2, 27 = 32. 83, p 3 ̆c 0. 001), where PD FOG walked with greater step length variability than PD non-FOG and the control group. A significant interaction (F 4, 54 = 3. 035, p= 0. 025) demonstrated that only the PD FOG group was most variable when the cue was present before gait initiation. Conclusion: This study concludes that motor planning deficits affect gait, specifically in individuals who experience FOG. This may have important implications for the design of therapeutic interventions in PD FOG...|$|E
50|$|The Half Dive Bomber variant simply {{stops the}} {{movement}} {{at the point}} the chest is between the hands and then reverses the movement <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> The Hindu dand variant <b>returns</b> directly <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> without bending the arms or arcing the chest and shoulders back through the hands.|$|R
50|$|Solar Panel Rig: Using the {{generator}} {{obtained from the}} traders in Episode 4, Mike, Joey and others set out to build a rig for the solar panels they obtained {{from the roof of}} a nearby building and along the railroad. John C. works to build a device that incorporates two photodiodes and a small motor into a solar tracking device, allowing the solar panels to follow the sun during the day, and <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>positions</b> at night.|$|R
50|$|An {{overhead}} bar (sometimes {{called a}} chin-up bar) is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin {{level with the}} bar, and keeping the back straight throughout. The bar remains {{in front of the}} subject at all times. The subject then slowly <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> in a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the lats or upper back muscles, as well as the forearms. An underhand grip variation or chin-up trains both the back and biceps.|$|R

50|$|The {{individual}} {{starts with}} both feet {{on the edge of}} a raised surface, with the toes on the surface and the heels lower than the toes. The heels are raised as high as possible, then <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{momentum}} conservation law {{is applied}} to analyse the dynamics of pulsejet engine in vertical motion in a uniform gravitational field {{in the absence of}} friction. The model predicts existence of a terminal speed given frequency of the short pulses. The conditions that the engine does not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> are identified. The number of short periodic pulses after which the engine <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> the <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> is found <b>to</b> be independent of the exhaust velocity and gravitational field intensity for certain frequency of the pulses. The pulsejet engine and turbojet engine aircraft models of dynamics are compared. Also the octopus dynamics is modelled. The paper is addressed to intermediate undergraduate students of classical mechanics and aerospace engineering. Comment: 14 page...|$|R

40|$|In chess, {{the bishop}} is unique {{as it is}} locked to a single color on {{the black and white}} board. This makes a closed tour in which the bishop visits every square on the board exactly once and <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> its <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> impossible. When can two bishops, one black and one white, legally visit every square (of their {{respective}} colors) exactly once and <b>return</b> <b>to</b> their <b>starting</b> <b>positions?</b> Such a tour will be called a closed monochromatic bishops tour. In this paper necessary and su ¢ cient conditions for the existence of a monochromatic bishops tour for the rectangularmn board are proven.
