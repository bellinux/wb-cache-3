40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from April 1, 2016 - April 1, 2018 Entomopathogenic fungi are cosmopolitan microbial pathogens that cause fungous diseases {{in a wide range}} of insects via spore infection. Due to their natural enemy status, they have tremendous potential for use as microbial control agents against insect pests, especially subterranean pests for which few management options are available. The clover <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> (Hylastinus obscurus Marsham) develops belowground, attacks the roots of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and causes a drastic reduction in seed yield. Hylastinus obscurus was controlled with organochlorine pesticides but their use was prohibited due to hazardous effects on the environment, and non-target organisms including humans. Subsequently, no alternative pest management strategy was developed for this pest. Meanwhile, little is known about impacts of entomopathogenic fungi on clover <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> The current study was conducted to isolate naturally occuring entomopathogenic fungi and assess their pathogenicity against the clover <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> More than 150 isolates were collected from infected clover <b>root</b> <b>borers</b> and <b>root</b> zone soil samples from five red clover seed production fields in western Oregon. Based on morphologic characters and phylogenetic analyses using ITS sequence data, these belonged to six species - Beauveria bassiana, B. pseudobassiana, Metarhizium brunneum, Isaria fumosorosea, I. farinosa and Lecanicillium muscarium. A laboratory experiment showed that two species of field isolated fungi - B. bassiana and I. fumosorosea were as effective in killing clover <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> adults as commercial sources of M. brunneum and I. fumosorosea when exposed to these fungi in petri dishes with sterile white sand. Subsequently, H. obscurus adults were exposed to four spore concentrations of B. bassiana and M. brunneum separately in cups filled with field collected unsterilized and sterilized soil. There were no significant mortality differences on either sterilized and unsterilized soil. However, at the highest concentration, more than 80 % of clover <b>root</b> <b>borers</b> died with M. brunneum while with B. bassiana, the mortality was not significantly different due to high mortality in the negative control. Based on the study, at least six species of entomopathogenic fungi occur naturally in red clover seed production fields in western Oregon, and field isolated fungi are as virulent as commercial fungi against the clover <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> Further research is needed for evaluation of the pathogenicity of these entomopathogenic fungi under field conditions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} Cosmopolites sordidus (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae) infestation among different banana genotypes {{in a commercial}} banana orchard {{over the course of}} 30 months. Banana <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> infestation was compared in 20 banana genotypes, including five varieties and 15 hybrids. Overall, we observed that 94. 17 % of pest infestation cases occurred in the cortex region, and only 5. 83 % occurred in the central cylinder. Genotypes least sensitive to infestation were the Prata Anã (AAB) and Pacovan (AAB) varieties, where no damage was recorded. Among the hybrid genotypes, PV 9401 and BRS Fhia 18 showed intermediate levels of sensitivity, while BRS Tropical hybrids (AAAB), PA 9401 (AAAB), BRS Vitoria (AAAB), YB 4203 (AAAB), and Bucaneiro (AAAA) were the most sensitive to attack by banana <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> This study demonstrated that the infestation of the banana <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> varies according banana plant genotype, and the utilization of less susceptible genotypes could reduce infestation rates of C. sordidus...|$|R

40|$|Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is a {{valuable}} forage legume grown alone or in mixture with grasses in temperate regions of the world. Red clover is adapted {{to a wide range}} of soil types, pH levels, environmental and management conditions. However, the main limitation of this species is the lack of persistence related to the high mortality of plants. In Chile the main biotic factor affecting survival of plants is the <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> Hylastinus obscurus (Marsham) (Coleóptera; Scolytidae). In 1989, a red clover (T. pratense L.) breeding program was started at Carillanca Research Center of the Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA), Chile, with the main objectives of improving the survival of plants, forage yield and persistence. In 2002 a research line to study the interaction between the <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> and the plant was started. This paper describes briefly the improvement obtained in survival of young plants after twenty years of breeding and the importance of <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> population regarding forage yield. Experiments were conducted at Carillanca Research Center under irrigated conditions, comparing under cutting the dry matter yield of new synthetic lines and Redqueli-INIA with Quinequeli-INIA. The experimental lines Syn Int IV, Syn Pre III, Syn Int V and Syn Int VI were more productive than the cultivars Redqueli-INIA and Quiñequeli-INIA at the second season. The evaluation of the biological parameter allowed identifying a tolerant line, Syn Pre I, and three potential new varieties: Syn Pre III, Syn Int V and Syn Int VI. This is the first report showing an inverse relation between dry matter yield of red clover and <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> population (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the ability of two agricultural system models, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and the Coupled Model (CoupModel), to simulate temporal nitrate mass loading below the root zone. To tackle this evaluation effort the following research objectives were developed: (1) determine the sensitivity of key model output responses for a selected agricultural system model to the variability of input parameters over different vertical-spatial and temporal domains; (2) compare and elucidate the ability of two agricultural system models to simulate water flux and nitrate loading at the plot scale; (3) explore the capability of an agricultural system model that is fully calibrated at one location to simulate the water flux and nitrate loading at another location with similar soil and cropping characteristics; and (4) use a calibrated and validated agricultural system model to predict groundwater recharge and nitrate loading resulting from the implementation of a best management practice (BMP) established on a parcel of land where groundwater impacts due to nitrogen application have been observed. Two study sites where elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater have been observed were used in {{this research}}. The primary study site was the shallow unconfined Abbotsford Aquifer, located in Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, where elevated groundwater nitrate concentration is attributed to excess nitrogen inputs compared with the nitrogen demand of the red raspberry crop. The secondary study site was the Thornton Well Field in southwestern Ontario where a legacy of agricultural activities in the area has resulted in an increased groundwater nitrate concentration. In summary, global sensitivity analysis not only identified the most influential parameters of the model that required calibration but also provided a useful guide to define the timing and vertical-location of the observation data that is most effective to use as the calibration target, and design appropriate experiments for collecting such data. Both selected models, RZWQM and CoupModel, were reliable for prediction of nitrate loading time series below the <b>raspberry</b> <b>root</b> zone; however, the CoupModel performed better than the RZWQM due to its flexibility for modifying growth parameters when perennial crops are simulated. The calibrated CoupModel was applicable for simulating nitrate flux below the <b>raspberry</b> <b>root</b> zone in a nearby farm within the Abbotsford region except for the years when organic fertilizer was applied. While the results of this transportability effort are promising, additional validation at similar fields under different management practices is encouraged. Also, development of models that capture the effects of raspberry inter-rows cropping system on nitrate and water flux below the <b>raspberry</b> <b>root</b> zone is essential. At the Thornton Well Field, the BMPs were effective in reducing nitrate load into the groundwater; however, various time frames are needed to observe significant response to the BMPs at different farmlands. 1 yea...|$|R
