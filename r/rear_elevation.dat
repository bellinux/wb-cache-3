5|$|Placed symmetrically in {{the north}} and south sides of the church are two nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows. Between the two windows on the church's north {{elevation}} is an exterior concrete block chimney. The layout of the east-facing <b>rear</b> <b>elevation</b> of the church is also symmetrical, and features three nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, with the center window placed above and between the other two windows. The church's windows have been repaired using materials consistent with original construction.|$|E
25|$|The south or <b>rear</b> <b>elevation</b> was {{undoubtedly}} taken directly from Plate LVIII of James Gibbs' Book of Architecture {{and the north}} elevation was less directly derived from a plate of Haddo House in Scotland, shown in William Adam's Vitruvius Scoticus.|$|E
25|$|The {{house itself}} is a two-and-half-story five-by-four-bay {{building}} sided in stucco over rubble stone, with two frame wings on the north and south. The latter was originally sanded {{to give it a}} stonier appearance. A veranda is on the west (<b>rear)</b> <b>elevation.</b> The metallic hipped roof is pierced by two pairs of brick chimneys on the sides.|$|E

50|$|The house's {{distinguishing}} feature is a poured-in-place concrete roof with three arched vaults. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>elevations</b> {{of the house}} are all glass, resulting in a largely transparent house. The side walls are pale red brick.|$|R
25|$|Three decades later, Migel's son Richard {{had grown}} and married. The two wings {{were added to}} the house to {{accommodate}} them in the late 1940s, and a shed-roof on the <b>rear</b> <b>elevation,</b> the only significant changes made during its existence. Original wrought iron hardware, which the Migels intended to retain, was accidentally melted down as scrap during this process.|$|E
25|$|A {{driveway}} {{from the}} intersection provides parking {{between the house}} and a former barn to the south, now used as a garage. The house itself is a one-and-a-half-story, five-by-three-bay wood frame structure on a fieldstone foundation. It is sided in clapboard on all but the north (<b>rear)</b> <b>elevation</b> and topped with a gambrel roof shingled in wood. Brick chimneys pierce it at either end.|$|E
25|$|At {{the bend}} in Willowbrook, the {{driveway}} continues straight, curving around slightly downhill behind some large mature deciduous shade trees. The house is to its west, {{built into the}} gentle slope. The basement is thus exposed on the west (<b>rear)</b> <b>elevation.</b> On the southwest a small garden has been added by the current owners; it is considered a non-contributing resource to the National Register listing.|$|E
5000|$|The Stephens Lane and <b>rear</b> <b>elevations</b> {{reflect the}} {{subsidiary}} and functional {{nature of the}} lane frontage and [...] "back of house" [...] conditions. A lightly rusticated porphyry base supports painted brick walls with many square headed windows. The <b>rear</b> <b>elevations</b> of the two wings are face brick but of discernibly different bricks on either wing. The Stephens Lane wing has dark brown face brick laid in English bond with segmental arches of red brick over the windows. The windows are two paned casement windows and the sills are either painted stone or rendered. The ground level is an arcade of arched openings forming a covered walkway with a glazed wall forming the enclosure to the interior offices.|$|R
50|$|North Parade {{was part}} of a wider scheme to build a Royal Forum, {{including}} South Parade, Pierrepont and Duke Streets, similar to Queen Square, which was never completed. Wood designed the facade, of Bath Stone, after which a variety of builders completed the work with different interiors and <b>rear</b> <b>elevations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Often, the <b>rear</b> <b>elevations</b> of {{buildings}} are less visible and therefore less ornamented, {{but because the}} rear of the Federal Office Building faces Western Avenue, an important thoroughfare, all elevations are extensively detailed. The building's cornerstone and two plaques commemorating the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 are located near where the fire began.|$|R
25|$|On either {{flank of}} the entrance, the first floor {{features}} French windows and iron balconies, except for the smaller windows next to the door, trimmed with marble lintels and sills. A similar pattern is found on the larger windows of the third story. Above them is a dentilled cornice and architrave; two large chimneys rise from the hipped roof. The <b>rear</b> <b>elevation</b> features two porches with Doric columns.|$|E
25|$|Two more {{doors are}} located on the west (<b>rear)</b> <b>elevation.</b> One leads to the basement; {{the other to the}} first floor, with a flight of wooden stairs. All the other bays have windows, either six-over-six double-hung sash windows similar to those {{elsewhere}} on the house or six-light casements. A large seam visible in the stoneworks next to the first-story entrance delineates the original section of the house from that added later on.|$|E
25|$|Building 1, the Former Hospital Administration Building, is the {{principal}} structure in Mann's Bastion. It is a two-story, rectangular, symmetrical stone structure with a hipped-roof pierced by two brick chimneys. The west-facing facade features restrained decorative detailing of pilasters supporting a flat cornice {{along the length of}} the five-bay façade. Loopholes are visible on the second floor on both sides of the building. The <b>rear</b> <b>elevation</b> facing into the bastion is functional and plain in appearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of side and <b>rear</b> <b>elevations</b> is more modest, but with fine detailing. The walls are unrendered brickwork with rectangular openings to ground and first floors, and the verandahs have paired timber posts with timber valances and capitals, boarded timber sunscreens, and cast iron balustrades. The side verandahs are partially enclosed.|$|R
50|$|Susan J. Armistead Moore House, {{also known}} as Poplar Neck and Jubilee Farm, is a {{historic}} home located near Edenton, Chowan County, North Carolina. It was built about 1853, and is a 2 1/2-story, three bay, double-pile Greek Revival-style frame dwelling. It features engaged, tiered porches across both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>elevations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Caledonia Place was {{completed}} in 1843 by architects T Foster and W Okely, The area has Grade II listed buildings and has mid Georgian style. Each three storey house has an attic and basement and has <b>rear</b> <b>elevations</b> differentiated by fine cast-iron Grecian balconies. In 1852, Lord Macaulay once lived at number 16 Caledonia Place.|$|R
25|$|The solid {{brick wall}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>elevation</b> is pierced by a high window {{in the form of}} a narrow cross. It has two layers of glazing, {{consisting}} of an inner layer of coloured glass segments and an outer layer of clear glass. Glazed doors provide access to the vestries. Adjacent to the western vestry door is a toilet block built up against the rear wall (this structure is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance).|$|E
500|$|The {{west and}} east sides match each other. Most houses have two storeys, but some rise to three; {{all have a}} {{basement}} and a three-window range with sash windows. [...] The entrances are in the <b>rear</b> <b>elevation</b> and are paired under single doorcases with cornices, architraves and fanlights. [...] The windows are topped by similar architraves. At the front, facing the garden, the hipped roofs of the main sections have prominent eaves, and the roofs of the tower sections have similar treatment. Number 1, at the southwest corner, has ground-floor rustication carried round on to its south-facing wall, and its windows are different. Similarly, number 48—the end house at the southeast corner—has a hipped-roofed south-facing wing with a hipped roof, in which the entrance {{is set in a}} doorcase flanked by antae. [...] The corner of the house is chamfered and has a blank two-window range. Several houses in {{the east side of the}} crescent have dormer windows in their attic space.|$|E
500|$|On the church's northeastern {{elevation}} {{there are}} three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry anchor plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (<b>rear)</b> <b>elevation</b> has an exposed coursed-stone foundation [...] high, due to its location on sloping ground. At {{the center of this}} elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|E

50|$|The two {{wings are}} similar to the main block in materials, {{decoration}} and fenestration. Their <b>rear</b> <b>elevations,</b> now facing onto the courtyard, have paired and single two-over-two windows shorter at the basement. An engaged elevator tower rises from the north wing's rear at the northwest corner of the courtyard. It is constructed of masonry block painted to match the brick.|$|R
50|$|The -story, {{common bond}} brick {{building}} has a metal-covered gable roof, {{with a number}} of skylights. There are stepped parapets on the front and <b>rear</b> <b>elevations.</b> The front windows are six-over-six with concrete lintels and sills. There are eight arched loading bays on the side elevations. Arched drive-throughs are located on the front and rear. The front drive-through was enlarged.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} porches, both originally {{referred to}} as piazzas, featured multiple arched wooden bays separated and supported by miniature Corinthian columns on pedestals. [...] The front piazza {{was replaced by a}} far simpler structure after 1912, the rear one was taken down in the 1940s and was never rebuilt. [...] Some of the components were stored at that time and have survived, with reconstruction contemplated by the current owners. The rear piazza originally connected to the detached kitchen by means of an elevated covered walkway, of a slightly simpler design than the piazzas. [...] The main entrance doors are set into a Serliana brownstone arch. [...] The doors are set under an arched glass fanlight with the sidelights placed in straight-topped transoms to either side. The front of the house also has a [...] "family" [...] entrance {{to the left of the}} tower, entered through a small arched loggia.

2500|$|The house {{consists}} of a central stuccoed block of three floors with a basement divided into five bays, with a flanking pavilion of two stories in four bays, to either side connected by low flanking quadrant walls. In {{the centre of the}} front is a large classical pedimented portico fronted by four [...] Ionic columns. The flanking walls screen the service wings behind. The <b>rear</b> <b>elevation</b> [...] has on either side full-height semi-circular bays. The interior contains much Adam style decorative plasterwork, apparently the work of a certain Mr Powell [...] referred to in the invoice from the builder Bellman, and ornamental fittings. Robert Adam did much work for the Parkers at Saltram House near Plymouth between 1768–72 and 1779–82. The Poles are likely to have been guests at their neighbours at this time, but in any case as they also spent much time in London at their house in Bedford Square, they would have been familiar with Adam's work in London and elsewhere. The north-east pavilion contains a [...] theatre of circa 1900. The top floor housed the servants' quarters. The kitchens were originally situated in the left hand pavilion, later converted into a theatre. A large Palladian style stables block is situated around a semi-circular courtyard, several [...] hundred yards from the house, now converted into several separate residences. It had stabling for twelve horses and accommodation for grooms.|$|E
