5|$|<b>Recreational</b> diver {{training}} and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by {{government in a}} subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes <b>recreational</b> diver {{training and}} dive leading for reward; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though non-specific health and safety legislation still applies. In Israel <b>recreational</b> diving activities are regulated by the <b>Recreational</b> Diving Act, 1979.|$|E
5|$|Commercial and <b>recreational</b> traps {{must not}} be {{interfered}} with.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina is {{separated}} into three distinct campuses: Main Campus, Health Sciences Campus, and West Research Campus. It owns two sports complexes: Blount <b>Recreational</b> Sports Complex and North <b>Recreational</b> Complex. It owns a field station in New Holland, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In {{its upper}} reaches, most of Scotch Run is closed to public access. For this reason, a 1997 report stated that {{this section of}} the stream offered poor <b>recreational</b> opportunities. However, the report stated that the stream {{provided}} good <b>recreational</b> opportunities in its lower reaches. According to the report, both sections of the stream are poor sites for angling.|$|E
5|$|On 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed. <b>Recreational</b> divers first visited the site in 1953. In 1960 a <b>recreational</b> diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island. At least two <b>recreational</b> divers have died from exploring the wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Paved and unpaved {{trails and}} paths {{are used for}} <b>recreational</b> and {{commuter}} purposes throughout the city. Popular among bicyclists, runners, hikers and <b>recreational</b> walkers, these trails are included in comprehensive plans {{for the city of}} Omaha, the Omaha metro area, Douglas County, and long-distance coordinated plans between the municipalities of southeast Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|Rivers {{introduced}} legislation {{to increase taxes}} on medical marijuana. Washington {{is one of only}} a few states that has legalized marijuana for both medical and <b>recreational</b> use. <b>Recreational</b> marijuana has a 25% tax for consumers. However, medical marijuana does not have any taxes. Rivers' legislation would also force medical marijuana clinics to obtain more permits and waivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} tables for {{professional}} diving use is generally {{made by the}} organization employing the divers. For <b>recreational</b> training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for <b>recreational</b> purposes the diver is generally free {{to make use of}} any of the published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|The common {{term for}} a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, {{professional}} diving is done where the work needs to be done, and <b>recreational</b> diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised <b>recreational</b> dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and <b>recreational</b> divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{responsibility}} for <b>recreational</b> diving service providers is usually limited {{as far as}} possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of <b>recreational</b> buddy divers is unclear and {{has been the subject of}} considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by <b>recreational</b> diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.|$|E
5|$|There are two lakeside {{restaurants}} and various <b>recreational</b> facilities {{on the lake}} shore.|$|E
5|$|X-Men Cartoon Maker, a <b>recreational</b> {{animation}} {{software package}} released in 1996 for home computers.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in <b>recreational</b> diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the Moose {{organization}} conducts numerous {{sports and}} <b>recreational</b> programs, in local Lodge/Chapter facilities called either Moose Family Centers or Activity Centers, {{in the majority}} of 44 State and Provincial Associations, and on a fraternity-wide basis.|$|E
5|$|An M24x2 {{male thread}} {{cylinder}} valve was supplied with some Dräger semi-closed circuit <b>recreational</b> rebreathers (Dräger Ray) {{for use with}} nitrox mixtures. The regulator supplied with the rebreather had a compatible connection.|$|E
5|$|Another group, with no {{affiliation}} {{but with}} the same name, {{was created in the}} early 1970s to promote the maintenance of <b>recreational</b> trails in the Ozarks.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and <b>recreational</b> overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. <b>Recreational</b> overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large <b>recreational</b> doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. <b>Recreational</b> doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E
5|$|BZP is not {{controlled}} under any UN convention, so the compounds themselves are legal {{throughout most of}} the world, although in most countries their use is restricted to pharmaceutical manufacturing and <b>recreational</b> use is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980 eruption, Spirit Lake offered year-round <b>recreational</b> activities. In {{the summer}} there was boating, swimming, and camping, {{while in the}} winter there was skiing.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a compact}} {{residential}} area, Lam Tin has various facilities to satisfy its residents' daily needs. These include shopping malls, <b>recreational</b> facilities, water and other supplies. Furthermore, during the 1970s and 1980s, Lam Tin hosted landfills.|$|E
5|$|Communities in the {{province}} of British Columbia, Canada can include incorporated municipalities, Indian reserves, unincorporated communities or localities. Unincorporated communities can be further classified as <b>recreational</b> or urban.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for <b>recreational</b> training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for <b>recreational</b> purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, <b>recreational</b> divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when <b>recreational</b> divers do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{derived from}} plants {{including}} opiates, cocaine and cannabis have both medical and <b>recreational</b> uses. Different countries have {{at various times}} made some uses of drugs illegal, partly {{on the basis of}} the risks involved in taking psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s the US <b>recreational</b> diving {{community}} {{tended to}} move away from the US Navy tables to a range of tables published by other organisations, including several of the diver certification agencies (BSAC, NAUI, PADI).|$|E
5|$|Foodland leased the city's Collins Hall <b>recreational</b> {{facility}} for conversion into a temporary grocery store, {{which opened in}} October 2012. Foodland's permanent new store opened at Pearson Plaza on April 1, 2016; the Collins Hall facility will now be converted back to <b>recreational</b> use, with several of the chain's structural improvements to the building — including upgrades to the lighting system and improvements to the building's accessibility {{for people with disabilities}} — remaining in place as a donation to the city.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has five}} front-country {{vehicular}} access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, {{and each has}} 350campsites which can accommodate large <b>recreational</b> vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for <b>recreational</b> vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} popular for <b>recreational</b> {{purposes}} {{since the late}} 1800s. Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular <b>recreational</b> areas near the lake in the early 1900s. Around this time period, there were four steamboats on Harveys Lake. They were used for carrying passengers and freight. <b>Recreational</b> steamboat rides on the lake were popular between 1900 and 1920. A 60-foot (18-meter) high Shoot the Chute {{was built in the}} area by Charles Shelley in 1910. It was one of the largest attractions in the lake's vicinity. A casino near the lake was opened by Frank Devlin in May 1924, but was demolished in 1980. Devlin also opened the largest bowling alley in northeast Pennsylvania near the lake. Throughout the 20th century, prior to and after World War II, the lake attracted thousands of visitors yearly.|$|E

5|$|Lewisville's {{consistently}} warm {{climate and}} proximity to Lewisville Lake {{have made it}} a <b>recreational</b> hub of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The city's municipal government, led by a nonpartisan city council, focuses its <b>recreational</b> and cultural investments on facilities such as Toyota of Lewisville Park and the MCL Grand Theater. The area's transportation infrastructure has evolved around the I-35 Corridor along Interstate 35E. The diversity of its population and industry has created a stable economic climate. Lewisville Independent School District provides most of the area's public education programs.|$|E
