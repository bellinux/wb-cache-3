40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{concepts of}} intermediate <b>rank</b> for countable groups that “interpolate ” between consecutive {{values of the}} classical (integer-valued) <b>rank.</b> Various classes of groups are proved to have intermediate <b>rank</b> behaviors. We are especially interested in interpolation between <b>rank</b> 1 and <b>rank</b> 2. For instance, we construct groups “of <b>rank</b> 7 ”. Our setting is essentially that of 4 non positively curved spaces, where concepts of intermediate <b>rank</b> include polynomial branching, local <b>rank,</b> and mesoscopic <b>rank.</b> The resulting framework has interesting connections to operator algebras. We prove property RD in many cases where intermediate <b>rank</b> occurs. This gives a new family of groups satisfying the Baum-Connes conjecture. We prove that the reduced C ∗-algebras of groups of <b>rank</b> 7 have stable <b>rank</b> 1. 4 The paper is organized along the following thematic lines.
