40|$|A 'material modeling' {{methodology}} for predicting the creep rupture behavior of unidirectional advanced composites is proposed. In this approach the parameters (obtained from short-term tests) {{required to make}} the predictions are the three principal creep compliance master curves and their corresponding quasi-static strengths tested at room temperature (22 C). Using these parameters {{in conjunction with a}} failure criterion, creep <b>rupture</b> <b>envelopes</b> can be generated for any combination of in-plane loading conditions and ambient temperature. The analysis was validated experimentally for one composite system, the T 300 / 934 graphite-epoxy system. This was done by performing short-term creep tests (to generate the principal creep compliance master curves with the time-temperature superposition principle) and relatively long-term creep rupture tensile tests of off-axis specimens at 180 C. Good to reasonable agreement between experimental and analytical results is observed...|$|R
50|$|The {{danger of}} sudden {{collapse}} is nearly negligible, because the structure will gradually deform or sag when {{subject to a}} heavy load or force (snow or wind). Only if these warning signs are ignored or not noticed, then the build-up of an extreme load may <b>rupture</b> the <b>envelope,</b> leading to a sudden deflation and collapse.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{extracellular}} form of {{vaccinia virus}} {{is referred to}} as an enveloped virion (EV) because it contains an additional lipoprotein membrane surrounding the infectious mature virion (MV) that must be discarded prior to cell fusion and entry. Most EVs adhere {{to the surface of the}} parent cell and mediate spread of the infection to adjacent cells. Here we show that some attached EVs have <b>ruptured</b> <b>envelopes.</b> <b>Rupture</b> was detected by fluorescence microscopy of unfixed and unpermeabilized cells using antibodies to the F 13 and L 1 proteins, which line the inner side of the EV membrane and the outer side of the MV membrane, respectively. The presence of ruptured EV membranes was confirmed by immunogold transmission electron microscopy. EVs with broken membranes were present on several cell lines examined including one deficient in glycosaminoglycans, which are thought to play a role in breakage of the EV membrane prior to fusion of the MV. No correlation was found between EVs with ruptured membranes and actin tail formation. Studies with several mutant viruses indicated that EV membranes lacking the A 34 protein were unbroken. This result was consistent with other properties of A 34 R deletion mutants including resistance of the EV membrane to polyanions, small plaque formation and low infectivity that can be increased by disruption of the EV membrane by freezing and thawing...|$|R
50|$|At night, the gas in a zero-pressure balloon cools and contracts, {{causing the}} balloon to sink. A zero-pressure balloon can only {{maintain}} altitude by releasing gas {{when it goes}} too high, where the expanding gas can threaten to <b>rupture</b> the <b>envelope,</b> or releasing ballast when it sinks too low. Loss of gas and ballast limits the endurance of zero-pressure balloons to a few days.|$|R
40|$|Altered nuclear {{shape is}} a {{defining}} feature of cancer cells. The mechanisms underlying nuclear dysmorphia in cancer remain poorly understood. Here we identify PPP 1 R 12 A and PPP 1 CB, two subunits of the myosin phosphatase complex that antagonizes actomyosin contractility, as proteins safeguarding nuclear integrity. Loss of PPP 1 R 12 A or PPP 1 CB causes nuclear fragmentation, nuclear <b>envelope</b> <b>rupture,</b> nuclear compartment breakdown and genome instability. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of actomyosin contractility restores nuclear architecture and genome integrity in cells lacking PPP 1 R 12 A or PPP 1 CB. We detect actin filaments at nuclear <b>envelope</b> <b>rupture</b> sites and define the Rho-ROCK pathway {{as the driver}} of nuclear damage. Lamin A protects nuclei from the impact of actomyosin activity. Blocking contractility increases nuclear circularity in cultured cancer cells and suppresses deformations of xenograft nuclei in vivo. We conclude that actomyosin contractility is a major determinant of nuclear shape and that unrestrained contractility causes nuclear dysmorphia, nuclear <b>envelope</b> <b>rupture</b> and genome instability...|$|R

30|$|To {{determine}} if the AH peptide possesses suitable properties for <b>rupturing</b> the lipid <b>envelopes</b> of virus particles, {{it is necessary to}} develop an appropriate model system to mimic the envelope structure. In this sense, intact lipid vesicles are an excellent choice because they replicate the membranous environment of lipid envelopes [50, 96 – 100]. Unlike the planar bilayer, intact vesicles also recapitulate membrane curvature. While the mechanism of the AH peptide’s vesicle rupturing activity was already determined by the combined QCM-D and reflectometry measurements, it was not determined how this in situ vesicle rupturing activity may correlate with in vitro virus particle rupturing.|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for isolating photosynthetically active rhodoplasts (“red algal chloroplasts”) from the marine alga Griffithsia monilis. The rhodoplasts exhibited rates of CO 2 fixation and CO 2 -dependent O 2 {{evolution in the}} order of 200 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll a per hour when illuminated with red or green light and were approximately 80 % intact. The response of the rate of photosynthesis to the inorganic phosphate and pyrophosphate concentrations in the medium was qualitatively similar to that previously reported for spinach chloroplasts. Osmotically shocked rhodoplasts evolved O 2 from ferricyanide in red, but not in green, light and were completely uncoupled.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya and Subba Raju is a global water quality issue. The misidentification of C. raciborskii {{in the past is}} a major concern for water quality users, considering the reported cases of human and livestock poisonings associated with the cyanobacterium. Many of the available taxonomic descriptions for this species provide little or no detail of the morphology of early developmental phases that may assist with identification. Therefore, typifying the morphological changes throughout the entire life cycle for such a species requires urgent attention. In this study, five distinct morphological phases identified using a new culturing technique are reported for the process of akinete germination in C. raciborskii. Before the terminal emergence of three to four cell germlings through a <b>ruptured</b> akinete <b>envelope</b> (phase 3), mature akinetes (phase 1) elongated and the endospore separated from the akinete envelope (phase 2). After the association with the envelope was lost, four-cell germlings (phase 4 a) matured into young trichomes of more than four cells (phase 4 b). Throughout the process of germination, internal granular structures decreased in size and were irregular in shape in germlings and young trichomes. The culturing technique, which used a Sedgwick-Rafter cell, was successful in its application but was limiting in that the development of young trichomes after phase 4 b could not be monitored.

The consequence, {{in the case of}} a <b>rupture</b> of the <b>envelopes,</b> may be serious for personnel (injuries from deflagration, burns, and oxygen deficiency hazard) as well as for the equipment. Performing a thorough risk analysis is an essential step to identify and understand risk hazards that may cause a pressure increase and in order to assess consequences, define mitigation actions, and design adequate safety relief devices to limit pressure accordingly.

In sucrose gradient centrifugation {{the area of}} maximal infectivity (buoyant density of I'I 75 g. /ml.) coincided with peaks in haemagglutinating activity, and in E 26 o.

Glutaraldehyde-fixed negatively stained rubella virus preparations showed round particles with rough surfaces measuring 5 o to 73 nm. (average 6 I nm.) in diameter. Unfixed viruses had a greater size variation, 55 to 89 nm. (aver-age 74 nm.) in diameter, apparently due to deformability and fragility of the particles.

40|$|AbstractThe histopathological {{effects of}} the spore-crystal complex of {{indigenous}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) isolate, as well as Cry 2 Ab gene expressed in transgenic tomato plants on the midgut of 4 th instar larva of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidea) has been investigated using the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Remarkable ultrastructural changes were observed in the columnar and goblet cells of the larval midgut after feeding on either transgenic tomato leaves, or spore-crystal complex of Bt. The effects observed included breakdown of microvilli of epithelial cells, increase in the electron density of the cytoplasm and vacuolation associated with different sizes of lysosomes; interruption of the goblet cells and distorted goblet cavities which lost their cytoplasmic projections; destruction of the mitochondria which lost their cristae; degeneration of the endoplasmic reticulum; collapse of the nucleus associated with <b>rupture</b> of nuclear <b>envelope</b> and clumped chromatin.

Electron micrographs of infected alfalfa tissue indicated that {{the same types of}} damage were inflicted on Lahontan (stem-nematode-tolerant) and Ranger (stem-nematode-susceptible). Only the infection rate and degree of damage differed between lines and temperatures, with the greater injury occurring at the higher temperatures.

40|$|Low-voltage circuit {{breakers}} under critical situa- tions {{such as a}} severe short circuit develop a strong electric arc leading to brutal manifestations such as <b>envelope</b> <b>rupture</b> or fire. Apparatus are strictly designed to avoid damages like personal injury and material destruction. To limit the external manifestations of the electric arc, an efficient way consists of inserting a porous filter in the gas exhaust duct, composed of metallic cloth arranged in a Reps structure. Experimental tests have demonstrated the efficiency of this technique. We propose to complete the experimental study by carrying out the numer- ical simulations about the filter impact on the hot gas flow. A 2 -D model based on the gas flow in porous media is considered, {{taking into account the}} porosity variation while the electric arc model derives from the experimental data and a thermal radiation model.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{strategy}} to estimate the geometry of a rupture on a finite fault in real time for earthquake early warning. We extend the work of Cua and Heaton who developed the virtual seismologist (VS) method (Cua, 2005), which is a Bayesian approach to seismic early warning using envelope attenuation relationships. This article extends the VS method to large earthquakes where fault finiteness is important. We propose a new model to simulate high-frequency motions from earthquakes with large <b>rupture</b> dimension: the <b>envelope</b> of high-frequency ground motion from a large earthquake can be expressed as a root-mean-squared combination of envelope functions from smaller earthquakes. We use simulated envelopes of ground acceleration to estimate the direction and length of a rupture in real time. Using the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake dataset, we have run simulations with different parameters to discover which parameters best describe the rupture geometry {{as a function of}} time. We parameterize the fault geometry with an epicenter, a fault strike, and two along-strike rupture lengths. The simulation results show that the azimuthal angle of the fault line converges to the minimum uniquely, and the estimation agrees with the actual Chi-Chi earthquake fault geometry quite well. The rupture direction can be estimated at 10 s after the event onset, and the final solution is achieved after 20 s. While this methodology seems quite promising for warning systems, it only works well when there is an adequate distribution of near-source stations...|$|R

40|$|Fine {{structural}} {{analyses of}} host tissue (alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.) response to infection by the stem nematode (Ditylenchus dipsaci Kühn) were conducted. Hypocotyl regions were taken on 1, 3 and 7 days after inoculation.

Only the infection rate (in percent) and degree of damage were different between lines and among the different temperatures (15, 20 and 25 C). The higher the temperature, the more injury resulted. After 3 to 7 days of infection, the symptoms observed were swelling and broken endoplasmic reticulum (ER), distended and broken chloroplasts, loss of nuclear material and bulging and <b>rupturing</b> of nuclear <b>envelopes.</b> Heavily infected cell walls showed more osmiophilic substances on one side.

40|$|Tetraploid cells, which {{typically}} arise from errors in mitosis, are genomically unstable and promote tumorigenesis. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} ~ 40 % of tumors undergo a tetraploid intermediate during their evolution, with ~ 20 % of all solid tumors maintaining a tetraploid karyotype. Consequently, tumor suppression mechanisms have evolved to limit the proliferation of tetraploid cells. However, it remains unclear how tetraploid cells are able to overcome these tumor suppression mechanisms to initiate tumorigenesis. To address this unresolved question, we developed and validated a genome-wide screening assay to comprehensively identify miRNAs whose overexpression promotes tetraploid cell proliferation. We then profiled those miRNAs to mechanistically define how each miRNA functions to overcome tetraploid induced arrest. Our results demonstrate that miRNAs can promote proliferation via multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of the p 53 tumor suppressor pathway, hyperactivation of growth factor signaling, and inactivation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Additionally, we investigated mechanisms that facilitate tumorigenesis from proliferating tetraploid cells. It is well established that tetraploid cell proliferation promotes both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities, although the precise mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain incompletely understood. Chromosome missegregation {{can lead to the}} formation of micronuclei separate from the primary nucleus, a result of either lagging or polar chromosomes. Micronuclei have been shown to rupture during interphase, leading to massive amounts of DNA damage and chromothripsis, resulting in extensive DNA breaks and rearrangements. We followed micronuclei formed from both lagging and polar chromosomes to determine whether all micronuclei are equally prone to nuclear <b>envelope</b> <b>rupture.</b> Our results show that polar micronuclei have nuclear envelopes that are significantly more stable than the nuclear envelopes of micronuclei formed from lagging chromosomes. Furthermore, micronuclei {{have been shown to be}} deficient at nuclear import of proteins. Kinetochore assembly, vital for proper chromosome segregation, is dependent upon the nuclear import of many proteins. We sought to establish whether micronuclei have defects in kinetochore assembly since without functional kinetochores, chromosomes cannot bind to the mitotic spindle. We found that chromosomes in micronuclei fail to assemble kinetochores efficiently, and thus promote additional chromosome missegregation. Overall, this dissertation identifies multiple mechanisms that facilitate tumorigenesis from tetraploid intermediates...|$|R
