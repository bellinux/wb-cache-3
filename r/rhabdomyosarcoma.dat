Apart from myogenic marker genes (bHLH factors, myosin, actin), cell adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin and N-CAM {{have been reported}} to be expressed both in <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> and during myogenesis. The present study demonstrates the expression of another cadherin, cadherin- 11, in <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> and during differentiation of myoblasts in vitro: cadherin- 11, a predominantly mesenchymal cell adhesion molecule, is highly expressed in embryonal <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> and alveolar <b>rhabdomyosarcomas,</b> which do not bear the Pax- 3 -FKHR fusion previously described. Cadherin- 11 is down-regulated in normal skeletal muscle and after myotube formation in vitro.

40|$|AIMS: The ALK p 80 {{chimeric}} protein {{is thought to}} be up-regulated {{as a result of the}} t(2; 5) as classically seen in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. However, <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> (in particular, the alveolar subtype) have also been noted to show expression of this protein. This study set out to examine ALK expression in a large number of <b>rhabdomyosarcomas.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-three cases of <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> and 16 cases of malignant mixed müllerian tumours with a rhabdomyosarcomatous component were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Anatomical Pathology for the period 1983 - 2001. The sections were stained with polyclonal ALK antibody. There were 52 male and 30 female patients. In one case, the gender of the patient was not indicated. The ages ranged from 1 week to 77 years. The most common site was the head and neck region, followed by the pelvis and extremities. Thirty-one cases were of the alveolar subtype while 40 cases were embryonal. There were four mixed embryonal/alveolar, six pleomorphic and two unclassifiable <b>rhabdomyosarcomas.</b> Fourteen of the 31 (45 %) alveolar <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> stained positively for the ALK protein, while only six of the 40 embryonal (15 %) cases showed positivity. One case each of the mixed embryonal/alveolar, pleomorphic and unclassified cases was also immunopositive. The rhabdomyosarcomatous component in the malignant mixed müllerian tumours was positive in four of the 16 cases. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a proportion of alveolar <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> (in particular) exhibit ALK protein expression. However, ALK expression is not restricted to this subtype.

Paraffin-embedded samples of 13 pairs of primary untreated <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> and their residual, recurrent, or metastatic lesions after chemotherapy were assessed for expression of MDR proteins, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP 1) and lung resistance-related protein (LRP).

40|$|<b>Rhabdomyosarcomas</b> {{are soft}} tissue sarcomas (STS) that, while {{extremely}} rare in adults, {{are one of}} the most common neoplasms in children and adolescents. <b>Rhabdomyosarcomas</b> are presumed to be associated with the skeletal muscle lineage, although surprisingly, those tumors can be present in organs histologically lacking skeletal muscle, like prostate, urinary bladder or gallbladder. Pathologically, <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> are very heterogeneous tumors and can be divided into three major groups: alveolar <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> (ARMS), embryonal <b>rhabdomyosarcomas</b> (ERMS), which includes the botryoid subtype, and pleomorphic <b>rhabdomyosarcomas.</b> Besides clinicopathological differences, these tumors also differ at the molecular level. As in many other sarcoma types, ARMS are characterized by specific chromosomal translocations and almost 75 % of cases show t(2; 13) or t(1; 13) translocations, involving PAX 3 -FKHR and PAX 7 -FKHR fusion genes respectively. These genetic events result in a molecular gain of function of the fusion protein, which is proposed to perturb the differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. Since PAX 3 / 7 -FKHR fusions result in rearrangements of PAX 3 / 7 and FKHR genes, such that the PAX C-terminal domain is replaced by the potent FKHR transactivation domain, we sought to investigate the implications of this translocation on function and expression of wild type PAX 3 and PAX 7 Cterminal isoforms. This research identified functional differences between Pax 3 and Pax 7 Cterminal isoforms during myogenesis, and suggests that both Pax 3 and Pax 7 transcripts are required for commitment of cells to the myogenic lineage. More specifically, the Pax 3 c isoform may be required for terminal myogenic differentiation whereas the Pax 3 d isoform may be involved in undifferentiated cell maintenance and/or proliferation. Therefore, different levels of individual C-terminal isoforms of Pax 3 and Pax 7 in normal cells v may shift the balance between the undifferentiated and differentiated phenotype during muscle cell differentiation. In ARMS, this „balance‟ appears to be further disrupted and may lead to a block in terminal differentiation...|$|R
