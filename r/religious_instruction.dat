To su prije svega kontekstualno obilježje {{discipline}} i interdisciplinarni karakter njezina istraživanja. Unatoč spomenutim poteškoćama nastoji se dati promišljen i utemeljen pregled najaktualnijih tema i tendencija na svjetskoj razini, iako je težište ipak na literaturi četiriju glavnih zapadnoeuropskih jezika. U religijskoj pedagogiji i katehetici uočljivo je nastojanje da se standardiziraju dosadašnja postignuća i otvore nove perspektive, obilježene sučeljavanjem s novim povijesnim i kulturološkim izazovima, među kojima je najznačajniji religijskopedagoški rad u uvjetima radikalne dijaspore i rastućeg svjetonazorsko-religioznog pluralizma, posebno na tradicionalnim kršćanskim prostorima. Aktualna pitanja religijske pedagogije i katehetike na hrvatskom jezičnom području, o kojima se govori na kraju članka, najvećim su dijelom određena društveno-političkim promjenama iz 1990. godine, a tretiraju: uvođenje i usustavljenje vjeronauka kao školskog predmeta, novo definiranje i profiliranje župne kateheze, razjašnjavanje međusobnog odnosa tih dvaju mjesta religioznog odgoja i učenja, novi profil vjeroučitelja, njihove duhovnosti i profesionalnih kompetencija, vjeronaučnu didaktiku i metodiku, pitanje planova i programa te udžbenika i katekizama za vjeronauk i katehezu. Bilješke ovog članka donose vrijedne indikacije koje mogu poslužiti kao putokaz za daljnja istraživanja o mnogim pitanjima i temama koje su ovdje naznačene. The article first reflects {{upon the}} complexity of religious-pedagogical catechism research and points out factors that thwart the presentation of current issues relating to religious pedagogy and catechism. These are above all contextual features of the discipline and the inter-disciplinary nature of religious-pedagogical-catechism research. Despite the said difficulties, the author attempts to offer the thought and a founded review of the most current topics and tendencies at a world level even though literature of the four main Western European languages is stressed. The presentation begins with {{the hypothesis that the}} transition between from the 20 th to the 21 st century in religious pedagogy and catechism was the motivation for numerous editions that endeavoured to standardise the achievements, consolidate scientific discipline and offer a contemporary overview of religious-pedagogy catechism topics and issues and as such, open new perspectives that vitally determined its profile in the present but even more so to determine its future. At large Continental and world conferences of experts and in catechism publications, discussions are presented of current issues of this scientific discipline that are featured with facing new historical and cultural challenges, amongst which the most significant is religious pedagogical work in conditions of radical Diaspora and a growing pluralism of religious affiliation, particularly in traditionally Christian regions. Experts point to the possibility of changes in catechism paradigms and traces of new models of catechism that is appropriate to the new, »post-Christian« missionary context. In that regard, it is particularly significance is given to the question of Evangelisation and revision and updatedness of Catechumenical forms of Christian initiation. The notion of multi-cultural social contexts and religious pluralism imposes new religious pedagogical tasks such as those concerned with teaching tolerance and dialogue and ecumenical inter-religious and inter-cultural teaching. New thought about thefundamental content of the Christian proclamation is also evident as is,facing the challenges of modem society that is defined as a »social study«. The article points out new accents in research that are directed to those involved in <b>religious</b> <b>instructions,</b> education and catechism listing numerous other projects and topics that are being worked upon. These include: scientific theory of religious pedagogy, the history of catechism, catechism and/or religious pedagogy, comparative <b>religious</b> <b>instructions,</b> reforms in studies for <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> teachers, new meaning to aesthetic teaching, the role of symbols and myths in religious communication, psychology, social and religious meaning of rituals and a new awareness of the catechism dimension of the Liturgy itself, religious-pedagogical meaning of Church space, new thought about the principles and didactic correlation, pastoral care of the young, family catechism, bio-ethical issues and dialogue with natural sciences, relations toward the media, the use of new media and multi-media halls, creativity, complete learning, open lessons, evaluation and attention to acute social issues and hot social problems. Current issues of religious pedagogy and catechism in the Croatian regions, which the article refers to in the end, was on the most part determined by social-political changes in 1990, and are treated as follows: introducing and establishing <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> as a school subject, new definitions and profiles of parochial catechism, explanation of mutual relations of the two places in <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> and teaching, new profile of <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> teachers, their spirituality and professional competencies, <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> didactics and methodology, questions of planning and programmes and text books and catechism for <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> and catechism.

5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, {{and the power of the}} State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits <b>religious</b> <b>instruction</b> in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive <b>religious</b> <b>instruction</b> or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E

Future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump and his brother, the judge Garnett Kerr Kump, received part of their primary education in the schoolhouse. By 1885, a Mr. Miller was teaching business principles at the school. The log building succumbed to the elements, and no longer exists.|$|E

25|$|Subsequent works {{usually have}} {{religious}} themes, including Bible translations, manuals for <b>religious</b> <b>instructions,</b> and biblical plays. In 1560, the first Romansh {{translation of the}} New Testament: L'g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ by Giachem Bifrun, was published. Two years later, in 1562, another writer from the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, published the Cudesch da Psalms, a collection of Romansh church songs in the Vallader dialect. In the Sursilvan dialect, the first surviving works are also religious works such as catechism by Daniel Bonifaci, and in 1611 Ilg Vêr Sulaz da pievel giuvan ("The true joys of young people"), a series of <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> for Protestant youths was published by Steffan Gabriel. Four years later in 1615, a Catholic catechism Curt Mussament was published in response, written by Gion Antoni Calvenzano. The first translation of the New Testament into Sursilvan was published in 1648 by the son of Steffan Gabriel, Luci Gabriel. The first complete translation of the Bible, the Bibla da Cuera was published between 1717 and 1719.|$|R
5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and <b>religious</b> <b>instruction</b> were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E

Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Franziska personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the same path. Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.|$|E
5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>religious</b> <b>instruction</b> provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E
50|$|The Archconfraternity of Voluntary Catechists (loosely {{corresponding}} to the French Oeuvre des Catéchismes) was founded to help parish priests in giving <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> to children attending the primary schools in Paris {{and other parts of}} France, after these had been laicized. In 1893, Pope Leo XIII gave it the rank of an archconfraternity with power to affiliate all similar confraternities in France.

5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{signed the}} Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a {{treaty with the}} Vatican that {{required}} the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches {{and to try to}} weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offenses. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce <b>religious</b> <b>instruction</b> and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed {{the separation of church and}} state and prohibited <b>religious</b> <b>instruction</b> in schools.|$|E
5|$|In Western Europe, some of {{the older}} Roman elite {{families}} died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs. Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of <b>religious</b> <b>instruction</b> in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.|$|E
50|$|Akhyana {{literally}} {{means to}} tell or narrate in Sanskrit. The 12th century polymath Hemchandra defined Akhyana in his Kavyanusashana {{as a side}} story from religious texts narrated by Granthika (professional story teller) to instruct audience accompanied by singing and acting. This definition {{does not include the}} narration of other non-mythological stories like that of Narsinh Mehta. In general, Akhyana can be defined as the stories narrated by story teller for <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> to audience accompanied by singing and acting.

The worship is held with <b>religious</b> <b>instructions</b> in the Vedas (Sanskrit sacred texts) and Thirumurai (Tamil sacred texts) read by priests. These hours are marked by the tolling of the bell of the temple amidst music with nadaswaram (pipe instrument) and thavil (percussion instrument).|$|R
