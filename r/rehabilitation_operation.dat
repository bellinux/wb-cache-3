40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The phrase “miner” is {{comparatively}} non-specific as mining {{is seen as}} a multi-disciplinary {{industry that}} includes several diverse professions and trades (Donoghue, 2004). One of the functions within mining is the operation of earth moving equipment (EME) such as haul trucks, dozers, excavators and graders. EME are generally used to shift large amounts of earth, dig foundations and landscape areas. In this study whole-body vibration (WBV) and noise exposure of earth moving equipment (EME) operators were assessed, at an opencast coalmine in South Africa. The aim was to evaluate and quantify the levels of exposure in different EME types, as well as to compare old with new EME, in order to estimate if machine hours contribute to higher noise and vibration levels. WBV and noise levels of the Production and Rehabilitation operations were compared, to determine whether different activities led to different exposures. Internationally accepted standardised methods, ISO 2631 - 1 for WBV and SANS 10083 : 2012 for noise were followed and correctly calibrated instrumentation was used. WBV measurements were conducted with a tri-axial seat pad accelerometer (SVAN 958) and personal noise dosimeters (Casella 35 X) were used for noise measurements. Measurements were taken over a period of four months. With regards to the European Union (EU) limit (1. 15 m/s 2) and the EU action limit (0. 5 m/s 2) it was noted that operators of EME within the Production operation were not exposed to WBV levels above the EU limit, but 77 % of these operators were exposed to WBV levels above the EU action limit. It was also evident that 45 % of operators’ vibration exposure levels were within the Health Guidance Caution Zone (HGCZ) of 0. 45 – 0. 90 m/s 2. Within the <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>operation,</b> 9 % of operators were exposed to WBV levels above the EU limit and 55 % above the EU action limit. Furthermore 50 % was within the HGCZ. With regards to the noise Occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 85 dB(A) as stated by the Mine Health and Safety Regulations (MHSR) it was noted that 27 % of operators within the Production operation were exposed to noise levels above the limit and for operators within the <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>operation</b> 14 % were reported to be exposed at or above the limit. Statistically significant difference in noise exposure was found between the Production operation and <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>operation.</b> Results indicated that the majority of EME operators were exposed to high noise levels, in some cases exceeding the 85 dB(A) OEL. A significant positive correlation was found between noise exposure levels and machine hours. Thus higher noise levels were observed as machine operating hours increased. It was found that operators were exposed predominantly to vibration and noise levels below the limits. However the Dozer group within the Production and Rehabilitation operations in some cases exceeded the vibration and noise legal limit. High exposure levels within the Dozer group {{can be attributed to the}} fact that these EME types mostly perform activities in uneven areas and the tracks on which these Dozers move also contribute to higher vibration levels due to a lack of a suspension. Controls should be implemented as far as is reasonably practicable to ensure that operators are not exposed above recommended or permissible levels for each hazard. Continuous improvement of the maintenance plan for all EME and regularly grading and maintaining travelling ways are some of the controls that will contribute to lower vibration and noise levels. Operators exposed to high noise levels should use hearing protective devices as an early on preventative measure to reduce noise exposure levels. Master...|$|E
40|$|The present degree thesis {{deals with}} modern methods for the {{maintenance}} and rehabilitation of sewage system, in particular with reference to public sewage networks. In {{the first section of}} the thesis the sewage system is presented as a set of buildings used for the collection and drainage of waste waters and atmospheric waters from a defined area. The design of a functionally optimal system requires adequate planning that takes into consideration all factors that affect the quality of the operation of the sewage system. Optimal drainage of waste waters and the atmospheic waters accompained by minimal construction, operation, and maintenance costs can only be realized through high quality construction and operation, and regular maintenance of the entire system. Like in other sectors, progress and improvements have also been made in relation to sewage system, from their design, construction, operation, through maintenance. The thesis focuses on modern method or processes used for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>operation</b> that exclude any digging and major spatial interventions. Domestic subcontractors that use the presented methods for the rehabilitations of sewage system operate under licences granted by foreign companies. Based on two concrete examples, the comparative cost analysis of a modern and a conventional method for the rehabilitation og sewage systems presents in the final part of my thesis has shown that despite numerous benefits modern rehabilitation methods are economically justified in certain cases only. Therefore, before each intervention a detailed analysis of the situation and rehabilitation costs has to be made, leading to the most appropriate and convenient solution in each examined case...|$|E

The Community shall enact a Tribal Water Code, to be approved by the DOI Secretary, through which the Community shall administer its water rights. Allottees must first exhaust remedies under the Tribe's water code and law before seeking recourse from the US. The Community may lease these waters (not to exceed 100 years) with some limitations. CAP water may be used off reservation but not out of state. The benefits received through this Act shall fully satisfy all Community claims.

Under the settlement agreement certain amounts have been paid the Community by AZ, Salt River Project. Treasury shall establish the Gila River Indian Community Water OM&R Fund. Reclamation shall lead on environmental compliance and repair any resulting subsidence damage. Secretary shall provide funds to Gila Valley and Franklin Irrigation Districts in attempt to acquire rights that will decrease demands on the Gila River or transfer them to San Carlos Irrigation Project for Community benefit. The Gila River agreement depends upon execution of the New Mexico consumptive and forbearance agreement, notice of which should be received no later than Dec. 31, 2014. Appropriations include $ 52, 396, 000 for rehabilitation of irrigation works, a maximum of $ 4 M for subsidence remediation, $ 10 M for habitat conservation, $ 15 million for the Gila Valley Irrigation District, and $ 13, 900, 000 to retire debt incurred on the Safford facility. {Source: Government Printing Office...|$|E
