5|$|Michael and Lori Fortier were {{considered}} accomplices for their foreknowledge {{of the planning}} of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols {{in exchange for a}} <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence</b> and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelveyears in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten {{and a half years of}} his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence</b> of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E

Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to the warden in exchange for a <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence</b> and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison.|$|E
5|$|Speer's {{supporters}} {{maintained a}} continual call for his release. Among those who pledged support for Speer's sentence to be commuted were Charles de Gaulle, U.S. diplomat George Ball, former U.S. High Commissioner John J.

Willy Brandt {{was a strong}} advocate of Speer's, supporting his release, sending flowers to his daughter {{on the day of}} his release, and putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against Speer, which could have caused his property to be confiscated. A <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence</b> required the consent of all four of the occupying powers, and the Soviets adamantly opposed any such proposal. Speer served his full sentence, and was released at midnight on October1, 1966.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence.</b> Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E

5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence</b> of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department {{announced}} that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim of the phone calls from Mexico to get a <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence,</b> while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence.</b> Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E

He admitted that he testified against Dwyer in hopes of receiving a <b>reduced</b> <b>sentence</b> and to spare his wife from being prosecuted for her role in the conspiracy, and expressed his regret for that decision and the role it played in Dwyer's death.|$|E

40|$|Many {{learning}} systems use {{the space}} of logic formulas as the search space of hypotheses. To build efficient systems, the set of first order logic formulas can be reduced in many ways. Most systems restrict themselves to (subsets of) Horn clauses. In this paper we investigate {{the space of}} <b>reduced</b> first order <b>sentences,</b> which has the same expressive power as an arbritrary first order logic. Shapiro [1981] has used the subset of <b>reduced</b> first order <b>sentences</b> to define a most general refinement operator. His operator is claimed to be complete, i. e., all <b>reduced</b> <b>sentences</b> are derivable from the empty sentence. In this article we will show that his operator is not complete and propose a new, complete refinement operator for <b>reduced</b> first order <b>sentences...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{his famous}} Model Inference System, Shapiro [10] uses {{so-called}} refinement operators to replace too general hypotheses by logically weaker ones.
