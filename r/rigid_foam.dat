40|$|Abstract. Polyurethane {{closed-cell}} <b>rigid</b> <b>foams</b> {{have been}} widely used as insulants in the building and refrigeration industry and also for district heating pipes. It is the special combination of excellent insulation performance and the mechanical stability due to the foaming process which makes this material very attractive for these applications. The replacement of chlorofluorocar-bons, which have been banned as blowing agents since 1993, by hydrocarbons in Europe caused a decrease in the insulation capability of polyurethane <b>rigid</b> <b>foams.</b> The additional global require-ment to reduce energy losses also adds an incentive to search for potential substances which would improve the thermal performance of <b>rigid</b> <b>foams.</b> To overcome this problem the heat transfer within polyurethane <b>rigid</b> <b>foams</b> via the polymer matrix, enclosed gas, and thermal radiation was examined in various independent experiments. Most importantly, it was observed that the potential to reduce the thermal conductivity of polyurethane <b>rigid</b> <b>foams</b> is higher than had been predicted. ...|$|R

25|$|Conventional {{polyester}} polyols {{are based}} on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols {{are based on}} reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in <b>rigid</b> <b>foam,</b> and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.|$|E

2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), glycerine (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styreneâ€“acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight <b>rigid</b> <b>foam</b> polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone.
