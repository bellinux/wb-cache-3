5|$|BMW {{began to}} use precise <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> systems in the 1930s, and many other European {{manufacturers}} soon adopted the technology. American automakers adopted <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> beginning with the 1974 Ford Pinto.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
25|$|V8 models use {{recirculating}} ball steering (as per previous 5 Series generations), however <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> {{was used for}} the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of <b>steering</b> gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of <b>steering</b> gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion.</b> In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of <b>steering</b> assay is reasonable.

25|$|Unusually, two {{different}} steering systems {{were used for}} the E39, depending on the engine. Models with four-cylinder and six-cylinder models use <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering,</b> the first time this system has been used in a 5 Series. This system steers {{from the front of the}} axle. Models with V8 engines use recirculating ball steering, as per the previous generations of 5 Series.|$|E
25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front end to accommodate <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> while still using transverse leaf spring suspension. The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced {{in the summer of}} 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|E
25|$|The XH series Falcon {{utility and}} van, {{released}} in 1996, were essentially XG models facelifted {{to resemble the}} contemporary Falcon EF sedans and wagons. The XH also gained an all-new front suspension and <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> from the EA–EL series cars. This meant changes to the frame and bodywork, from the firewall forward. The turret (roof) panel on the utility was now domed and lost its squared-off appearance, increasing interior head room. By this time, {{the popularity of the}} panel van had faded and Ford released their final Falcon panel van in 1997 as part of the revised XH II series. It was also with this model that the V8 engine was re-introduced into the Falcon utility commercial vehicle range. After 20 years, the fourth generation Falcon was discontinued in June 1999.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> with {{adjustable}} <b>steering</b> {{column and}} lightweight 10 inch {{leather-covered steering wheel}} was used. Steering arms were connected to the rack by adjustable rod-ends.|$|R
50|$|All C4 S4s' came {{equipped}} {{as standard}} with a conventional fixed-assistance <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> power assisted <b>steering</b> (PAS) system. An electronically controlled 'servotronic' system, which varied {{the level of}} assistance {{in accordance with the}} road speed, was available as an option.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} is {{a sophisticated}} clean sheet, double wishbone layout {{that is also}} cleverly symmetrical from left to right, thus reducing spares inventories, etc. Both {{the front and rear}} suspension oscillations are dampened by adjustable bump and rebound shock absorbers fitted with adjustable spring platforms.The <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> power <b>steering</b> assembly is mounted ahead of the engine in order to better optimise the front suspension geometry and the high loads generated under long distance racing events.|$|R
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E
500|$|The Ford Pinto is a front-engine, {{rear-drive}} subcompact car manufactured {{and marketed}} by Ford Motor Company for model years 1971–1980.

2500|$|The Autobianchi Primula is a {{supermini}} {{economy car}} manufactured between 1964 and 1970 by the Italian automaker Autobianchi, a now defunct {{subsidiary of the}} Fiat Group. The Primula was Fiat's first model with <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> and is widely known for its innovative Dante Giacosa-designed front-wheel drive, transverse engine layout [...] that would be later popularized by the Fiat 128 to ultimately become an industry-standard front drive layout.|$|E

Braking-wise, {{ventilated}} front, {{and solid}} rear disc brakes are employed, both using piston steel calipers. To counteract noise, vibration, and harshness, engineers have designed the Cruze with an isolated four-point engine mount and implemented sound damping material in areas including the front-of-dashboard panel, luggage compartment, decklid internals, doors, carpet and headlining. Further noise suppression {{through the use}} of a triple-layer sealing system in the doors has also been employed.|$|E
2500|$|Volkswagen added a [...] "Super Beetle" [...] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 {{differed}} from the standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension {{instead of the usual}} torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). <b>Rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> replaced recirculating ball steering gears in model year 1974 and up. The front of the car was stretched [...] to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by styling {{from the}} Dakar and Jeepster concept vehicles, the Liberty was {{intended}} as a replacement for the discontinued Jeep Cherokee. The Liberty also marked a few firsts for Jeep. It was the first Jeep vehicle to use <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> It's also the first Jeep to use the two then-new PowerTech engines; the [...] 2.4 L straight-4, which was discontinued in 2006, and the [...] 3.7 L V6, as well as a 2.8 L VM Motori turbo diesel (2005-2006 only) for the CRD versions. [...] However, the Liberty was not the first Jeep vehicle to use an independent front suspension, as the Jeep Wagoneer first used it in the 1963 model. But, that independent front suspension was limited to four wheel drive versions and, even then, was a short lived option. In addition, the Liberty was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson dislikes the British car brand Rover, {{the last}} major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view {{stretched}} back to the company's time as part of British Leyland. Describing {{the history of the}} company up to its last flagship model, the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated [...] "Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many," [...] citing issues with the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> system. In the latter years of the company Clarkson blamed the [...] "uncool" [...] brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars.

2500|$|The {{production}} car changed little from the prototype, although the full-width rear bumper was dropped {{in favour of}} two part-bumpers curving round each corner, with overriders. Mechanicals were basically stock Herald with the notable addition of front disc brakes. The engine was an [...] four-cylinder with a pushrod OHV cylinder head and two valves per cylinder, mildly tuned for the Spitfire, fed by twin SU carburettors. Also from the Herald came the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>steering</b> and coil-and-wishbone front suspension, and at the rear a single transverse-leaf swing axle arrangement. This ended up being the most controversial part of the car: it was known to [...] "tuck in" [...] and cause violent over steer if pushed too hard, even in the staid Herald. In the sportier Spitfire (and later the six-cylinder Triumph GT6 and Triumph Vitesse) it led to severe criticism. Known fixes for this include things like camber compensators (essentially a single leaf spring suspended beneath the vertical links), or simply achieving more negative camber to the rear wheels can help the handling become more manageable. The body was bolted to a much-modified Herald chassis, the outer rails and the rear outriggers having been removed; little of the original Herald chassis design was left, and the Spitfire used structural outer sills to stiffen its body tub.|$|E
