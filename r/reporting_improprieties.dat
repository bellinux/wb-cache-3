40|$|The {{development}} {{level of}} managerial control {{systems in the}} Romanian public entities is not a remarkable one, on the contrary, some institutions {{do not understand the}} real usefulness of the internal control system and the related set of standards; the compliance is determined only by the regulatory norms. The practice of implementing the internal control proves that the perception of executives and middle managers regarding that system is not a favourable and supporting one. The managers face difficulties caused by the ambiguity of some of the standards, poorly understood, and for which the body of laws does not provide advices. Thus, some institutions report the high compliance of standards, although the reality shows numerous inconsistencies. Other public institutions assess their own level of implementation only partially, but do not identify improvement solutions. Because of the lacking of benchmarking initiatives and knowledge transferring between institutions, the picture of this situation indicates dysfunctions that influence the efficiency of the activities and the achievement of the objectives. In this paper, we will analyze the correlation between the observed shortcomings in the implementation of three of the most important standards, namely the <b>Reporting</b> <b>improprieties,</b> the Information and the Communication. The methodology used is an analytical and exploratory one and critically examines the implementation status of these three standards in more than 40 public institutions in Dolj County, Romania. Also, by analyzing the answers to the questionnaire, our study identifies differences in interpretation and implementation of these standards between certain types of organizations (given the heterogeneity of the investigated sample). The results show a high interdependence between this control standards and our proposals focus on the strengthening of the interpersonal skills and the personal relationships. Our study is directed toward the conclusion that the three internal/managerial control standards and their potential impact on the organizational optimization are not optimal exploited...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry requires the coordinated effort of many professionals: architects, engineers, surveyors and contractors. Engineers and architects have for decades been regulated by complex codes of ethics. Construction Industry employees are often {{required to report}} improper, unsafe or illegal construction activities. In most cases, practitioners have a legal or ethical duty {{to blow the whistle}} on a colleague, employer or client. This paper focuses on several key aspects of whistle-blowing as they relate to construction sector employees. The aims of this paper are two-fold: firstly, to highlight the need to have legislation in place that protects, and therefore encourages, the whistle-blowing phenomenon in the {{construction industry}} as a basis for good ethical practice; and secondly, to review the provisions for protecting whistleblowers as they relate to the construction industry employees nationally and internationally. The purpose is not to present any specific national legislation as a model of best practice but rather to compare and contrast coverage of legal protection, and to bring to the fore precedent pertinent to the construction industry context. The variations in whistleblowing protection laws create an environment where it is difficult to make a general statement regarding legal protection available to practitioners who <b>report</b> <b>impropriety.</b> It may be necessary for a potential whistleblower to balance the ethical call to duty with the specific legal protection afforded to them as employees within a particular country...|$|R

500|$|Thomas Cromwell, Henry's Chief Minister, {{had long}} since had {{his eyes on the}} wealth of English monasteries; at the time they owned {{approximately}} a quarter of all the realm's landed wealth. Starting in 1534, Cromwell had each of the monasteries inspected, with the establishment's wealth and endowments recorded, along with frequent <b>reports</b> of <b>impropriety,</b> vice and excess. These reports were compiled into volumes known as the Valor Ecclesiasticus. Leicester abbey was inspected by Richard Layton, in 1535, who complimented Abbot Bourchier as an honest man, but who tried to bring charges of [...] "adultery and unnatural vice" [...] against the abbey's canons. Abbot Bourchier sought to gain Thomas Cromwell's favour to protect his canons and abbey; in 1536 sending him £100 and gifts of sheep and oxen. This was ultimately fruitless: Cromwell had convinced King Henry of the immoral behaviour within England's monasteries and thus between 1536 and 1541 they were all suppressed and dissolved: their land, property and wealth transferred to the king. The abbot's attempts at bribery could not save Leicester Abbey, and it was finally surrendered to the crown for dissolution in 1538.|$|R

5000|$|In the meantime, Tulane enlisted a {{law firm}} from outside the New Orleans area to conduct an {{in-house}} investigation.

By the end of the month, Tulane athletic director Hindman Wall resigned, and the school was expelled from the Metro Conference as a result. According to Sports Illustrated, the scandal, combined with <b>reports</b> of academic <b>impropriety,</b> enraged the faculty to the point that several members wanted to drop intercollegiate athletics altogether.

40|$|This essay, to be {{published}} in the First Amendment Law Review 2 ̆ 7 s forthcoming symposium issue on Public Citizens, Public Servants: Free Speech in the Post-Garcetti Workplace, critiques the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Garcetti v. Ceballos as reflecting a distorted understanding of government speech that overstates government 2 ̆ 7 s own expressive interests while undermining the public 2 ̆ 7 s interest in transparent government. In Garcetti, the Court held that the First Amendment does not protect public employees 2 ̆ 7 speech made 2 ̆ 2 pursuant to their official duties, 2 ̆ 2 concluding that a government employer should remain free to exercise 2 ̆ 2 employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created. 2 ̆ 2 The Court thus created a bright-line rule that essentially defines public employees 2 ̆ 7 speech delivered pursuant to their official duties as the government 2 ̆ 7 s own speech for which it paid with a salary - i. e., speech that the government may control free from First Amendment scrutiny regardless of the strength of the public 2 ̆ 7 s interest in it or its impact, if any, on the government 2 ̆ 7 s efficiency. But in suggesting that any speech pursuant to a public employee 2 ̆ 7 s official duties constitutes government speech, the Court ignored the fact that government speech merits insulation from First Amendment scrutiny only because of its instrumental value in enabling the public to identify and evaluate its government 2 ̆ 7 s priorities - and to hold the government politically accountable for those choices. Indeed, the government 2 ̆ 7 s political accountability to the electorate for its effectiveness is undercut by the carte blanche Garcetti now gives government to discipline workers who truthfully <b>report</b> irregularities and <b>improprieties</b> pursuant to their official duties. Rather than identifying a theoretically principled approach for capturing the value of empowering government to control its own speech, the Garcetti Court instead formalistically imposed a bright-line rule to avoid the often challenging but entirely commonplace task of balancing constitutional interests...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{attitudes of}} new-to-practice {{certified}} family physicians in Ontario concerning sanctions against {{sexual abuse of}} patients by physicians and to assess the importance of concern about accusations of sexual abuse in influencing clinical decisions. DESIGN: Qualitative study and cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Focus groups: 34 physicians who completed family medicine residency training between 1984 and 1989 participated in seven focus groups between June and October 1992. Survey: all certificants of the College of Family Physicians of Canada who received certification between 1989 and 1991 and were currently practising in Ontario. Of the 564 eligible physicians 395 (184 men and 211 women) responded, for an overall response rate of 70. 0 %. The response rates among {{the male and female}} physicians were 70. 5 % and 69. 6 % respectively. OUTCOME MEASURES: Physicians' attitudes toward restricting physical examinations done by physicians to same-sex patients, mandatory <b>reporting</b> of sexual <b>impropriety</b> and loss of licence in cases of sexual violation and the perceived importance of concern about accusations of sexual abuse as an influence on clinical decisions. RESULTS: During the focus groups male physicians in particular expressed concerns about the effect on their practice patterns of the current climate regarding sexual abuse of patients. Female physicians were less concerned about possible accusations of sexual abuse but expressed concerns regarding possible sexualization of the clinical encounter by male patients. In the survey equal proportions of men (163 [93. 7 %]) and women (191 [92. 3 %]) disagreed with restricting examinations to same-sex patients. The women were more likely than the men to agree that all suspected cases of sexual impropriety committed by other physicians should be reported (121 [58. 7 %] v. 86 [50. 0 %]), whereas the men were more likely to disagree (48 [27. 9 %] v. 32 [15. 5 %]) (p = 0. 008). The women were also more likely than the men to agree that physicians should lose their licence permanently if they were found guilty of sexual violation (125 [62. 2 %] v. 73 [43. 5 %]), whereas the men were more likely to disagree (61 [36. 3 %] v. 37 [18. 4 %]) (p < 0. 001). Almost half of the men (80 [46. 5 %]) but only 28 women (14. 1 %) reported that concerns about accusations of sexual abuse were of importance in their clinical decisions (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Young female family physicians practising in Ontario are much more likely than their male counterparts to endorse permanent loss of licence for physicians who sexually abuse patients and are significantly less concerned about accusations against themselves. Neither sex endorses only same-sex examinations by physicians. Educational approaches to protect patients while ensuring that appropriate care continues to be delivered are essential...|$|R
