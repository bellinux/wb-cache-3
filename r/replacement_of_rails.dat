50|$|In 2005, the Ministry of Transport for Rheinland-Pfalz {{announced}} {{a plan to}} reactivate the railway for passenger service to Frankfurt Hahn Airport. To demonstrate a commitment, buses connecting the remote airport with the greater Rhine-Main region would be utilized until the railway was re-activated for use. Originally forecasted to begin in 2010, the plan called for hourly Regional-Express (RE) train service between the airport and Mainz and a service to Bingen every two hours. In 2007, the Minister of Transport for Rheinland-Pfalz {{signed an agreement with}} DB to reactivate the railway, but stated that the goal to have service ready by 2010 was impractical. The route was to require extensive re-construction, including track doubling in several sections, thus raising costs significantly. Further studies showed that the entire railway required <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails,</b> sleepers, and ballasts in addition to reducing at-grade crossings. Planners also recommended the upgrade of the entire railway in one major project, rather than a phased project.|$|E
5000|$|From May 13, 1985, to August 21, 1989, the IRT Flushing Line was {{overhauled}} for improvements, {{including the}} installation of new track, repair of station structures and to improve line infrastructure.

This was necessitated because the subway was allowed to deteriorate during the 1970s and 80s {{to the point that}} there were widespread [...] "Code Red" [...] defects on the Flushing Line, and there were some pillars holding elevated structures that were so shaky that trains wouldn't run if the wind exceeded 65 mph. ⟨7⟩ express service was suspended {{for the duration of the}} project; however, extra 7 service was provided for Mets games and Flushing Meadows Park events. Upon the completion of the project, ⟨7⟩ express service was restored, but express trains bypassed 61st Street-Woodside because the Transit Authority was concerned about passengers transferring between local and express trains at that station.

40|$|The {{major reasons}} for {{deterioration}} and premature <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> on heavy haul track are reviewed with particular {{regard to the}} mechanical and metallurgical factors influencing various damage mechanisms. Damage to the rail is principally a result of wear; rolling contact fatigue; other types of fatigue defects; corrugation; plastic flow and head crushing; martensitic layers, particularly from wheelburns; and batter of joints and welds. Some consideration is also given to wheel damage processes. Conclusions are drawn regarding means <b>of</b> reducing <b>rail</b> (and wheel) damage on existing systems.

40|$|Several {{different}} kinds of steel are used for railway rails. From simple pearlitic steels for rarely used tracks over premium pearlitic steels for high performance lines to special bainitic, martensitic and austenitic steels for switches and crossings. Most of these steels have been trial and error developed over time in track. The main reasons for <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> are fatigue and wear. For material selection purposes fatigue properties {{must be taken into}} account. Simple fatigue testing methods that allow comparison of different steels are scarce in literature. In this thesis results from low cycle fatigue test of four different steels are compiled and a comparison based on strain energy density is presented. The steels are all used for railway rail application. One is near fully pearlitic steel which is mainly employed in common track. The other three are used for different parts in switches and crossings. It is one carbide free bainitic steel, one high manganese austenitic steel and a martensitic steel. Results show the martensitic and bainitic steel as the superior steels at low strain ranges (< 0. 4 %). At high strain ranges the bainitc steel fails to perform due to crack sensitivity and the martensitic and the pearlitic steels are superior. The austenitic steel can not readily be compared to the other steels through low cycle fatigue tests because of its unique hardening property. The comparison of strain energy densities is a viable way to compare standard steels...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{continuous}} increase of axle loads, tonnage, train speed, and train length which has increased both the productivity in the rail sector and the risk of rail breaks and derailments. Rail operating risks have been increasing due to the increased number of axle passes, sharper curves, wear-out of rails and wheels, inadequate rail-wheel grinding and poor lubrication and maintenance. Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear are significant problems for railway companies. In 2000, the Hatfield accident in the UK killed 4 people, injured 34 people and led to the cost of £ 733 million (AUD$ 1. 73 billion) for repairs and compensation. In 1977, the Granville train disaster in Australia killed 83 people and injured 213 people. These accidents were related to rolling contact fatigue, wear and poor maintenance. Studies on rail wear and lubrication, rolling contact fatigue and inspection and rail grinding analyse and assess the asset condition to take corrective and preventive measures for maintaining reliability and safety of rail track. Such measures can reduce the operational risks and the costs by early detection and prevention of rail failures, rail breaks and derailments. Studies have so far been carried out in isolation and have failed to provide a practical solution to a complex problem such as rail-wheel wearfatigue-lubrication-grinding-inspection for cost effective maintenance decisions. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop integrated economic models to predict expected total cost and operational risks and to make informed decisions on rail track maintenance. The major challenges to rail infrastructure and rolling stock operators are to: 1. keep rolling contact fatigue and rail-wheel wear under controllable limits, 2. strike a balance between rail grinding and rail lubrication, and 3. take commercial decisions on grinding intervals, inspection intervals, lubrication placements, preventive maintenance and rail replacements. This research addresses the development and analysis of an integrated model for assessment of operational risks in rail track. Most significantly, it deals with problems associated with higher axle loads; wear; rolling contact fatigue; rail defects leading to early rail replacements; and rail breaks and derailments. The contribution of this research includes the development of: failure models with non-homogenous Poisson process and estimation of parameters. economic models and analysis of costs due to grinding, risks, downtime, inspection and <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> for 23, 12, 18 and 9 Million Gross Tonnes (MGT) of traffic through curve radius 0 - 300, 300 - 450, 450 - 600 and 600 - 800 m; and application of results from this investigation to maintenance and replacement decisions of rails. Cost savings per meter per year are: * 4. 58 % with 12 MGT intervals compared to 23 MGT intervals for 0 - 300 m * 9. 63 % with 12 MGT intervals compared to 23 MGT intervals for 300 - 450 m * 15. 80 % with 12 MGT intervals compared to 23 MGT intervals for 450 - 600 m * 12. 29 % with 12 MGT intervals compared to 23 MGT intervals for 600 - 800 m. a lubrication model for optimal lubrication strategies. It includes modelling and economic analysis of rail wear, rail-wheel lubrication for various types of lubricators. Cost effectiveness of the lubricator is modelled, considering the number of curves and the total length of curves it lubricates. Cost saving per lubricator per year for the same curve length and under the same curve radius is: * 17 % for solar wayside lubricators compared to standard wayside lubricators. simulation model for analysis of lubrication effectiveness. Cost savings per meter per year for: * 12 MGT grinding interval is 3 times for 0 - 450 m and 2 times for 450 - 600 m curve radius with lubrication compared to without lubrication. * 23 MGT grinding interval is 7 times for 0 - 450 m and 4 times for 450 - 600 m curve radius with lubrication compared to without lubrication. a relative performance model, total curve and segment model. an inspection model for cost effective rail inspection intervals. Cost savings per year for same track length, curves and MGT of traffic: * 27 % of total maintenance costs with two inspections, compared to one inspection considering risk due to rail breaks and derailments. a risk priority number by combining probability of occurrence, probability of detection and consequences due to rail defects, rail breaks and derailments. integrated model combining decisions on grinding interval, lubrication strategies, inspection intervals, rectification strategies and <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails.</b> Cost saving per meter per year for 12 MGT is: * 5. 41 % of total maintenance costs with two inspections, compared to one inspection considering risk due to rail breaks and derailments. * 45. 06 % of total maintenance costs with lubrication for two inspections, compared to without lubrication. Cost saving per meter per year for 23 MGT is: * 5. 61 % of total maintenance costs with two inspections, compared to one inspection considering risk due to rail breaks and derailments. * 68. 68 % of total maintenance costs with lubrication for two inspections, per year compared to no lubrication.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a condition-based treatment methodology for a type <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> surface defect called squat.

Models including the effects of maintenance to treat squats, via either grinding or <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> are also described. A railway track may contain a huge number of squats distributed in the rail surface with different levels of severity. This paper proposes to aggregate the local squat interval models into track-level performance indicators including the number and density of squats per track partition. To facilitate the analysis of the overall condition, a single fuzzy global performance indicator per track partition is proposed based on a fuzzy expert system that combines all the scenarios and predictions over time. The proposed methodology relies on the early detection of squats using axle box acceleration measurements. Real-life measurements from the Meppel-Leeuwarden track in the Dutch railway network are used to show the benefits of the proposed methodology. The use of robust and predictive fuzzy performance indicators facilitates the visualization of the track health condition and eases the maintenance decision process. </p...|$|R
