40|$|<b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>Macaw</b> (Ara chloroptera) and Scarlet Macaw (Ara macao) {{belong to}} the most bred big parrots in our country. They are {{resistant}} species, however, in breeding they can suffer from different illnesses. The aim of this work was {{to deal with the}} existing knowledge of their veterinary problems. The work is divided into several main parts according to the qualities of illnesses. There are infectious and invasive diseases, genetic disorders, tumoral diseases or veterinary problems caused by environmental impact. In the last but one part different injuries of these birds are mentioned and the last part contains health problems of digestion, respiration or psyche. Finally, basic aspects of the health problems in the breeding of these species are analysed...|$|E
2500|$|Lesser known are {{a number}} of {{ecotourism}} sites. [...] One of the most recent ecotourism parks to be created include the “Ecoparque los Aluxes” just outside the city of Palenque. It is a conservation center with facilities to rescue wildlife. It also has natural enclosures containing species such as jaguars, ocelots, bobcats, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws,</b> spider monkeys, parrots, turtles and various bird species. The facility has relations with other similar ecotourism parks such as Xcaret Park. One of the institution’s goals is to release fifty macaws per year into the surrounding Palenque National Park. The Palenque National Park surrounds the archeological site of the same name and includes dense tropical rainforest and streams with blue waters. Together, they have been classified as a World Heritage Site. Near the park are two major waterfalls called Agua Azul and Misol Há. The park contains hiking paths to see the various areas of vegetations along with streams and small waterfalls. The rainforest contains numerous birds and howler monkeys.|$|R
40|$|Mammal survey: This study aims {{to monitor}} the long term changes that occur in mammal populations after the {{cessation}} of hunting activity. 2006 was the fourth consecutive year of data collection along line transects. Populations recorded this year were compared to levels in 2003. The spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth chamek) was the only species to have shown a statistically significant increase in population abundance. This species {{has been the most}} severely affected by hunting activities in adjacent river systems (the lower part of River Tambopata) where over hunting has caused the species to become locally extinct. For other hunted species, it may be that it is too soon in the study to see significant increases and that future studies will reveal a clearer trends. Recommendations for wildlife protection in the River Las Piedras are made. Macaw & parrot survey: Results are presented here on the impacts of boat traffic on <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> at two study sites in south eastern Peru, for two time periods. More activity was seen at the more remote site compared to the site located closer to the region’s principal town. Both clay licks showed peaks in use and numbers of birds {{in the vicinity of the}} clay licks for the months of January and February (wet season), compared to June, July, August (the middle of the dry season). Red <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> showed less inclination to flush at the site where boat traffic is not associated with danger even though boat traffic was higher, while a...|$|R

50|$|The diagram to {{the right}} shows the bit error (shown in blue text) and the bad parity created (shown in red text) in the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> circles. The bit error can be {{detected}} by computing the parity of the <b>red,</b> <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> blue circles. If a bad parity is detected then the data bit that overlaps only the bad parity circles is the bit with the error. In the above example, the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> circles have bad parity so the bit corresponding to the intersection of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> but not blue indicates the errored bit.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, lane {{control signals}} are used on many toll plazas to {{indicate}} the open/closed status of toll lanes.

The reason for discouraging the use of circular <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> signals for indicating the open and closed status of toll lanes is due to their use being contrary to their traditional definitions of stop and go.|$|R
