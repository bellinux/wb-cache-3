5000|$|Resource {{leveling}} is {{also useful}} {{in the world of}} maintenance management. Many organizations have maintenance backlogs. These backlogs consist of work orders. In a [...] "planned state" [...] these work orders have estimates such as 2 electricians for 8 hours. These work orders have other attributes such as <b>report</b> <b>date,</b> priority, asset operational requirements, and safety concerns. These same organizations have a need to create weekly schedules. Resource-leveling can take the [...] "work demand" [...] and balance it against the resource pool availability for the given week. The goal is to create this weekly schedule in advance of performing the work. Without resource-leveling the organization (planner, scheduler, supervisor) is most likely performing subjective selection. For the most part, when it comes to maintenance scheduling, there is less, if any, task interdependence, and therefore less need to calculate critical path and total float.|$|E

5000|$|The {{government}} {{had planned to}} revalue all properties in England in 2007 (the first revaluations since 1993) but, in September 2005, {{it was announced that}} the revaluation in England would be postponed until [...] "after the next election".

In Wales, tax bills based on the property revaluations done using 2003 prices were issued in 2005. Because of the surge in house prices over the late 1990s and early 2000s, {{more than a third of}} properties in Wales found themselves in a band higher than under the 1991 valuation. Some properties were moved up three or even four bands with consequent large increases in the amount of council tax demanded. Some properties were moved into new Band I at the top of the price range. Only 8% of properties were moved down in bands.|$|E

5000|$|All {{regulated}} {{financial institutions}} in the United States are required to file periodic financial and other information with their respective regulators and other parties. For banks in the U.S., {{one of the key}} reports required to be filed is the quarterly Consolidated Report of Condition and Income, generally referred to as the call report or RC report. Specifically, every National Bank, State Member Bank and insured Nonmember Bank is required by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to file a call report as of the close of business {{on the last day of}} each calendar quarter, i.e. the <b>report</b> <b>date.</b> The specific reporting requirements depend upon the size of the bank and whether or not it has any foreign offices. [...] Call reports are due no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Revisions may be made without prejudice up to 30 days after the initial filing period. Form FFIEC 031 is used for banks with both domestic (U.S.) and foreign (non-U.S.) offices; Form FFIEC 041 is for banks with domestic (U.S.) offices only.|$|E
