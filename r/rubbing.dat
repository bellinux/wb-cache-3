50|$|Pericardial {{friction}} <b>rub</b> {{is one of}} several, similar sounds. A {{differential diagnosis}} may be possible, or not, depending upon the number of components that are audible. Pericardial friction <b>rub</b> may have one, two, or three audible components, whereas the similar pleural friction <b>rub</b> ordinarily has two audible components. One- and two-component <b>rubs</b> are ambiguous. A three-component <b>rub</b> distinguishes a pericardial <b>rub</b> and indicates the presence of pericarditis. Also, a pleural <b>rub</b> can only be heard during inspiration and expiration, whereas, the pericardial <b>rub</b> can be heard even after cessation of breathing. Pleural <b>rub</b> creates pain mostly on the lateral part of the chest wall, whereas pain due to pericardial <b>rub</b> is always central in location.

40|$|The rubella virus (<b>RUB)</b> {{capsid protein}} (C) is a {{multifunctional}} phosphoprotein with roles beyond encapsidation. It {{is able to}} rescue a large lethal deletion of the Q domain in the P 150 replicase gene at a step in replication before detectable viral RNA synthesis, indicating a common function shared by <b>RUB</b> C and the Q domain. The goal of this dissertation was to use constructs containing the N-terminal 88 amino acids of <b>RUB</b> C, the region previously defined as the minimal region required for the rescue of Q domain mutants, to elucidate the function of <b>RUB</b> C in Q domain rescue and viral RNA synthesis. In the first specific aim, the rescue function of 1 - 88 <b>RUB</b> C {{and the importance of}} an arginine-rich cluster, R 2, within 1 - 88 <b>RUB</b> C for rescue were confirmed. Rescue was not correlated with intracellular localization or phosphorylation status of <b>RUB</b> C. In the second specific aim, the involvement of <b>RUB</b> C in early events post-transfection with <b>RUB</b> RNA was analyzed. <b>RUB</b> C specifically protected <b>RUB</b> transcripts early post-transfection and protection required R 2. However, it was concluded the protection observed was due to the encapsidation function of <b>RUB</b> C and not related to Q domain rescue. No differences in the translation of the <b>RUB</b> nonstructural proteins in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>RUB</b> C were observed. Interactions of <b>RUB</b> C with host cell proteins were analyzed. Although the interaction of <b>RUB</b> C with cellular p 32 required the R 2 cluster, both wild type (does not require <b>RUB</b> C for replication) and RQQ (requires <b>RUB</b> C for replication) Q domain bound p 32, indicating interaction with this binding partner is not the basis of rescue. Using a human protein array phosphatidylinositol transfer protein alpha isoform (PITPα) was found to interact with <b>RUB</b> C but not its R 2 mutant. However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that this protein binds both forms of <b>RUB</b> C. Although the mechanism behind the rescue of the <b>RUB</b> P 150 Q domain by <b>RUB</b> C remains unknown, we propose a model that <b>RUB</b> C plays a role in generation of the virus replication complex in infected cells...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from <b>rubbing</b> glass, the other from <b>rubbing</b> resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{magnesium}} alloy sheets have poor plasticity and formability {{due to their}} strong (0002) basal texture. In this paper a new method, repeatedly unidirectional bending (<b>RUB),</b> was used to improve formability of the {{magnesium alloy}} sheets. The samples were deformed repeatedly by the unidirectional bending at room temperature and annealed. Firstly, <b>RUB</b> route {{which is the most}} infection to formability was investigated. There were two <b>RUB</b> route, single surface <b>RUB</b> and reserve surface <b>RUB.</b> The result showed that better formability can be obtained by the reserve surface <b>RUB.</b> Focused on the development of formability of magnesium alloy sheet, the technological parameters, such as <b>RUB</b> passes, radius of support, annealing temperature and holding time, were determined by orthogonal experiment,and hence the optimal <b>RUB</b> process was acquired.

After <b>RUB,</b> (0002) basal textural component of cold rolled magnesium alloy sheet was weakened and σb, σ 0. 2 decreased obviously.

5|$|When resting, lion {{socialisation}} occurs {{through a}} number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head <b>rubbing</b> and social licking, which have been compared with grooming in primates. Head <b>rubbing</b> – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting, as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{fatigue failure}} of {{compressor}} wheel <b>rub</b> {{is one of}} important failure modes of turbocharger for vehicle application. Because the operating state of turbocharger in the life cycle changes as the work condition of diesel engine changes, the compressor wheel <b>rub</b> of turbocharger is applied by the variable stress which can causes the fatigue failure. In this paper, the effect of centrifugal load, thermal load and aerodynamic load on the stress of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> is studied, and then the fatigue stress spectrum of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> is developed based on the endurance test profile of vehicle engine. In order to research the fatigue strength of compressor wheel <b>rub,</b> the fatigue specimen is designed {{and the relationship between}} the stress and fatigue life of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> is built. Then, utilizing the linear Miner cumulative damage rule and the first-order reliability method, the reliability model of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> with fatigue failure mode is derived, and the rule that the reliability of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> changes with life is studied. Based on the reliability model of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> with fatigue failure mode developed, the method for determining the reliable fatigue life of compressor <b>rub</b> of turbocharger is proposed. The result shows that with the method developed in this paper the fatigue life of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> for the given reliability can be predicted reasonably, and the reliability of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> can also be calculated for the given fatigue life...|$|R

The effects of reducing protein levels for two <b>Rub</b> proteins, <b>RUB</b> 1 and <b>RUB</b> 2, were characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. T-DNA insertional null lines homozygous at a single RUB-encoding locus were analyzed and found to have a wild-type phenotype. A double mutant was never recovered. More than one-quarter of the progeny from the self-fertilization of plants with a single functional RUB-encoding gene died as embryos at the two-cell stage. Outcrosses demonstrated reduced inheritance of the null allele from both the male and female parent. Hemigglutinin-tagged forms of <b>RUB</b> 1 and <b>RUB</b> 2 conjugate to the same cullin protein, CUL 1, and produce the same conjugation pattern.
