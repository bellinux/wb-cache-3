50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that because Wake-on-LAN is built upon broadcast technology {{it can only be}} used within the current network subnet. While this is generally the case, there are some exceptions, and Wake-on-LAN can operate across any network in practice, given appropriate configuration and hardware, including <b>remote</b> <b>wake-up</b> across the Internet.|$|E

The module supports USB suspend, resume and <b>remote</b> <b>wake-up</b> operations {{and can be}} configured for up to eight input and eight output endpoints. The module includes an integrated physical interface (PHY); a phase-locked loop (PLL) for USB clock generation; and a flexible power-supply system enabling bus-powered and self-powered devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{message is}} usually {{sent to the}} target {{computer}} by a program executed on a device connected to the same local area network, such as a smartphone. It is also possible to initiate the message from another network by using subnet directed broadcasts or a WOL gateway service. Equivalent terms include wake on WAN, <b>remote</b> <b>wake-up,</b> power on by LAN, power up by LAN, resume by LAN, resume on LAN and wake up on LAN. If the computer being awakened is communicating via Wi-Fi, a supplementary standard called Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN) must be employed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Intelligent environments (IE) {{leverage}} {{embedded processing}} and wireless communication to assist users {{in a variety}} of ways. Applications rely on low power consumption for longer lifetimes, though different applications require different Qualityof-Service (QoS) requirements from the MAC layer. Until now, low power has come at the cost of other QoS parameters such as latency or packet loss. This paper presents WoR-MAC, a wireless MAC protocol which allows pre-existing protocols to be combined with <b>remote</b> multi-node <b>wake-ups.</b> The protocols are embedded into Wake-on-Radio (WoR) frames, allowing nodes to sleep during periods of low activity and be woken asynchronously with a single short RF signal. After waking, nodes begin communication using the embedded MAC protocol. Once the nodes have been woken, they maintain the QoS of the original MAC, with greatly reduced power consumption. The results indicate that WoR-MAC maintains packet loss characteristics of CSMA-CA and TDMA, as well as latency after accounting for the duty cycle and collaborative parameter estimation, while reducing power consumption by up to 49 %, very close to the lower bound given by the duty-cycle.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present EnergySave, a smart {{energy-saving}} system that, by leveraging the consolidated WoL (Wake on LAN) technology, allows the <b>remote</b> <b>wake-up</b> of PCs from a centralized management server, providing easy and secure power management capabilities for local or remote IP-based networks of personal computers (PCs). We also present a lightweight web-based platform implementing the remote management interface as less intrusively as possible. Finally, we model the mathematical saving functions {{to be used}} in order to evaluate through simulation the amount of potential energy savings, and hence the whole framework effectiveness, both in the general case and in a real case scenario. Results show that significant savings are achievable provided that the hardware supports the Wake-on-LAN specifications and that proper configuration of the Web server is set-up, allowing the WoL magic packet to travel to the destination hosts and wake them up only when they are really needed.

40|$|The TJA 1041 {{provides}} an advanced interface between the protocol controller {{and the physical}} bus in a Controller Area Network (CAN) node. The TJA 1041 is primarily intended for automotive high-speed CAN applications (up to 1 Mbit/s). The transceiver provides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential receive capability to the CAN controller. The TJA 1041 is fully compatible to the ISO 11898 standard, and offers excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance, very low power consumption, and passive behavior when supply voltage is off. The advanced features include: • Low-power management, supporting local and <b>remote</b> <b>wake-up</b> with wake-up source recognition and the capability to control the power supply {{in the rest of}} the node • Several protection and diagnosis functions including short circuits of the bus lines and first battery connection • Automatic adaptation of the I/O-levels, in line with the supply voltage of the controller 2. 1 Optimized for in-vehicle high speed communication ■ Fully compatible with the ISO 11898 standar...|$|E
40|$|In the {{downlink}} of {{a wireless}} LAN, power-save mode {{is a typical}} method to reduce power consumption. However, it usually causes large delay. Recently, <b>remote</b> <b>wake-up</b> control via a low-power wake-up radio (WuR) has been introduced to activate a node to instantly receive packets from an access point (AP). But link quality is not taken into account and protocol overhead of wake-up per node is relatively large. To solve these problems, in this paper, a broadcast-based wake-up control framework is proposed, and a low-power WuR is used to receive traffic indication map from an AP, monitor link quality, and perform carrier sense. Among the nodes which have packets buffered at the AP, only those whose SNR is above a threshold will be activated, contending via a proper contention window to receive packets from the AP. Optimal SNR threshold, deduced by theoretical analysis, helps to reduce transmission collisions and false wake-ups (caused by wake-up latency) and improve transmission rate. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed method (i) effectively reduces power consumption of nodes compared with other methods, (ii) has less delay than power-save mode in times of light traffic, and (iii) achieves higher throughput than other methods in the saturation state...|$|E
40|$|The TJA 1145 is a {{high-speed}} CAN transceiver that provides an interface between a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller {{and the physical}} two-wire CAN bus. The transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the automotive industry, providing differential transmit and receive capability to (a microcontroller with) a CAN protocol controller. The TJA 1145 features very low power consumption in Standby and Sleep modes and supports ISO 11898 - 6 compliant CAN Partial Networking {{by means of a}} selective wake-up function. A dedicated implementation of the partial networking function has been embedded into the TJA 1145 /FD variants TJA 1145 T/FD and TJA 1145 TK/FD (see Section 6. 3. 1 for further details on CAN FD). This function is called ‘FD-passive ’ and is the ability to ignore CAN FD frames while waiting for a valid wake-up frame in Sleep/Standby mode. This additional feature of partial networking is the perfect fit for networks that support both CAN FD and standard CAN 2. 0 communications. It allows normal CAN controllers that do not need to communicate CAN FD messages to remain in partial networking Sleep/Standby mode during CAN FD communication without generating bus errors. Advanced power management regulates the supply throughout the node and supports local and <b>remote</b> <b>wake-up</b> functionality. I/O levels are automatically adjusted to the I/O levels of the controller, allowing the TJA 1145 to interface directly with 3. 3 V to 5 V microcontrollers. An SPI interface is provided for transceiver control and for retrieving status information. Bus connections are truly floating when power is off. These features make the TJA 1145 the ideal choice for high-speed CAN networks containing nodes that are always connected to the battery supply line but, in order to minimize current consumption, are only active when required by the application. 2.
