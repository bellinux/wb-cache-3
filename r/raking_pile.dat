40|$|Pile {{foundation}} {{has been widely}} used in supporting various structures such as bridges and tall buildings in Taiwan. With the development of mountainous areas, pile {{foundation has}} been used to mitigate slope movement. <b>Raked</b> <b>piles</b> are commonly used in group piles subjected to lateral forces. In this study, we use the FLAC 3 D program to analyze the mechanical response of a <b>raked</b> <b>pile</b> subjected to lateral soil movement. In order to verify the correction of the FLAC 3 D simulation, we compare our findings with those from a published case study. The analysis of a single pile and a one row-pile in different dip angles subjected to lateral soil movement is modeled. Results of the analysis show that under the conditions of lateral slope movement, a <b>raked</b> <b>pile</b> causes the pile’s lateral displacement and bending movement to increase. Use of a row <b>raked</b> <b>pile</b> can reduce the lateral displacement of the pile. Further study is required to evaluate the behavior of <b>raked</b> <b>piles</b> when subjected to lateral slope movement. 樁基礎在台灣已經廣泛的使用於支承各種橋梁與高樓等重要結構物，而在現今隨著經濟發展，用地逐漸發展至山坡地時，基樁也逐漸用於邊坡的整治工程，作為阻止或減緩邊坡滑動的工法之一。而在承受側向荷載的群樁中，加入斜樁是常見的。本文使用FLAC 3 D 程式，探討斜樁在承受土壤側向滑動的行為分析。首先使用前人模型試驗案例，對FLAC 3 D 模擬進行驗證，而後分別對單樁與排樁在不同傾角的情形下分析其受力行為，並針對土層內有軟弱層進行模擬。模擬結果顯示，在土壤軟弱層側向滑動的條件下，樁身傾斜將使樁身側向位移與彎矩增加，軟弱層的存在會放大這些現象，排樁的彎矩也與單樁類似。因此，在土壤滑動下，當使用排樁時，傾角不論是- 15 或是 15 度，斜樁都能使樁頂位移稍微減小；而彎矩分布會因斜樁的傾斜而增加。對於使用斜樁來抵抗邊坡滑動之影響則待進一步評估...|$|R

The highest structure in Secunda is the 301 metre high chimney at the Sasol Three plant. The chimney is an Eskom type chimney comprising four 301 metre high refractory brick lined concrete fluor of 4.6 metre diameter each. The windshield is 292 metres high with an internal diameter of 26 metres. The chimney was constructed by Concor {{as part of a}} contract to construct the Sasol Three steamplant with Hochtief. The foundations of the chimney comprised vertical and <b>raked</b> <b>piles.</b> This chimney is one of the tallest free-standing structures in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} under seismic {{loading of}} inclined piles embedded in two idealized soil profiles, a homogeneous and a non-homogenous ""Gibson"" soil, is analysed with 3 D finite elements. Two structures, modeled as single-degree-of-freedom oscillators, are studied: (1) a tall slender superstructure (H st = 12 m) whose crucial loading is the overturning moment, and (2) a short structure (H st = 1 m) whose crucial loading is the shear force. Three simple two-pile group are studied: (a) one comprising a vertical pile {{and a pile}} inclined at 25 °, (b) one consisting of two piles symmetrically inclined at 25 °, and (c) a group of two vertical piles. The influence of key parameters is analysed and non-dimensional diagrams are presented to illustrate the role of <b>raked</b> <b>piles</b> on pile and structure response. It is shown that this role can be beneficial or detrimental depending {{on a number of}} factors, including the slenderness of the superstructure and the type of pile-to-cap connection. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.

50|$|The Statnamic weight packs usually {{consist of}} steel or {{concrete}} rings {{placed over the}} Statnamic silencer. As the device does not rely on gravity to apply loads as in static or drop weight testing {{it can be used}} vertically, horizontally and inclined to test <b>raked</b> <b>piles.</b> The ability to test horizontally has led to the method being used for lateral load testing of piles and simulation of ship impacts on mooring bodies (Middendorp, 2000). In order to improve the flexibility of the device and minimise transportation costs for offshore works a device has also been tested that can apply up to 14MN using water as a reaction mass. This is achieved in an over water pile tests by connected the Statnamic device to a vessel full of water below the water bodies surface (Middendorp, 2000), thus removing the need for heavy reaction weights.|$|R
50|$|Harvesting whole {{flax straw}} and fibre {{can be a}} challenge. Whole flax straw is {{historically}} left {{in the field to}} decay over time or <b>raked</b> into <b>piles</b> and burned as it tends to clog farm equipment and thus makes collection difficult. As a result, harvest and post-harvest labor may be lengthy and time consuming if the straw and fibers are constantly clogging the discs of the plow.|$|R

50|$|The manure {{originally}} {{belonged to}} {{the owners of the}} horses that dropped it. But when the owners abandoned it on the road, it became the property of the man who was first to claim it. The Court found that the best owner after the act of abandonment was the borough of Stamford, Connecticut where the manure was found. In the absence of a claim to the manure by the officials of Stamford, the plaintiff was entitled to it by reason of trover. The plaintiff was entitled to damages because the defendant had committed a conversion. The manure had not {{become a part of the}} real estate, as the defendant had argued. It remained separate and unattached to the land, and hence was not part of the fee of estate. Comparing manure to seaweed and laws in the 19th century having to do with the scraping into piles of natural things of this sort, the court held that 24 hours was a reasonable time for the defendant to wait to take the manure. That by this standard, and the fruits of his labour of <b>raking</b> into <b>piles,</b> the plaintiff was granted a new trial over the issue of damages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Windrowing site preparation, the <b>raking</b> and <b>piling</b> of long rows {{of logging}} debris, has been {{reported}} to displace surface soil, redistribute nutrients, and reduce volume growth of southern pine forests. Many of these studies have reported short-term results, and there are few long-term studies of the effects of windrowing on soil properties and pine growth. A 16. 2 hectare tract on Sacul fine sandy loam (clayey, mixed, thermic Aquic Hapludult) in Jackson Parish in northern Louisiana was windrowed in 1975. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare soil physical and chemical properties from scraped areas between windrows with that from windrow pile soils, 25 years after windrowing. Surface, subsurface, and subsoil horizons were sampled from 13 soil profiles within inter-row (scraped) and windrow (piled) positions. Thickness of the 0, A, and E horizons, as well as depth to the Bt horizon, were measured in these profiles. Comparisons were made on the following properties for each horizon on each of the two site positions: organic matter, pH, available phosphorus, and exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. Bulk density was measured for windrow and inter-row position surface and subsurface soils. Pore space and air-filled volume were calculated using bulk density and water content...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) {{is promoted}} as a cropping {{system that has}} potential to alleviate poor crop yields in smallholder farming while protecting the environment. It involves maintenance of permanent soil cover, diverse crop rotations and/or interactions; and minimum soil disturbance. CA is associated with crop residue management challenges due to low crop biomass yields and crop-livestock interactions in Zimbabwean smallholder farming sector. There is competition on crop residue uses causing challenges in retaining adequate crop residues for full benefits of using residues to be realised. Among the crop residues management options fencing fields reduces the chances of crop residues grazing by free roaming cattle during the dry season. Construction of <b>rakes</b> to <b>pile</b> up crop residues where cattle cannot access has been practiced in some communal areas. Farmers have practised the system of taking the crop residue harvest to homesteads into protected areas to reduce risk of grazing. Farmers may use fences around fields to reduce access into fields. However, all these management options require an investment from the farmers who are resource constrained. Farmers may use non-crop residues such as thatch grass and reduce competition for crop residue use where farmers feed them to livestock during the dry season...|$|R

60|$|Without more ado Glenn settled to brisk action, {{every move}} of which Carley watched with keen eyes. The usurping of a woman's {{province}} {{by a man}} was always an amusing thing. But for Glenn Kilbourne--what more would it be? He evidently knew what he wanted, for every movement was quick, decisive. One after another he placed bags, cans, sacks, pans, utensils on the table. Then he kicked at the roaring fire, settling some of the sticks. He strode outside to return with a bucket of water, a basin, towel, and soap. Then he took down two queer little iron pots with heavy lids. To each pot was attached a wire handle. He removed the lids, then set both the pots right on the fire or in it. Pouring water into the basin, he proceeded to wash his hands. Next he took a large pail, and from a sack he filled it half full of flour. To this he added baking powder and salt. It was instructive for Carley to see him run his skillful fingers all through that flour, as if searching for lumps. After this he knelt before the fire and, lifting {{off one of the}} iron pots with a forked stick, he proceeded to wipe out the inside of the pot and grease it with a piece of fat. His next move was to <b>rake</b> out a <b>pile</b> of the red coals, a feat he performed with the stick, and upon these he placed the pot. Also he removed the other pot from the fire, leaving it, however, quite close.|$|R
