The shareholders in the new company are SBB Cargo (75%) and Hupac (25%), with further partners possible in the future. The aim is to achieve cost leadership in the intermodal segment by optimising resources on selected routes and halving structural costs. The new company’s customers will primarily comprise intermodal operators, who will account for about 80% of the planned total sales of CHF 300 million.|$|E

5000|$|European Rail Shuttle B.V. {{was founded}} in 1994 as {{a joint venture between}} the {{companies}} Sealand Service, P & O Containers, Nedlloyd and NS Cargo. These four companies were aiming to cooperate in order {{to take full advantage of}} the liberalization process in Europe which started the same year. Pretty soon after the start of the joint venture NS Cargo decided to step out being replaced by Mærsk Line joining the three other shipping lines. At the very first beginning European Rail Shuttle started offering container shuttles between Rotterdam and a couple of destinations along the Rhine river in Germany as well as Melzo Terminal in Italy. During the first years of European Rail Shuttle, the company was [...] "only" [...] acting as an intermodal operator whilst traction services were still bought from state owned railway companies. The added value the company offered at that time to its shareholders was based on organizing intermodal shuttle solutions based on gathering enough volumes from its shareholders and taking care about purchasing tractions services from a few suppliers and controlling their performance. In 2002 European Rail Shuttle changed its name into ERS Railways B.V. and the container shuttles were run with locomotives which were leased. With this strategic move ERS Railways positioned itself as a fully independent player by acquiring railway licenses in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. With its shareholders having gained appetite for expansion within the European railway scene ERS Railways became a major shareholder in the company boxXpress.de GmbH which had been launched in 2000 already. In 2007 ERS Railways BV (at time being fully owned by Maersk Line) had leased 17 so called Class 66 diesel locomotives running on the respective long distance corridors. This set-up changed in the years to come as ERS Railways decided to start reducing the number of diesel locomotives and replace them by electric locomotives. Since December 2012 ERS Railways does not use the diesel locomotives for long-distance transports and is ERS Railways running all its long distance trains in the Europe, with electric locomotives only. ERS Railways is one of the first railway companies who have joined the Dutch-based VIVENS electricity consortium which will supply 100% CO2-free electric energy by 2018.
