5|$|Individual {{times to}} finish each stage are totalled to {{determine}} {{the winner of the}} general classification {{at the end of the}} race. The rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day wears the leader's jersey. Since 2010 this has been a red jersey; previously it was gold. Other classifications have been calculated: those still in use are the points classification, in 2010 <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> green jersey; the mountains classification, in 2010 <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> blue dotted jersey; and the combination classification, in 2010 <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> white jersey.|$|E

5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can be <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can {{be composed of}} any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors can be represented by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E

5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> short dashed line. The ball, <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|The 1968 Games also {{marked the}} first time that West Germany and East Germany competed as {{independent}} teams. For the previous three Olympiads (1956–1964), the two NOCs were jointly <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> united German team. The 1972 Summer Olympics, in Munich, featured 121 nations, the highest total yet.|$|E

5|$|A charter {{was granted}} to the Mayor of Faversham, Jurats and Freemen of the Town of Faversham in 1546, and regranted 1685; the town council was {{established}} under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The parliamentary constituency of Faversham was created for the 1885 general election and replaced by the new constituencies of Sittingbourne and Sheppey and Faversham and Mid Kent at the 1997 general election. The town has been <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Member of Parliament from the Conservative Party other than between 1945 and 1970. Since 2015, the constituency's MP has been Conservative Helen Whately.|$|E

5|$|Animal zodiac: The {{earliest}} {{and most}} complete {{version of the}} animal zodiac mentions twelve animals which differ slightly from the modern version (for instance, the Dragon is absent, <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> worm). Each animal matches the Earthly Branches and were written on bamboo slips from Shuihudi, dated to the late 4th century BC, {{as well as from}} Fangmatan, dating to the late 3rd century BC. Before these archaeological finds, the Lunheng written by Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD) during the 1st century provided the earliest transmitted example of a complete duodenary animal cycle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Augusta Raurica and Aventicum {{were also}} the civitates, or capitals, of the non-Roman tribes of the Rauraci and Helvetii, respectively. In that capacity, the magistrates of Aventicum, as duoviri coloniae Helvetiorum, also governed the entire Helvetic population, which had {{the legal status of}} incolae (inhabitants) {{invested}} with the Latin Right. The rights of the Roman coloni, or colonists, were <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> special authority, the curatores colonorum Aventicensum ("Heads of the colonists of Aventicum"). Moreover, the Roman citizens of the entire territory established the cives Romani conventus Helvetici ("Association of Roman citizens in Helvetia").|$|E
