40|$|Process {{design of}} <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> {{involves}} {{the selection of}} the <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine, mould design, production scheduling, cost estimation, and determination of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> parameters. An expert system approach has been rued to derive the process solution for <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> over the past few years.

Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> sintering, microstructure examination, symulation of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Findings: Simulation of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> was preceded by the rheological tests, which made obtaining possible of the data indispensable for modelling, pertaining to the polymer-powder slurry viscosity. The portion of particles reinforcing the composite is usually lower than powder portion in mixtures used for forming and next binding agent degradation and sintering. The big powder portion is often the reason for the high viscosity of the mixture and problems with its forming. However, simulation results revealed that the fabricated polymerpowder mixture may be injected, which was confirmed by carrying out powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> on a typical Arburg <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine using in the industry. Practical implications: Application of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> to manufacturing of high speed steel matrix composites gives the possibility to obtain tool materials with the relative high ductility characteristic of steel and high hardness and wear resistance typical for cemented carbides.

A wide variety of products are manufactured by using these two technologies, which vary greatly in their size, complexity, and application.
