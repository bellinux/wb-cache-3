5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} <b>repair</b> process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for <b>repair</b> of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a <b>repair</b> process implies that the benefit of <b>repair</b> can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a <b>repair</b> process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
30|$|The tendon {{separation}} {{after the}} third phase of 100  cycles of 190  N was 17.4  mm for 4 -strand <b>repairs,</b> 16.6  mm for 6 -strand <b>repairs</b> and 26.6  mm for 8 -strand <b>repairs.</b> Over the four phases of the loading programme {{there was a significant}} difference between the different <b>repairs</b> (p <  0.0001). Four and six strand non-absorbable <b>repairs</b> had significantly less separation than 8 -strand absorbable <b>repairs</b> (p =  0.017 and p =  0.04 respectively). There were no significant differences between the 4 and 6 strand <b>repairs</b> (p =  1).

40|$|Data <b>repairing</b> aims at {{discovering}} and correcting erroneous data in databases. Traditional methods {{relying on}} predefined quality rules {{to detect the}} conflict between data may fail to choose {{the right way to}} fix the detected conflict. Recent efforts turn to use the power of crowd in data <b>repairing,</b> but the crowd power has its own drawbacks such as high human intervention cost and inevitable low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a crowd-aided interactive data <b>repairing</b> method which takes the advantages of both rule-based method and crowd-based method. Particularly, we investigate the interaction between crowd-based <b>repairing</b> and rule-based <b>repairing,</b> and show that by doing crowd-based <b>repairing</b> to a small portion of values, we can greatly improve the <b>repairing</b> quality of the rule-based <b>repairing</b> method. Although we prove that the optimal interaction scheme using the least number of values for crowd-based <b>repairing</b> to maximize the imputation recall is not feasible to be achieved, still, our proposed solution identifies an efficient scheme through investigating the inconsistencies and the dependencies between values in the <b>repairing</b> process. Our empirical study on three data collections demonstrates the high <b>repairing</b> quality of CrowdAidRepair, as well as the efficiency of the generated interaction scheme over baselines...|$|R
40|$|<b>Repairing</b> {{locality}} is an appreciated {{feature for}} distributed storage, {{in which a}} damaged or lost data share can be <b>repaired</b> by accessing a subset of other shares much smaller than is required for decoding the complete data. However for Secret Sharing (SS) schemes, it has been proven theoretically that local <b>repairing</b> {{can not be achieved}} with perfect security for the majority of threshold SS schemes, where all the shares are equally regarded in both secret recovering and share <b>repairing.</b> In this paper we make an attempt on decoupling the two processes to make secure local <b>repairing</b> possible. Dedicated <b>repairing</b> redundancies only for the <b>repairing</b> process are generated, which are random numbers to the original secret. Through this manner a threshold SS scheme with improved <b>repairing</b> locality is achieved on the condition that security of <b>repairing</b> redundancies is ensured, or else our scheme degenerates into a perfect access structure that is equivalent to the best existing schemes can do. To maximize security of the <b>repairing</b> redundancies, a random placement mechanism is also proposed...|$|R
