40|$|The {{accuracy}} in determined energy consumption and runningtime of trains, {{by means of}} computer simulation, is dependent upon the various models used. This thesis aims at developing validated models of <b>running</b> <b>resistance,</b> train and of a generaldriver, all based on full scale testing. A partly new simple methodology for determining <b>running</b> <b>resistance,</b> called by energy coasting method is developed and demonstrated. An error analysis for this methodis performed. <b>Running</b> <b>resistance</b> of high speed train SJ X 2000, conventional loco hauled passenger trains and freight trains is systematically parameterised. Influence of speed, number of axles, axle load, track type, train length,and train configuration is studied. A model {{taking into account the}} ground boundary layer for determining the influence ofmeasured head and tail wind is developed. Different factors and parameters of a train, that are vital for the {{accuracy in}} computed energy consumption and runningtime are identified, analysed and finally synthesized into a train model. Empirical models of the braking and the traction system, including the energy efficiency, are developed for the electrical locomotive of typeSJ Rc 4, without energy regeneration. Driver behaviour is studied for freight trains and a couple of driving describing parametersare proposed. An empirical model of freight train driver behaviour is developed from fullscale testing and observations. A computer program, a simulator, is developed in Matlabcode, making use of the determined runningresistance and the developed models of train and driver. The simulator calculates the energy consumption and running time ofa single train. Comparisons between simulations and corresponding measurements are made. Finally, the influence of driving on energy consumption and running time is studied and demonstrated in some examples. The main conclusions are that: The method developed for determining running resistanceis quite simple and accurate. It can be used on any train andon any track. The <b>running</b> <b>resistance</b> of tested trains includes some interesting knowledge which is partly believed to be new. Mechanical <b>running</b> <b>resistance</b> is less than proportional to the actual axle load. Air drag increases approximately linearly with train length and the effect of measured head and tail wind on the air drag can be calculated if the groundboundary layer is considered. The developed train model, including <b>running</b> <b>resistance,</b> traction, braking etc. is quite accurate, as verified for the investigated trains. The driver model together with the train model insimulations, is verified against measurements and shows good agreement for energy consumption and running time. It is recommended to use a driver model, when calculating energy consumption and running times for trains. Otherwise, the energy consumption will most likely be over-estimated. This has been demonstrated for Swedish ordinary freighttrains. QC 20100526 NR 2014080...|$|R

One of these two publications is devoted to joints with open sections including simple joints and moment resistant joints.

This connection type is not directly covered by Eurocode 3.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Voluntary {{strength}} training methods for rodents {{are necessary to}} investigate the effects of {{strength training}} on cognition and the brain. However, few voluntary methods are available. NEW METHOD: The current study tested functional and muscular effects of two novel voluntary strength training methods, burrowing (digging a substrate out of a tube) and unloaded tower climbing, in male C 57 Bl 6 mice. To compare these two novel methods with existing exercise methods, <b>resistance</b> <b>running</b> and (non-resistance) running were included. Motor coordination, grip strength and muscle fatigue were measured at baseline, halfway through and {{near the end of}} a fourteen week exercise intervention. Endurance was measured by an incremental treadmill test after twelve weeks. RESULTS: Both burrowing and <b>resistance</b> <b>running</b> improved forelimb grip strength as compared to controls. <b>Running</b> and <b>resistance</b> <b>running</b> increased endurance in the treadmill test and improved motor skills as measured by the balance beam test. Post-mortem tissue analyses revealed that <b>running</b> and <b>resistance</b> <b>running</b> induced Soleus muscle hypertrophy and reduced epididymal fat mass. Tower climbing elicited no functional or muscular changes. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: As a voluntary strength exercise method, burrowing avoids the confounding effects of stress and positive reinforcers elicited in forced strength exercise methods. Compared to voluntary <b>resistance</b> <b>running,</b> burrowing likely reduces the contribution of aerobic exercise components. CONCLUSIONS: Burrowing qualifies as a suitable voluntary strength training method in mice.

H2O, O2, Cl2, H2S, HCl, HF, HBr, N2, H2, CH3OH, etc. are relatively mobile in a polymer matrix and lead to measurable effects. In particular in lining and coating applications, the permeation resistance is necessary as permeating species may attack the underlying mechanical layers, such as fiber reinforced plastic or steel. This high permeation resistance to small molecules is a consequence of the free volume occupied by the chlorine atom on the polymer chain.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} is initiated {{with the aim}} to make the tunnel resistance estimations more accurate. Tunnel resistance is measured to calculate running times and energy consumption. From previous studies performed by Norges Statsbaner-NSB, {{it is found that}} the standard methods in Open Track and Viriato 6 simulation tools, used to measure tunnel resistance overestimate its value which leads to higher estimation of running times and energy consumption. But in reality, train experiences less resistance while crossing the tunnels. With the purpose to measure tunnel resistance more accurately, an attempt is made to develop new methodology that can eliminate the overestimation of tunnel resistance thus making the railway system more efficient. In order to establish the methodology of calculating tunnel resistance, train resistance, its types and extent to which these resistances effect train motion inside tunnels are investigated. <b>Running</b> <b>resistance</b> value changes significantly inside the tunnels mainly because of change in aerodynamics. <b>Running</b> <b>resistance</b> depends on three coefficients A, B and C and among these three coefficients, C shows more variations as it depends on aerodynamics inside the tunnel. Therefore, efforts have been made out to measure the new value of coefficient C and tunnel factor is estimated using the new value of this coefficient C. Data for the research work was gathered both from NSB and Stadler. NSB conducted the test runs on NSB Type 73 and 75 while Stadler performed the test runs only on Type 75. On the basis of available data sets, direct and velocity fitting approaches are developed for tunnel resistance calculations. Direct and velocity fitting approaches are compared with each other and also with standard Open Track and Viriato 6 methods based on tunnel factors. Results show that both the methods provide lower tunnel factors than standard values used in Open Track and Viriato 6 thus eliminating the overestimation problem. It is also found from the results that the velocity fitting method has less variations in tunnel factors for same tunnel type and provides better estimation of tunnel resistance than direct method. Therefore, tunnel factors are calculated using velocity fitting approach based on tunnel types and it ranges from 4. 1 to 7. 7 kg/m. Based on the results, it is suggested to use 7. 7 kg/m for single track tunnels with small cross-section, 6. 4 kg/m for double track tunnels with small cross-section and 4. 1 kg/m for double track tunnels with large cross-section to calculate the tunnel resistance more accurately...|$|R

The inclusion of energy consumption (or traction) data is recommended, resulting in more precise estimates. The approach is considered feasible in terms of data storage and transfer requirements, allowing a routinely collection of data from trains in operation. The additional tunnel resistance has been evaluated for a set of 10 tunnels in Norway, giving resistance coefficients ranging from 2. 4 to 16. 0 kg/m for tunnels with an aerodynamic cross section of 87 to 27 m 2 respectively. The comparison to a set of predictions showed that there is a large spread in the predicted additional tunnel resistance. This demonstrates that the choice of prediction method and corresponding coefficients must be taken carefully...|$|R
