50|$|Stripping is simple: Safety on, remove magazine, cock {{and hold}} bolt open, rotate to left, inspect bolt face and chamber, <b>release</b> <b>bolt</b> under control. Then grab butt, press catch on bottom of {{receiver}} with other hand, rotate butt to left 90 degree and pull off. Remove spring, release safety, tip barrel up and pull {{so that the}} trigger bolt slides out. Assemble in reverse. Suggested ranges for use were 25 meters from the hip snap shooting 100 meters using sights.|$|E
50|$|Hammond and May {{tried to}} convert a 1992 Reliant Robin {{into a space}} shuttle. They were given 12 days to build it and help from the United Kingdom Rocketry Association. Eight tons of thrust was {{required}} to launch the Robin—the largest non-commercial rocket launch undertaken in Europe. The Reliant Robin took off; {{everything seemed to be}} working until a <b>release</b> <b>bolt</b> attaching the Robin to the fuel tank failed to detach. The combined result spiraled out of control and crashed on a nearby hillside.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the local {{excitation}} method of vibration test by using mutilayer piezoelectric actuators as input device to specimen {{for the purpose of}} detecting comparatively small damage of steel structural member, and measures change of an vibration characteristics. It is shown that the vibration test by using mutilayer piezoelectric actuator is effective to damage detection of steel structural member. After <b>releasing</b> <b>bolt</b> supports of a steel structural member, the vibration test is carried out, and the validity of damage detection is examined. The analytical software system using genetic algorithm (GA) to evaluate the location and level of <b>released</b> <b>bolts</b> as a model of damage, is examined. And effectiveness of that system is verified by comparing with the experimental results...|$|R
50|$|The Beretta ARX160 modular {{assault rifle}} is only {{available}} for military {{and law enforcement}} use. It is chambered in either 5.56×45mm NATO or 7.62×39mm cartridge. It features a Picatinny rail {{on the top of}} the receiver for mounting various optics, on both sides of the hand guard for mounting various accessories and on the bottom of the handguard for mounting various grips, a quick change barrel, a barrel length of 12- and 16-inch, a folding back-up iron sights, ambidextrous fire/safety selector, magazine <b>release,</b> <b>bolt</b> release and charging handle, case ejector that can eject the empty brass either to the right side or left side by pressing on the case ejection selector with a tip of a 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, and a telescopic folding buttstock that is also adjustable for length of pull. A conversion kit for 7.62×39mm is also available, it requires changing the barrel, bolt, lower receiver assembly and magazine in order to change the caliber. It uses the AK-47 or AKM magazines for the 7.62×39mm configuration and STANAG magazines for the 5.56×45mm NATO configuration.|$|E
40|$|With head {{on each of}} its ends, bolt can be {{disengaged}} {{from its}} blind side. Bolt has conventional hexagonal head on one end and smaller hexagonal head on its threaded end. Since reduced head is smaller than bolt diameter, it does not interfere with insertion of bolt shank in bolthole. However, it can be turned by wrench to <b>release</b> <b>bolt</b> from its blind (threaded) end. Bolt should be tethered on its large-head end {{so that it does}} not drop away from assembly...|$|E

5000|$|Instagram has {{developed}} and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it <b>released</b> <b>Bolt,</b> a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen. It {{was followed by}} the release of Hyperlapse in August, a then-iOS-exclusive app that uses [...] "clever algorithm processing" [...] to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos. Hyperlapse launched on Android and Windows in May 2015. In October 2015, it released Boomerang, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.|$|R
50|$|T91 has a 4-position {{selector}} switch: S - safe, 1 - semi-automatic, 3 - three-round burst, and A - automatic. Like the T65K2, T91 utilizes an M16A2-style front post, rear peephole sight. The rear sight, {{mounted on}} the detachable handle, is adjustable for windage and elevation. Operation of the charging handle, magazine <b>release,</b> and <b>bolt</b> <b>release</b> {{are the same as}} the M16. One notable difference is that the T91 does not have a forward assist, and the brass deflector is not as pronounced.|$|R

50|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AK safety selector, some Vepr-12 shotguns have an ambidextrous safety that can be manipulated from {{either side of the}} receiver.An unusual feature among firearms in the Kalashnikov family, the Vepr-12 sports a last round bolt hold-open mechanism. That is, the bolt locks {{to the rear of the}} receiver after the last round has been ejected. To facilitate rapid reloading of the shotgun, a <b>bolt</b> <b>release</b> lever is located inside the trigger guard, allowing the user to <b>release</b> the <b>bolt</b> without breaking grip.|$|R

50|$|The {{safety is}} {{conveniently}} positioned {{just to the}} right of the bolt handle, and locks the bolt and disengages the sear when applied. By moving the safety catch partially forward you can <b>release</b> the <b>bolt</b> whilst the rifle is still 'safe'.|$|R
50|$|Mass {{production}} {{started in}} July 1966. The first ads showed cameras with <b>release</b> <b>bolting</b> devices and battery test keys. The first {{proved to be}} redundant, since with the lens inserted the camera could not be released anyway. The latter feature was dropped, for reasons of reliability - electrical contacts could easily fail. The voltage of the mercury battery dropped so rapidly {{at the end of}} the battery's life that it would be hard to obtain a wrong exposure. Likewise a switch for the exposure meter was also dropped. The exposure meter was always on, even with the lens inserted. Enclosed in the darkness of the camera bag, practically no current drained from the battery, which therefore remained usable for many years.|$|R

50|$|Like BioShock Infinite, Burial at Sea is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} elements. Using {{a mixture}} of the limited spaces of Rapture in BioShock and BioShock 2 with the expanded environment of Columbia from BioShock Infinite allows for more dynamic combat challenges. Returning from BioShock and BioShock 2, the player may carry more than two weapons at a time, and can collect other weapons and ammunition either from defeated enemies or from random locations around the city. Returning from Infinite is the regenerating shield, while health can be replenished with medical kits or food. Plasmids and EVE replace Vigors and Salts from Infinite. Plasmids grant activated powers such as creating shockwaves, <b>releasing</b> <b>bolts</b> of electricity, and machine/human possession. Plasmids require EVE, the equivalent of magic points for powering their abilities.|$|R
50|$|A glass relocking {{device is}} a piece of glass, usually tempered, placed where it might be {{expected}} to break in a burglary attack. It is attached, usually with wires, to one or more spring-loaded bolts, which are often randomly located. A drill or torch may break the glass, <b>releasing</b> the <b>bolts.</b>|$|R

50|$|Booker gains {{powers and}} {{abilities}} through Vigors, Gears, and Infusions, all scattered around Columbia. Vigors, {{the equivalent of}} BioShocks Plasmids, grant activated powers such as creating shockwaves, <b>releasing</b> <b>bolts</b> of electricity, and machine/human possession. Vigors require Salt, the equivalent of magic points or BioShocks EVE, for powering their abilities. Salts can be found throughout Columbia, and are also granted upon death. Wearing Gears grant passive abilities that can improve the player's strength or damage resistance, similar in function to BioShocks Tonics. Each piece of Gear attaches to one of four specific slots: Hats, Shirts, Boots, and Pants. Only one piece of Gear can be affixed to a slot at a time; any extra Gear is stored in the player's inventory. Infusions grant the ability to permanently boost the player's health, Salts or shield meter by one stat; they also fully restore whatever is being boosted.|$|R

5000|$|... "The AR-15/M16-series rifles are {{considered}} the finest human-engineered assault rifles in the world." [...] The M16 is ergonomically superior to the AK-47 in most respects. It is much easier and faster to change magazines and get the M16 back into action than with the AK-47. [...] This is due to several factors, such as perfectly located magazine <b>release</b> and <b>bolt</b> <b>release</b> buttons, a flared magazine well for fast magazine insertions, {{and the ability to}} simply insert the magazine into the M16 in a conventional manner, rather than the [...] "rock and lock" [...] method required with the AK-47. In addition, it is easier for an M16 user to keep the strong hand on the pistol-grip and sights on target while performing magazine changes than with the AK-47.|$|R

50|$|LR-300MLs have {{flat top}} {{receivers}} with Picatinny rails, {{allowing them to}} be used with multiple types of sighting systems. The trigger, along with the charging handle, forward assist, magazine <b>release</b> and <b>bolt</b> hold <b>release</b> are identical to those of the AR-15. The barrel has a 1:9 twist ratio, is chrome lined, and the muzzle is fitted with a Phantom flash suppressor.|$|R
5000|$|Before his death, Gilbert {{left out}} two songs {{originally}} {{intended for the}} rock opera. [...] "Miss Broadway" [...] was released on Live at the Troubadour, and [...] "The Best of Everything" [...] was <b>released</b> on <b>Bolts</b> in 2009. Both songs allude to the way Sheryl Crow propelled her career over his back, which might have distracted from the main story of Johnny Virgil.|$|R
5000|$|The MG 15 fires {{from an open}} bolt, {{meaning that}} the bolt stays back when the gun is ready to fire, and also making it nearly {{impossible}} for [...] "through the propeller" [...] synchronized forward firing on a fuselage mount. Pulling the trigger <b>releases</b> the <b>bolt</b> and allows it to go forward, stripping a round from the magazine. The bolt continues pushing the round into the chamber and locks up when the lockring rotates and locks the bolt and barrel extension together. At this point the trip lever releases the firing pin and the gun fires. Recoil pushes the barrel, lock and bolt backwards until the lockring hits a cam that rotates it unlocking the bolt and barrel. Inertia carries the bolt backwards until {{the base of the}} fired case hits the ejector flinging the empty out of the receiver. If the trigger is held down the cycle will continue. If the trigger is <b>released</b> the <b>bolt</b> will remain in the rearward position.|$|R
50|$|At RISD he met fellow {{musician}} Brian Gibson {{and soon}} became the vocalist {{in the band}} Lightning Bolt.
