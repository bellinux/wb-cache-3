5|$|In February 1846 Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster {{that she}} was {{thinking}} of becoming a public speaker, but not until the following summer did a storm of controversy over Foster’s speaking at Oberlin decide the matter for her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women’s rights among the students, especially of woman’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men’s and women’s literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin’s August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} two years, Jinnah worked to build support among Muslims for the League. He secured the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> for the Muslim-led Bengali and Punjabi provincial {{government}}s in the central government in New Delhi ("the centre"). He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (⅛ of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League {{along the lines of}} the Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed. By December 1939, Liaquat estimated that the League had three million two-anna members.|$|E

The {{congress}} is the highest organ of the party, and is stipulated to be held every four years. 3,062 delegates represented the party's membership; 117 foreign delegates attended the congress, without the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> The congress saw the reappointment of Kim Il-sung as WPK General Secretary and the Presidium of the Politburo established as the highest organ of the party between congresses.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the council}} had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> freely, and {{although}} there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state, {{it is clear that the}} king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander the Great acted as prosecutor in the trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his father's assassination plot (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire, but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the council}} had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their minds freely, and {{although}} {{there is no evidence that}} they voted on affairs of state or that the king was even obligated to implement their ideas, it is clear that he was at least occasionally pressured to do so. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander III acted as prosecutor in the trial and ultimate conviction of three alleged conspirators in the plot to assassinate Philip II (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld, constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire; however, it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends. For instance, when Perdiccas had Philip II's daughter Cynane murdered to prevent her own daughter Eurydice II of Macedon from marrying Philip III of Macedon, the army revolted and ensured that the marriage took place.|$|E

40|$|The dual {{principles}} of promoting {{the marketplace of}} ideas and protecting individual autonomy lie {{at the core of}} the First Amendment. When the government assumes an affirmative role by opening opportunities for public speech, it places individuals 2 ̆ 7 negative liberties, such as the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> at risk. This conflict cannot be avoided by analyzing compelled speech outside of the First Amendment; the autonomy promised by the Bill of Rights and repeatedly affirmed by Supreme Court jurisprudence protects the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Scholars, jurists, and practitioners therefore should pay close attention <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> when the government pursues affirmative policies of widening access. In so doing the government may not ignore the negative speech rights of private citizens...|$|R

25|$|On the {{initiative}} of the municipality of Linkebeek, the Constitutional Court of Belgium was asked for an opinion on the constitutionality of article 23 {{of the law of}} 18 July 1966 that stipulates that the internal language of administration in the rim municipalities has to be Dutch. In its ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998, the Court ruled this was not in violation with articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution of Belgium and that the mayor and aldermen do indeed not have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in another language than Dutch during council meetings. The Court further specified that the language facilities do not alter the principle of Dutch unilingualism of the concerned municipalities and that the Constitution guarantees the primacy of Dutch.|$|E
25|$|The movement, {{like others}} in South Africa, has {{suffered}} sustained illegal harassment {{from the state}} {{that has resulted in}} more than 200 arrests of Abahlali members in the first last three years of its existence and repeated police brutality in people's homes, in the streets and in detention. On a number of occasions, the police used live ammunition, armoured vehicles and helicopters in their attacks on unarmed shack dwellers. In 2006 the local city manager, Mike Sutcliffe, unlawfully implemented a complete ban on Abahlali's right to march which was eventually overturned in court. Abahlali have been violently prevented from accepting invitations to appear on television and radio debates by the local police. The Freedom of Expression Institute has issued a number of statements in strong support of Abahlali's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> out and to organise protests. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and a group of prominent church leaders have also issued public statements against police violence, as has Bishop Rubin Philip in his individual capacity, and in support of the right of the movement to publicly express dissent.|$|E
25|$|The Ainu have {{historically}} suffered from {{economic and social}} discrimination throughout Japan that continues to this day. The Japanese Government {{as well as people}} since contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people. The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaido into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands. The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather. These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today. This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaido in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had a 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaido as a whole. The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap. The Japanese government will provide ¥7 million beginning in 2015, to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter.|$|E
