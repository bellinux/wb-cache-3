5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a top-level domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent <b>registrant</b> (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior <b>registrant</b> (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the domain name itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E
5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior <b>registrant</b> to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The {{proceeding}} in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior <b>registrant</b> may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} {{for this type}} of registration is set forth in the Lanham Act, which permits concurrent use registration where the concurrent use applicant made a good-faith adoption of the mark prior to the <b>registrant</b> filing an application for registration. Such registrations are most commonly achieved by agreement of the parties involved, although the USPTO must still determine that no confusion will be caused.|$|E

25|$|A DOI {{is a type}} of Handle System handle, {{which takes}} the form of a {{character}} string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash. The prefix identifies the <b>registrant</b> of the identifier, and the suffix is chosen by the <b>registrant</b> and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is a series of at least 4 numbers greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants. The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.|$|E

25|$|From 1965 to 1973, {{very few}} {{men in the}} US were convicted of burning their draft cards. Some 25,000 others went unpunished. Before 1965, the act of burning a draft card was already {{prohibited}} by US statuteâ€”the <b>registrant</b> was required to carry the card at all times, and any destruction of it was thus against the law. Also, it was entirely possible {{for a young man}} to destroy his draft card and still answer his country's call to service by appearing at an induction center and serving in the military. And it was possible for a <b>registrant</b> to faithfully keep his card on his person but fail to appear when called. The draft card was not {{an essential part of the}} government's ability to draft men into the military. Thus draft-card burning was an act of war resistance more than it was draft resistance.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the extent of}} socioeconomic inequalities in low birth weight. To assess the relative benefits of measuring socioeconomic status by individual occupation, socioeconomic deprivation status of area of residence, or both, for describing inequalities and targeting resources. DESIGN: Analysis of birth registrations by registration status: joint compared with sole <b>registrants</b> ("lone mothers"), routinely recorded parental occupation (father's for joint <b>registrants),</b> and census derived enumeration district (ED) deprivation. SETTING: England and Wales, 1986 - 92. SUBJECTS: 471, 411 births with coded parental occupation (random 10 % sample) and birth weight. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of low birth weight (< 2500 g) RESULTS: 34 % of births to joint <b>registrants</b> in social classes IV and V, and 45 % of births to sole <b>registrants,</b> were in the quintile of most deprived EDs. It was found that 6. 8 % of births were of low birth weight. Sole <b>registrants</b> were at higher risk (9. 3 % overall) than joint <b>registrants,</b> across all deprivation quintiles. For joint <b>registrants,</b> the socioeconomic risk gradient was similar by social class or area deprivation, but a greater gradient from 4. 7 % to 8. 7 % was found with combined classification. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 30 % of low birth weight {{can be seen as}} being associated with levels of socioeconomic deprivation below that of the most affluent group, as measured in this study. Caution is needed when targeting interventions to high risk groups when using single indicators. For example, the majority of births to lone mothers and to joint <b>registrants</b> in social classes IV and V would be missed by targeting the most deprived quintile. There is a high degree of inequality in low birth weight according to social class, area deprivation and lone mother status. When using routinely recorded birth and census data, all three factors are important to show the true extent of inequalities...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to identify disparities in risk within heart transplant urgency designations. BackgroundPatients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are given 30 days of elective status 1 A time. This allowance may create competition for organs between stable LVAD-supported <b>registrants</b> and less stable <b>registrants</b> listed status 1 A or 1 B. MethodsThe Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for all status 1 A and 1 B listings between 2005 and 2010. Cox models were used to estimate the relative and absolute risk of adverse events (death or delisting as too ill) during status 1 A or 1 B listing. ResultsStatus 1 A <b>registrants</b> supported with dual inotropes and right heart monitoring had a higher risk of adverse events compared to those supported with implanted LVADs using elective 1 A time (hazard ratio: 3. 2; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 8 to 5. 7). The 30 -day risk of events was 1 % (95 % confidence interval: 0. 1 % to 3 %) for implanted LVADs using elective 1 A time and 6 % (95 % confidence interval: 4 % to 8 %) for dual inotrope support. <b>Registrants</b> listed with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices had a higher risk of adverse events (hazard ratio: 9. 1; p < 0. 0001) compared with <b>registrants</b> with implanted LVADs using elective 1 A time. The odds of transplant were higher for implanted LVADs (odds ratio: 1. 5; p < 0. 0001) compared with dual-inotrope and intra-aortic balloon pump support. ConclusionsThe historic allowance for 30 days of elective status 1 A time for implanted LVADs creates disparities in risk among status 1 A <b>registrants.</b> The allowance of 30 days of elective status 1 A time should not be allocated to stable <b>registrants</b> with implanted LVADs. <b>Registrants</b> supported with paracorporeal ventricular assist devices should be listed status 1 A indefinitely...|$|R

500|$|Between lawful {{concurrent}} {{users of}} the same mark in geographically separate markets, the senior <b>registrant</b> {{has the right to}} maintain his registration for at least those market areas in which it is using the mark. However, the senior <b>registrant</b> does not always maintain the right to use the mark in territories not yet occupied by either party. In Pinocchio's Pizza, for example, the first applicant (but the junior user of the mark in commerce) owned one small restaurant in Maryland and had expressed no plans for expansion, while the second applicant (but senior user of the mark in commerce) owned multiple restaurants in Texas and was planning aggressive expansion. The TTAB held that [...] "purpose of the statute is best served by granting [...] applicant a registration for the entire United States except for registrantâ€™s trading area." [...] The TTAB therefore restricted the first applicantâ€™s registration to permit exclusive use in Maryland, and within 50 miles of the first applicantâ€™s restaurant in areas crossing into other states.|$|E
