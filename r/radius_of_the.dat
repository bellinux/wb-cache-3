5|$|The {{issue of}} the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, but also on bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation. Increase the crown <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front tire {{has been shown to}} decrease the size or eliminate self stability. Increasing the crown <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a lesser degree.|$|E

5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core (372km) is about 64% of the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition.

5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core (480km) is about 63% of the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E

It forms orange hexagonal crystals with the lattice constants a = 745.1 pm and c = 1209.7 pm. The average <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BkCl62− ion in this compound is estimated as 270 pm.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E

5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons.

5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet is unlikely to be much more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E

5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.
