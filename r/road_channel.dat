5000|$|Mack left WBAP to join XM Satellite Radio on its Open <b>Road</b> <b>channel</b> (XM 171). Ironically, two of {{the other}} main personalities on Open Road, Dave Nemo and Dale [...] "The Truckin' Bozo" [...] Sommers, were Mack's primary {{competitors}} before all three left their AM radio stations to join XM. Mack's radio program was heard weekdays on XM channel 13 from 12 Noon to 3 PM Eastern, and rebroadcast from Midnight to 3 AM Eastern.On April 29, 2011 Mack announced that Sirius/XM had terminated his contract {{to make room for}} a merger of {{two of the}} channels The Roadhouse and Willie's Place into one channel and that this was his final show.|$|E
5000|$|Born Glen Council in Humboldt, Tennessee, Sommers {{moved to}} Cincinnati {{with his family}} {{at the age of}} 15. The next year (1959), be began working for WAEF. Sommers worked for other local radio {{stations}} in Cincinnati, as well as in Evansville, Indianapolis, Seattle, San Diego, Miami, and Kansas City, before settling back at WLW in 1984. His nickname [...] "The Truckin' Bozo" [...] reportedly came from his former boss at WLW, Randy Michaels. During a station remodeling, Michaels saw Sommers kick a wall. Unfortunately, its supports had been removed and it came crashing down across a desk, prompting Michaels to call Sommers “a bozo.” Sommers retired from WLW in 2003 but shortly thereafter assumed work at XM, joining the Open <b>Road</b> <b>channel</b> in a daytime slot. Sommers would remain with the channel through its merger with Sirius's Road Dog Trucking channel up until shortly before his death.|$|E
50|$|Extreme XM got {{yet another}} big lineup {{sweeping}} in May 2006. Nighttime show The John and Jeff Show {{went off the}} XM radio platform, and David Lawrence was moved to a tape-delayed slot on XM's Open <b>Road</b> <b>channel</b> (keep in mind Lawrence once had his own channel with replays all day). Now Extreme XM has become 100% Clear Channel content. The departure of Tony Kornheiser allowed Extreme to give Lex and Terry back the hour that they normally lose, {{as well as an}} additional hour (for whatever reason, since The Philips Phile is still missing one hour). Lex and Terry therefore moved from 1-4 p.m. to 11-4 p.m., still tape delayed. The show is also replayed in place of John and Jeff. A new addition to the channel was The Schnitt Show. The show is currently on tape delay from 7-10 p.m., while Phil Hendrie was moved to a live timeslot (albeit too little too late) from 10 p.m.-1 a.m.. Schnitt claims that his show will move to a live timeslot down the road, and with Phil Hendrie's retirement, another lineup shuffle is expected in the early summer. On May 22, the afternoons were shuffled around as Schnitt was moved to 4 p.m., ending the 3-year run of The Philips Phile on XM Radio. In the 7-10 PM slot, the station added an encore of Glenn Beck's mid-morning program, which can also be heard on Talk Radio 165. Following in Glenn Beck's steps was Rollye James, which took the Lex and Terry replay spot from 1-6 a.m. Upon the retiring of Phil Hendrie, a replay of The Schnitt Show was added into the 10-1 timeslot, making the Monsters, Lex and Terry, and Schnitt the only 3 unique shows to the channel. In late August 2006, Philips Phile returned to the lineup (albeit on tape delay), while Schnitt was moved later to support the arrival of Ed Schultz, whose show was truncated to an hour. Syndicated hosts Bill Handel and Jesse Jackson were moved off their original home, Talk Radio 165, onto Extreme. The shows, once taped on 165, now run live on 152.|$|E

In the past the traditional drainage control method was paid much control on drainage road, such as the river channel dredging, truncation curving straight, the natural water <b>road</b> <b>channel</b> turned, increasing the levee height and so on. It only considers how to manage the drainage facilities for producing rain-storm from the surface runoff to the downstream region, but neglected the direct influence on the downstream ecosystem. In recent years, {{the idea of the}} ecosystem conservation has already also been become a kind of trend by the public. Therefore, while we manage the drainage facilities, it becomes the important topic for the management of drainage facilities in the present zone of how to avoid inappropriate controls and how to choose appropriate measures and methods against control water for reducing the disasters of inundation and the impact on the environment of the ecosystem. This research uses 2 -D inundation model (SOBEK) to carry on the inundation domain analysis. We simulates the inundation situation of Yang-Tang-Tso basin according to the different year return period, and analyzes it with the most serious condition. Furthermore, we inquire into the condition of inundation area among different depth to provide the reference of the most concrete security on the drainage control for the managers of relational authorities. 彰化地區近年來由於經濟發展迅速，土地開發密集，地表不透水面積增加及地下水超抽造成地盤嚴重下陷，加上氣候變遷，暴雨量增大等因素，致使現有排水設施常無法負荷而造成嚴重之淹水災害。 過去傳統排水治理工法多注重於排水路之整治，如河道疏浚、截彎取直、天然水路渠道化、增加堤防高度等，僅考慮如何治理排水設施，將暴雨產生地表逕流排放至下游地區，而忽略逕流對下游生態環境之衝擊。近年來，生態保育之觀念已被各界重視並已成為一種趨勢，因此在治理排水設施時如何避免不當的整治，如何選擇適當的治水措施及方法，減少淹水災害及其對生態環境的衝擊，乃成現今區域排水治理上重要的課題。 本研究旨在利用SOBEK二維淹水模式進行淹水範圍分析，依不同重現期距之降雨條件以模擬本研究洋子厝排水集水區之淹水情形，並以最嚴重之情況進行分析，進而探討不同深度所產生淹水面積之狀況，所得結果期能提供相關單位在區域排水治理上最具體安全之參考。摘要	I ABSTRACT	II 目錄	III 圖目錄	V 表目錄	VIII 壹、前言	 1 1. 1 緣起	 1 1. 2 研究動機	 1 1. 3 研究目的	 1 貳、前人研究	 3 2. 1 沿海低窪地區改善對策	 3 2. 2 地理資訊系統（GIS）	 4 2. 3 數值地形模型（DTM）	 6 2. 4 降雨-逕流之演算	 8 2. 5 頻率分析	 9 2. 6 逕流係數之演算	 9 2. 7 SCS曲線值法	 9 2. 8 以往規劃與改善情形	 10 参、研究材料與方法	 12 3. 1 研究試區與材料	 12 3. 2 研究流程與方法	 28 肆、結果分析與討論	 56 4. 1 水文分析	 56 4. 2 淹水模擬演算	 73 伍、結論與建議	 98 5. 1 結論	 98 5. 2 建議	 99 參考文獻	 100 附表	 10...|$|E
