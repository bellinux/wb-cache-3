40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the comparative statics properties of the theory of the regulated firm. It is assumed that the firm either maximizes profit, subject to <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint,</b> or maximizes revenue, subject to <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> and a profit constraint. The question asked in each case is whether there are comparative statics properties which distinguish effective from ineffective regulation. Several properties which do so are identified. In particular, the firm's derived demands are found to have some very striking properties. It is shown that if the <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> is effective, then at given output the firm's demand for capital decreases while its demand for labor increases with increases in the wage rate. These peculiar properties also occur in some cases when the <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> is not binding if revenue is maximized. However, there prove to be properties which conclusively distinguish revenue maximization from profit maximization. ...|$|E

The effective influence of a firm is identified as comprising both intrinsic and exerted components; where the latter involves distorting regulation via a transfer to the regulator. Understanding the source of a firm’s high influence is found to be important for — among other things — predicting whether it faces higher or lower <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> than other firms. Data from the World Business Environment Survey provides strong evidence in support of model hypotheses across a wide range of government agents, countries, and regulatory areas. Of particular relevance to public debate, large firms are found to be more likely to be influential, but also more likely to experience <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> than smaller firms.

40|$|International audienceWe empirically characterise {{how good}} labour {{relations}} can alleviate {{the negative impact}} on productivity of <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints</b> or workforce opposition. The estimates {{are based on a}} unique survey of French manufacturing firms collected by the Banque de France over the period 1991 - 2008. Our main results may be summarised as follows: i) 'workforce or union opposition' interacted with 'regulatory constraints' has a negative significant impact on total factor productivity (TFP). When this interaction is not taken into account, a deteriorated labour climate, through workforce or union opposition, weighs directly on TFP. But when this interaction is taken into account, this negative impact relies solely on the combination of <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints</b> and labour opposition: workers or unions can successfully oppose management's decisions and weigh on TFP when they can use or threaten to use appropriate regulation; otherwise, their opposition may be harmless; ii) 'regulatory constraints' interacted with 'branch or firm agreement' has a positive significant impact on TFP. These agreements, which can only be obtained if labour relations are supportive, would be used by firms to offset the negative impact of <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints.</b> This favourable impact can be obtained through two channels: first, informally, a good labour climate can lead to a flexible implementation of regulation; second, formally, the French labour code incorporates provisions that allow firm or branch agreements to adapt or even alleviate the constraints of regulation.

40|$|Heterogeneity is a {{hallmark}} of stem cell populations, {{in part due to}} the molecular differences between cells undergoing self-renewal and those poised to differentiate. We examined phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity in pluripotent stem cell populations, using public gene expression data sets. A high degree of concordance was observed between global gene expression variability and the reported heterogeneity of different human pluripotent lines. Network analysis demonstrated that low-variability genes were the most highly connected, suggesting that these are the most stable elements of the gene regulatory network and are under the highest regulatory constraints. Known drivers of pluripotency were among these, with lowest expression variability of POU 5 F 1 in cells with the highest capacity for self-renewal. Variability of gene expression provides a reliable measure of phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity and predicts those genes with the highest degree of <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> within the pluripotency network. Gene expression variability is a simple measure of heterogeneity in stem cell populations and is informative about the behavior of pluripotency genes. Network analysis demonstrates that genes within the pluripotency network have distinct and characteristic variability profiles, such that genes highly connected in the network have the lowest variability. Wells and colleagues propose that this identifies genes that may be under the highest degree of <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint...</b>|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{substance}} of the literature stemming from the Averch-Johnson model of the firm under rate-of-return regulation. It examines a number of propositions, among them the following: (1) The profit-maximizing firm under rate-of-return regulation will tend to use a capital-labor ratio greater than that which minimizes cost for its output level; (2) The profit-maximizing firm under <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> will use a capital-labor ratio and produce an output greater than it would in the absence of regulation; (3) The closer the "fair rate of return" is to the true cost of capital, the greater the quantity of capital the firm will want to use; and (4) The sales (total revenue) -maximizing firm under <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> will use a labor-capital ratio greater than it would when unconstrained. The second of these propositions, which has been widely taken to have been proved by Averch and Johnson, is shown to be false. The paradoxical assertion in the third proposition is explained and its regulatory implications discussed. Two models involving regulatory lag are described along with their implications for policy. Finally, some evaluative comments are offered on the entire issue of {{what has come to be}} known as the "A-J effect" and its importance in regulatory economics. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper has been to extend the range of {{consequences}} implied by government regulation of privately owned firms. The analytical framework of Section II concentrated on deriving the implications of alternative degrees of regulation on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s research and development (R 2 ̆ 6 D) decisions. The analysis implies that managers of stringently regulated firms have greater incentive to neglect such activities related to the search for and production of valuable market information which increases owners 2 ̆ 7 wealth. Among other things, this implies that firms subject to more restrictive regulatory climates are more likely to commit fewer expenditures to R 2 ̆ 6 D activities. Empirical evidence from the electric power industry was presented in Section III. The results indicate that the interfirm differences in R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditures in this industry can be explained to a large extent by the variability of governmentally imposed <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints.</b> After controlling for other determinants of R 2 ̆ 6 D behavior, the evidence reveals that electric power firms subject to the most restrictive <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints</b> do significantly (at the 5 percent level and better) less R 2 ̆ 6 D than firms operating under the weakest <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of uncertainty {{can make a}} significant difference in the valuation of a project. This manifests itself, inter alia, in the <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints</b> that can affect the valuations of the firm’s investment which, in turn has an adverse impact on consumers’ welfare. In particular, the inability to exercise any or all of the delay, abandon, start/stop, and time-to-build options has an economic and social cost. With this view in mind, we specify and estimate a model where <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints</b> impact on the firm’s cash flow and on investment valuation with real options methods. This paper uses real options analysis to address issues of regulation that have not been previously quantified. We show that <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraints</b> on cash flow have an impact on investment valuations in the telecommunications industry. Specifically, a model is developed to estimate the cost of regulation for broadband services. We show that the cash flow constraints and the inability to delay and abandon has a significant cost. Because some costs are not recognized in a static view of the world, this failure to recognize the operation and implications of non-flexibility by regulators (which can be modeled by real options methods) will lead to a reduction in company valuations which in turn will lead to a reduction in economics welfare...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} great {{interest}} in recent decades in “ecosystem services”. One of the services most often mentioned is the retention of nutrients. I construct a simple model of agricultural land use under a regulatory requirement that nutrient loading cannot exceed a fixed ceiling develop three propositions. First, when the <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> is relatively weak {{there will be a}} corner solution in which no land is set aside to provide the service of nutrient retention. Second, for any given <b>regulatory</b> <b>constraint</b> there is in general a minimum amount of land that would be set aside to provide ecosystem services, regardless of the efficiency with which preserved land provides the nutrient retention function. Third, there is sort of paradox of value: the more valuable it is to set some land aside for nutrient retention, the less land in total would optimally be preserved for this purpose. I illustrate the implications of this model with an application to the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Estimates reported in the literature suggest that land retained in natural cover could prove very effective in retaining reactive nitrogen and other nutrients. If so, there is a sort of “good news/bad news” scenario for conservation advocates touting the importance of ecosystem services. The {{good news is that the}} ecosystem service of nitrogen retention is, in fact, likely to be very valuable.

Using this decomposition, we arrive at a novel strategy for estimating a plausibly causal effect of land use regulation on land value and welfare. This strategy exploits cross-border changes in development, prices, and regulation in regions near municipal borders. Our estimates suggest large negative effects of regulation on the value of land and welfare in these regions...|$|R
