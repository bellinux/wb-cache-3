5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church {{rather than as a}} <b>religious</b> <b>community.</b> The church {{remained}} important in part because the parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles).

5|$|On July 26, 1846, Bishop Bourget {{unilaterally}} {{opened the}} noviciate of the Saint-Pélagie Community, {{and placed the}} assembled female staff of the Hospice as novices within that program. This effectively established the Hospice de Saint-Pélagie as a <b>religious</b> <b>community,</b> of which Bourget proclaimed Sophie Raymond to be the superior. It also allowed for women to join the community as postulants, {{with the aim of}} eventually taking religious vows. Bourget designated himself spiritual and canonical director of the novitiate, and delegated a priest, the Abbé Antoine Rey, to be Director of the Hospice. Later that year at the direction of Coadjutor Bishop Jean-Charles Prince (later Bishop of Saint-Hyacinth) the Wolfe Street premises were expanded through the acquisition of the first floor adjacent to the hospice.|$|E
5|$|Agnes of Mansfeld-Eisleben was a Protestant canoness (meaning {{that she}} was a woman living in a <b>religious</b> <b>community,</b> but not bound by a {{perpetual}} vow) at a convent in Gerresheim, today a district of Düsseldorf. After 1579, she maintained a lengthy liaison with the Archbishop of Cologne, Gebhard of Waldburg-Trauchburg, Truchsess of Waldburg. In defense of her honor, two of her brothers convinced Gebhard to marry her, and Gebhard considered converting to Calvinism for her. Rumors spread throughout the Electorate of his possible conversion, and that he might refuse to relinquish his position. The Electorate had overcome similar problems. Hermann of Wied had converted to Protestantism and resigned in 1547. Salentin of Isenburg-Grenzau, Gebhard's immediate predecessor, had resigned upon his marriage. In December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion and extended equal religious rights to Protestants in the Electorate. In February, he married Agnes. At the end of March 1583, the Pope excommunicated him. The Cathedral chapter promptly elected a new archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by the <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E

5|$|During the Norman reign, several {{different}} religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: Latin Christians (Roman Catholics), Greek-speaking Christians (Eastern Orthodox), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, {{the fact that}} Latin Christians were in power tended to favor Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize {{the claims of the}} Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance with Islamic law.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, Boston's {{population}} grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically {{with the first}} wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated {{the first wave of}} newcomers during this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants. Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest <b>religious</b> <b>community,</b> and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F.

5|$|St Mary's Church, Reculver, {{was founded}} in the 7th century as either a minster or a monastery {{on the site of}} a Roman fort at Reculver, which was then at the {{north-eastern}} extremity of Kent in south-eastern England. In 669, the site of the fort was given for this purpose by King Ecgberht of Kent to a priest named Bassa, beginning a connection with Kentish kings that led to King Eadberht II of Kent being buried there in the 760s, and the church becoming very wealthy {{by the beginning of the}} 9th century. From the early 9th century to the 10th the church was treated as essentially a piece of property, with ownership passing between kings of Mercia and Wessex and the archbishops of Canterbury. Viking attacks may have extinguished the church's <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> in the 9th century, although an early 11th-century record indicates that the church was then in the hands of a dean accompanied by monks. By the time of Domesday Book, completed in 1086, St Mary's was serving as a parish church.|$|E

5|$|The town {{developed}} {{around its}} 11th-century priory, a Benedictine monastery, {{the remains of}} which make {{up some of the}} early parts of Great Malvern Priory, now a large parish church. Several slightly different histories explain the actual founding of the <b>religious</b> <b>community.</b> Legend tells that the settlement began following the murder of St. Werstan, a monk of Deerhurst, who fled from the Danes and took refuge in the woods of Malvern, where the above-mentioned hermitage had been established. St Werstan's oratory is thought to have been located on the site of St Michael's Chapel which is believed to have stood on the site of Bello Sguardo, a Victorian Villa. Bello Sguardo was built on the site of Hermitage Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 1825 and ecclesiastical carvings were found within it. A Mediaeval undercroft, human bones and parts of a coffin were also uncovered. Although the legend may be monastic mythology, historians have however concluded that St. Werstan was the original martyr.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{returned}} to England in 958 {{at the behest}} of his uncle, but Oda died before Oswald returned. Lacking a patron, Oswald turned to Oskytel, recently named Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald along with Oskytel travelled to Rome for Oskytel's pallium, but this story is only contained in a 12th-century Ramsey Abbey chronicle, so it may not be authentic. Even if he did not travel to Rome, Oswald was active in ecclesiastical affairs at York until Dunstan obtained Oswald's appointment to the see, or bishopric, of Worcester. He was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester in 961. Soon after his consecration, he persuaded Germanus to come back to England and made him head of a small <b>religious</b> <b>community</b> near Westbury-on-Trym. After the establishment of this group about 962, Oswald grew worried that because the monastery was located on lands owned by the see of Worcester, his successors in the see might disrupt the community. He was offered the site of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire by Æthelwine, son of Æthelstan Half-King, and Oswald established a monastery there about 971 that attracted most {{of the members of the}} community at Westbury. This foundation at Ramsey went on to become Ramsey Abbey. Ramsey was Oswald's most famous foundation, with its church dedicated in 974. Later, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury to come and teach at Ramsey. Oswald directed the affairs of Ramsey Abbey until his death, when the dean Eadnoth became the first abbot. He gave a magnificent Bible to Ramsey, which was important enough to merit a mention in Oswald's Life. Alongside the gift of the book, Oswald also contributed wall hangings and other textiles to the abbey.|$|E
