25|$|Sorel cement was {{patented}} in 1867 by Frenchman Stanislas Sorel and {{was stronger}} than Portland cement but its poor water resistance and corrosive qualities limited its use in building construction. The next development with the manufacture of Portland cement was {{the introduction of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> which allowed a stronger, more homogeneous mixture and a continuous manufacturing process.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{operation}} of cement kilns provides combustion conditions {{which are more}} than adequate {{for the destruction of}} even the most difficult to destroy organic substances. This is primarily due to the very high temperatures of the kiln gases (2000nbsp&°C in the combustion gas from the main burners and 1100nbsp&°C in the gas from the burners in the precalciner). The gas residence time at high temperature in the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> is of the order of 5–10 seconds and in the precalciner more than 3 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|This {{design of}} {{incinerator}} has 2 chambers: a primary chamber and secondary chamber. [...] The primary chamber in a <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln</b> incinerator {{consists of an}} inclined refractory lined cylindrical tube. The inner refractory lining serves as sacrificial layer to protect the kiln structure. This refractory layer needs to be replaced from time to time. Movement of the cylinder on its axis facilitates movement of waste. In the primary chamber, there is conversion of solid fraction to gases, through volatilization, destructive distillation and partial combustion reactions. The secondary chamber is necessary to complete gas phase combustion reactions.|$|E

2500|$|John Grant of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1859 set out {{requirements}} for cement {{to be used}} in the London sewer project. This became a specification for Portland cement. The next development with the manufacture of Portland cement was the introduction of the <b>rotary</b> <b>kiln,</b> patented by German Friedrich Hoffmann, called a Hoffmann kiln for brick making in 1858, and then Frederick Ransome in 1885 (U.K.) and 1886 (U.S.); which allowed a stronger, more homogeneous mixture and a continuous manufacturing process. [...] The Hoffmann 'endless' kiln which gave 'perfect control over combustion' was tested in 1860, and showed the process produced a better grade of cement. This cement was made at the Portland Cementfabrik Stern at Stettin, which was the first to use a Hoffmann kiln. [...] It is thought that the first modern Portland cement was made there. The Association of German Cement Manufacturers issued a standard on Portland cement in 1878.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOver the years, <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> {{have become}} an inescapable {{benchmark}} in several industrial sectors. This is because they offer special possibilities regarding {{a wide range of}} materials which can be continuously processed with little or no operating labor, especially when they are automatically controlled. The wider the scope of applications, the greater the variety of kiln designs and sizes. <b>Rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> are widely used for the drying or cooling of solid particles, for instance in the food processing industry when dealing with wet or dry granular materials, for the calcination of limestone, petroleum coke, or production of cement. Other applications include: regeneration of spent catalyst, hazardous waste reclamation, defluorination and reduction of uranyl difluoride and so on. Industrial <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> are usually equipped with internal fixtures such as lifters, baffles, constrictions or exit dams. The complex hydrodynamic behavior of the granular materials within <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> has led to extensive research over the years. Most of these publications report on the influence of operating parameters (rotational speed, kiln slope, mass flow rate or exit dam height) on the residence time distribution (RTD) and axial dispersion of solid particles. However, few of these studies analyze the effect of the presence of lifters, their number or shape. We therefore decided to conduct a systematic experimental investigation of RTD, kiln holdup and axial dispersion coefficient for the continuous flow of granular materials in <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> equipped with lifters. To do so, we used two different pilot scale <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns.</b> One is about twice the size of the other. We investigated both the influence of operating parameters (rotational speed, kiln slope, mass flow rate) and of the presence of internal devices (grid, different shapes and number of lifters, different height of exit dam) on a large range of size and shape of particles (two different sands, rice and beech chips). The large set of experimental data obtained, allowed us to build a model based on dimensional analysis, which is useful for industrial applications...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} successful <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> {{were developed}} in Pennsylvania around 1890, based on a design by Frederick Ransome, and were about 1.5 m in diameter and 15 m in length. Such a kiln made about 20 tonnes of clinker per day. The fuel, initially, was oil, which was readily available in Pennsylvania at the time. It was particularly easy {{to get a good}} flame with this fuel. Within the next 10 years, the technique of firing by blowing in pulverized coal was developed, allowing the use of the cheapest available fuel. By 1905, the largest kilns were 2.7 x 60 m in size, and made 190 tonnes per day. At that date, after only 15 years of development, <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> accounted for half of world production. Since then, the capacity of kilns has increased steadily, and the largest kilns today produce around 10,000 tonnes per day. In contrast to static kilns, the material passes through quickly: it takes from 3 hours (in some old wet process kilns) to as little as 10 minutes (in short precalciner <b>kilns).</b> <b>Rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> run 24 hours a day, and are typically stopped only for a few days {{once or twice a year}} for essential maintenance. One of the main maintenance works on <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> is tyre and roller surface machining and grinding works which can be done while the kiln works in full operation at speeds up to 3.5 rpm. This is an important discipline, because heating up and cooling down are long, wasteful and damaging processes. Uninterrupted runs as long as 18 months have been achieved.|$|R

30|$|As to the disposal, PCBs can {{be safely}} {{destroyed}} by incineration in <b>rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> or on the grate if temperatures above 900 °C are maintained for some seconds. Legally, waste contaminated up to 50 mg/kg may be incinerated in MWI’s. <b>Rotary</b> <b>kilns</b> which are typical for hazardous waste incineration are normally used for disposal of higher PCB concentrations. Former problems with the de novo synthesis of PCBs have been overcome by fast quenching of the flue gas to avoid the temperature window between 200 and 400 °C and flue gas cleaning with activated coke. Thus, a modern incineration plant serves as a sink for PCBs and dioxins [17]. There are some other valuable techniques {{for the destruction of}} PCBs like the reaction with sodium or potassium, the hydrogenation, or plasma arc treatment. These techniques are fitted only for highly concentrated PCB waste. The disposal in former salt mines is a safe sink for transformers and condensers filled with PCB oils [18, 19].|$|R
