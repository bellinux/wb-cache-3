Effect of the burner geometry on the heat transfer coefficient at the jet/plate interface, with the variation of Reynolds number and air/fuel equivalence ratio, has been examined. <b>Round</b> and <b>slot</b> burner nozzles with the same cross-sectional area were tested at a constant nozzle-to-plate distance of 2 d. The Reynolds number was selected to range from 1, 000 to 1, 700, {{in order to produce}} a laminar flow.

40|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} {{is concerned with}} corrosive thinning of portions of the metallic pressure boundary, particularly {{in areas that are}} not directly accessible for inspection. This study investigated the feasibility of detecting these thickness degradations using ultrasonic imaging. A commercial ultrasonic system was used to carry out several full-scale, controlled laboratory experiments. Measurements of 0. 5 MHz shear wave levels propagated in 25 -mm-thick steel plate embedded in concrete showed 1. 4 - 1. 6 dB of signal loss for each centimeter of two-way travel in the steel plate (compared to previous numerical predictions of 3 - 4 dB), and 1. 3 dB of signal loss per centimeter of two-way travel in steel plates embedded in concrete prior to setting of the concrete (i. e., plastic). Negligible losses were measured in plates with a decoupling treatment applied between the steel and concrete to simulate the unbonded portions of the pressure boundary. Scattered signals from straight slots of different size and shape were investigated. The return from a 4 -mm-deep rectangular slots exhibited levels 23 dB down relative to incidence and 4 - 6 dB higher than those obtained from both ''v'' shaped and <b>rounded</b> <b>slots</b> of similar depth. The system displayed an input/output dynamic range of 125 dB and measurement variability less than 1 - 2 dB. Based on these results, a 4 -mm-deep, rounded degradation embedded 30 cm in concrete has expected returns of - 73 dB relative to the input and should therefore be detectable.

Its aim is to compare the vibration magnitude when the motor possesses different geometrical rotor-slot shapes. The cross sectional areas of two typical semi-closed slot shapes (rectangular and round shapes) are kept equally constant according to the IEEE standard. Under an assumption of sinusoidal motor excitation, the simulation works employ the finite element method (FEM) and the Newton-Raphson method to solve time varying nonlinear equations. The numerical solutions obtained indicate the electromagnetic force distribution over the motor cross sectional area. Such forces cause mechanical vibration in the motor. To evaluate this vibration, the displacement of stator inner perimeters was observed carefully.

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} influence of exit orifice shape on the performance characteristics of a three-electrode plasma synthetic jet actuator. High-speed Schlieren imaging system and phase-locked two-component PIV measurements are used for flowfield characterisation in quiescent conditions. Two actuator configurations with the same exit area but different exit orifice shape (<b>round</b> orifice and <b>slot</b> orifice) are studied. Results indicate a close correspondence between {{the shapes of the}} starting vortex ring with the shapes of the respective exit orifices. For the slot orifice, the elongated starting vortex ring gradually expands during propagation, while its ends become warped. A distinct K–H instability structure is observed, inducing continuous oscillation of the high-speed jet. Compared with the jet from the <b>round</b> orifice, the <b>slot</b> jet has a higher entrainment rate of surrounding air, thus resulting in a lower propagation velocity of the jet front. The exit velocity of PSJA within one period initially shows a rapid increase, then persists at a relatively high level (100 – 130  m/s), and finally drops with some small-scale oscillations. The oscillation amplitude is less than 10  m/s, and the oscillation period is approximately 600  µs.

Although traditional osteointegrated implants provide good anchorage (Ödman et al., 1988; Roberts et al., 1989; Wehrbein and Merz, 1998), they are too bulky for some applications, and therefore, miniscrews [microscrews or temporary anchorage devices (TADs) ] are often preferred (Kanomi, 1997; Ohmae et al., 2001; Miyawaki et al., 2003). Besides their smaller sizes, other advantages of the miniscrews are smooth surface, lower costs, reduced chair-side times, {{and the possibility of}} immediate loading (Fritz et al., 2004). Unlike dental implants, which acquire their stability via osteointegration, miniscrews obtain maximum stability mechanically via primary retention (Melsen and Verna 1999; Brettin et al., 2008).
