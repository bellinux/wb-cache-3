2500|$|In June 1994, {{an article}} in the Chicago Tribune by John Crewdson stated that an {{anonymous}} junior researcher in Hamer’s laboratory alleged that Hamer selectively presented the data in his 1993 paper in the journal Science. The junior researcher had assisted in the gene mapping in Hamer's 1993 study. Shortly after voicing her questions, she was summarily dismissed from her post-doctoral fellowship in Hamer’s lab; who dismissed her could not be determined. Later, she was given another position in a different lab. Hamer stated that Crewdson's article was [...] "seriously in error" [...] and denied the allegations made against him.

While researchers in both fields endeavor {{to bridge the gap between}} research and practice, there are only few discussions between treatment <b>integrity</b> <b>research</b> and DBIR. In this project, overviews about aspects, underlying assumptions, and challenges in these two fields are supplied.
