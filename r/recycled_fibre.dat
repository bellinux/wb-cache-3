5|$|The Medway valley {{has long}} been {{associated}} with the newsprint industry, but in February 2015 it was confirmed that the last major paper mill in the parish, Aylesford Newsprint, was to close with the loss of 233 jobs. Ditton's connection with the industry goes back to 1922 when the first factory was built by Reed International {{on the banks of the}} river Medway. Reed International were a major paper manufacturer which, at its height, had in the region of 1,500 employees. The business was seriously hampered by the advent of World War II, which caused a shortage of pulp to make newspapers and led to a different material, waste paper, being used in its place. Waste paper was then replaced by <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre,</b> which was fully utilised in the process of producing newsprint. The 60-acre Newsprint plant belonged to SCA, paper manufacturers from Sweden, in partnership with Mondi, and £250 million was invested in developing the site. Aylesford Newsprint was one of the world's leading manufacturers of newsprint, recycling around 500,000 tonnes of material to produce some 400,000 tonnes of final product. Media organisations in Europe, America and the Far East relied on the recycled newsprint from the plant for their publications. Ditton stream was a vital water supply for the processes carried out in the plant.|$|E

40|$|Plastic macro fibres, {{inclusive}} of virgin and <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres,</b> {{are becoming more}} popular {{in the construction of}} concrete footpaths, precast panels and shotcrete mine tunnels. In particular, the use of <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> has become increasingly attractive due to their low cost and sustainability.

Therefore, the feasibility of using <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> in concrete may be in doubt. This research assessed reinforcing effects of the <b>recycled</b> Polypropylene (PP) <b>fibre</b> and compared it with those of the virgin PP fibre.

The main objective is to increase the use of <b>fibres</b> <b>recycled</b> from coloured paper. One of the main problems of this raw material is the presence of contaminants, such as colourants, which hinder its potential and causes the obtained product to loss part of its value. A big inconvenience of using <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> from the disintegration of coloured paper as raw material is that the type of colourant used is unknown. Therefore, parameters based on measuring the optical properties of the paper sheets where used to determine the efficiency of the colour elimination sequences. The first part consisted in applying different enzymatic stages (laccasemediator system) and a bleaching chemical agent to the red/black <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> for determining the efficiency of eliminating colour in the dough. Afterwards, different biotechnological agents (enzymes) and chemical treatments will be applied to the red <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> using a combination of mediators and doubling the dose of mediator used in the red fibres in order to determine which treatment gives the best results. Later on, we will apply a selected colour elimination sequence to the red and black <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres,</b> with the aim of determining the best biochemical sequence. At the same time, studies with another oxidizing agent (ozone) will be done in order to determine if the enzymatic stages can substitute the ozone stage. Last part of the project consists in doing physical test to determine if the paper has lost any of its properties after the treatments. The enzymatic activity of the effluents will be calculated as well in order to determine which mediator performed better and the possibility of recirculating these effluents will be studied...|$|R
40|$|Use of macro <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> in {{reinforcing}} concrete footpaths and precast panels offers {{significant economic}} and environmental benefits over traditionally used virgin plastic fibres or steel fibre and mesh. However, wide adoption of <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> by construction industries {{has not yet been}} seen due to limited data available on their durability, mechanical properties and performance in concrete. This paper reports findings from a laboratory study on the alkali resistance and performance of <b>recycled</b> polypropylene (PP) <b>fibres</b> in the 25 MPa and 40 MPa concretes, used for footpaths and precast panels, respectively. The <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> was proven to have very good alkali resistance in the concrete and other alkaline environments. The <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> showed excellent post-cracking performance in concrete, bringing in significant ductility. In the 40 MPa concrete the effectiveness of reinforcement of PP fibres depended on their Young's modulus and tensile strength in the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) test. Since the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> was found to have lower tensile strength but higher Young's modulus than those of virgin PP <b>fibre,</b> the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> produced similar or slightly lower reinforcement than that of virgin PP fibre. In the 25 MPa concrete, the Young's modulus of fibres was more effective on their reinforcement than the tensile strength, thus the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> produced better reinforcement than that of virgin PP fibre...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{environmental}} impact of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle-to-fibre recycling using the methodology of life-cycle assessment (LCA). Four recycling cases, including mechanical recycling, semi-mechanical recycling, back-to-oligomer recycling and back-to-monomer recycling were analysed. Three allocation methods are applied for open-loop recycling, i. e. the “cut-off” approach, the “waste valuation” approach and the “system expansion” approach. Nine environmental impact indicators were analysed, i. e. non-renewable energy use (NREU), global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation. The LCA results are compared with virgin PET fibre and other commodity fibre products, i. e. cotton, viscose, PP (polypropylene) and PLA (polylactic acid). The LCA results show that <b>recycled</b> PET <b>fibres</b> offer important environmental benefits over virgin PET fibre. Depending on the allocation methods applied for open-loop-recycling, NREU savings of 40 – 85 % and GWP savings of 25 – 75 % can be achieved. <b>Recycled</b> PET <b>fibres</b> produced by mechanical recycling cause lower environmental impacts than virgin PET in at least eight {{out of a total of}} nine categories. <b>Recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> produced from chemical recycling allow to reduce impacts in six to seven out of a total of nine categories compared to virgin PET fibres.

5000|$|Recycled: Used {{paper is}} {{collected}} and sorted and usually mixed with virgin fibres {{in order to}} make new material. This is necessary as the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> often loses strength when reused; the added virgin fibres enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually deinked (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the pulp may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards. Health risks have been associated with using recycled material in direct food contact. Swiss studies have shown that recycled material can contain significant portions of mineral oil, which may migrate into packed foods. Mineral oil levels of up to 19.4 mg/kg were found in rice packed in recycled board.|$|E

40|$|The {{processing}} and reuse of end-of-life composite products in an environmentally friendly manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the industry and community. The global annual production of glass reinforced composite materials is rapidly approaching 10 million tons, of which approximately 60 % is thermoset based. A number of processes are available for recycling such GRP composites. Of these possible routes, thermal recycling is probably the most technologically advanced and has been piloted in the UK and Denmark. However, nearly all options deliver <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> which suffer from a lack of cost competitiveness with pristine first-pass materials. A key factor in this equation is that there is a huge drop in the performance of <b>recycled</b> glass <b>fibre</b> (80 - 90 %) in comparison to its original state. Consequently, <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> have a very poor performance to cost ratio, and in most cases are considered unsuitable for re{{processing and}} reuse as a valuable reinforcement of composites. In this presentation we will introduce two recently initiated EPSRC funded projects (ReCoVeR) focussed on the enabling cost-effective regeneration of the mechanical properties of glass fibres obtained from thermal recycling of glass reinforced composites from end-of-life automotive and wind energy applications. A breakthrough in the regeneration of <b>recycled</b> glass <b>fibre</b> performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling such GRP composites which would otherwise most likely be disposed of to landfill. This will enable such <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> to compete with, and replace, pristine materials in many large volume composite applications. The development of an economically viable process for regenerating the properties of thermally <b>recycled</b> glass <b>fibres</b> would have major technological, societal, economic, environmental impacts. This ReCoVeR team of researchers is currently 1. generating fundamental understanding of the degradation of glass fibre strength during thermo-mechanical conditioning (300 - 600 °C) 2. developing cost effective treatments to regenerate the performance of thermo-mechanically treated glass fibres 3. producing examples of composites using regenerated glass fibres Highlights of the results from these studies will be reviewed with emphasis on the teams’ breakthrough treatments to regenerate the properties of thermally conditioned glass fibres...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{decreasing}} limited forest resources, {{the increasing}} paper consumption {{and the pressure}} from the environmental movements, the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> has become increasingly important. Today’s modern paper and paperboard industry is the exclusive user of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> as a raw material. On the other hand, the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> inevitably presents {{a number of new}} challenges to the paper industry, as the recycled fibres are drained more slowly, often contaminated with other materials and fibre strength is diminished with the recycling number. Microbial growth is another common problem in the papermaking system. Besides the use of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> in paper and paperboard mills, the increased closure of the water and the conversion to neutral/alkaline systems exacerbate microbiological problems and decrease mill performances. Problems caused by micro organisms that are typically encountered in paper making systems include slime spots and holes, offensive odours, corrosion, paper breaks, brightness loss, additive spoilage, and shower and stock line plugging. These problems are costly because they lead to poor runnability, low production rates, off-quality paper, and even shortened equipment life due to accelerated corrosion rates. Microbiological growth control has therefore become more and more important within the paper industry. The proper control of microbiological growth involves properly identifying the problem and finding the best solution...|$|E
40|$|Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRPs) {{have very}} {{impressive}} properties. particularly {{in terms of}} specific strength and stiffness. and they are widely used in many industries {{such as in the}} production of high-tech sports goods and the aviation industry In addition. the quantity of (,FRPs in use has increased significantly. especially during the past few decades. After Hoeing announced the shift in their aeroplanes from alloy based to composite aircraft. there has been a very large impact on the carbon fibre market. and it is estimated that by 2014. the carbon fibre market will reach £ l. 7 billion. However. the growth of carbon fibre utilisation has resulted in an increased quantity of CFRP waste which still {{has the potential to be}} al high value material and which can be recycled and reused in non-structural applications. The aim of this study is to recycle carbon fibre using a fluidised bed and to investigate the most suitable operating conditions in order to obtain the highest quality of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> in term of fibre length. tensile properties and surface energy. All aerospace grade composite was recycled using a fluidised bed process operating between 525 °C and 550 °C with a fluidising velocity of 0. 8 m/s and 1 m/s and a bed depth of 5 cm and Scm. As the recycling temperature can affect the residence time in the fluidised bed. there were two forms of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> resulted from this process: single fibre filaments elutriated from the bed and bundles of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> remained in the bed. The elutriated single filaments. <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> possessed approximately 46 % normalised tensile strength with 67 % average normalised tensile modulus while the bundles offered higher tensile properties (the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles had roughly 67 % normalised tensile strength and 73 % average normalised tensile modulus). Both <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> type had a clean surface with no visible damage. The efforts to improve the tensile properties of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> were carried out by controlling the oxygen content. However. it was found that low oxygen content, between 6 and 18 per cent. does not improve tensile strength of a recycled carbon fibre. The main parameter associated with the single filament <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> quality is temperature. An increasing temperature tends to decrease the fibre length degradation and tensile strength for recycled single filaments. both of which are due to faster char oxidation and hence. a lower residence Time before elutriation. For the recycled carbon fibre bundles. it was found that the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> quality is related to fluidising velocity and bed depth. Regarding surface energy. it has been observed that the surface energy of recycled carbon fibre depends on the quantity of acid based functional groups and these changes are slightly dependent on the recycling conditions. Finally. degradation modelling of the composite has been developed and Shown to be a useful tool in determining the behaviour of the composite in the fluidised bed. The outcomes of this research are not only useful for understanding and optimising the fluidised bed process for recycling carbon fibre. but they are also helpful in developing a better understanding of carbon fibre recycling operations based on thermal processing.
