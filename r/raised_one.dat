5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He <b>raised</b> <b>one</b> {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E

25|$|The Open D tuning D–A–D–F–A–D, {{also called}} “Vestopol” tuning, {{is one of}} the most common open tunings used by European and American guitarists working with {{alternate}} tunings. There are countless recorded examples, including Joni Mitchell (“Big Yellow Taxi”), Bruce Cockburn (“Sunwheel Dance”), Leo Kottke (many of his slide tunes), John Fahey (multiple tunes) and many others. The popular Allman Brothers instrumental “Little Martha” used an open D tuning <b>raised</b> <b>one</b> half step, giving an open E♭ tuning with the same intervalic relationships as open D.|$|E
25|$|The inner gallery {{is nearly}} filled by the upper terrace, <b>raised</b> <b>one</b> level higher again. The lack of {{space between the}} inner gallery and the upper terrace has led {{scholars}} {{to conclude that the}} upper terrace did not figure in the original plan for the temple, but that it was added shortly thereafter following a change in design. Originally, it is believed, the Bayon had been designed as a single-level structure, similar in that respect to the roughly contemporaneous foundations at Ta Prohm and Banteay Kdei.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the changing demands of the sport, at the 58th Congress of the FIG, held in July 1980 just before the Moscow Olympics, the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15. Under this rule, which {{went into effect in}} 1981, gymnasts were required to turn at least 15 years of age in the calendar year to compete in senior-level events. This age requirement remained in place until 1997, when it was <b>raised</b> <b>one</b> more year, from 15 to 16.|$|E

25|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{change for the}} Mackenzies was {{the replacement of the}} forward /50 calibre Mk 22 guns of the St. Laurent design with a dual Vickers 3-inch/70 calibre Mk 6 gun mount and the presence of a fire-control director atop the bridge superstructure. The bridge was <b>raised</b> <b>one</b> full deck higher than on previous classes in order to see over the new gun mount. The class did retain the rear dual 3-inch/50 calibre gun mount and for anti-submarine warfare, the class was provided with two Mk 10 Limbo mortars. The ships were initially fitted with Mark 43 torpedoes to supplement their anti-submarine capability, but were quickly upgraded to the Mark 44 launched from a modified depth charge thrower. This was to give the destroyers the ability to combat submarines from a distance.|$|E

500|$|The ship's {{anti-aircraft}} guns were grouped amidships and placed relatively {{low on the}} hull. Thus, the guns could not {{be brought to bear}} directly forward or aft. Also, the island blocked the forward arcs of the port battery. As a result, the ship was vulnerable to attack by dive bombers. The ship's 12cm 10th Year Type guns were scheduled to be replaced by more modern [...] Type 89 mounts in 1942. The anti-aircraft sponsons were to be <b>raised</b> <b>one</b> deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire as was done during Kagas modernization. However, the ship was lost in combat before the upgrade could take place.|$|E
500|$|Lambertia formosa {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} introductions of Australian plant species to cultivation in England. In 1788, seed was sent from Botany Bay to the Lee and Kennedy's nursery in Hammersmith, west London. Two varieties were <b>raised,</b> <b>one</b> designated as [...] "var. longifolia". The first [...] recorded flowering was a plant grown by J. Robertson of Stockwell in July 1798. Andrews wrote the following year that it is [...] "without difficulty raised by cuttings, and thrives in peat earth." [...] Knight reported in 1809 that it required more heat and close care than other Australian plants and hence would never be widely cultivated in England.|$|E
500|$|On 31 March 1856, Calcraft {{executed}} William Bousfield, but {{a threat}} {{he had received}} {{that he would be}} shot on the scaffold unnerved him. After releasing the bolt securing the trapdoor on which the condemned man was standing, Calcraft ran off, leaving Bousfield hanging; a few moments later Bousfield <b>raised</b> <b>one</b> of his legs to support himself on the platform. Calcraft's assistant tried to push the victim off, but Bousfield repeatedly succeeded in supporting himself. The officiating chaplain forced the frightened Calcraft to return to the scaffold, where he [...] "threw himself around his [...] legs and by the force of his weight finally succeeded in strangling him". Calcraft's bungling became the subject of a popular ballad.|$|E
