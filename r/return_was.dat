5|$|Because Florida State had {{received}} the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's <b>return</b> <b>was</b> the first touchdown {{of the game and}} the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history.

5|$|Californication is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was {{released}} on June8, 1999, on Warner Bros. Records and was produced by Rick Rubin. Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's <b>return</b> <b>was</b> credited with changing the band's sound altogether, producing a notable shift in style from the music recorded with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, but also contained more varied themes than previous outings, including lust, death, contemplations of suicide, California, drugs, globalization, and travel.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} impact of risks on returns of sukuk in different sectorial structures. The different types of risks (market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk) are independant variables and the <b>return</b> of sukuk <b>is</b> dependant variable. Data were collected from Nasdaq Dubai HSBC sukuk index of sukuk market period from 2005 to 2015 {{on a monthly basis}} and analyzed using descriptive, correlation analysis and multi-regressions analysis. The four regression models explain 70 % to 89 % of the variation. While risk exposure on global sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 88 %, risk exposure on sovereign sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 70 %. While risk exposure to corporate sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 89 % risk exposure to financial sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> 73 %. The results indicate that a sovereign sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> very less exposed to risk compared with other sectors corporate sukuk and financial sukuk. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that sovereign sukuk <b>return</b> <b>is</b> minimally exposed to risk. It is also found that when compared with finance sector risk is high in the corporate sector. This study recommend to maintain inflation rate at an optimal level and promote secondary markets for sukuk...|$|R

Instead, around 1160, he followed his younger brother, Stephen's, example and settled in Constantinople but both were to return to Hungary following the death of their elder brother, Géza II of Hungary, in 1162. Their <b>return</b> <b>was</b> backed by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos who used their return in a bid to expand his suzerainty over Hungary. Initially, the Emperor was planning to assist Stephen IV in seizing the throne, but the Hungarian lords were only willing to accept Ladislaus as king against the late Géza II's son, Stephen III.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a reverse logistic system where <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> stochastically dependents on sales. The aim of the paper is to assess the influence on optimal production capacities when <b>is</b> assumed that <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> stochastically independent of sales. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents {{a model of the}} system. An approximated model where <b>is</b> assumed that <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> stochastically independent of sales, is formulated to obtain the optimal capacities. The optimal costs of the original and the approximated models are compared in order to assess the influence of the assumption made on returns. Findings: The assumption that <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> stochastically independent of sales is significant in few cases. Research limitations/implications: The impact of the assumption on <b>returns</b> <b>is</b> assessed indirectly, by comparing the optimal costs of both models: the original and approximated. Practical implications: The problem of calculating the optimal capacities in the original model is hard to solve, however in the approximated model the problem is tractable. When the impact of the assumption that <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> stochastically independent of sales is not significant, the approximated model can be used to calculate the optimal capacities of the original model. Originality/value: Prior to this paper, few papers have addressed with the problem of calculating the optimal capacities of reverse logistics systems. The models found in these papers assumed that <b>returns</b> <b>are</b> stochastically independent of sales. </p...|$|R
