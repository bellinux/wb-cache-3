40|$|We have {{implemented}} a root-extraction stemmer for Arabic {{which is similar}} to the Khoja stemmer but without a <b>root</b> <b>dictionary.</b> Our stemmer was found to perform equivalently to the Khoja stemmer as well as so-called “light ” stemmers in monolingual document retrieval tasks performed on the Arabic Trec- 2001 collection. A <b>root</b> <b>dictionary,</b> therefore, does not improve Arabic monolingual document retrieval. ...|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{analysis}} of Arabic words allows decreasing the storage {{requirements of the}} Arabic dictionaries, more efficient encoding of diacritical Arabic text, faster spelling and efficient Optical character recognition. All these factors allow efficient storage and archival of multilingual digital libraries that include Arabic texts. This paper presents a lossless compression algorithm based on the affix analysis that {{takes advantage of the}} statistical studies of the diacritical Arabic morphological features. The algorithm decomposes a given Arabic word into its root and its affixes. The affixes (prefix, infix, and suffix) are the redundant elements of the word. The roots are stored in the <b>root</b> <b>dictionary.</b> Also, we maintain categorized affix dictionaries and their valid combinations to validate and generate the morphological forms during encoding and decoding using a list of patterns. Since our goal is lossless reproducible Arabic text, stemming is not an option and noise words (high frequency words) cannot be filtered out. The size of the obtained <b>root</b> <b>dictionary</b> is about 8000 three-character roots and 700 four character roots. We also code the most frequently occurring diacritical bigrams (biliterals) and trigrams (triliterals) with unused codewords in ASCII, ASMO- 449, and Unicode standard codes. Using combined methods of root dictionaries and the proposed coding scheme, compression ratios of proper Arabic text compare favorably with other unigram non-diacritical methods...|$|E
50|$|As such, it is {{inconvenient}} for dictionary use, {{because the}} imperative would {{be closer to}} the <b>root</b> word. Nevertheless, <b>dictionaries</b> use the first infinitive.|$|R
25|$|Basically, it {{consists}} of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document <b>root.</b> This <b>dictionary</b> contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each {{of which may be}} individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.|$|R
50|$|Because many legal {{terms are}} derived from a Latin <b>root</b> word, the <b>Dictionary</b> gives a {{pronunciation}} guide for such terms. In addition, the applicable entries provide pronunciation transcriptions pursuant to those found among North American practitioners of law or medicine.|$|R
40|$|The Coeur d’Alene Online Language Resource Center (COLRC) is {{a digital}} archive that {{interfaces}} with the World Wide Web via {{a series of}} websites that make accessible many of the known Coeur d’Alene language resources for scholarly and educational purposes. Following the best practices outlined in the TAPS Checklist (Chang 2010) and Bird and Simons (2003), a team of linguists, community members, and a computer engineer developed the resources (at minimal cost) building on the grass roots model outlined in Bischoff and Fountain (2013). The COLRC contains over 1, 200 pages of unpublished field-notes and manuscripts recording Coeur d’Alene myths, tales, and histories. Additionally, it includes a searchable Coeur d’Alene/English <b>root</b> <b>dictionary,</b> affix list, and stem list, along {{with a number of}} audio recordings and other language resources. This paper presents elements of the COLRC and the questions derived from the best practices that shaped it...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to lemmatization based on exhaustive morphological analysis and use of external knowledge sources to help disambiguation {{which is the most}} relevant issue to cope with. Our system GETARUNS was not concerned with lemmatization directly and used morphological analysis only as backoff solution in case the word was not retrieved in the wordform dictionaries available. We found out that both the rules and the <b>root</b> <b>dictionary</b> needed amending. This was started during development and before testset was distributed, but not completed for lack of time. Thus the task final results only depict an incomplete system, which has now eventually come to a complete version with rather different outcome. We moved from 98. 42 to 99. 82 in the testset and from 99. 82 to 99. 91 in the devset. As said above, this is produced by rules and is not subject to statistical evaluation which may change according to different training sets. In this version of the paper we perform additional experiments with WordForm dictionaries of Italian freely available online...|$|E
40|$|The Coeur d’Alene Online Language Resource Center (COLRC) is a {{comprehensive}} data resource for the Coeur d’Alene (Interior Salish) language community and scholars. The COLRC was created and is maintained by the collaborative efforts of community members, linguists, and computer engineers working to make Coeur d’Alene resources widely available following TAPS (Target, Access, Preservation, Sustainability) guidelines presented in Chang (2010). Presently, the Tribal Language Program provides language courses at various levels and for various ages. The COLRC was created to support the Tribal Language Program and make a number of language resources readily accessible online as the Tribal government has developed community wide broadband. The COLRC includes a searchable <b>root</b> <b>dictionary,</b> affix list, and stem-list; {{all of these are}} based on published material (Lyon and Greene-Wood 2007; Reichard 1938, 1939) and are used by permission or the copyright has expired (all reference resources are available in two modern orthographies). The COLRC also houses audio recordings; 1, 200 + pages of unpublished fieldnotes and typed manuscripts (some forty-eight myths and tales in Coeur d’Alene/English); images of original resources; and links to resources housed at various digital archives. Coeur d’Alene is a morphologically complex language, and the COLRC’s searchable online root, stem, and affix list make access to the complex morphology easy for language learners and scholars. The COLRC allows simultaneous access to fieldnotes, edited manuscripts, and published English translations (Reichard 1947) of stories collected in the late 1920 s, as well as native-speaker recitations of a number of these tales. These resources provide users with examples of connected speech not otherwise available; a record of changes in the interpretation of the texts at various stages of analysis; and valuable cultural information. We present the resources mentioned above, and discuss issues that arose during the construction of the COLRC. For example, Coeur d’Alene has been recorded in three distinct orthographies: older Boasian phonetic transcription; modern variations on APA-based phonological orthography; and the community orthography adopted by the tribe and designed for use on a typewriter. In an effort to maintain fidelity, all original sources are included in the COLRC where possible. Where older orthographies have been updated, the process of systematic change is documented in the COLRC. Advances in phonological and morphological understanding of Coeur d’Alene are reflected by inclusion of alternative analyses of published data. In short, we believe the COLRC can serve as an example of grass-roots digital language resources following best practices...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a wealth}} of {{information}} about financial systems that is embedded in document collections. In this paper, we focus on a specialized text extraction task for this domain. The objective is to extract mentions of names of financial institutions, or FI names, from financial prospectus documents, and to identify the corresponding real world entities, e. g., by matching against a corpus of such entities. The tasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Resolution (ER); both are well studied in the literature. Our contribution is to develop a rule-based approach that will exploit lists of FI names for both tasks; our solution is labeled Dict-based NER and Rank-based ER. Since the FI names are typically represented by a root, and a suffix that modifies the root, we use these lists of FI names to create specialized <b>root</b> and suffix <b>dictionaries.</b> To evaluate the effectiveness of our specialized solution for extracting FI names, we compare Dict-based NER with a general purpose rule-based NER solution, ORG NER. Our evaluation highlights the benefits and limitations of specialized versus general purpose approaches, and presents additional suggestions for tuning and customization for FI name extraction. To our knowledge, our proposed solutions, Dict-based NER and Rank-based ER, and the <b>root</b> and suffix <b>dictionaries,</b> are the first attempt to exploit specialized knowledge, i. e., lists of FI names, for rule-based NER and ER...|$|R

40|$|In 2010 Chang {{presented}} the T APS Checklist, “intended to help depositors of language materials assess digital language archives based on (1) areas of special concern to linguists and language communities (Target and Access) and (2) recommended best practices {{for the long-term}} preservation of digital information (Preservation and Sustainability) ” (2010 : iv). In 2009, two volunteers with no webpage creation experience created an online resource for the Coeur d’Alene community and scholars which included a searchable <b>root</b> <b>dictionary,</b> stem list, and affix list along with over 1, 200 pages of previously unpublished fieldnotes and typed manuscripts. Additionally, other resources such as links to original publications in various digital archives and information regarding the resources creation and history {{were included in the}} website. I n 2011, linguists, community members, and an engineer decided to use the TAPS Checklist to update the 2009 website. The goal was to create online language resources at the grassroots level in line with the best practices outlined in Chang 2010. Although the TAPS Checklist was designed for assessment by depositors, we decided to use it to inform the updating of the 2009 website. To this end, we treated the directory containing the resources accessed via the internet browser interface as an “archive”. The goal has been to develop and maintain this directory as nearly as possible with the checklist outlined in Chang 2010. This presentation highlights advantages of using the TAPS Checklist as a guide for the development of community-based digital language projects. We argue that using the best practices outlined in Chang 2010 can ensure longevity and accessibility of important digital language resources. Further, following such practices can ensure materials that would not necessarily be appropriate for archives (e. g. interactive digital dictionaries) can be created and maintained in a similar fashion and thus be available for use in the future. We compare the 2009 website with the current updated site, which we call the Coeur d’Alene Online Language Resource Center (COLRC). We present some necessary changes made to bring it in line with the TAPS Checklist, changes such as the development of the following: metadata grounded in the Dublin Core and extended elements; Mission Statement including the succession plan; disaster plan; backup and storage plan; history of resources and their origin; maintenance plan; among other elements. We believe the COLRC can be an example of how existing online language resources can be updated to conform to best practices. References Chang, Debbie. 2010.

40|$|Root Word (RW) Analysis Approach for Universal Words (UWs) in Bangla Language is a {{technique}} which helps {{to find out more}} correct universal words more accurately and quickly than other available techniques. The main problem with universal word creation is that, as Bangla sentences varies semantically depending {{on the use of the}} same root in different sentences, it is important to get accurate universal words or universal expressions according to this variation of the sentence structure. The length of the sentence also plays an important role in determining the performance of the output. If length of the sentence is large enough and more complex, it will be problematic for the parser to make specified language which may not imply accurate meaning as required. In this paper a new method, termed as Root word Analysis Approach for converting Bangla to UNL has been investigated Universal Word construction. Root word Analysis Approach begins generation in a constructive fashion by adding some rule/criterion one after another which also shows how to use different meaning of <b>root</b> words using <b>dictionary</b> according to <b>root</b> words in different sentences...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of information retrieval in arabic language is very problematic {{due to the}} specific morphological and structural changes in the language. To extract information from an arabic document, the involved methods must answer the following question: "How can we find {{the root of the}} word we search". To find a word in an arabic dictionary, first you must extract the root of this word and then find this <b>root</b> in the <b>dictionary.</b> This is because the vocabulary of the arabic language is essentially built from the roots derivation. The roots are words composed of three to five consonants letters. To address these problems, several methods have been proposed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a preliminary classification of arabic information extraction methods. These methods can be classified into two main categories. The first one is called "Stemmer". This category includes the following subcategories: Stemmer based on affixes, Stemmer based on translation and Stemmer based on pattern and affixes. The second is called "N-gram". This category regroups the subcategories: N-gram based on Dice's similarity coefficient and N-gram based on “Manhattan distance” dissimilarity coefficient. However, we find methods which implement the two approaches "Stemmer " and "N-gram". This work contributes to decide on the more appropriate arabic information extraction method...|$|R
40|$|Turkish {{is a rich}} {{language}} in terms of verb types and words. This research is limited to Turkish spoken in Turkey, and its verb <b>roots.</b> Turkish <b>dictionary</b> of Turkish Language Association (2011) is {{the main source of}} this study. This study was prepared by taking into account of written, audio and visual resources during the period of Turkish spoken in Turkey. From basic education to university education, this dictionary {{is one of the most}} important sources of Turkish lessons. Within this framework, the verb roots that are in the dictionary have been accepted as Turkish spoken in Turkey’s verb roots and study field were established. The number of verb roots which wasn’t encountered in any source, including Turkish language grammar books previously, were determined in this study and these verb roots were classified in terms of structure and meaning. In terms of structure, the verb roots consist of at least two sounds at most six sounds but among these verb roots three-and four-sounded ones are outnumbered. And also in terms of their meaning features single and multi meaning verb roots are determined. In addition to this, this study focuses on the mental verb roots which have also drawn attention on them by the recently done Turkish researches and emphasized on the root verbs. This study was carried out on the basis of common methods in Turkish studies, but in the objective and outcome parts the lack of Turkish course books and teaching Turkish verb roots are emphasized. Verb type words in general in all languages but in particularly in Turkish form the staff of the basic words of Turkish language. In terms of Turkish which is an agglutinative language, affixes are as important as word roots. Turkish language that is rich in affixes and roots has a productive character. Attention was taken to this aspect of Turkish with the help of verb roots All in all, the subject of this study deserves to be highlighted in many ways. Besides providing new research data, emphasis was made in terms of teaching Turkish and aimed to contribute to the world of science...|$|R
40|$|Documentary {{language}} {{materials that}} {{serve the needs}} of local source communities differ from those designed for academic researchers. Local communities encompass users with diverse interests and abilities, everyone from pre-school learners to fluent speakers. This paper examines the language needs of community language workers, particularly language teachers and translators, who are an especially important local audience. Although the number of community language workers is typically small, they play a disproportionate role as language activists in developing teaching resources, instructing classes, and using the language in public settings. They are among the most literate members of the local community, and commonly work to enhance their spoken language fluency. They have often trained with academic language researchers and are among the most frequent users of documentary resources. This paper examines the needs of Kaska language workers in Ross River and Watson Lake, Yukon who, over the last six months, have contributed to a collaborative on-line Kaska dictionary project conducted in collaboration between two First Nations, the Yukon Department of Education, and university-based researchers. We consider the extent to which design options, including the use of contemporary digital and web-based technologies, have facilitated or failed to facilitate the usability of the dictionary for community language workers. Dene (Athabaskan) dictionaries pose problems for dictionary makers and users relating to the complex structure of verbs. Hargus (2012) has pointed out that what might be construed as verbal headword entries in Dene languages are discontinuous, unpronounceable, non-word entities. Similarly Poser (2003) says that because of the extensive prefixation and complex verb stem variation in these languages there is a basic dilemma between a <b>root</b> based analytical <b>dictionary</b> (requiring extensive knowledge of abstract language structure) and presenting an overwhelming number of fully inflected forms. We explore a compromise organizational structure that utilizes access through English translational equivalents, Kaska entries organized by Kaska roots, and paradigms of selected inflected forms. We consider the advantages of using linked sound files as well as written text and reference to sentences, conversations and narratives recorded with fluent speakers. Finally we consider what types of recorded materials are most useful for Kaska language workers in their roles as language instructors and advanced language learners.
