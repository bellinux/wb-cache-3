50|$|There are occurrences where a handoff is unsuccessful. Lots of {{research}} was conducted regarding this. In the late 80's the main reason was found out. Because frequencies cannot be reused in adjacent cells, when a user moves from one cell to another, a new frequency must be allocated for the call. If a user moves into a cell when all available channels are in use, the userâ€™s call must be terminated. Also, there {{is the problem of}} signal interference where adjacent cells overpower each other resulting in <b>receiver</b> <b>desensitization.</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} an electromagnetic characterization analysis {{in order to}} ascertain if integrated masts are an effective ship radiofrequency electromagnetic interference mitigation strategy. Free space and fitted antenna radiation patterns, and fitted relative near field power flux densities of a linear array transmitting antenna, and the mutual antenna-to-antenna coupling between a linear array transmit and receive antennas, both fitted on the same mast structure, was determined. Overall, the mast structure can reduce the mutual antenna-to-antenna coupling (up to ~ 20 dB) and can affect the fitted antenna radiation pattern. There is both significantly high (i. e., up to 0 dB) and low (~ - 30 dB) fitted relative near field power flux density within {{the vicinity of the}} transmitting antenna and regions around the mast structure. All this depends on the location and position of the transmit antenna relative to the mast structure, and the location of the receiver antenna relative to the transmit antenna. Both desensitization and third order subharmonic distortions non-linear effects on the receiver antenna system were also assessed due to the fitted relative near field power densities. Depending on the specifications of the <b>receiver</b> system, <b>desensitization</b> (or gain compression) was found to be significant, whereas, third order sub-harmonic distortion was not [...] Prepared for: Defense Science and Technology Organization Australia Edinburgh SA 5111, Australi...|$|R
40|$|In {{the quest}} to {{increase}} channel bandwidths in wireless communication systems, two important trends are to move towards wider continuous bands at mm-wave frequencies and to aggregate smaller bands at cellular frequencies. In this dissertation {{a few of the}} challenges and possible circuit and DSP solutions for efficient high data rate communication using these techniques are described. First, an issue relating to cellular uplink carrier aggregation is discussed and a DSP based solution developed. Second, the design of a broad band CMOS PA for mm-wave applications is presented. Third, the design of an mm-wave predistortion system and its use to predistort an array of mm-wave CMOS SOI PAs is described. In the near term, cellular carriers plan on employing carrier aggregation to increase data rates. This can lead to significant <b>receiver</b> <b>desensitization</b> for a number of LTE band combinations, because of the cross-modulation products created by the nonlinearity of RF front-end components. To mitigate this effect, an all-digital cancellation algorithm is proposed in this thesis that canceled the cross-modulation product and improved the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and error-vector-magnitude (EVM) of the desired received signal by up to 20 dB. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation, the possibility of using mm-wave CMOS PAs for wideband communication is described. The design of CMOS stacked-FET PAs with an emphasis on appropriate complex impedances between the transistors is presented. The stacking of multiple FETs enables the use of higher supply voltages, which in turn allows higher output power and a broader bandwidth output matching network. A 4 -stack amplifier design that achieves a saturated output power greater than 21 dBm while achieving a maximum power-added- efficiency (PAE) greater than 20 % from 38 GHz to 47 GHz is reported. Finally, the thesis describes predistortion of an array of stacked-FET PAs after spatial power combining. Predistortion improved the signal quality to a high level, which allowed the use of complex modulation schemes, which in turn allows high data rates in a spectrally efficient manner. After predistortion a 100 -MHz wide, 1024 -QAM signal was demodulated with an EVM of 1. 3 %, which corresponds to a data rate of 1 Gb/...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} data usage by mobile phone users requires higher data rates which, in turn, calls for employing larger bandwidths and flexible transmission schemes. To meet these demands, advanced solutions such as higher-order modulation techniques, multiantenna and multicarrier transmission shemes, among others, have been developed with time. Carrier aggregation (CA) {{is also one of}} the techniques that has been proposed, where multiple component carriers (CCs) are aggregated together to form larger transmission bandwidth in order to support high data rate requirements, while also enabling efficient spectrum utilization. In this thesis, the problem of self-interference in radio transceivers supporting interband CA, where separate transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) chains are used for each CC, is studied and analyzed. At the transmitter the nonlinear behavior of the radio front-end components generates spurious intermodulation distortion components of the transmit CCs which, in some cases, may appear in one of the configured RX operating bands, causing self-interference. Moreover, the CCs are also distorted in a nonlinear fashion by each of the individual power amplifiers (PAs) in the transmitter chain, which means that the self-interference is actually produced by a cascade of two nonlinearities. The resulting self-interference may lead to the blockage of desired received signal, thus causing own <b>receiver</b> <b>desensitization.</b> In order to investigate and formulate a solution to this problem, in this thesis, a signal model for self-interference is first derived incorporating the nonlinearities of the TX PAs and passive front-end components. Then, a digital cancellation solution, utilizing the original transmit data and estimated parameters, is proposed to efficiently suppress the self-interference at the receiver band. The performance of the suggested method is first tested through waveform simulations, and then through practical radio frequency (RF) measurements adopting LTE-Advanced mobile transceiver components. It is observed that the self-interference is efficiently suppressed close to the receiver thermal noise floor by the proposed digital cancellation solution and sufficient cancellation of about 18. 2 dB is achieved. All the results based on the waveform simulations and practical RF measurements are presented in this thesis work. The obtained results suggest that the digital cancellation is one potential approach for improving the receiver sensitivity in interband CA transceivers while also relaxing the RF components' linearity requirements...|$|E
