General Niazi had ordered the Pakistan army to live off the land because of logistical difficulties, and Maj. General A.O.

Instead, the C-130 planes (which had played a crucial role during Operation Searchlight) were withdrawn from the province, diminishing the airlift capacity of the Pakistani forces further. The Mukti Bahini had sabotaged 231 bridges and 122 rail lines by November 1971 (thus diminishing transport capacity to 10 percent of normal), and complicated the delivery of the daily minimum 600 tons of supplies to the army units.|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} processes and associated water quality in many lakes mainly {{depend on their}} transport behaviors. Most existing methodologies for investigating transport behaviors are based on physically based numerical models. The pollutant transport trajectory and residence time of Poyang Lake {{are thought to have}} important implications for the steadily deteriorating water quality and the associated rapid environmental changes during the flood period. This study used a hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21) in conjunction with transport and particle-tracking sub-models to provide comprehensive investigation of transport behaviors in Poyang Lake. Model simulations reveal that the lake’s prevailing water flow patterns cause a unique transport trajectory that primarily develops from the catchment river mouths to the downstream area along the lake’s main flow channels, similar to a <b>river-transport</b> behavior. Particle tracking results show that the mean residence time of the lake is 89 days during July–September. The effect of the Yangtze River (the effluent of the lake) on the residence time is stronger than that of the catchment river inflows. The current study represents a first attempt to use a combined model approach to provide insights into the transport behaviors for a large river–lake system, given proposals to manage the pollutant inputs both directly to the lake and catchment rivers...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of surface processes to climatic forcing is fundamental {{for understanding the}} impacts of climate change on landscape evolution. In the Himalaya, most large rivers feature prominent fill terraces that record an imbalance between sediment supply and transport capacity, presumably due to past fluctuations in monsoon precipitation and/or effects of glaciation at high elevation. Here, we present volume estimates, chronological constraints, and ^(10) Be-derived paleo-erosion rates from a prominent valley fill in the Yamuna catchment, Garhwal Himalaya, to elucidate the coupled {{response of}} rivers and hillslopes to Pleistocene climate change. Although precise age control is complicated due to methodological problems, the new data support formation of the valley fill during the late Pleistocene and its incision during the Holocene. We interpret this timing to indicate that changes in discharge and <b>river-transport</b> capacity were major controls. Compared to the present day, late Pleistocene hillslope erosion rates were higher {{by a factor of}} ∼ 2 – 4, but appear to have decreased during valley aggradation. The higher late Pleistocene erosion rates are largely unrelated to glacial erosion and could be explained by enhanced sediment production on steep hillslopes due to increased periglacial activity that declined as temperatures increased. Alternatively, erosion rates that decrease during valley aggradation are also consistent with reduced landsliding from threshold hillslopes as a result of rising base levels. In that case, the similarity of paleo-erosion rates {{near the end of the}} aggradation period with modern erosion rates might imply that channels and hillslopes are not yet fully coupled everywhere and that present-day hillslope erosion rates may underrepresent long-term incision rates...|$|E

Study of the western Louisiana coastal wetlands found hurricanes appear to be the [...] "overwhelming pathway" [...] by which sediment is deposited in that location, accounting for amounts of sediment far greater than amounts deposited by the local river systems. [...] Based annualized estimates of magnitude of sediment deposition, hurricanes have been found to deposit hundreds of times more sediment in these coastal wetland regions than man-made river diversions intended to redirect <b>river-transported</b> sediment to starving wetland systems.

40|$|Limited {{measurements}} along Greenland’s remote coastline hamper quantification of {{the sediment}} and associated nutrients draining the Greenland ice sheet, despite the potential influence of <b>river-transported</b> suspended sediment on phytoplankton blooms and carbon sequestration. Here we calibrate satellite imagery to estimate suspended sediment concentration for 160 proglacial rivers across Greenland. Combining these suspended sediment reconstructions with numerical calculations of meltwater runoff, we quantify {{the amount and}} spatial pattern of sediment export from the ice sheet. We find that, although runoff from Greenland represents only 1. 1 % of the Earth’s freshwater flux, the Greenland ice sheet produces approximately 8 % of the modern fluvial export of suspended sediment to the global ocean. Sediment loads are highly variable between rivers, consistent with observed differences in ice dynamics and thus with control by glacial erosion. Rivers that originate from deeply incised, fast-moving glacial tongues form distinct sediment-export hotspots: just 15 % of Greenland’s rivers transport 80 % of the total sediment load of the ice sheet. We conclude that future acceleration of melt and ice sheet flow may increase sediment delivery from Greenland to its fjords and the nearby ocean...|$|R
40|$|Salt {{marshes and}} {{estuaries}} are key environments for organic matter (OM) burial, which plays {{an essential role}} in the global carbon cycle (López-Capel et al., 2006). Common to these environments is the diversity of OM sources, which is usually composed by a complex mixture of terrestrial and marine residues originated from the decomposition of vegetal, animal and microbial organisms (Hedges and Keil, 1999). Concomitantly, anthropogenic contaminants are transported and deposited. The proposed research is focused on the assessment of OM inputs changes in the salt marshes of Alfeite, which may be related to environmental changes in the Tagus estuary. The Tagus discharges into the Atlantic Ocean close to Lisbon through a 350 km 2 mesotidal estuary, being the third largest estuary in Europe. It acts as a depocenter for <b>river-transported</b> sediments, with a sedimentation rate of around 80 cm kyr- 1. Run-off and sediment load carried by Tagus river to estuary and towards the continental shelf has been highly modified during last centuries because of a range of anthropogenic activities (including damming, urbanization, deforestation and dredging) and natural events (floodings and tsunamis).

40|$|High-resolution palynological {{analysis}} of a 38 -cm-long core collected from Lake Sapanca, northwest Turkey, reveals large earthquakes {{that occurred during the}} second half of the 20 th century along the North Anatolian Fault Zone. Four events have disturbed the lacustrine sedimentary sequence. Three of the four events are historical earthquakes in 1999 in Izmit, 1967 in Mudurnu and 1957 in Abant. These events are recorded in the core by turbiditic deposits and reworked sediment and by low overall palynomorph concentrations but high values of thick-exined pollen, fern spores and fungal spores. Palynomorphs in the event beds have been grouped based on their associations in modern moss, river and lake samples. The inferred mechanisms of transport and sources for the palynomorphs are: 1 - lake sediment displaced by slump, 2 - collapsed shoreline sediment owing to seiche, waves and sudden lake level changes, 3 - subsidence of deltas and 4 - <b>river-transported</b> soil and sediment from upland areas. The 1999 Izmit earthquake is only weakly recorded by palynomorphs, probably due to recent engineering control on the rivers.

Accounts of rare health disorders in residents of Fort Chipewyan and deformed fish in downstream ecosystems provided impetus for several recent expert-panel assessments regarding the societal and environmental consequences of this multi-billion-dollar industry.

Methods/Principal Findings: Based on analyses of lake sediment cores, we provide evidence that the Athabasca Delta has been a natural repository of PACs carried by the Athabasca River for at least the past two centuries. We detect no measureable increase in the concentration and proportion of <b>river-transported</b> bitumen-associated indicator PACs in sediments deposited in a flood-prone lake since onset of oil sands development.

40|$|Materials from {{different}} spheres of the Earth are ultimately delivered to bottom sediments, which {{serve as a}} natural recorder of the functioning of other spheres and originate {{as a result of}} the accumulation of their substances. Sedimentary material and species of <b>river-transported</b> elements are subjected to dramatic reworking in marginal filters, where river and sea waters are mixed. These processes are most important for the Caspian Sea, where runoffs of rivers (especially the Volga River) and the intense development and transportation of hydrocarbon fuel by tankers and pipelines (related to the coastal petroleum industry in the Sumgait and Baku ports, Apsheron Peninsula) are potential sources of hydrocarbon pollution. Previously obtained data showed that the total content of hydrocarbon fraction (i. e., the sum of aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) in bottom sediments varied within 29 - 1820 µg/g. The content of petroleum hydrocarbons in the northeastern Caspian region varied from 0. 052 to 34. 09 µg/g with the maximum content in the Tengiz field. The content of six polyarenes in the Volga delta sediments was no more than 40 ng/g. To determine the recent HC pollution of bottom sediments and trends in the functioning of the Volga marginal filter, in summer of 2003 and 2004 we analyzed bottom sediments (58 samples) in the river waterway; Kirovsk channel; Bakhtemir and Ikryanoe branches; tributaries of the Kizan, Chagan, and other rivers; and the Caspian seashore...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the yearly}} maximum {{suspended}} sediment concentrations (SSC) in the Yellow River and its tributaries, the rivers {{are divided into}} three types of more than 300, 20 - 300, and less than 20 kg/m(3). The middle Yellow River basin {{is located in the}} transitional zone from subhumid to semiarid climates, and covered by a thick loess mantle. Neighboring on the desert areas to the northwest, the surface material of the Loess Plateau exhibits some marked areal differentiation in grain size and forms three zones covered by sandy loess, (typical) loess and clayey loess from northwest to southeast. Controlled by these physico-geographical conditions, the grain size of <b>river-transported</b> sediment shows some particular characteristics; at small water discharge or SSC, the grain size of suspended sediment abruptly decreases to a minimum with increasing water discharge or SSC. At water discharge of more than ca. 40 m(3) /s or at SSC of more than ca. 40 kg/m(3), the grain size increases with water discharge or SSC. During the low-stage season, the relatively clear baseflow may scour the coarse bed materials, so the suspended sediment is relatively coarse. In the rainy season, rainstorm runoff washes out fine loess materials to the river, making suspended sediment fine. During relatively strong rainstorms, there often occur hyperconcentrated flows at SSC of more than 300 kg/m(3). The relatively coarse grains could then remain suspended in the mixture of water and fine suspended sediment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index, a proxy for <b>river-transported</b> soil OC into the ocean, was determined from the distributions of these GDGTs. The GDGT-derived parameters were compared with other bulk geochemical data (i. e. C:N ratio and stable carbon isotopic composition). The GDGT-derived and bulk geochemical data indicate that riverine SPM and riverbed sediments in the lower Amazon River and its tributaries are a mixture of C 3 plant-derived soil OC and aquatic-derived OC. The branched GDGTs in the SPM and riverbed sediments did not predominantly originate from the high Andes soils (> 2500 m in altitude) as was suggested previously. However, further constraint on the soil source area of branched GDGTs was hampered due to the deficiency of soil data from the lower montane forest areas in the Andes. Our study also revealed seasonal and interannual variation in GDGT composition as well as soil OC discharge, which was {{closely related to the}} hydrological cycle.

The results show high concentration of REEs in surface waters, in particular close to the mouth of the Orinoco, and a middle-REE-enrichment that is strongest in the south and east of the study area suggesting that fluvial inputs are the main sources rather than REEs supplied by Saharan dust. The surface waters close to the Orinoco are heavy REE enriched compared to the potential fluvial sources, emphasizing the importance of processes in the estuaries and the surface ocean that preferentially remove light- and middle-REEs. Relatively small heavy-REE enrichments in near-bottom water samples {{at the mouth of the}} Orinoco may be the result of preferential release of light REEs from <b>river-transported</b> sediments. The REE patterns of distinct subsurface water masses are largely coherent across the Caribbean basin, suggesting that the lateral transport of preformed compositions is not significantly influenced by vertical processes of scavenging and release. In particular, low Dy/Er molar ratios are associated with Antarctic Intermediate Water and have most likely been advected into the Caribbean from the Southern Ocean. In contrast, deep waters in the Caribbean are enriched in light and middle REEs compared to incoming Upper North Atlantic Deep Water suggesting that release from sinking particles or from sediments is an important source of these REEs in the deep ocean, in particular when deep water residence times are long...|$|R
40|$|The assemblages {{of marine}} sediments on the SW Iberian shelf have been {{controlled}} by contributions from distinct sources, which have varied {{in response to}} environmental changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The rapid, decadal scale Mediterranean overturning circulation permits mixing of suspended particles from the entire Mediterranean Sea. They are entrained into the suspended particulate matter (SPM) carried by Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), which enters the eastern North Atlantic through the Strait of Gibraltar and spreads at intermediate depths in the Gulf of Cadiz and along the Portuguese continental margin. Other major sediment sources that {{have contributed to the}} characteristics and budget of SPM along the flow path of MOW on the SW Iberian shelf are North African dust and <b>river-transported</b> particles from the Iberian Peninsula. To reconstruct climate- and circulation-driven changes in the supply of sediments over the past ~ 23000 cal yr B. P., radiogenic Nd, Sr and Pb isotope records of the clay-size sediment fraction were obtained from one gravity core in the Gulf of Cadiz (577 m water depth) and from two gravity cores on the Portuguese shelf (1745 m, 1974 m water depth). These records are supplemented by time series analyses of clay mineral abundances from the same set of samples. Contrary to expectations, the transition from the LGM to the Holocene was not accompanied by strong changes in sediment provenance or transport, whereas Heinrich Event 1 (H 1) and the African Humid Period (AHP) were marked by significantly different isotopic signatures reflecting changes in source contributions caused by supply of ice rafted material originating from the North American craton during H 1 and diminished supply of Saharan dust during the AHP. The data also reveal that the timing of variations in the clay mineral abundances was decoupled from that of the radiogenic isotope signatures...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the eruptive history of El Chichón volcano. In order to address future hazards for the area, the volcano’s {{behavior}} should be better understood. Its eruption record includes 13 events since 6500 BC. Because this record is largely based on the poorly exposed and highly incomplete proximal stratigraphy, distal tephra deposits may yield a more complete archive. Two tephrostratigraphic targets are located within the Usumacinta-Grijalva delta, ca. 150 kilometer north of El Chichón. A back-barrier swamp hosts a sequence of tephra fall deposits, and a beach ridge sequence a reworked, <b>river-transported</b> tephra archive. Both tephrostratigraphic settings have been studied in this thesis, whereby age-depth and age-distance models, supported by C- 14 dated organic material in a peat core, served as a chronological framework for individual tephra layers and beach ridges, respectively. Grain-size distributions and chemical compositions of juvenile glass particles and mineral phases were used to characterize the tephras. Nine tephra-fall layers were identified in a peat core from the swamp. Although all studied glass shards are rhyolithic in composition, three clusters can be distinguished: cluster 1 with 70 - 72. 5 wt% SiO 2, cluster 2 with 72. 5 - 76 wt. % SiO 2 and cluster 3 with 78 - 79 wt% SiO 2. The glass shards of clusters 1 and 2 represent Holocene tephra-fall deposits from El Chichón, whereas the cluster 3 shards appear to be redeposited/reworked material. The studied beach ridge sequence contains only glass with a cluster 3 composition. It is interpreted as river-reworked material of tephra-fall deposits from the caldera-forming Los Chocoyos eruption of Atitlán caldera (Guatemala) that occurred 84 ka ago. The distal stratigraphy of El Chichón documented in this study shows that the volcano produced at least four Plinian eruptions in the late Holocene (since 50 BC), with intervals of roughly 500 years.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in soils {{has been shown}} to correlate with pH and mean annual air temperature. Because of this dependence brGDGTs have found an application as palaeoclimate proxies in coastal marine sediments, {{based on the assumption that}} their distribution is not altered during the transport from soils to marine systems by rivers. To study the processes acting on the brGDGT distributions, we analysed the full suite of brGDGTs, including the recently described 6 -Me brGDGTs, in both the suspended particulate matter (SPM) of the Siberian Yenisei River and the SPM and sediments of its outflow in the Kara Sea. The brGDGT distribution in the SPM of the Yenisei River was fairly constant and characterized by high abundances of the 6 -Me brGDGTs, reflecting their production at the neutral pH of the river water. However, the brGDGT distribution showed marked shifts in the marine system. Firstly, in the Yenisei River Mouth, the fractional abundance of the 6 -Me brGDGTs decreases sharply. The brGDGT signature in the Yenisei River Mouth possibly reflects brGDGTs delivered during the spring floods that may carry a different distribution. Also, coastal cliffs were shown to contain brGDGTs and to influence especially those sites without major river inputs (e. g. Khalmyer Bay). Further removed from the river mouth, in-situ production of brGDGTs in the marine system influences the distribution. However, also the fractional abundance of the tetramethylated brGDGT Ia increases, resulting in a distribution that is distinct from in-situ produced signals at similar latitudes (Svalbard). We suggest that this shift may be caused by preferential degradation of labile (riverine in-situ produced) brGDGTs and the subsequent enrichment in less labile (soil) material. The offshore distribution indeed agrees with the brGDGT distribution encountered in a lowland peat. This implies that the offshore Kara Sea sediments possibly carry a soil-dominated signal, indicating potential for palaeoclimate reconstructions at this site. Both in the river system and coastal cliffs, brGDGTs were much more abundant than crenarchaeol, an archaeal isoprenoid GDGT, resulting in high (> 0. 93) Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index values. Moving downstream in the marine sediments, a decrease in brGDGT concentrations, coeval with an increase in crenarchaeol, resulted in decreasing BIT index values. This decrease correlates with changes in bulk proxies for terrigenous input (d 13 Corg, C/N), confirming the use of the BIT index to trace the delivery of <b>river-transported</b> and coastal cliff-derived terrigenous organic matter...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this study {{represent}} an attempt to construct an inventory of contaminants of several environmentally important organic contaminant classes in seawater, suspended particles and sediments and to consider their sources, persistence, physicochemical properties and potential marine ecological impacts. A series of coastal and estuarine surveys was carried out in the River Humber and it's coastal region to determine transport mechanisms and fates of anthropogenic inputs to the Humber system and provide a quantitative understanding of the behaviour of the selected contaminants. Also non-priority contaminants have been identified which potentially contribute to ecotoxicological impacts. All of the compounds investigated showed seasonal variations, although trends differed. Dissolved atrazine generally increased gradually from winter to summer before declining in autumn. For dissolved PAHs the highest dissolved concentrations were found in autumn while the lowest were in summer. Atrazine behaved conservatively in the estuary while a non-conservative behaviour was demonstrated for dissolved lindane, even though riverine inputs to the estuary from the Trent and Ouse are the major source for both compounds. The results show that position and type of inputs as well as the Intrinsic physicochemical properties of these compounds are critical in regulating their behaviour in estuarine and coastal environments. The two coastal surveys show that although some compounds such as atrazine and lindane were detectable at all stations, their concentrations were generally in the low ng L- 1 range. Concentrations followed the general path of the Humber Plume with only a minor influence from the Wash, confirming that the Humber catchment is the major source of input of these pollutants in the study area. Pyrene was detected at most locations while malathion concentrations were below the detection limit at all sites outside of the estuary. The results showed that the Humber system is a sink for all the organic contaminants studied, regardless of their origin, solubility, hydrophobicity or degradation potential. The Humber estuary removed between 13 and 100 % of atrazine. lindane, PCB 77 and PCB 118, although the degree of removal is substantially more significant for the more hydrophobic compounds PCB 77 and PCB 118. Atrazine and lindane were removed by 28 and 13 %, respectively. The total balance shows that 5 and 20 % of <b>river-transported</b> fluoranthene and pyrene, respectively, are removed from the estuary. The results reported address a wide range of environmental contaminants and biogeochemical processes and have contributed substantially to several papers which have been published in peer reviewed international journals. Pollutants studied originate from many different sources and have a spectrum of physico-chemical properties. This research has answered many questions relating to their estuarine and coastal behaviour, but also raises a whole series of new issues that will require research in the future.

40|$|The Dry Valley {{region of}} Victoria Land {{is the largest}} {{ice-free}} area in Antarctica. Within the frigid arid environment of the Dry Valleys, where the mean annual air temperature is - 20 ℃, there are several permanently ice-covered, amictic, saline lakes occupying undrained bedrock depressions. Three of these lakes, namely Lakes Vanda, Bonney and Joyce, have been studied {{with the aim of}} determining the nature of their bottom sediments and relating the stratigraphy of bottom sediment cores to Holocene climatic fluctuations. These lakes have an area of 0. 8 to 5. 2 km², are from 35 to 68 m in maximum depth and have an ice-cover 3 to 4 m thick. The lakes are chemically and thermally stratified and receive their water from meltwater streams draining the local glaciers. The bottom sediments consist of detrital sands and silts, chemical precipitates and organic material. The detrital sediments consist of feldspar and quartz with smaller quantities of hornblende, augite, hypersthene and mica that are derived locally from the rocks exposed on the adjacent valley sides. These sediments are mainly wind-transported or, to a lesser extent, <b>river-transported</b> into the lakes. The wind derived sediments are either blown onto the lake-ice, where they eventually sink to the lake-floor, or they are blown into the moat developed about the shores of the lake in summer. The chemical precipitates consist mainly of gypsum, halite, aragonite and calcite whose constituent elements were derived from meltwater streams discharging into the lakes; however Lake Bonney also received dissolved solids of marine origin about 300, 000 years B. P. and 1, 200 years B. P. From the sequence of chemical precipitate - rich bands and grain-size cycles in cores from Lakes Vanda and Joyce, together with the stratigraphy in the Lake Bonney cores, a sequence of climatic fluctuations is inferred. Colder climatic phases are most probably associated with periods of low lake-level during which chemical precipitates formed following the concentration of brines under frigid evaporitic conditions. At these times the sediment input from meltwater streams was low because of the locking-up of water in valley glaciers, and the main source of sediment would probably then be wind-derived. U/Th dating of the chemical precipitates has provided an absolute record of past climatic changes which indicate that the major glacier systems in the Dry Valley region were nonsynchronous. Low lake levels occurred in Lake Vanda some 2, 000 and 5, 500 years B. P. and on at least four earlier occasions. Sediment cores from Lake Joyce indicate a period of low lake-level about 3, 000 years B. P. The Lake Bonney cores suggest periods of low lake-level occurred following each of the marine incursions into the valley (300, 000 and 1, 200 years B. P.) and that the advance of the Taylor Glacier into the Bonney Basin at least 10, 000 years B. P. probably coincided with the Taylor I Glaciation. Frigid evaporitic conditions have continued to operate in Lake Bonney since 1, 200 years B. P. with halite crystals forming on the lake-floor. However, the lake-level has been steadily rising over the last 500 years...|$|R
40|$|Floodplain lakes are {{strongly}} regulated by river connectivity because floodwaters exert strong {{influence on the}} water balance, the physical, chemical and biological limnological conditions, and the influx of contaminants. The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Alberta (Canada) is a hydrologically complex landscape and is an important node in the upper Mackenzie River Drainage Basin. The ecological integrity of the PAD is potentially threatened by multiple environmental stressors, yet {{our understanding of the}} hydroecology of this large floodplain remains underdeveloped. Indeed, ever since the planning and construction of the WAC Bennett Dam (1960 s), concerns have grown over the effects of upstream human activities on the lakes of the PAD. More recently, concerns over the health of the PAD have intensified and come to the fore of national and international dialogue due to water abstraction and mining and processing activities by the rapidly expanding oil sands industry centred in Fort McMurray Alberta. Currently, widespread perception is that upstream human activities have reduced water levels and frequency of flooding at the PAD, which have lowered nutrient availability and productivity of perched basin lakes, and have increased supply of pollutants from oil sands. However, these perceptions remain based on insufficient knowledge of pre-impact conditions and natural variability. Current and past relations between hydrology and limnology of PAD lakes are mostly undocumented, particularly during the important spring freshet period when the effects of river flood waters are strongest. Similarly, knowledge of the deposition of oil-sands- related contaminants in the PAD remains insufficient to determine whether anthropogenic activities have increased the deposition of important oil-sands-related contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) relative to natural processes. Such knowledge gaps must be filled to achieve effective monitoring, policy and governance concerning impacts of industrial development and the protection of human and environmental health within the PAD and Mackenzie drainage basin. This thesis examines the effects of river flooding (and the lack of) on water clarity, nutrients, chemistry, phytoplankton abundance, epiphyton community composition and the deposition of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in lakes of the Peace-Athabasca Delta. To determine the role of flooding on contemporary epiphytic diatom communities (an abundant and diverse guild of primary producers in PAD lakes), a field experiment was conducted examining the community composition and abundance of epiphytic diatoms in four PAD lakes. Two of these four lakes had received floodwaters that spring and two had not. Epiphytic diatom communities in each lake were sampled during the peak macrophyte biomass period (summer) from two macrophyte taxa (Potamogeton zosteriformis, P. perfoliatus var. richardsonii) and from polypropylene artificial substrates previously deployed that spring. A two-way analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) test identified that epiphytic diatom community composition differed between lakes that flooded and those that did not flood. From the use of similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis, diatom taxa were identified that discriminate between flooded and non-flooded lakes. The relative abundance of ‘strong flood indicator taxa’ was used to construct an event-scale flood record spanning the past ~ 180 years using analyses of sedimentary diatom assemblages from a closed-drainage lake (PAD 5). Results were verified by close agreement with an independent paleo-flood record from a nearby flood-prone oxbow lake (PAD 54) and historical records. Comparison of epiphytic diatoms in flooded and non-flooded lakes in this study provides a promising approach to detect changes in flood frequency, and may have applications for reconstructing other pulse-type disturbances such as hurricanes and pollutant spills. Additionally, this study demonstrates that artificial substrates can provide an effective bio-monitoring tool for lakes of the PAD and elsewhere. To improve our understanding of the hydrolimnological responses of lake in the PAD to flooding, repeated measurements over three years (2003 - 05) were made on a series of lakes along a hydrological gradient. This allowed the role of river flooding to be characterized on limnological conditions of lakes and to identify the patterns and timescales of limnological change after flooding. River floodwaters elevate lake water concentrations of suspended sediment, total phosphorus (TP), SO 4 and dissolved Si (DSi), and reduce concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), DOC and most ions. River flooding increases limnological homogeneity among lakes, because post-flood conditions {{are strongly}} affected by the river water properties. After floodwaters recede, limnological conditions become more heterogeneous among lakes in response to diversity of local basin influences (geology, slope, vegetation, depth, fetch, and biological communities and processes), and limnological changes occur at two distinct timescales. In the weeks to months after flooding, water clarity increases as suspended sediments and TP settle out of the water column. In the absence of flooding for many years to decades, evaporative concentration leads to an increase in most nutrients (TKN, inorganic N, and dissolved P), DOC and ions. Contrary to a prevailing paradigm, these results suggest that regular flooding is not required to maintain high nutrient concentrations. In light of anticipated declines in river discharge, limnological conditions in the southern Athabasca sector will become increasingly less dominated by the short-term effects of flooding, and resemble nutrient- and solute-rich lakes in the northern Peace sector that are infrequently flooded. To determine the roles of the Athabasca River and atmospheric transport as vectors for the deposition of PACs in the PAD, sediment cores spanning the last ~ 200 years were collected from three lakes within the delta. A closed-drainage basin elevated well above the floodplain (PAD 18) was selected to determine temporal patterns of change in PAC concentration due to atmospheric deposition and within-basin production of PACs. Known patterns of paleohydrological changes at the other two lakes (PAD 23 and 31) were used to assess the role of the Athabasca River in delivering PACs to the Athabasca Delta during the ~ 200 year. Well- dated sediment core samples were analysed for 52 alkylated and non-alkylated PACs (method EPA 3540 / 8270 -GC/MS). Sediments deposited in the non-flood prone lake (PAD 18) contained lower concentrations of total PACs compared to sediments deposited during flood-prone periods in the other study lakes, and were dominated by PACs of a pyrogenic rather than bitumen origin. Multivariate analysis of similarity tests identified that the composition of PACs differs between sediments deposited during not flood-prone and flood-prone periods. Subsequent Similarities Percentage (SIMPER) analysis was used and identified seven PACs that are preferentially deposited during flood-prone periods. These seven PACs are bitumen-associated, <b>river-transported</b> and account for 51 % of the total PACs found in oil-sands sediment. At PAD 31, which has been flood-prone both before and since onset of Athabasca oil sands development, identified no measureable differences in both the proportion and concentration of the <b>river-transported</b> indicator PACs in sediments deposited pre- 1940 s versus post- 1982. Our findings suggest that natural erosion of exposed bitumen {{along the banks of the}} Athabasca River and its tributaries is the main process delivering PACs to the Athabasca Delta, and that the spring freshet is a key period for contaminant mobilization and transport. Such key baseline environmental information is essential for informed management of natural resources and human-health concerns by provincial and federal regulatory agencies and industry, and for designing effective long-term monitoring and surveillance programs for the lower Athabasca River watershed in the face of future oil sands development. Further monitoring activities and additional paleolimnological studies of the depositional history of PACs and other oil-sands- and non-oil-sands-related contaminants is strongly recommended. Overall, results of this research identify that river flooding exerts strong control on physical, chemical and biological conditions of lakes within the PAD. However, contrary to prevailing paradigms, the PAD is not a landscape that has been adversely and permanently affected by regulation of the Peace River and industrial development of the oil sands along the Athabasca River. Instead, data from contemporary and paleolimnological studies identify that natural processes continue to dominate the delivery of water and contaminants to the delta. Regular and frequent flooding is not essential to maintain the supply of nutrients and productivity of delta lakes, which has been a widespread paradigm that developed in the absence of objective scientific data. Instead, nutrient concentrations rise over years to decades after flooding and lake productivity increases. During the thesis research, novel approaches were developed and demonstrated to be effective. Namely, new artificial substrate samplers were designed for aquatic biomonitoring that accrue periphyton and can identify the occurrence of flood events. Also, paleolimnological methods were employed to characterize the composition and concentration of PACs supplied by natural processes prior to oil sands industrial activity, which serves as an important benchmark for assessing industrial impacts. These are effective methods that can be employed to improve monitoring programs and scientific understanding of the factors affecting this world-renowned landscape, as well as floodplains elsewhere. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|The {{upward trend}} of various {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) {{concentrations in the}} atmosphere since {{the outset of the}} Industrial Era (ca. 1750) is becoming unequivocally linked to anthropogenic-driven disruption of source-sink interactions binding the major carbon (C) reservoirs within the over-arching Earth System (atmosphere, ocean, land, lithosphere). It is imperative we develop a comprehensive understanding of the natural cycling of elements within each of these reservoirs, and quantitatively constrain the exchange fluxes between them, in order to drive informed land management decisions in the future. Inland waters are one component in this regard which have traditionally received less attention, yet we now recognise inland waters not only transport significant quantities of terrestrial subsidies to the coastal zone, but their typically heterotrophic nature drives carbon dioxide (CO 2) (and other GHG) evasion across the water-air interface, influencing global atmospheric chemistry. Further constraining the role of rivers systems will require the gathering of additional datasets over adequate spatial and temporal scales, especially for regions currently under-represented in the prevailing database, with Africa regarded as providing the highest degree of uncertainty at the global scale. The research here presents local and regional findings from inland waters of Madagascar and Kenya, for which little or no literature data are available characterising their source contributions, in-situ biogeochemical cycling or transport flux dynamics. Sampling regimes included basin-wide campaigns across variable hydrological conditions in each of the Betsiboka and Rianila river basins of Madagascar and the Athi-Galana-Sabaki (A-G-S) river basin of Kenya, as well as high frequency monitoring for two years in the latter. These datasets are often compiled with others from poorly represented inland waters of Africa to demonstrate variability at the regional scale, as well as providing first estimates to the age of riverine C fractions at the global scale. Traditionally, a lack of appropriate proxies has hampered the ability to distinguish riverine organic C (OC) sources at the landscape scale, though the dissection of C 4 grasslands by C 3 -enriched riparian vegetation in the Betsiboka basin provided a unique setting to assess the relative contribution of riparian and more distant landscapes to riverine C pools. The C 3 -rich Rianila basin afforded comparative analysis between C 3 and C 4 dominated river basins. Comparing delta 13 C ratios of bulk sub-basin vegetation (delta 13 CVEG) with those of riverine OC pools, results indicate riverine OC is disproportionately composed of C 3 -derived OM, irrespective of climatic season, even though delta 13 CVEG estimates suggest C 4 biomass accounts for up to 96 % of land cover in some Betsiboka sub-basins. Given the typically low rates of autotrophic production in Malagasy inland waters, and hence the dominance of terrestrial OM subsidies in riverine OC pools, the hydrological disconnection of the more remote C 4 grasslands (relative to the bordering C 3 -enriched riparian fringe) is considered the primary driver of the under-representation of C 4 -derived OM within riverine OC pools in the Betsiboka basin, and our results suggest caution when interpolating paleo-environmental conditions, such as C 3 and C 4 distribution, from the delta 13 C signatures stored in fluvial-derived sediment deposits. Despite the potential of D 14 C signatures to elucidate sources and cycling of different riverine C pools, no comprehensive attempts to synthesize the available information and examine global patterns in the 14 C content of different riverine C pools had been performed. Data from the three river basins comprising the primary focus of the research here in combination with the basins listed above provide ~ 100 new D 14 C measurements of OC transported by inland waters of Africa. Results indicate African riverine dissolved OC (DOC) is typically of modern C 3 origin, whereas the age of particulate OC (POC) was far more variable, reaching ~ 4200 yr BP with a mean and median age of ~ 250 and 80 % of the total load for TSM (~ 86 %), POC (~ 89 %), DOC (~ 81 %), PN (~ 89 %) and TPP (~ 82 %). Our estimated sediment yield of 85 Mg km- 2 yr- 1 remains low on the global scale, while sediment and OC yields were all ~ 2 - to 5 -fold greater than reported yields for the neighbouring and flow regulated Tana River. Rapid pulses of heavily 13 C enriched POC during dry season coincide with peak concentrations of PN, ammonium and CH 4, and suggest bulk inputs of degradable C 4 OM. We argue that large mammalian herbivores might mediate the delivery of C 4 OM to the river. These first estimates of material fluxes from the Sabaki River provide base-line data for future research initiatives assessing the ongoing anthropogenic perturbation of the A-G-S river basin.
