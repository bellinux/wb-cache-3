A science-based regulatory framework to ensure high-quality biosimilars has been established in Europe since 2005 and is monitored and updated on an ongoing basis. The guiding principle of a biosimilar development program is to establish similarity between the biosimilar and the <b>reference</b> <b>medicine</b> by the best possible means, ensuring that the previously proven safety and efficacy of the reference medicinal product also applies to the biosimilar. Development of a biosimilar is underpinned by state-of-the-art analytical techniques to characterize both reference medicines and biosimilars. The extent and nature of the nonclinical in vivo studies and clinical studies to be performed depend on the level of evidence obtained in the previous step(s), including the robustness of the physicochemical, biological, and nonclinical in vitro data. Extrapolation is an important element of the biosimilarity concept. When biosimilar comparability has been demonstrated in one indication, extrapolation of the data package to other indications of the <b>reference</b> <b>medicine</b> could be acceptable, but needs to be scientifically justified and considered in light of the demonstrated level of sameness by all analytical, nonclinical, and clinical data. The credibility of the scientific basis behind the biosimilar concept, and quality of regulatory decision-making, is demonstrated by the successful approval and clinical use of 20 biosimilar medicines since 2006 when Omnitrope® was the first biosimilar to be approved. The regulatory environment for biosimilars continues to evolve, both in recognition of advances in technology/analytical methods and the availability of new targets for biosimilar development.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: The animals {{received}} their respective pre-treatments dissolved in tween 20 (5 % v/v), orally. Ethanol (95 % v/v) was orally administrated to induce superficial hemorrhagic mucosal lesions. Omeprazole (5. 790 × 10 (- 5) M/kg) {{was used as a}} <b>reference</b> <b>medicine.</b> The pre-treatment with the zinc (II) complex (2. 181 × 10 (- 5) and 4. 362 × 10 (- 5) M/kg) protected the gastric mucosa similar to the reference control. They significantly increased the activity levels of nitric oxide, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione and prostaglandin E 2, and decreased the level of malondialdehyde. The histology assessments confirmed the protection through remarkable reduction of mucosal lesions and increased the production of gastric mucosa. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis indicated that the complex might induced Hsp 70 up-regulation and Bax down-regulation. The complex moderately increased the gastroprotectiveness in fine fettle. The acute toxicity approved the non-toxic characteristic of the complex (< 87. 241 × 10 (- 5) M/kg). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The gastroprotective effect of the zinc (II) complex was mainly through its antioxidant activity, enzymatic stimulation of prostaglandins E 2, and up-regulation of Hsp 70.

40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Increasing {{health care}} costs is an {{international}} problem from which South Africa is not excluded. Prescription medication contributes most to these high {{health care costs}}, and methods to reduce their costs to society are implemented worldwide. In South Africa, such a method is a managed care <b>reference</b> <b>medicine</b> price list, as introduced by a PBM (pharmacy benefit management) company. This step had some cost implications in the private health sector in South Africa, and these implications were investigated in this study. Central nervous system (CNS) medicine items are among the top ten medicine items claimed and represent {{a substantial amount of}} the costs of all medicine items claimed during the study period. Antidepressants, a subdivision of the CNS agents, comprise the largest share of CNS agents claimed and CNS costs, and were therefore investigated more closely. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the usage patterns and costs of central nervous system medicine items, and more specifically, the antidepressants, against the background of the implementation of a managed care <b>reference</b> <b>medicine</b> price list in the private sector of South Africa. This study was conducted as a retrospective, non-experimental quantitative research project. The study population consisted of all medicine items claimed as observed on the database over the two-year study period of May 2001 to April 2002 (pre-MPL) and May 2002 to April 2003 (post-MPL). Data were provided by MedschemeTM/lnterpharm, and the Statistical Analysis System® SAS 8. 2 ® was used to extract the data from the database. The central nervous system agents had a prevalence of 8. 10 % (N= 49098736) and a total cost of R 757576976. 72 over the two-year study period. The cost per CNS item increased by 5. 98 % or R 11. 50 per CNS item in the year after MPL implementation, and the cost per prescription containing CNS medicine items increased by 4. 09 % or R 9. 07 per prescription. CNS agents are classified into ten sub-pharmacological groups, according to the MIMSC 3 (Snyman, 2003 : 13 a). One of these sub-pharmacological groups, antidepressants, comprised 33. 97 % of all CNS medicine items claimed (N= 3978364) and 45. 53 % of all costs associated with CNS medicine items (N=R 757576976. 72) over the study period. The number one antidepressant claimed was amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant. Of the antidepressants with generic substitutes, all with the exception of clomipramine, were prescribed at generic substitution rates of more than 50 %. After the MPL implementation, generic antidepressant products were more frequently prescribed (16. 48 % increase, N= 617190), although patient co-payments did not decrease immediately. Some innovator products had price reductions after the implementation of the MPL. This study indicates that cost minimisation analyses and retrospective drug utilisation reviews are valuable tools in the evaluation of managed care medicine price lists. Master...|$|E
40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} medicinal product that contains {{a version of the}} active substance of an original {{biological medicinal product}} (reference or innovative medicinal product) that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference medicinal product in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference medicinal product by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived medicinal products, is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its <b>reference</b> <b>medicine.</b> Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states. In order to support pharmacovigilance monitoring, all appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify any biological medicinal product with due regard to its brand name and batch number.

In 2007, HX 575 (Binocrit®) became the first biosimilar epoetin alfa to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The decision to approve a biosimilar is based on the totality of evidence obtained in a comprehensive comparability exercise that involves extensive analytical characterization, nonclinical studies and clinical studies. The development process for HX 575 included extensive analytical characterization and comparison with the reference epoetin alfa. This was followed by a clinical development program, comprising Phase I pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies to show bioequivalence to the <b>reference</b> <b>medicine</b> and a confirmatory Phase III study to demonstrate therapeutic effectiveness in anemia related to CKD. In addition to the comparability exercises, extensive clinical experience over the last decade also confirms that HX 575 provides an effective treatment for CKD-related anemia, with a favorable safety profile.

Copies of these drugs, called biosimilars, are not identical to their <b>reference</b> <b>medicine,</b> and therefore specific regulatory requirements for registration apply. Pharmaceutical quality evaluation requires a complete dossier and a detailed comparative analysis to the reference drug. However, nonclinical and clinical requirements {{are much less}} extensive compared to the requirements for an innovator. Therefore, {{at the time of}} introduction onto the market, only limited clinical experience is available for the biosimilar. Differences of 15 %– 30 % between the acquisition price of biosimilars and their corresponding reference biopharmaceuticals have been suggested in the literature. Although the percentage price difference between reference biopharmaceuticals and biosimilar medicines may be limited, absolute savings are still likely to be substantial when calculated with respect to expensive reference biopharmaceutical medicines. Although an economic evaluation needs to be carried out in an increasing number of European countries to inform reimbursement decisions, uncertainty exists about how such an economic evaluation should be conducted for a biosimilar. The assessment of the cost-effectiveness of a biosimilar for reimbursement purposes depends primarily on the relative efficacy, given that a biosimilar is likely to be less expensive than the reference biopharmaceutical. To date, the question of meaningful differences in efficacy between biosimilar and biopharmaceutical drugs has not been answered. Due to a lack of demand-side incentives, biosimilar medicines have enjoyed limited success in Europe to date. Other factors that inhibit the market accessibility of biosimilars include the limited number of companies that have the expertise and the financial ability to manufacture, gain marketing authorization for, and commercialize biosimilars; physician brand loyalty to reference biopharmaceutical medicines; application of rebate contracts to reference biopharmaceutical medicines following expiry of protection; and life-cycle management strategies of companies marketing reference biopharmaceutical medicines.

40|$|Introduction. In {{contemporary}} pharmaceutical practice among drugs used in dental gels {{are most}} effective, that are easily {{applied to the}} mucous and long held on the gums to form a protective film and prolonging therapeutic effect. Therefore it developed a new drug with a carbon dioxide Humulus Lupulus extract antimicrobial action in gel form for treatment of the oral cavity. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the acute and subacute toxicity the gel containing 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract. The toxicity of the gel studied at the intragastric route of administration, due to the scope of drug – dentistry. Materials and methods. The object of the research was gel containing 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract. Studies of acute toxicity gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract was performed on white inbred laboratory mice of both sexes, weighing 19 – 21 gram. Animals received gel single intragastric at maximum tolerated this route of administration dose – 2. 0 g/kg [6]. The experiment used by 5 mice of both sexes. The criteria of judgment about the toxicity was the clinical picture of intoxication, animal survival, dynamics of body weight of mice (raw data, 3, 7, 14 days). Observation of animals were carried out within two weeks. Subacute toxicity studied on white inbred laboratory rats of both sexes, weighing 220 – 250 g. Animals were divided into 3 groups, each experimental group were 5 male and 5 female rats. Total experiment used 30 rats. Rats was injected gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract once a day for 14 days at doses of 0. 2 g/kg and 1. 0 g/kg (1 / 10 and 1 / 2 of the maximum dose in acute experiment). Control animals were injected comparison drug Kamistad–H gel at a dose of 1. 0 g/kg. Evaluation of the toxic effects of investigational gel and <b>reference</b> <b>medicine</b> on the body of the experimental animals were carried out on the following parameters: clinical observations, the survival of animals, food and water consumption, the dynamics of body weight, hematological and biochemical parameters of blood. Clinical observations of the animals was performed daily during the experiment, registering changes in their general condition, behavior, food and water consumption. Clinical and biochemical parameters studied using a reagent kit of "Felicity Diagnostics" (Ukraine) and conventional methods. Body weight of animals recorded in dynamics. The animals were weighed before the experiment, then 7 and 14 days. Results and discussion. Results of the study parameters acute toxicity gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract showed that intragastric administration to mice at a dose of 2. 0 g/kg caused no clinical symptoms of intoxication. Animals calmly reacted to the introduction of the sample gel, their general condition and behavior remained unchanged. Animal deaths and abnormalities in their general condition and behavior during the observation period were noted. Impact analysis of the sample of gel on the dynamics of body mass animal experiments showed that a single injection of a gel to mice at a dose of 2. 0 g/kg did not significantly affect the dynamics of body weight. In experiments on rats were studied subacute toxicity gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract. The results of 14 days intragastric introduction gel and reference drug studies at subacute toxicity showed that daily administration of no effect on the general condition, appearance (state of the skin and mucous membranes) and the behavior of rats. Consumption of food and water in animal experimental and control groups had no differences from each other. During the experiment animal deaths were not reported. Data characterizing the dynamics of increase in body weight of rats showed that the animals of experimental groups and the control group {{by the end of the}} experiment had equivalent, statistically significant weight gain compared with the output data: males – p ≤ 0. 0001 females – from p ≤ 0. 0001 to p ≤ 0. 0004. During the experiment, the animals of all experimental groups were observed physiological fluctuations that characterize the pattern of peripheral blood. Results of biochemical studies showed that overall the tested parameters: the concentration of total protein, albumin, thymol test, the activity of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, the concentration of glucose and cholesterol in the blood serum of rats of all experimental groups answered normal values. There have been fluctuations in biochemical parameters in animals of all experimental groups compared with baseline data did not go beyond the physiological norm. Conclusions. 1. Study of acute toxicity after a single intragastric administration to mice gel with 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract have shown that gel does not cause death of animals; no toxic effects on the general state, behavior, food consumption and water weight animals; does not affect the absolute and relative weight of internal organs; does not cause visible changes of internal organs. 2. According to the standard classification gel with 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract refers to practically non-toxic substances. 3. Subacute toxicity study results showed that the gel with 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract with 14 daily intragastric administration to rats at doses of 0. 5 g/kg and 1. 0 g/kg, does not cause death of animals; has no toxic effects on the general state, behavior and dynamics of body weight of the experimental animals; no negative impact on the performance of blood of animals; does not change the biochemical parameters characterizing the functional state of the liver of animals. 4. Pharmacological studies of dental gel with 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract, such as the results of the study of acute and subacute toxicity found that designed gel to include low-toxic substances (IV class of toxicity), has good tolerability and safety of long-term use...|$|E

40|$|With {{this article}} we intend to present facts and to expose several myths {{concerning}} the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. We wish to summarize the experience of EMA regarding the biosimilar mAb and address the outstanding issues concerning the regulation and continuous supervision of these products. These issues include the conditions necessary to extrapolate the indications of the biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies for uses other than the ones initially evaluated in clinical comparability. Moreover, the {{issues related to the}} impact of changes in the manufacturing of biosimilars, or of biological <b>reference</b> <b>medicines,</b> continue to be a major point of discussion. Since the quality of biotech medicines is crucial for the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies, an effective approach of the variables involved in this process is important for an independent evaluation of these products. The scientific basis for the discussion of the quality, efficacy and safety of the biosimilar medicines will not only overcome the myths that label these products, but also raise regulatory requirements for the approval of biotech medicines, guaranteeing that their use by patients and healthcare professionals is safe...|$|R
