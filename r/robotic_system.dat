Locomotor training is ranked as number one by most neurological patients. Huge demand for gait encourages the creation and development of new technologies such as exoskeletons.

2500|$|Modular robots are a {{new breed}} of robots that are {{designed}} to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture. The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of a single type of identical, several different identical module types, or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the programming, inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots. Modular robots may be composed of L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U and H shaped modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems. These [...] "ANAT robots" [...] can be designed with [...] "n" [...] DOF as each module is a complete motorized <b>robotic</b> <b>system</b> that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain, and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom. The more modules that are connected to one another, the more degrees of freedom it will have. L-shaped modules can also be designed in a chain, and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases, as payloads attached {{to the end of the}} chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases. Modular robots can be manually or self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different applications. Because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots, a snake-arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra-arm robot, or can split into several mobile robots, and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones, or combine with others into a larger or different one. This allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task, as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks.|$|E

40|$|With the {{infrastructure}} of ubiquitous networks around the world, the study of <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> over communication networks has attracted widespread attention. This area is denominated as networked <b>robotic</b> <b>systems.</b> By exploiting the fruitful technological developments in networking and computing, networked <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> are endowed with potential and capabilities for several applications. Robots within a network are capable of connecting with control stations, human operators, sensors, and other robots via digital communication over possibly noisy channels/media. The issues of time delays in communication and data losses have emerged as a pivotal issue that have stymied practical deployment. The aim of this dissertation is to develop control algorithms and architectures for networked <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> that guarantee stability with improved overall performance {{in the presence of}} time delays in communication. The first topic addressed in this dissertation is controlled synchronization that is utilized for networked <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> to achieve collective behaviors. Exploiting passivity property of individual <b>robotic</b> <b>systems,</b> the proposed control schemes and interconnections are shown to ensure stability and convergence of synchronizing errors. The robustness of the control algorithms to constant and time-varying communication delays is also studied. In addition to time delays, the number of communication links, which prevents scalability of networked <b>robotic</b> <b>systems,</b> is another challenging issue. Thus, a synchronizing control with practically feasible constraints of network topology is developed. The problem of networked <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> interacting with human operators is then studied subsequently. This research investigates a teleoperation system with heterogeneous robots under asymmetric and unknown communication delays. Sub-task controllers are proposed for redundant slave robot to autonomously achieve additional tasks, such as singularity avoidance, joint angle limits, and collision avoidance. The developed control algorithms can enhance the efficiency of teleoperation systems, thereby ameliorating the performance degradation due to cognitive limitations of human operator and incomplete information about the environment. Compared to traditional <b>robotic</b> <b>systems,</b> control of <b>robotic</b> manipulators over networks has significant advantages; for example, increased flexibility and ease of maintenance. With the utilization of scattering variables, this research demonstrates that transmitting scattering variables over delayed communications can stabilize an otherwise unstable system. An architecture utilizing delayed position feedback in conjunction with scattering variables is developed for the case of time-varying communication delays. The proposed control architecture improves tracking performance and stabilizes robotic manipulators with input-output communication delays. The aforementioned control algorithms and architectures for networked <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> are validated via numerical examples and experiments...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{a robust}} {{nonlinear}} L∞-gain tracking control design for uncertain <b>robotic</b> <b>systems</b> is proposed under persistent bounded disturbances. The design objective {{is that the}} peak of the tracking error in time domain must be as small as possible under persistent bounded disturbances. Since the nonlinear L∞-gain optimal tracking control cannot be solved directly, the nonlinear L∞-gain optimal tracking problem is transformed into a nonlinear L∞-gain tracking problem by given a prescribed disturbance attenuation level for the L∞-gain tracking performance. To guarantee that the L∞-gain tracking performance can be achieved for the uncertain <b>robotic</b> <b>systems,</b> a sliding-mode scheme is introduced to eliminate the effect of the parameter uncertainties. By virtue of the skew-symmetric property of the <b>robotic</b> <b>systems,</b> sufficient conditions are developed for solving the robust L∞-gain tracking control problems in terms of an algebraic equation instead of a differential equation. The proposed method is simple and the algebraic equation can be solved analytically. Therefore, the proposed robust L∞-gain tracking control scheme is suitable for practical control design of uncertain <b>robotic</b> <b>systems.</b> Key Words: Robust L∞-gain tracking control, sliding-mode scheme, persistent bounded disturbances, and uncertain <b>robotic</b> <b>systems.</b> I...|$|R
