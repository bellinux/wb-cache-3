40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the blends {{of natural}} rubber with waste ground <b>rubber</b> <b>powders</b> have been {{prepared}} by mechano-chemical activation method. The influences of particle sizes on both processing performances and mechanical properties have been investigated. The results indicated that: the blends with waste ground <b>rubber</b> <b>powders</b> of smaller particle sizes approached to higher surface tensile and easily mechano-chemical activation, {{which led to the}} formation of complete homogenous re-vulcanization cross-linking structure and resulted in the improvements of the whole performances of the final products.

40|$|Polypropylene/rubber powders {{composites}} {{with different}} kinds of <b>rubber</b> <b>powders</b> were foamed by injection molding machine equipped with volume-adjustable cavity. The effect of dispersity of <b>rubber</b> <b>powders</b> and crystallization behavior of composites on the foaming behavior and mechanical properties was investigated. The {{results show that the}} addition of <b>rubber</b> <b>powders</b> can improve the cell structure of foamed PP with fine and uniform cell distribution. And cell density and size of PP/PP-MAH/NBR foams are 7. 64 &# 215; 10 6 cell/cm 3 and 29. 78 μ m respectively, which are the best among these foams. Combining cell structures with mechanical properties, notch impact strength of PP/PP-MAH/CNBR composites increases approximately by 2. 2 times while tensile strength is reduced just by 26 % compared with those of the pure PP. This indicates that PP/PP-MAH/CNBR composites are ideal foamed materials...|$|R

5000|$|There is an {{applicable}} American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specification D5603-01 (2008) [...] for {{the classification}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>powder,</b> including MRP.|$|E
50|$|Micronized <b>rubber</b> <b>powder</b> (MRP) is {{classified}} as fine, dry, powdered elastomeric crumb rubber in which {{a significant proportion of}} particles are less than 100 µm and free of foreign particulates (metal, fiber, etc.). MRP particle size distributions typically range from 180 µm to 10 µm. Narrower distributions can be achieved depending on the classification technology.|$|E
50|$|MRP {{is a free}} flowing, black <b>rubber</b> <b>powder</b> that disperses into a {{multitude}} of systems and applications. Due to its micron size, MRP {{can be incorporated into}} multiple polymers, and provides a smooth surface appearance on finished products. In some cases, in order to improve compatibility with host materials, the MRP is given a chemical treatment to activate, or “make functional” the surface of the powder particles. This is referred to as functionalized MRP or FMRP.|$|E

40|$|For {{improving}} bending toughness {{and fatigue}} performance of brittle cement-based composites, {{two types of}} water-soluble polymers (such as dispersible latex powder and polyvinyl alcohol powder) and waste tire-rubber powders are added to concrete as admixtures.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{chemical}} modifications on <b>rubber</b> leaf <b>powder</b> were performed {{in order to}} evaluate the Pb(II) adsorption capacity by xanthation and oxidation processes. Pb(II) adsorption study was investigated under batch and fixed bed column modes. The amount of Pb(II) adsorbed increased with increasing pH, contact time and initial Pb(II) concentration but decreased with increasing adsorbent dosage, ionic strength and temperature for xanthated <b>rubber</b> leaf <b>powder</b> (XRL) and hydrogen peroxide <b>rubber</b> leaf <b>powder</b> (HPRL). The adsorption kinetics of Pb(II) by XRL and HPRL were fitted well with pseudo second order model suggesting that chemisorption could be the rate determining step in Pb(II) adsorption. The equilibrium time was achieved within 60 min for XRL and 90 min for HPRL. Adsorption of Pb(II) followed Langmuir isotherm model with the monolayer adsorption capacities of 166. 7 mg/g by XRL and 52. 6 mg/g by HPRL, respectively. The optimum adsorption process occurred at pH 4, shaking rate of 120 stroke/min and temperature of 303 K. The adsorption process {{was found to be}} exothermic for both adsorbents. The amount of Pb(II) adsorbed decreased in the presence o f Cu(II) ions. Pb(II) ions showed higher selectivity compared to Cu(II) ions in the binary systems. EDTA was more effective in releasing Pb(II) from XRL surface than HC 1 but HPRL desorbed well in HC 1. Possible mechanisms involved in the Pb(II) adsorption by XRL and HPRL were ion exchange, complexation and physical adsorption as supported by FTIR spectra, thermodynamic, ion exchange and desorption studies.

40|$|Rubber as a {{free-flowing}} powder, {{is essential}} in order to stream line the manufacturing processes of rubber goods. The previous works noted the importance of using <b>powdered</b> <b>rubber</b> as a competitive raw material for continuous processing in rubber industry. However, {{in most of these}} works, the study was continued to the synthetic rubbers and only a few had been reported on the natural rubber. Sri Lanka which is an agricultural based country, has a bulk quantity of natural rubber field latex at a low price. Hence, it is worthwhile to produce a value-added product like <b>powdered</b> <b>rubber</b> using field latex. Encapsulation is a common process in preparing <b>powdered</b> natural <b>rubber.</b> In this process, starch xanthate, SX, which acts as a diluent/reinforcing filler, behaves as an encapsulating agent for latex particles. The level of encapsulation as well as the properties of the resulting powder is highly dependent on the strength and the amount of the SX solution. The present work investigates these effects with varying strength of SX by changing the degrees of substitution, DS, of the SX solution and also the loading of the SX. The lower and the upper limits of DS of SX examined were 0. 07 and 0. 35 and the results suggested that the intermediate DS levels were more promising. The physical properties of the final vulcanizates were found to be satisfactory and were comparable with the rubbers available in the market. Study on drying techniques established the necessity of water washing step for natural <b>rubber</b> <b>powders</b> to remove non-rubber substances and the applicltion of an anti-cake agent to prevent agglomeration during drying.
