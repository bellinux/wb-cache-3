25|$|A {{butterfly}} gag is a wing-shaped gag that {{is usually}} inflatable {{by means of a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb.</b> The central part fits behind the teeth to fill up the mouth, while the wings go between the teeth and the lips. The gag inflates {{in the shape of a}} butterfly. This kind of gag is very hard to keep in the wearer; the use of an O-ring in front of the gag strapped to the back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place.|$|E

50|$|The larger <b>rubber</b> <b>bulbs</b> are {{commonly}} used to draw liquid through a pipette when the reagents are needed in a larger amount. These <b>rubber</b> <b>bulbs</b> will compliment larger pipettes and plastic rods, as the glass will easily break due to uneven pressure distribution.|$|R
50|$|The smaller <b>rubber</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{are well}} suited with small {{pipettes}} to draw smaller amount of reagents and can attach to both glass, {{as well as}} plastic rods. They are very commonly used for droppers as small sized <b>rubber</b> <b>bulbs</b> help control the amount of drops more precisely.|$|R

50|$|Serological pipette or {{characterized}} by its purpose as blow-out pipette. Serological pipette contains the graduation mark and color paired ring. The graduation marks reach {{to the end}} of the tip. The color paired ring only locates in Serological pipette indicated for blowout purpose. It can be blowed out by the gravitational force. <b>Rubber</b> <b>bulbs</b> are commonly used to blow the remained solution.The remained solution attached at the end of the tip can interfere the result of the experiment by an incorrect volume of solution. The calibration of TD is cotained in most of serological pipettes.|$|R
5000|$|... rubber {{resistance}} {{balls and}} indicators. These devices provide a nominal resistance to squeeze against. An advantage of <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> devices {{is that they}} provide visual feedback (via a gauge) of how much pressure is being applied.|$|E
50|$|Pasteur pipettes, {{also known}} as {{droppers}} or eye droppers, are used to transfer small quantities of liquids. They are usually glass tubes tapered to a narrow point, and fitted with a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> at the top. The combination of the Pasteur pipette and <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> has also {{been referred to as}} a teat pipette. Pasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are sold in boxes of hundreds. They are named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who was known to have used a variant of them extensively during his research. The purpose of Pasteur pipette is invented as in laboratory, the sterile condition of samples is the most concerned. In the past, there is no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing to the external environment. The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment. The pasteur pipette both glass and plastic types are sterilized and plugs with <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> at the open end of the pipette preventing the contamination from the atmosphere. Generally, they are considered cheap enough to be disposable, however, so long as the glass point is not chipped, the Pasteur pipette may be washed and reused indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|The {{pneumatic}} otoscope is {{the standard}} tool used in diagnosing otitis media. In addition to the pneumatic (diagnostic) head, a surgical head also is useful. The pneumatic head contains a lens, an enclosed light source, and a nipple for attachment of a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> and tubing. The head is designed so that when a speculum is attached and fitted snugly into the patient’s external auditory canal, an air-tight chamber is produced. In some cases, {{the addition of a}} small sleeve of rubber tubing {{at the end of the}} plastic speculum or use of a rubber-tipped speculum helps to avoid trauma and improve the air-tight seal.1 Gently squeezing and releasing the <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> in rapid succession permits observation of the degree of eardrum mobility in response to both positive and negative pressure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rubber</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{can also}} be {{replaced}} with wheel style pipette filler or flip style pipette filler. The flip style pipette fillers have two valves system and have a removable top valve which makes cleaning easy {{and it can be}} used with one hand. The plastic wheel style pump help reduce the amount of work done by the users, as there are no squeezing involved. The liquid is drawn up by use of wheel movement and can be easily released by using the lever. They are also easy to clean.|$|R
5000|$|Ball {{check valves}} are often very small, simple, and cheap. They are {{commonly}} used in liquid or gel minipump dispenser spigots, spray devices, some <b>rubber</b> <b>bulbs</b> for pumping air, etc., manual air pumps and some other pumps, and refillable dispensing syringes. Although the balls are most often made of metal, they can be made of other materials; in some specialized cases out of highly durable or inert materials, such as sapphire. High pressure HPLC pumps and similar applications commonly use small inlet and outlet ball check valves with both balls and seats made of artificial ruby, for both hardness and chemical resistance. After prolonged use, such check valves can eventually wear out or the seat can develop a crack, requiring replacement. Therefore, such valves are made to be replaceable, sometimes placed in a small plastic body tightly-fitted inside a metal fitting which can withstand high pressure and which is screwed into the pump head.|$|R
5000|$|Akin {{to water}} droppers, the oldest known {{manufactured}} water guns utilized a simple <b>rubber</b> squeeze <b>bulb</b> into which water could be drawn, then forcibly expelled out the nozzle by squeezing the bulb rapidly. [...] This design has inherent limitations regarding {{the amount of}} pressure that one can achieve (fully dependent on the user's hand gripping strength) {{as well as the}} need to refill after each shot.|$|R
50|$|The plunger type has a {{cylinder}} with a spring-loaded piston which is pushed down and locks into place. When triggered by pressing a button, the piston springs up, creating suction that sucks the solder off the soldered connection. The bulb type creates suction by squeezing and releasing a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb.</b>|$|E
50|$|As its typical {{symptoms}} {{overlap with}} other conditions, such as acute external otitis, clinical history {{alone is not}} sufficient to predict whether acute otitis media is present; it has to be complemented by visualization of the tympanic membrane. Examiners use a pneumatic otoscope with a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> attached to assess the mobility of the tympanic membrane.|$|E
50|$|While spray bottles existed {{long before}} {{the middle of the}} 20th century, they used a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> which was {{squeezed}} to produce the spray; the quickly-moving air siphoned fluid from the bottle. The rapid improvement in plastics after World War II increased the range of fluids that could be dispensed, and reduced the cost of the sprayers because assembly could be fully automated.|$|E
2500|$|Willie the Worm was a 35-cent toy Sales {{got from}} Woolworth's, {{according}} to WXYZ art director Jack Flechsig. With animated squeezings of his <b>rubber</b> air <b>bulb,</b> the latex accordion worm flexed {{in and out}} of a little apple. Willy was [...] "The Sickest Worm in all of Dee-troit" [...] and suffered from a perennial cold and comically explosive sneeze. He helped read birthday greetings to Detroit-area kids while the show was on WXYZ. Willie did not survive the show's move to the Big Apple.|$|R

He tries to get Spanky to pose with an exaggerated sweet smile on his face; when Spanky sees Phocus' ridiculous grimace he turns to his Dad (Emerson Treacy) and says, [...] "Hey Pop, {{do you see what}} I see?" [...] Later, when Spanky's friends have filled the <b>rubber</b> shutter <b>bulb</b> with water, and Phocus squeezes it, {{squirting}} Spanky's Dad with water, his Mom (Gay Seabrook) tells Spanky, [...] "That's how they take watercolor pictures."Finally, after having successfully taken Spanky's picture, Phocus discovers the gang exposed his photographic plates, rendering [...] "all my lovely work for nothing!". Spanky manages to give him one more [...] "buss" [...] before his family leaves the studio in disgust.|$|R
2500|$|Manual breast {{pumps are}} {{operated}} by squeezing or pulling a handle in a repetitive fashion, allowing {{the user to}} directly control the pressure and frequency of milk expression. [...] Though manual pumps are small and inexpensive, they can require significant effort and can be tiring because the user provides all the power. They also allow for only one breast to be pumped at a time. This style is recommended for infrequent usage such as when a woman is away from her baby for a single feeding. These pumps may not provide sufficient stimulation and emptying of the breast. It is recommended that [...] "bicycle horn" [...] style manual pumps not be used. [...] Though cheap, they can damage breast tissue and harbor bacteria in the <b>rubber</b> suction <b>bulb,</b> which is difficult to clean.|$|R
5000|$|Tyrrell sold {{a device}} named the “Ideal Sight Restorer”. This was “a piece of tubing with a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> {{attached}} {{for the purpose}} of producing a partial vacuum over the eyeballs”. The device was reviewed by the AMA and criticized as [...] "pseudomedical claptrap"; the manufacturer, Ideal Company, moved to England and was renamed [...] "Neu-Vita Hygienic Institute"—to avoid prosecution.|$|E
5000|$|Less commonly, some TD {{pipettes}} {{are made}} [...] "to contain" [...] as per manufacturer {{and made to}} be blown out. A set of two rings printed on {{the upper end of}} the pipette indicate that it is a [...] "blow out" [...] type and should be blown using a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb.</b> Do not blow the solution out if the pipette has no rings on the upper end.|$|E
50|$|Rubber bulbs {{are used}} in {{chemistry}} laboratories, by placing them {{on top of a}} glass or plastic tube. It serves as a vacuum source for filling reagents through a pipette or pasteur pipette and also help control the flow of liquid from the dropping bottle. By using <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb,</b> the contact of the mouth to the chemicals can be avoided. These rubber rods come in different shapes, sizes and colors.|$|E
25|$|Bubble flow meters: A simple, yet highly {{accurate}} way {{to measure}} flow rates involves timing movement of bubbles of soap film up glass tubes between marks of known volume. The glass tube is connected at the bottom (for push systems) or at the top (for pull systems) to the air stream. A small <b>rubber</b> pipette <b>bulb</b> attached {{at the base of}} the tube acts as both a reservoir and delivery system for the soap bubbles. Operation is simple. First, wet the glass surface along the path bubbles travel (e.g., press the bulb so that copious amounts of soap are pushed up the glass by the air flow) to provide a virtually friction-free surface. Second, pinch the bulb so that one clean bubble is produced. With a stopwatch in hand, record the time required for the bubble to travel between marks on the glass. Note the volume recorded on the upper mark (e.g., 125 = 125ml), divide the volume by the time required to travel between marks and the result is the flow rate (ml/s). These instruments can be purchased from a variety of sources, but they may also be constructed from appropriate-sized, glass volumetric pipettes.|$|R
40|$|A contact lens may {{be removed}} from the eye either {{manually}} or by using a small rubber sucker. The removal of lenses by the rubber sucker technique is difficult at times, especi-ally when the lens is fenestrated, as the vacuum cannot be maintained. Assistance in the removal of the lens may be obtained by modifying existing <b>rubber</b> suckers. The <b>bulb</b> is cut off with a sharp blade and into the lumen so exposed is inserted a glass pipette removed from a drop-bottle. The other end of the pipette is attached to a rubber tube of convenient length. A second glass pipette which has been lightly packed with cotton wool to act as a barrier to saliva and to prevent condensation in the tube is fitted into {{the other end of the}} rubber tube. The device is then assembled and suction is provided by the mouth and the vacuum controlled by the tongue as in using a volumetric pipette. This method should prove most useful in the removal of soft lenses. The surface tension between cornea and fenestrated lens is readily reduced and the lens may be removed more easily by gently blowing down the pipette with the bell of the applicator apposed to the fenestration or fenestrations. A haptic type sucker may be used for large hard lenses and for soft lenses. Received for publication September 2. 197...|$|R
50|$|On 18 December 1909, in New York, {{with the}} help of a hidden man lying under a table, Münsterberg caught Palladino levitating a table with her foot. Some {{investigators}} were originally baffled how Palladino could move curtains from a distance when all the doors and windows in the séance room were closed. According to Münsterberg she moved the curtains by releasing a jet of air from a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> that she had in her hand.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> {{dispenser}} which primarily moved {{air with}} a small amount of fluid, modern spray bottles use a positive displacement pump that acts directly on the fluid. The pump draws liquid up a siphon tube from the bottom of the bottle and forces it through a nozzle. Depending on the sprayer, the nozzle may or may not be adjustable, so as to select between squirting a stream, aerosolizing a mist, or dispensing a spray.|$|E
50|$|Pasteur {{pipettes}} are {{plastic or}} glass pipettes used to transfer {{small amounts of}} liquids, but are not graduated or calibrated for any particular volume. The bulb is separate from the pipette body. Pasteur pipettes are also called teat pipettes, droppers, eye droppers and chemical droppers. The proper handling of the pipettes is by holding the <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> between the {{thumb and index finger}} and controlling the glass by holding it between the ring finger and the pinky. The middle finger is not used.|$|E

50|$|Bicycles {{often have}} a classic bulb horn, {{operated}} by squeezing a <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> attached to a metal horn. Squeezing the bulb forces air through a steel reed located in the throat of the horn, making it vibrate, producing a single note. The flaring horn matches the acoustic impedance of the reed to the open air, radiating the sound waves efficiently, making the sound louder. Other types of horns used on bicycles include battery-operated horns (sometimes even car horns on 12-volt circuits are incorporated) and small air horns powered by a small can of compressed gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{recommendation}} for using pipette is {{near to the}} desired volume. Before utilizing pipette, rinsing is required to prevent error. The standard technique for handling a graduated pipette is to hold the pipette in the solution without touching {{the bottom of the}} beaker. Then use a propipetter, a pipette bulb or <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb,</b> to draw the liquid into the pipette. The effective way to control the volume of the solution is to use a forefinger. After getting the desired volume, the solution can be released into another vessel by lifting the finger. During pipetting, the pipette must not divert from its upright position.|$|E
50|$|Water {{will always}} try to find its lowest level. Using this principle, very simple pumps with plastic or <b>rubber</b> <b>bulb</b> with flap valve at each end are used for {{emptying}} fuel or water cans into tanks. Once the bulb is full, the fluid will flow without further effort from the higher to the lower container. Many hand pumps will allow the passage of fluid through them {{in the direction of}} flow and diaphragm pumps are particularly good at this. Thus where the levels are correct large volumes of liquid such as swimming pools can be emptied with very little effort and no expensive energy use.|$|E
