5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced <b>River</b> {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the <b>river,</b> some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced <b>River</b> confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter <b>river</b> was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced <b>River</b> enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced <b>River</b> diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced <b>River.</b> In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced <b>River</b> Hatchery, was built beside the Merced <b>River</b> just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced <b>River</b> dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced <b>River.</b>|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake <b>River,</b> but rather feed the Snake <b>River</b> Aquifer underneath the Snake <b>River</b> Plain. Water diverted from the <b>river</b> for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake <b>River</b> Plain and re-enters the <b>river</b> as springs. Throughout much of the Snake <b>River</b> Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake <b>River</b> to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon <b>River</b> confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E

50|$|Low {{gradient}} {{channels of}} <b>rivers</b> and streams {{can be divided}} into braided <b>rivers,</b> wandering <b>rivers,</b> single thread sinuous <b>rivers</b> (meandering), and anastomosing <b>rivers.</b> The channel type developed depends on stream gradient, riparian vegetation and sediment supply. Braided <b>rivers</b> tend to occur on steeper gradients where there is a large supply of sediment for braid bars, while single thread sinous channels occur where there is a lower sediment supply for point bars. Anastomosing channels are multithreaded, but are much more stable than braided channels and commonly have thick clay and silt banks and occur at lower gradients of stream bed. Wandering <b>rivers</b> fall between sinuous single thread and braided streams and are relatively stable multi-channel gravel bed <b>rivers.</b>|$|R

The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua <b>River</b> and nearby basins. The lower Snake <b>River</b> also {{supports}} seven species of Pacific salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus).

5|$|The Waterworks <b>River</b> {{underwent}} considerable {{change over}} the years. In 1850, it left the channel of the Old <b>River</b> Lee much further to the north, to the south-west of Temple Mills railway depot. It was called Lead Mills Stream at this point. Near Temple Mills bridge, now on the A12 road, Channelsea <b>River</b> split off. The two channels ran parallel to the Old <b>River</b> Lee, before Channelsea <b>River</b> turned to the south-east. There was another small connection between the Old <b>River</b> Lee and the Waterworks <b>River</b> called Bully Fence, where the northern Channelsea <b>River</b> is shown on modern maps. By 1870, it was called Waterworks <b>River</b> {{as far north as}} Temple Mills depot, and by 1896, its present connection to the old <b>river</b> near to Carpenters Road had been established. Twenty years later, the northern Waterworks <b>River</b> rejoined the Lee at Bully Fence, and the section between there and Carpenters Road had been filled in. At some point, the connection at Bully Fence became the main source for the Channelsea <b>River,</b> although the 1953/66 map still shows it connected to the remnants of the system to the north, for drainage.
