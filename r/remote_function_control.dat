Universal mobile interaction devices will increase the flexibility of the service men during their maintenance task.

50|$|Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, {{a company}} which made digital drum {{machines}} and inexpensive analog audio mixers introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It {{was named the}} ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full <b>function</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> was also available.|$|R

Separation of actinides is performed on chromatographic columns as sample preparation step for mass spectrometry measurements. The chromatographic separation is a time consuming process which, if performed manually, necessitates the constant presence of an operator. A semi - Automatic Separation Unit (ASU) was developed by JRC-ITU in collaboration with the IAEA as an alternative to manual separations under the EC support task to the IEA EC A- 1391. It is already in use in the JRC-ITU and in cold testing for the LSS, La Hague and at SAL, IAEA. A fourth unit will be produced for the OSL Sellafield.
