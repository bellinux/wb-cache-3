5|$|The {{species was}} first named Toxostoma curvirostre by William John Swainson in 1827. Since then, six {{subspecies}} have been recognized, {{and have been}} divided into two branches. Genetic <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the curve-billed thrasher is the sister species of a clade consisting of the ocellated thrasher, brown thrasher, long-billed thrasher, and Cozumel thrasher. This contrasts with an earlier suggestion that curve-billed and ocellated thrashers are closest relatives.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of domesticated horses in England comes from archaeological investigations {{showing that the}} ancient Britons were using wheeled horse-drawn transport extensively in southwest England as early as 400 BC. Recent <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> there was significant Roman involvement in mining on Exmoor. Metals including iron, tin, and copper were transported to Hengistbury Head in neighbouring Dorset for export, and Roman carvings, showing British and Roman chariots pulled by ponies phenotypically similar to the Exmoor, {{have been found in}} Somerset.|$|E

25|$|In later years, Spilbury's dogmatic {{manner and}} his {{unbending}} belief {{in his own}} infallibility gave rise to criticism. Judges began to express concern about his invincibility in court and recent <b>researches</b> <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> his inflexible dogmatism led to miscarriages of justice.|$|R

5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
25|$|Recent <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> mammograms {{should not}} be done with any {{increased}} frequency than used in normal procedure in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast implant, augmentation, mastopexy, and breast reducation.|$|E

5000|$|TNT's <b>research</b> <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the {{audience}} for Babylon 5 did not watch other TNT programming, and likewise TNT's main audience was not watching the show, making another related program unattractive to the network's management. Straczynski believes that the network's [...] "interference" [...] with the production {{was an attempt to}} get out of their contract by allowing them to argue that he failed to deliver the series they wanted.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{discoveries in}} Alzheimer's Disease <b>research</b> <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> amyloid beta peptide-induced nitro-oxidative damage {{promotes}} the nitrotyrosination of TPI in human neuroblastoma cells. Nitrosylated TPI {{was found to}} be present in brain slides from double transgenic mice over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein as well as in Alzheimer's disease patients. Specifically, the nitrotyrosination occurs on Tyr164 and Tyr208 within the protein, which are near the center of catalysis; this modification correlates with reduced isomerization activity.|$|R
30|$|Several <b>researches</b> <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> some {{polymers}} {{can be used}} as {{corrosion inhibitors}} because, through their functional groups, they form complexes with metal ions and on the metal surfaces. These complexes occupy a large surface area, thereby blanketing the surface and protecting the metals from corrosive agents present in the solution [17]. The inhibitive power of these polymers is related structurally to the cyclic rings, heteroatom (oxygen and nitrogen), that are the major active centers of adsorption.|$|R
25|$|Carboplatin {{has also}} been used for {{adjuvant}} therapy of stage 1 seminomatous testicular cancer. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> it is not less effective than adjuvant radiotherapy for this treatment, while having fewer side effects. This has led to carboplatin based adjuvant therapy being generally preferred over adjuvant radiotherapy in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|The site is {{approximately}} 1 hectare in area (1.25 ha in some sources). Loudon used {{plans for the}} Histon Road cemetery as illustrative of his views on cemetery design. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the actual work carried out on the cemetery, which opened in 1843 (the year of his death), does not correspond closely with Loudon's announcements.|$|E
25|$|Furan {{is found}} in {{heat-treated}} commercial foods and is produced through thermal degradation of natural food constituents. It {{can be found in}} roasted coffee, instant coffee, and processed baby foods. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> coffee made in espresso makers, and, above all, coffee made from capsules, contains more furan than that made in traditional drip coffee makers, although the levels are still within safe health limits.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{scientific}} papers has recently suggested {{the possibility of}} using objective colour measurements to predict functional properties of poultry. Some <b>researches</b> <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> lightness (L*) may be able to discriminate the pale, soft, exudative (PSE) condition in poultry (Barbut, 1997; Owens et al., 2000). It has also been suggested that each commercial processing plant would have to determine its own lightness values for sorting meat depending on type of birds, processing factors, and product specifications (Woelfel et al., 2002) [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In service {{interactions}} {{the management}} of service employee’s emotion through emotional labor has gained prominence and is becoming an active method to affect consumer’s behavior. Several <b>researches</b> <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> self-concept of the consumer affects their buying behavior. However {{there is not much}} research to evaluate the effect of emotional labor of the service employee on the self-concept of the consumer. Based on review of literature, this paper tries to answer whether emotional labor of the service employee affects the self-concept of the consumer. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> {{environmental}} enrichment can help relieve motor and psychiatric deficits caused by Huntington's disease. It also improves lost protein levels {{for those with}} the disease, and prevents striatal and hippocampal deficits in the BDNF, located in the hippocampus. These findings have led researchers to suggest that {{environmental enrichment}} has a {{potential to be a}} possible form of therapy for those with Huntington's.|$|E
25|$|The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) {{is often}} used to {{determine}} the functional skills a patient has at various times after their brain damage. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> patients with more severe neglect are less likely to make functional improvements than patients with less severe neglect based on FIM scores. Additionally, patients with any level of neglect tend to have reduced functional cognitive and communication skills than patients without neglect (Cherney et al., 2001).|$|E
25|$|Centronuclear myopathies {{typically}} have a milder presentation {{and a better}} prognosis. Recently, researchers discovered mutations at the gene dynamin 2 (DNM2 on chromosome 19, at site 19p13.2), responsible for the autosomal dominant form of centronuclear myopathy. This condition {{is now known as}} dynamin 2 centronuclear myopathy (abbreviated DNM2-CNM). <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> patients with DNM2-CNM have a slowly progressive muscular weakness usually beginning in adolescence or early adulthood, with an age range of 12 to 74 years.|$|E
5000|$|A Gartner {{research}} report predicted that Vista business adoption in 2008 would overtake that of XP {{during the same}} time frame (21.3% vs. 16.9%) while IDC <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the launch of Windows Server 2008 served as a catalyst for the stronger adoption rates. As of January 2009, Forrester <b>Research</b> <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> almost one third of North American and European corporations had started deploying Vista.

Previous <b>research</b> <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> generally children who experienced love and warmth in their childhood home had marital role expectations of friendliness, spontaneity, adaptability, trust, responsibility, and leadership, while those who experienced rejecting and neglecting parental behaviors {{were more likely to}} have expectations of being seclusive, guilty, hostile, rigid, mistrustful, and irresponsible...|$|R
5000|$|After its {{introduction}} to the public, the Edsel did {{not live up to}} its preproduction publicity, even though it did offer many new features, such as self-adjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication. While Ford's market <b>research</b> <b>had</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> these and other features would make the [...] "E" [...] car attractive to them as car buyers, the Edsel's selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay. Upon seeing the price for a base model, many potential buyers simply left the dealerships. Other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped top-of-the-line model.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} found that BPO errors (i.e. use of BPO pantomimes in place of the IO pantomimes {{dominant}} in typical adult individuals) are made by patients with schizophrenia. Given that BPO errors are associated with apraxia, and that past <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> schizophrenic patients have apraxia-like symptoms, this is perhaps not a surprising finding. This BPO-schizophrenia association has not been extensively explored to date, and more research is required in order to better understand it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> animals {{suffering}} from {{spinal cord injuries}} showed significant improvement in motor capabilities even with a long delay in treatment after the injury when exposed to environmental enrichment. Social interactions, exercise, and novelty all play major roles in aiding the recovery of an injured subject. This has led to some suggestions that the spinal cord has a continued plasticity and all efforts must be made for enriched environments to stimulate this plasticity in order to aid recovery.|$|E
25|$|Breast {{reduction}} surgery {{cannot be}} performed {{if the woman}} is lactating, or has recently ceased lactating; if her breasts contain unevaluated tissue masses, or unidentified microcalcifications; if she is suffering a systemic illness; if she is unable to understand the technical limitations of the plastic surgery; and her inability to accept the possible medical complications of the procedure. Additionally, recent <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> mammograms should not be done with any increased frequency in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast augmentation, mastopexy, and breast reduction.|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of {{evolutionary}} optimization, evolutionary operators, including crossover and mutation, are indispensable for solving a problem. The performances of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), such as convergence, diversity, and exploration capability, depend on them to a large extent. Gong et al. have put forward an effective crossover operator guided by preferred regions in [27]. Many <b>researches</b> <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> mutation operators {{play an important role}} in EAs [28, 29]; however, they are less well understood in many-objective evolutionary optimization, and in particular, effective mutation operators guided by preferences are rather lacking in EAs that integrate preferences. As a result, it is essential to investigate and develop mutation operators guided by preferences.|$|R
25|$|Evidence {{has shown}} that jurors {{typically}} take their roles very seriously. According to Simon (1980), jurors approach their responsibilities as decision makers much {{in the same way}} as a court judge – with great seriousness, a lawful mind, and a concern for consistency that is evidence-based. By actively processing evidence, making inferences, using common sense and personal experiences to inform their decision-making, <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> jurors are effective decision makers that seek thorough understanding, rather than passive, apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury.|$|E
25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> {{women are}} more likely to be left {{hemisphere}} dominant, and men are more likely to be right hemisphere dominant. Because of this, women recover faster from left hemisphere damage, and men are more likely to recover faster from right hemisphere damage. Men who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke also have significantly better rehabilitation outcomes than men who suffer a left hemisphere stroke. Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E
25|$|The Wnt protein family {{includes}} {{a large number}} of cysteine-rich glycoproteins. The Wnt proteins activate signal transduction cascades via three different pathways, the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. Wnt proteins appear to control a wide range of developmental processes and have been seen as necessary for control of spindle orientation, cell polarity, cadherin mediated adhesion, and early development of embryos in many different organisms. Current <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> deregulation of Wnt signaling plays a role in tumor formation, because at a cellular level, Wnt proteins often regulated cell proliferation, cell morphology, cell motility, and cell fate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{our recent}} efforts in exploring effective discriminative features for speaker recognition. Recent <b>researches</b> <b>have</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the appropriate fusion of features {{is critical to}} improve the performance of speaker recognition system. In this paper we describe our approaches for the NIST 2006 Speaker Recognition Evaluation. Our system integrated the cepstral GMM modeling, cepstral SVM modeling and tokenization at both phone level and frame level. The experimental results on both NIST 2005 SRE corpus and NIST 2006 SRE corpus are presented. The fused system achieved 8. 14 % equal error rate on 1 conv 4 w- 1 conv 4 w test condition of the NIST 2006 SRE...|$|R
40|$|Despite its widely {{acknowledged}} importance, the information security policy has not, to date, {{been the subject}} of explicit, empirical scrutiny, in the academic literature. To help fill this gap an exploratory research project was initiated that sought to investigate the uptake, content, dissemination and impact of information security policies. To this end, a questionnaire was mailed to senior IS executives, in large UK-based organizations, and 208 valid responses were received.
