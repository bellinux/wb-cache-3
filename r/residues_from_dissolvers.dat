40|$|We are {{studying}} the isotope dilution gamma-ray spectrometry (IDGS) technique for the simultaneous measurements of concentrations and isotopic compositions for both plutonium and uranium in spent-fuel dissolver solutions at a reprocessing plant. Previous experiments have demonstrated that the IDGS technique can determine the elemental concentrations and isotopic compositions of plutonium in dissolver solutions. The chemical separation and recovery methods for just plutonium were ion-exchange techniques using anion exchange resin beads and filter papers. To keep both plutonium and uranium in the sample for simultaneous measurements, a new sample preparation method is being studied and developed: extraction chromatography. The technique uses U/TEVA{center_dot}Spec resin to separate fission products and recover both uranium and plutonium in the resin <b>from</b> <b>dissolver</b> solutions for measurements by high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the use of solid <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> incineration waste products, especially in the construction industry. The aim of the thesis is to test various modifications of solid <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> incineration waste. These secondary materials were tested in bonding systems based on hydratation of portland cement, gypsum made from chemogypsum, quicklime and alkali-activated systems. The aim was to verify whether solid <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> waste incineration {{could be used as a}} component of alternative materials for the construction industry...|$|R

40|$|<b>Residues</b> <b>from</b> eight solvents/solvent {{mixtures}} {{before and}} after their passage through C 18 - bonded phase columns were assayed for cytostatic activity using mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC). All <b>residues,</b> except those <b>from</b> acetonitrile, exhibited cytostatic activity (15 %- 35 % MLC inhibition as measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation). Passage of solvents through bonded phase columns contributed an additional and significant cytostatic effect (19 %- 69 % MLC inhibition). Pretreatment of columns with methanol led to further increases in the release of cytostatic <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> the columns, only when followed by less polar solvents (hexane, ethylacetate, etc.). It is concluded that <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> solid-phase extraction columns may interfere with subsequent cell culture-based assays for proliferative/antiproliferative activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} {{measures of}} oral and pha-ryngeal <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> scintigraphic studies and esti-mates/observations from videofluorographic (modi-fied barium swallow) studies {{taken on the}} same day but not concurrently in 16 dysphagic patients of varying etiologies presenting with oral and/or pha-ryngeal dysphagia. Oral and pharyngeal residuals following the swallow were quantified scintigraphi-cally and were then compared with measures of residuals obtained from the modified barium swal-low. Estimates of oral and pharyngeal <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> the modified barium swallows were generated by a trained observer who was blinded to the scintigraphic data. Positive and significant Spearman correlations between oral and pharyngeal <b>residue</b> measures <b>from</b> scintigraphy and observations of oral and pharyngeal <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> modified barium swallows were found. This supports the validity of observations of oral and pharyngeal residues in clinical studies. Limitations of these observations are discussed...|$|R

30|$|The {{amount of}} {{residues}} {{depends on the}} specific agronomic management used in the cultivation of the herbicide-resistant plants. Data from publications show [77, 78] {{a considerable amount of}} <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> spraying can be expected in genetically engineered soybeans that are resistant to glyphosate formulations. In general, the level of residues is likely to increase due to increasing problems with herbicide-resistant weeds [76]. However, {{there is a lack of}} reliable data covering the actual range of residue load in the plants [79]. EFSA also stated in 2015 [84], that the safety of <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> spraying glyphosate formulations could not be concluded on the data provided by the company. Thus, EFSA was unable to deliver a conclusive risk assessment on the actual risks of <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> spraying with glyphosate and the various glyphosate formulations used in the countries where such plants are cultivated. Therefore, the data regarding <b>residues</b> <b>from</b> spraying glyphosate on the genetically engineered soybeans do not meet the requirements of Regulation 1107 / 2009 or Regulation 396 / 2005. However, neither the EU risk assessor nor the EU risk manager discussed this aspect.|$|R
