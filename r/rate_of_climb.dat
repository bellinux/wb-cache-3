5|$|In {{its first}} year of service, an IK-3 was lost {{when one of the}} {{squadron}} commanders, Kapetan Anton Ercigoj, was making a mock attack on a Potez 25 over the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. After passing below the Potez, he went into a climb with the intention of performing a loop. His <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> was too steep and the aircraft fell into a spin at low altitude and hit the water. Before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in early April 1941, the 51st Fighter Group was placed under the 6th Fighter Regiment, which was responsible for the defence of Belgrade. The 51st Fighter Group was further reinforced the day before the invasion began, with the 102nd Fighter Squadron equipped with Bf 109Es. When the invasion began on 6 April, the two IK-3 squadrons had only three serviceable aircraft each.|$|E
5|$|Though it had {{operated}} {{mainly as}} a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No.77 Squadron's primary {{role in the}} RAAF was interception, and {{it was hoped that}} with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in Korea. Cresswell therefore arranged for the USAF to lend him a Sabre to simulate a MiG-15 in combat training with the Meteors at Iwakuni; he determined that the Meteor's manoeuvrability and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> allowed it to match the swept-wing jet below , so that the best air-to-air tactic would be to work in concert with USAF Sabres operating at high level while the Australians flew at lower altitudes. On 20July, No.77 Squadron began moving to Kimpo, South Korea, where it was tasked by the USAF's 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} {{commercial}} helicopter-operating experiences was conducted using a helicopter flight recorder {{in order to}} provide a basis for extending helicopter design and service-life criteria. These data are representative of 182 flight hours accumulated during 1414 flights comprised of the separate legs of the total route structure employed. The operating experiences are presented in terms of the time spent within different airspeed brackets, within the classifiable flight conditions <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> en route, and descent, at various <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and descent, and at different rotor rotational speeds. The results indicated that the helicopter spent a majority of the flight time at airspeeds either below 40 knots or above 100 knots. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and descent were concentrated at values below 5. 1 m/s (1000 ft/min) particularly for higher airspeeds. Normal acceleration experiences were low, both in the total number and peak value realized; however, an extremely large number of pitch angular-velocity experiences were noted. Rotor rotational speeds were normal with no occurrences above the upper red-line limit...|$|R

50|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was tested}} in December 1936, {{and in spite}} of its insufficient speed and the disappointing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> the Regia Aeronautica felt there was sufficient room for development and ordered the SM.85 into production. Despite some improvements, critical deficiencies continued to be experienced during test flights by the Reparto Sperimentale Volo a Tuffo. These revised aircraft were disappointing as dive bombers in almost every aspect, with the most serious problems encountered being frequent uncontrollable spins, extremely slow climb rate after a dive, and instability during the dive.|$|R
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb.</b> The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E

50|$|DUATS {{can store}} {{data on a}} {{particular}} type of airplane that the user generally flies {{so that it can be}} used for flight planning purposes. In order to store a profile, for a reciprocating engine aircraft, a user must enter airspeeds for climb, cruise and descent, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and descent, and fuel consumption for all three stages of flight. For a turbine-powered aircraft, everything is the same except that fuel consumption is entered on an hourly basis, e.g. first hour, second hour...tenth hour. Once stored, this data can be automatically entered in the correct fields for flight plans and weather forecast requests.|$|R
50|$|As stated above, {{the modern}} fighter pilot is {{well advised to}} avoid the {{scissors}} engagements, as they do not favor the characteristics of many modern fighter aircraft: aircraft with medium-to-high wing loading, powerful engines (and attendant high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> allowing for significant maintained vertical maneuvering capabilities), and long-range missile weapons. The scissors are also very physically and mentally taxing on the pilots involved, {{and can lead to}} a dangerous loss of situational awareness due to fixation on the one other enemy aircraft involved, leading to vulnerability to other enemies that may be flying in the area unobserved, or ground threats such as surface-to-air missiles.|$|R
5000|$|Development {{work on the}} Siemens-Halske Sh.I {{culminated in}} the Siemens-Halske Sh.III, which {{developed}} [...] The new engine was fitted {{to a series of}} original prototype designs from the SSW works, the D.II, D.IIa and D.IIb. These featured a much rounder and wider front fuselage to hold the larger engine, leading to a rather stubby-looking aircraft which pilots later referred to as the flying beer barrel. Flight tests started in June 1917, and while the aircraft did not have a very high top speed, they showed outstanding <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb.</b> The only serious concern was the extremely long landing gear needed to keep the huge 2-bladed prop clear of the ground.|$|R
25|$|The CL.II entered {{service in}} August 1917, and proved {{extremely}} successful, its excellent manoeuvrability, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and good {{field of fire}} for its armament allowing it to match opposing single-seat fighters. It also proved to be well suited to close-support, which became the primary role of the CL-type aircraft, the units operating them being re-designated Schlachtstaffeln (Battle flights).|$|E
25|$|Initial {{response}} to the P-47 praised its dive speed and high-altitude performance, while criticizing its turning performance and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> (particularly at low-to-medium altitudes). The turbosupercharger in the P-47 gave the powerplant its maximum power at 27,000ft (8,230m), and in the thin air above 30,000ft (9,144m), the Thunderbolt remained comparatively fast and nimble relative to other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Triplane's combat debut {{was highly}} successful. The new fighter's {{exceptional}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and high service ceiling {{gave it a}} marked advantage over the Albatros D.III, though the Triplane was slower in a dive. The Germans were so impressed by {{the performance of the}} Triplane that it spawned a brief triplane craze among German aircraft manufacturers. Their efforts resulted in no fewer than 34 different prototypes, including the Fokker V.4, prototype of the successful Fokker Dr.I.|$|E
50|$|The initial missile-armed version, {{designated}} Ye-150, flew for {{the first}} time on 8 July 1960, after extensive ground checks of systems and a delay in delivery of a flightworthy engine. Flight testing progressed slowly, hampered by the very short life of the R-15 engine (barely sufficient for pre-flight ground checks and a single flight), as well as problems with aileron buffeting, brake parachute failure, and the engine accessory gearbox disintegrating. Manufacturer's flight tests, over 42 flights, revealed very high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> impressive maximum speed (Mach 2.65 at 19,100 m using less than full throttle), and a phenomenal service ceiling of at least 21,000 m.|$|R
30|$|Comparing between agriculture- and industry-based biogas {{engineering}} projects, {{we observe}} that agriculture- based engineering biogas production nearly follows a generalized Weng model {{which is an}} asymmetric bell shape, with a faster growing trend than declining trend (probably due to strong promotion by government), while industry-based engineering biogas production follow a (multi-cycle) symmetric bell-shaped model (Hubbert model) with almost the same <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> and decreasing (possibly similar to normal technology diffusion processes). However, due to {{the characteristics of the}} two sectors, the industrial production has fluctuated more than that from the agriculture sector and thus is hard to simulate and predict, with only about an R-squared value of 0.75 compared to 0.99 for the agriculture sector.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of a {{variometer}} is in helping a pilot find {{and stay in the}} [...] "core" [...] of a thermal to maximise height gain and, conversely, to indicate when a pilot is in sinking air and needs to find rising air.Humans can sense the acceleration when they first hit a thermal, but cannot detect the difference between constant rising air and constant sinking air. Modern variometers are capable <b>of</b> detecting <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> or sink <b>of</b> 1 cm per second.A variometer indicates climb rate (or sink-rate) with short audio signals (beeps, which increase in pitch and tempo during ascent, and a droning sound, which gets deeper as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> descent increases) and/or a visual display. It also shows altitude: either above takeoff, above sea level, or (at higher altitudes) flight level.|$|R
25|$|On April 3, 2006 Symphony Aircraft {{announced}} that a tuned exhaust system made by Power Flow Systems would be offered as an option on the SA-160. This US$1600 option was forecast to give a 10% improvement in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> to about 781ft/min, an increased optimal cruise speed of about 5 knots to about 133 knots, or 0.5 to 1.5 US gallon per hour decrease in fuel burn, down to about 7.5 US gallons per hour.|$|E
25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} yawing moment {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A sideslip develops, causing the total drag of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the aircraft's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb.</b> The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of bank angle, are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment.|$|E
25|$|As Hemer noted, the Dr.I was {{considerably}} slower than contemporary Allied fighters {{in level flight}} and in a dive. While initial <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> was excellent, performance fell off dramatically at higher altitudes because of the low compression of the Oberursel Ur.II, a clone of the Le Rhône 9J rotary engine. As the war continued, chronic shortages of castor oil made rotary operation increasingly difficult. The poor quality of German ersatz lubricant resulted in many engine failures, particularly {{during the summer of}} 1918.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{review by}} the {{intelligence}} and technical divisions of the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field reached the same conclusion.

It was therefore recommended in late September 1947 that an official Air Force investigation be set up to investigate the phenomenon. It was also recommended that other government agencies should assist in the investigation.|$|R
25|$|The GA-1 {{were sent}} to Kelly Field, Texas, in early 1923 for service tests with the only US aerial attack formation, the 3rd Attack Group.

25|$|Several Dr.Is {{were used}} as testbeds for {{experimental}} engines. One aircraft, designated V.7, was fitted with the Siemens-Halske Sh.III bi-rotary engine. The V.7 exhibited exceptional <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and ceiling, but it proved difficult to handle. Serial 108/17 {{was used to test}} the 118kW (160hp) Goebel Goe. III, while serial 469/17 was used to test the 108kW (145hp) Oberursel Ur. III. None of these engines were used on production aircraft. One triplane was used as a testbed for an experimental Schwade gear-driven supercharger.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimated}} horizontal {{speed was}} not satisfactory {{and in the}} next development, Project VII, the jet intakes were situated in the wing roots. Further improvements over Project VI were a narrower fuselage and a changed pilot's canopy. In order to improve the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> a Walter HWK 109-509 hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket was built in to give supplementary thrust. A complete mockup was built and all construction and assembly plans were finished, but the aircraft was not accepted by the Reich Air Ministry (Reichsluftfahrtministerium, RLM).|$|E

The equipment needed for large scale testing to extend {{the state of the art}} is reviewed and developments in three areas are recommended as follows: (1) improve methods for simulating the engine exhaust and inlet flows; (2) develop a model support system that can simulate realistic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and descent as well as steady height operation; and (3) develop a blowing BLC ground board as an alternative to a moving belt ground board to properly simulate the flow on the ground...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} {{distribution of the}} pressure, temperature, and density of the atmosphere varies from day to day. Thus, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> on different days cannot be compared directly, but must be corrected with reference to a standard <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> diminution of air density with increasing altitude. The following problem, therefore, has to be solved. An airplane has climbed on a certain day under prevailing atmospheric conditions {{as shown by the}} barograph. How would the same airplane climb in a standard atmosphere? This problem has already been dealt with by Everling, using the monthly and yearly mean of the vertical temperature distribution. Von Mises solved the problem by arithmetical methods. Here, conditions are examined which shorten or lengthen the climbing time. In establishing the corrected barogram, computation seems more practical than graphical treatment. The basis of {{the answer to the question}} answered here is summed up in the remark that lift, drag, propeller thrust, and torque and engine power depend only on the density of the air and do not change with the pressure and temperature, provided that the density remains constant...|$|R
