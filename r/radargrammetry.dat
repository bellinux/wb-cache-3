40|$|Nowadays by high {{resolution}} SAR imaging systems as Radarsat- 2, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-skyMed, three-dimensional terrain data extraction using SAR images is growing. InSAR and <b>Radargrammetry</b> are two most common approaches for removing 3 D object coordinate from SAR images. Research {{has shown that}} extraction of terrain elevation data using satellite repeat pass interferometry SAR technique due to atmospheric factors {{and the lack of}} coherence between the images in areas with dense vegetation cover is a problematic. So the use of <b>Radargrammetry</b> technique can be effective. Generally height derived method by <b>Radargrammetry</b> consists of two stages: Images matching and space intersection. In this paper we propose a multi-stage algorithm founded on the combination of feature based and area based image matching. Then the RPCs that calculate for each images use for extracting 3 D coordinate in matched points. At the end, the coordinates calculating that compare with coordinates extracted from 1 meters DEM. The results show root mean square errors for 360 points are 3. 09 meters. We use a pair of spotlight TerraSAR-X images from JAM (IRAN) in this article...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for combining radar image shape-from-shading with stereo <b>radargrammetry</b> to produce terrain surface models using multiple SAR images is described. This technique {{is expected to}} be of use to reconstruct surface shape from Magellan images of planet Venus, and to refine the results of terrestrial radar measurements. Local variation in pixel shading is an indicator of terrain slope changes. This variation in pixel shading offers an opportunity for increasing the detail of terrain mapping over that which is available from stereo <b>radargrammetry</b> alone. Shape-from-shading can potentially provide a relative change in height at each pixel. This leads to a dense set of height measurements and a more faithful rendition of the local terrain shapes. However, shape-from-shading needs some type of boundary values or external terrain low-frequency information to succeed. These can be obtained from stereo or from altimeter measurements...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models (DEMs) can be generate by interferometric SAR (InSAR) and <b>radargrammetry</b> techniques {{from different}} acquisition of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Radar imaging systems record both the phase and intensity information of the backscattered signals from ground. InSAR utilizes the phase information {{of the images}} to extract useful geodetic information, such as the height of terrain, ground deformation and movement. However, InSAR technique is constrained by the temporal and spatial baselines between the images used, {{as well as the}} various atmospheric conditions at the time of acquisitions. In comparison, <b>radargrammetry</b> technique uses the intensity (power) information in a stereo-pair of radar images. It is similar to stereo-grammetry or photogrammetry which is a classic method for relief reconstruction using airborne/spaceborne optical imageries. In this paper, the radargrammetric DEM quality improvement method using SAR image processing is presented by ENVISAT/ASAR imageries...|$|E
40|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that {{spaceborne}} single-pass cross-track SAR interferometry is - up to an overall range shift - not affected by atmospheric effects. A closer analysis reveals, however, that both the troposphere and the ionosphere may cause notable phase, range and height offsets even in a single-pass interferometer. One such offset is due to slightly different incident angles which cause different path lengths through both the troposphere and the ionosphere. Another subtle effect arises from the wavenumber shift in combination with a dispersive medium like the ionosphere, which may induce differential range offsets in coherent <b>radargrammetry.</b> The analyses in this paper are not only of importance for future low-frequency bistatic SAR missions like Tandem-L, but they may also shed some new light on how the ionosphere can influence repeat-pass interferometry and <b>radargrammetry</b> in case of non-vanishing cross-track baselines...|$|E

40|$|Geomatic tools fast terrain {{modelling}} play {{a relevant}} role in hydrogeological risk mapping and emergency management. Given their complete independence from logistic {{constraints on the}} ground (as for airborne data collection), illumination (daylight), and weather (clouds) conditions, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite systems may provide important contributions in terms of digital surface models (DSMs) and digital elevation models (DEMs). For this work we focused on the potential of high-resolution SAR satellite imagery for DSM generation using an interferometric (InSAR) technique and using a revitalized radargrammetric stereomapping approach. The goal of this work was just methodological. Our goal was to illustrate both the fundamental advantages and drawbacks of the radargrammetric approach {{with respect to the}} InSAR technique for DSM generation, and to outline their possible joint role in hydrogeological risk mapping and emergency management. Here, it is worth mentioning that <b>radargrammetry</b> procedures are independent of image coherence (unlike the interferometric approach) and phase unwrapping, as well as of parsimony (only a few images are necessary). Therefore, a short time is required for image collection (from tens of minutes to a few hours), thanks to the independence from illumination and weather. The most relevant obstacles of the technique are speckle and the lack of texture impact on image matching, as well as the well-known deformations of SAR imagery (layover and foreshortening), which may produce remarkable difficulties with complex morphologies and that must be accounted for during acquisition planning. Here, we discuss results obtained with InSAR and <b>radargrammetry</b> applied to a COSMO-SkyMed SpotLight triplet (two stereopairs suited for <b>radargrammetry</b> and InSAR, sharing one common image) acquired over suburbs of San Francisco (United States), which are characterized by mixed morphology and land cover. We mainly focused on urban areas and zones covered by bare soil and rocks. Image processing was performed using the well-known commercial software SARscape® for InSAR, and the radargrammetric suite implemented in SISAR, software developed at the Geodesy and Geomatic Division of the University of Rome "La Sapienza". Global accuracies were approximately 5 m using both approaches. However, several differences in terrain morphology reconstruction were determined and are underlined and evaluated here, as well as a possible way to further enhance the results using the integration of InSAR and <b>radargrammetry.</b> © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

Generally height derived method by <b>Radargrammetry</b> {{consists of two}} stages: Images matching and space intersection. In this {{paper we propose a}} multi-step image matching algorithm founded on feature based matching. In this multi step algorithm, a SAR image is firstly filtered by a speckle suppression algorithm. a SIFT (Scale invariant feature transform) is used to extract feature points. Then we use non parametric Transformation as discriptor for the points extracted. Matching is sometimes more efficient when operating on image signals that have been transformed in some way, rather than operating on the pure intensity values themselves; In this article we use a pair of spotlight long base line TerraSAR-X images from JAM (IRAN). In a part with 700 × 700 pixels of these images 90 points are matched with using Ranklet algorithm. The mean absolute error of the corresponding points is 0. 9 pixel.

40|$|Generally, {{there are}} two ways to {{generate}} Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which are Interferometer Synthetic Aperture Radar(InSAR) and <b>radargrammetry.</b> Considering the disadvantages of InSAR data, such as the limit of terrain and the influence of water content, the application field of InSAR is relatively limited, while <b>radargrammetry</b> is more widely applied since it does not have such limits. However, for high-precision stereo SAR imagery, since the terrain distortion caused by shooting angle cannot be eliminated and the speckle noises are obvious, the classical matching algorithms for optical stereo images do not have the same effect on SAR data. Based on the experience of optical stereo image matching, this paper proposes a new algorithm which combines the feature of SIFT image matching, region-based least squares matching and TIN. First, SIFT matching is used as the initial matching to obtain the sparse DEM, then by using TIN the matching points are forecast, finally the region-based least squares matching is adopted to get accurate matching points. In this paper, COSMO-SkyMed and TSX stereo images of Lanzhou area are used to validate the proposed method. Experiment results show that the algorithm can be effectively used in stereo SAR matching and high-precision DEM production. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The most {{intuitive}} way {{to extract}} depth information from remote sensing images is stereogrammetry, {{in which a}} digital elevation model (DEM) is achieved by computing stereoscopic radar images. When only the amplitude of the radar images is considered, this computation is called <b>radargrammetry.</b> The main idea {{of which is to}} match stereopair radar images {{in order to create a}} disparity map from one image to the other and, finally, to compute the elevation. Therein, we present our studies on the extraction of 3 -D information from radar images. We examine a way to produce a DEM of a challenging area of the French Alps. The central issue of this paper concerns improvements for radargrammetric synthetic aperture radar image processing for high-relief reconstruction, and we focus on the matching step, which is one of the most important points of the radargrammetric processing. Thus, we propose original methods using different correlation windows. On the one hand, we take the advantages of a multiwindow approach to combine relevant information by multiplying the correlation surfaces obtained for each correlation window size during the matching operation. On the other hand, the second improvement is based on the expansion of windows on foreshortened areas, particularly because of the side-looking radar view. These methods allow us to achieve reliable image matching and to improve the accuracy of the DEM.

40|$|Accurate {{data about}} the forest are needed both in climate {{research}} and forest management planning. This thesis focuses on using different types of three-dimensional (3 D) satellite data sources to accurately estimate forest variables, primarily above-ground biomass (AGB) and tree height (H). Different satellite sensors have been used and compared, and depending on the sensors, the acquired satellite images have been processed in different ways to create 3 D surface models. The three main processing alternatives have been stereogrammetry, <b>radargrammetry</b> and interferometry. The surface models were used together with digital terrain models from airborne laser scanning, to take {{the difference between the}} two in order to create canopy height models. The models have been built and evaluated on data from two test sites: Krycklan located in northern Sweden (Lat. 64 °N, Long. 19 °E) and Remningstorp in southern Sweden (Lat. 58 °N, Long. 13 °E). The included studies have shown that 3 D satellite data are efficient to use for accurate estimations of AGB and H at stand-level. Moreover, the optical stereogrammetric models can play a role in the boreal region, but to obtain accurate estimations they are dependent on rather high resolution, along-track data with pixel sizes smaller than 10 m. <b>Radargrammetry</b> applies stereogrammetry to radar images, which can be taken regardless of atmospheric conditions, time of day, or season.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{remote sensing}} has enabled {{detailed}} mapping of terrain and vegetation heights. Consequently, forest inventory attributes are estimated {{more and more}} using point clouds and normalized surface models. In practical applications, mainly airborne laser scanning (ALS) {{has been used in}} forest resource mapping. The current status is that ALS-based forest inventories are widespread, and the popularity of ALS has also raised interest toward alternative 3 D techniques, including airborne and spaceborne techniques. Point clouds can be generated using photogrammetry, <b>radargrammetry</b> and interferometry. Airborne stereo imagery can be used in deriving photogrammetric point clouds, as very-high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are used in <b>radargrammetry</b> and interferometry. ALS is capable of mapping both the terrain and tree heights in mixed forest conditions, which is an advantage over aerial images or SAR data. However, in many jurisdictions, a detailed ALS-based digital terrain model is already available, and that enables linking photogrammetric or SAR-derived heights to heights above the ground. In other words, in forest conditions, the height of single trees, height of the canopy and/or density of the canopy can be measured and used in estimation of forest inventory attributes. In this paper, first we review experiences of the use of digital stereo imagery and spaceborne SAR in estimation of forest inventory attributes in Finland, and we compare techniques to ALS. In addition, we aim to present new implications based on our experiences...|$|E

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{satellite}} systems may give important contribution {{in terms of}} Digital Surface Models (DSMs) generation considering their complete independence from logistic constraints {{on the ground and}} weather conditions. In recent years, the new availability of very high resolution SAR data (up to 20 cm Ground Sample Distance) gave a new impulse to <b>radargrammetry</b> and allowed new applications and developments. Besides, to date, among the software aimed to radargrammetric applications only few show as free and open source. It is in this context that it has been decided to widen DATE (Digital Automatic Terrain Extractor) plug-in capabilities and additionally include the possibility to use SAR imagery for DSM stereo reconstruction (i. e. <b>radargrammetry),</b> besides to the optical workflow already developed.

40|$|With {{the launch}} of the recent {{high-resolution}} Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite missions, e. g., TerraSAR-X, RadarSAT- 2, and CosmoSkymed, the technique of <b>radargrammetry</b> motivates interest again to potentially improve upon the level of detail and accuracy of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from a global coverage perspective as an alternative to data derived from Interferometric SAR (IFSAR), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), or the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). A stereoradargrammetric DEM extraction capability has been developed in-house with large area operational capacity. A number of DEMs, posted at 10 meters, have been generated from the TerraSAR-X strip-map mode stereo images, and evaluated relative to Intermap’s NEXTMap airborne DEM (vertical accuracy specification is 1 meter RMSE for a 5 meter grid). Vertical accuracies of 3 ~ 5 m (RMSE) were observed in the low-relief, bare terrain areas, which outperformed, in these cases, a 90 m SRTM DEM that had been re-sampled to a 10 meter grid. However, the implementation of the stereo <b>radargrammetry</b> concept has some limitations. For instance, the resulting DEM is severely strongly affected by speckle in the images. Therefore the terrain needs to be overly smoothed and this results in a loss of spatial resolution and accuracy. Although the stereo DEM can be improved with the application of a speckle reducing filter and through development of more efficient image matching algorithms, another approach is through merging with a complementary source, such as a photogrammetrically-derived DEM. The medium-resolution optical stereo images from ALOS/PRISM, are candidates for this approach. However, photogrammetric DEMs also have their intrinsic limitations, for instance, cloud coverage, and in the areas of interest the potential absence of Ground Control Points (GCPs).

In recent years, InSAR’s capabilities have been considerably improved by advanced processing techniques such as Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and SAR Tomography. However, complicated scattering situations such as layover need to be better resolved in urban areas. This master thesis presents a new technique for providing the 3 D scatterer location and the resolution cell configuration and consequently, more precise surface displacement of urban areas can be realized by combining this technique with Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and SAR Tomography. The implemented method is based on the principle of <b>radargrammetry</b> and uses Bayesian inference to estimate heights of point scatterers. Since the method is based only on amplitude of SAR images, it is insensitive to limitations caused by coherency due to temporal decorrelation, a small spread of incidence angles caused by a small orbital tube, the atmospheric phase screen and non-linear displacement.. For implementing this method, a new estimation framework has been developed, wherein, directed graphs are used to represent dependencies of random variables and probability density functions are modelled by particle representations. The principle of <b>radargrammetry</b> is converted to a simple Bayesian line fitting problem for estimating heights of individual point scatterers. To improve the technique, joint estimation of small neighbourhoods has been implemented. The implemented estimation framework allows a Bayesian model selection, which is used during joint estimation of a small neighbourhood to test for the hypotheses of a vertical wall or a horizontal surface. High Resolution Spotlight TerraSAR-X preprocessed interferometric data of the Berlin central station {{has been used}} as a processing example.

40|$|A {{topographic}} map {{is a prerequisite}} to the thematic map of geological and environmental information. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has become {{an important source of}} topographical information for many scientific and engineering uses, such as hydrological and geological studies, infrastructure planning and environmental applications. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) can be generated by using various techniques and by using a range of data sources, including ground surveying, photogrammetry, optical remote sensing, radar, and laser scanning. Where topographical data is unavailable, global coverage elevation data sets, typically DEMs based on remotely sensed data, can be the main source of information. Remote sensing techniques are a rapid means of acquiring elevation information over extensive terrain. In particular, processing remotely sensed data collected by Earth observation satellites is a very efficient and cost-effective mean of acquiring up-to-date and relatively accurate land cover and topographic information. Active remote sensing sensors (such as radar), which can operate in almost all weather conditions and also in darkness using their own illumination have become an important remote sensing technique. In radar remote sensing systems, DEM generation methods are based on the analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and include interferometry, <b>radargrammetry,</b> radarclinometry, and polarimetry. The two most common methods for generating DEMs from SAR images are: (1) <b>radargrammetry,</b> a technique derived from photogrammetry and based on the stereoscopic principle, (2) interferometry, based on the phase differences between identical imaged points in two SAR images. This thesis describes the methods or techniques of DEM quality improvement and reduction in elevation errors, which are generated by various SAR techniques and imagery. InSAR DEM generation relies on the measurement of phase difference between two sets of complex radar signals, i. e. the range difference between the satellite-borne radar instrument and the ground targets reflecting the radar transmissions. In InSAR DEM generation, the so-called &# 147;master image&# 148; parameters, such as signal wavelength, incidence angle, and SAR image relationship (i. e. perpendicular baseline), affect the final DEM products. Furthermore, the different orbit direction (ascending and descending) provides a different representation of terrain and multi-temporal observation, leading to a more detailed representation of terrain over the same target area. Hence, ways of improving the quality of InSAR DEMs include using images collected by the satellite sensor from different orbit directions and multi-epoch data acquisitions. Also, in the case of InSAR DEM generation, major issues related to long satellite repeat-cycle times and low resolution DEM updating are discussed and solutions are proposed for ground distortion excluding method and selective elevation updating. Depending on the data acquisition conditions, the InSAR technique is less robust and more difficult to implement, particularly because the InSAR technique often produces poor results caused by poor coherence, atmospheric differences between two processed images and conditions. These three factors are influenced by the incidence angle and the Doppler similarity, which are quite stringent. InSAR requires the expectations of a certain baseline while interferometry is sensitive to the direction of sensor movements and some other factors. For this reason, the <b>radargrammetry</b> technique is an important alternative for DEM generation...|$|E

SAR <b>radargrammetry,</b> on the contrary, has the advantage that the required acquisitions are obtained in shorter time spans, what can be helpful in cases where rapid response is on demand. By matching corresponding points of a stereo image pair, surface height can be retrieved. Our approach propose to determine 3 D building parameters, especially height information, relying on the radargrammetric analysis of building layover areas. In this paper, we newly combined a hierarchical matching approach with a matching criterion based on the coefficient of variation. Our method shows improvement if compared to previous works...|$|E
40|$|Consistent, {{detailed}} and up-to-date forest resource information {{is required for}} allocation of forestry activities and national and international reporting obligations. We evaluated the forest stand attribute prediction accuracy when <b>radargrammetry</b> was used to derive height information from TerraSAR-X stereo imagery. Radargrammetric elevations were normalized to heights above ground using an airborne laser scanning (ALS) -derived digital terrain model (DTM). Derived height metrics were used as predictors in the most similar neighbor (MSN) estimation approach. In total, 207 field measured plots were used in MSN estimation, and the obtained results were validated using 94 stands with an average area of 4. 1 ha. The relative root mean square errors for Lorey’s height, basal area, stem volume, and above-ground biomass were 6. 7 % (1. 1 m), 12. 0 % (2. 9 m 2 /ha), 16. 3 % (31. 1 m 3 /ha), and 16. 1 % (15. 6 t/ha). Although the prediction accuracies were promising, {{it should be noted}} that the predictions included bias. The respective biases were − 4. 6 % (− 0. 7 m), − 6. 4 % (− 1. 6 m 2 /ha), − 9. 3 % (− 17. 8 m 3 /ha), and − 9. 5 % (− 9. 1 t/ha). With detailed DTM, TerraSAR-X stereo radargrammetry-derived forest information appears to be suitable for providing consistent forest resource information over large areas...|$|E
40|$|Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) can be {{generated}} {{using a variety of}} techniques and data sources including levelling, photogrammetry, SAR interferometry, <b>radargrammetry,</b> and laser scanning. These different-sourced DEMs are affected by different systematic vertical and horizontal errors, as well as random noise. Moreover, each DEM generally has different spatial resolution and coverage. In general, the spatial resolution of a DEM is inversely proportional to the areal coverage. For example, airborne SAR DEMs have better than 1 m resolution and 16 km swath, while the SRTM DEM has 30 m resolution and 255 km swath width. Obviously high resolution DEMs need more data to cover a large region for applications such as terrain monitoring. If all terrain areas had the same high spatial resolution, the resulting DEM would be huge. However, if only certain areas are of interest, such as CBD areas, industrial areas, or disaster affected areas, a relatively high spatial resolution DEM is required, while other areas, such as those covered by forest, crossed by rivers, or have mountainous terrain, may be of lower resolution. The authors propose a method that exploits the information contained in the area of overlap between DEMs of different scale {{in order to reduce the}} total DEM data size and processing time by removing excess data in areas of reduced interest, while at the same time reducing the vertical systematic errors...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{elevation}} {{models have}} large relevance in some territorial applications, such as topographic mapping, {{spatial and temporal}} change detection, feature extraction and data visualization. Two different methods to extract absolute or relative elevation from SAR data are interferometry and <b>radargrammetry,</b> both using a couple of images of the same area acquired from two different points of view. At present, {{the importance of the}} radargrammetric approach is rapidly growing due to the new high resolution imagery (up to 1 m GSD) which can be acquired by COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT- 2 sensors in Spotlight mode. It is well known that the two main steps for DSMs generation from SAR imagery according to the radargrammetric approach are the stereo pair orientation and the image matching for the detection of homologous points. In this paper the topics related to image orientation of SAR stereo pairs through an orientation model based on geometric reconstruction are investigated. The new model, implemented in the scientific software SISAR (Software per Immagini Satellitari ad Alta Risoluzione) has been tested on two SAR stereo pair acquired in Spotlight mode on the test site of Mausanne (Southern France) and on Merano (Northern Italy). The same data set has been tested in the commercial software PCI Geomatica v. 10. 3, in order to evaluate the accuracy of the orientation performed with Toutin rigorous orientation model...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models {{produced from}} COSMO-SkyMed imagery {{were used to}} delineate palaeo-drainage in a wide area surrounding the Siwa and Al-Jaghbub oases of the western Sahara Desert (Egypt and Libya). This new generation of synthetic aperture radar imagery is suitable for this purpose because of its high spatial resolution and capacity to penetrate dry surface sediments. Different techniques such as radar interferometry and <b>radargrammetry</b> were used to produce digital elevation models. These were assessed for accuracy and then combined to produce a single elevation model of the area. The resulting elevation model was used to support the geological study and palaeo-environmental interpretation of the area. It revealed buried features of the landscape, including inactive palaeo-drainage systems. Drainage features were extracted from the elevation model using geographical information systems; results were combined and assessed with respect to geological field data, as well as data from the literature. Previous studies in the area suggest that a wide river, probably the old Nile River, flowed into the Libyan palaeo-Sirte before the Late Messinian drawdown of the Mediterranean Sea. During the Late Messinian lowering of the sea the fluvial system changed shape and carved deep canyons throughout north-eastern Africa. The reported findings on the key Siwa area were used to precisely delineate the physiography of the modern drainage network and to confirm findings from our previous geological research in the area...|$|E
