He {{described himself as}} [...] "totally flabbergasted", adding [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was the sort of}} record that was going to win awards". Crowley promised to use the money to fund his music. He was one of eight nominees who performed at the awards ceremony. He is a friend of fellow nominee Valerie Francis.|$|E
500|$|Comments from Darryl McDaniels, AKA DMC of Run-D.M.C., {{make this}} {{connection}} to the underground explicit: [...] "hat's exactly what we did. We didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When {{a lot of the}} old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we'd say, 'They didn't do that shit last night in the Bronx!' ... So we said that we weren't going to be fake. We ain't gonna wear no costumes. We're gonna keep it real." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

500|$|His {{birthday}} (14 December 1895) was the 34th {{anniversary of}} the death of his great-grandfather, Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been [...] "rather distressed". Two days later, he wrote again: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: [...] "I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good". Consequently, he was baptised [...] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" [...] at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later. Within the family, he was known informally as [...] "Bertie". His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name [...] "may supplant the less favoured one". Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was going to work}} out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

[...] "I think it’s great to play Fed Cup," [...] said Radwańska, [...] "I’ve been playing {{for the last couple}} of years and I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> helped my team to go up and, you know, I’m very happy about it and I’m always ready to play".|$|E

5000|$|David Stratton, {{film critic}} for The Movie Show praised Bad Boy Bubby.

[...] Previously, during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2007, Mullen told lawmakers, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is for the American people to come forward, really through this body, to both debate that policy and make changes, if that's appropriate." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'd love to have Congress make its own decisions" [...] with respect to considering repeal.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{games in}} the Need for Speed {{franchise}} included a story, but Matt Webster, producer of Hot Pursuit said: [...] "We didn’t <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to include a story. If you’re a cop, {{the aim is to}} go up the ranks, while a racer’s aim is to get to the highest rank they can." [...] EA stated that the combination of acclaimed developer Criterion Games, a socially-focused online mode and official car licences makes the franchise more accessible than before. UK product manager for Need for Speed Kevin Flynn said: [...] "This is definitely the best Need for Speed I’ve seen to date. I thought [...] was a great game but different and a bit serious, while Hot Pursuit is more fun and accessible." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{release of}} Millennium on DVD {{prompted}} Lance Henriksen {{to propose a}} continuation of the series. Henriksen speculated that the numbers behind the box set sales might be the key to reviving Frank Black. [...] "I wonder if the sales of these will tell us how many people loved the show and whether or not the movie ought to be made," [...] Henriksen told the Sci-Fi Wire. [...] "I mean, [...] still is alive. Maybe it's a good thing there was no closure for Millennium because now, if we did a movie, it would be good closure for me." [...] Henriksen has gone on to support the Back to Frank Black campaign, a movement dedicated to the return of the character, explaining, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a possibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|I have {{a theory}} about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has {{lost a lot of}} weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing his {{outstanding}} form in Serie A {{and in the}} Champions League for the 2010–11 campaign, he was pivotal to Inter's attack line. On 16 March 2011, Eto'o gave {{a legendary}} performance in Munich as he helped Inter eliminate Bayern Munich 3–2 (with an aggregate score of 3–3, winning on away goals) in the Champions League. Eto'o scored the first goal after four minutes, and provided two clinical assists to Wesley Sneijder and to Goran Pandev for the winner. After the game, Inter President Massimo Moratti said, [...] "I'm not sure if the deal that brought Eto'o to the club was my best piece of transfer business ever, but I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a great piece of business for us. Eto'o is fantastic. I {{do not want to}} take anything away from Ibrahimović, but for everyone it was really a great deal to get Eto'o. Samuel is truly extraordinary." [...] On 29 May, Eto'o scored two goals in the final of the Coppa Italia against Palermo to help Inter win 3–1 and taking his total season goals to 37, a new record high for him.|$|E
