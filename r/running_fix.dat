50|$|Any sight can be {{advanced}} {{and used to}} obtain a <b>running</b> <b>fix.</b> It {{may be that the}} navigator due to weather conditions could only obtain a single sight at dawn. The resulting LOP can then be advanced when, later in the morning, a Sun observation becomes possible. The precision of a <b>running</b> <b>fix</b> depends on the error in distance and course so, naturally, a <b>running</b> <b>fix</b> tends to be less precise than an unqualified fix and the navigator must take into account his confidence in the exactitude of distance and course to estimate the resulting error in the <b>running</b> <b>fix.</b>|$|E

50|$|A fix {{is called}} a <b>running</b> <b>fix</b> when {{one or more of}} the LOPs used to obtain it is an LOP {{advanced}} or retrieved over time. In order to get a fix the LOP must cross at an angle, the closer to 90° the better. This means the observations must have different azimuths. During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an LOP from the observation but not a fix as another LOP is needed. What may be done is take a first sight which yields one LOP and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, take a second sight which yields a second LOP. Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first LOP can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second LOP yields a <b>running</b> <b>fix.</b>|$|E

40|$|Reviewed are the {{theoretical}} assumptions underlying two transfer techniques known from celestial navigation. The objective of both techniques is to correctly transfer the GP {{of an earlier}} sight for the run. One is the <b>running</b> <b>fix</b> technique (RFT) known from coastal navigation and applied to celestial configurations, here called celestial RFT. An application of celestial RFT is the iterative least-squares (LSQ) program, which incorporates celestial RFT and is then denoted as LSQ*. The other transfer technique, called GD-UT, refers to {{the transfer of the}} position circle of an earlier sight by transferring its GP for the run data. With GD-UT, the motion of the observer relative to the GP of the original sight only depends on the run data and is therefore divorced from the assumed initial and final coordinates of the run. It is this latter assumed position, which in applying celestial RFT introduces various anomalies in respect of the properties of the transferred position circle. Only in ‘limiting’ configurations such as the presence of small Zd will the position solution with RFT converge on the one obtainable with GD-UT...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{traditional}} approach relying on sight reduction tables, a non-programmatic {{location of the}} position fix and an inadequate allowance for observation errors is still widely pursued and advocated. In the late 1970 s the programmatic Least Squares method (LSQ) was introduced which determines a random error fix (FixQ) for any multiple sights combination. B. D Yallop & C. Y Hohenkerk (1985) expanded LSQ to incorporate the computation of the random error margin of a fix. Several marketed PDA-based programs apply LSQ, but none have fully incorporated the random error margin {{as a guide for}} the navigator. All existing LSQ applications have two drawbacks. One is, all observation error is attributed to random sources, whereas the possibility of systematic error has in fact a long theoretical and practical background in celestial navigation. Systematic error represents a bias in statistical random error theory and can and should be allowed for. A major drawback is that existing LSQ program applications incorporate the <b>running</b> <b>fix</b> technique (RFT) traditionally applied in coastal navigation. It has no general validity in celestial navigation. The position circle of an earlier celestial sight can only be mathematically correctly transferred when its Geometric Position (GP) is transferred for the run data. A final aspect of reliability is the strategy adopted at the sight planning stage. At least during twilight observations, navigators should aim at getting three or four sights with a total azimuth angle> 180 o, with three successive subsights on each body. In such configurations FixQ and FixS will b...|$|E

For random effects to work in the school example it is necessary that the school-specific effects be uncorrelated to the other covariates of the model. This can be tested by <b>running</b> <b>fixed</b> effects, then random effects, and doing a Hausman specification test. If the test rejects, then random effects is biased and fixed effects is the correct estimation procedure.|$|R

50|$|Until recently, {{constructing}} simulator rides was an expensive, {{high tech}} business. The first simulators were built to train military pilots. Long before {{the days of}} virtual reality, the view through the cockpit came from remote video cameras which moved on gantries above physical model landscapes. These model landscapes were huge, often the size of aircraft hangars. By the mid-1990s, computer virtual reality graphics replaced most physical models in simulators. Today's flight training simulators, like NASA’s, have virtual landscapes projected on multiple screens giving a 180 degree view.

This paper empirically tests this hypothesis using data on a country with one of the longest <b>running</b> <b>fixed</b> exchange rate regimes (1975 -present). The results of the study confirm the theoretical predictions of Edwards and Vegh, but they also show that the propagation of nominal shocks in fixed exchange rate systems is comparatively slower than in countries with a more flexible exchange rate regime. monetary transmission, fixed exchange rates, cointegration,...|$|R

30|$|The {{main goal}} of the paper is to rigorously analyze the impact of {{borrowing}} costs incurred by a defaultable investor on her optimal allocation strategy. We construct a dynamic optimization framework where a defaultable investor can buy CDS upfronts, borrow at a premium over the risk-free rate, and invest in a money market account at the risk-free rate. The choice of upfront CDSs reflects regulatory market practices following the Big Bang Protocol (ISDA News Release 2009), and requiring distressed credits to trade with an upfront fee plus a <b>running</b> <b>fixed</b> coupon depending on the credit quality of the reference entity. The borrowing rate of the investor accounts both for her credit quality and for feedback effects generated by default of the reference entity. The latter are modeled using a contagion credit risk model with interacting default intensities, see also Jarrow and Yu (2001) for more explicit examples and Frey and Backhaus (2008) for a theoretical illustration. The investor maximizes her power utility from terminal wealth until the earlier of either her default time or the investment horizon.|$|R

40|$|AbstractConsidering defects {{of current}} single celestial-body {{positioning}} {{methods such as}} discontinuity and long period, a new sun positioning algorithm is herein put forward. Instead of traditional astronomical spherical trigonometry and celestial coordinate system, the proposed new positioning algorithm is built by theory of mechanisms. Based on previously derived solar vector equations (from a C 1 R 2 P 2 series mechanism), a further global positioning method is developed by inverse kinematics. The longitude and latitude coordinates expressed by Greenwich mean time (GMT) and solar vector in local coordinate system are formulated. Meanwhile, elimination method of multiple solutions, errors of longitude and latitude calculation are given. In addition, this algorithm has been integrated successfully into a mobile phone application to visualize sun positioning process. Results of theoretical verification and smart phone’s test demonstrate the validity of presented coordinate’s expressions. Precision is shown as equivalent to current works and is acceptable to civil aviation requirement. This new method solves long-period problem in sun sight <b>running</b> <b>fixing</b> and improves applicability of sun positioning. Its methodology can inspire development of new sun positioning device. It would be more applicable to be combined with inertial navigation systems for overcoming discontinuity of celestial navigation systems and accumulative errors of inertial navigation systems...|$|R

Several experiments have been conducted in laboratory facilities to assess the potential of HCNG blends in order to decrease the exhaust emissions. This paper reports the results of experimental tests performed at the ENEA Casaccia Research Center aiming to evaluate the energy and environmental performances of a CNG vehicle when fuelled with a hydrogen-methane blend.
