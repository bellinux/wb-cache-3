5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Steve Davis {{won his first}} world title in 1981, there had been just ten world champions since 1927, with Davis {{becoming}} the eleventh, including {{the winner of the}} boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the fourteenth in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). O'Sullivan is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). Mark Williams has won twice (2000 and 2003) and John Higgins four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but {{since the beginning of the}} century, there has not been a dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> Davis for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985 and still holds the record for most tournament wins overall, at a time when there were far fewer tournaments than today. By retaining his title in 2013, O'Sullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row.|$|E

500|$|The Act {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the toughest anti-corruption legislation in the world", <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> above the standard set by the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Despite being [...] "widely drafted and far-reaching in scope [...] in many ways an improvement upon earlier corruption legislation", significant concerns have been raised, mainly around the fact that the Act may harm British industry's competitiveness in the global market. David Aaronberg and Nichola Higgins, writing in the Archbold Review, argue that section 6 particularly has the potential to include actions which are ethically problematic but seen as legally permissible. Aisha Anwar and Gavin Deeprose in the Scots Law Times take a similar line, highlighting as particularly problematic areas corporate hospitality and facilitation payments, described as [...] "essentially a form of extortion on the payer and, although not a common feature in the UK, they are commonplace in many international jurisdictions", which may fall under the scope of the Act despite being permissible in the commercial world.|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E

2500|$|The NRA's Distinguished Smallbore Rifleman Badge (Prone) and Distinguished Smallbore Rifleman Badge (Position) were {{established}} in 1965 while the Double Distinguished Smallbore Rifleman Badge was established in 2009.

2500|$|Two {{designers}} at Commodore, Fred Bowen and Bil Herd, {{were determined}} to rectify {{the problems of the}} Plus/4. They intended that the eventual successors to the C64—the Commodore 128 and 128D computers (1985)—were to build upon the C64, avoiding the Plus/4's flaws. The successors had many improvements such as a structured BASIC with graphics and sound commands, 80-column display ability, and full CP/M compatibility. The decision to make the Commodore 128 plug compatible with the C64 was made quietly by Bowen and Herd, software and hardware designers respectively, without the knowledge or approval by the management in the post Jack Tramiel era. The designers were careful not to reveal their decision until the project was too far along to be challenged or changed and still make the impending Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Upon learning that the C128 was designed to be compatible with the C64, Commodore's marketing department independently announced that the C128 would be 100% compatible with the C64, thereby <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for C64 support. In a case of malicious compliance, the 128 design was altered to include a separate [...] "64 mode" [...] using a complete C64 environment to ensure total compatibility.|$|E
