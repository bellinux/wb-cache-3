5|$|Boletus auripes has a disjunct distribution, {{and is one}} {{of several}} fungi found in both eastern Asia and eastern North America.

5|$|Hapalopilus nidulans has {{a mostly}} circumboreal {{distribution}} in the north temperate zone, and {{has been found in}} North Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Outside of this region, it has been recorded from Australia, and Oceania. In North America, where it can be found as far north as the Northwest Territories in Canada, it is more common in the eastern and southwestern part of the continent. In Europe, its northern distribution extends to Porsanger in Norway. <b>Reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time from India in 2011, it was found in forests depots of Chhattisgarh, growing on the stored logs of several native trees: Anogeissus latifolia, Chloroxylon swietenia, Desmodium oojeinense, Shorea robusta, and Terminalia elliptica.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis {{occurs in}} two disjunct ranges in {{southern}} Australia. In southwest Western Australia, {{it has been}} recorded from Perth and the Avon wheatbelt southwest to Augusta and east along the southern coastline to Esperance. In the southeast of the continent, it is found from eastern South Australia, {{where it has been}} recorded from Mount Gambier and the Fleurieu Peninsula, the Mount Lofty Ranges around Adelaide, the Murraylands, and north to the Flinders Ranges and from Lincoln National Park at the apex of the Eyre Peninsula, through to southeast Queensland. It also occurs in Tasmania. It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests, in habitats as diverse as the arid scrubland of Wyperfeld National Park and subalpine areas of Mount Buffalo National Park, as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruit bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Outside Australia, it has been recorded from Norfolk Island. In 2012, it was <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time from Kerala, India, where it was discovered growing on a coconut tree stump.|$|E
5|$|Palynology (the {{study of}} pollen), {{as well as}} studies of fossil megaflora and invertebrates, had {{initially}} suggested that the uppermost Cedar Mountain Formation – including the Mussentuchit – dated to the Albian stage. A 1997 argon-argon dating of sanidine crystals recovered from a volcanic ash layer in the upper Cedar Mountain Formation by Cifelli and colleagues indicated an age of 97 ± 0.1 million years, which was then considered to be just after {{the boundary between the}} Albian and Cenomanian stages. This is similar to the early Cenomanian age <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> overlying Dakota Formation. Subsequently, in 2007, James Garrison and colleagues dated the volcanic ash layer passing through the Cifelli #2 Quarry – which is likely the same layer dated previously by Cifelli and colleagues – to 96.7 ± 0.5 million years ago. At an approximate level, the Cifelli and Garrison estimates agree with each other, thus indicating a Cenomanian age for Eolambia. Garrison and colleagues also re-analyzed the pollen assemblage from localities throughout the Mussentuchit, concluding that the assemblage spans the Albian-Cenomanian boundary.|$|E

5|$|The later 860s saw a {{reduction}} of activity by the Foreigners—although the Annals indignantly report that they plundered the ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth in 863—with the Dublin forces active in Pictland and in the six months' siege of Dumbarton Rock. Áed Findliath took advantage of these absences to destroy the Viking fortresses {{in the north of}} Ireland. Amlaíb left Ireland for good in 871 and Ímar died in 873.

5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E
5|$|The spores are , amyloid (meaning {{they turn}} bluish-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7–9 by 4–5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are 30–35 by 7–8μm, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are {{embedded}} in the hymenium and inconspicuous, measuring 20–28 by 6–12μm. They are irregular in form; some have short rodlike projections on the upper part, others have irregular branched finger-like protuberances, while others have wavy walls and an elongated contorted apex. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in Mycena maculata. The gill tissue is hyaline or very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap tissue has a thin , and the region directly under it is made of hyphae with only slightly enlarged cells, while the remainder is filamentous, and stains yellowish to slightly vinaceous-brown in iodine. The mycelium of M.maculata is bioluminescent; this property has not been <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fruit bodies.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Brass was {{dismissed}} after a home defeat to Forest Green Rovers, which left York fourth {{from the bottom}} of the table. His assistant Viv Busby took over as caretaker manager before former Derby County coach Billy McEwan was appointed in February 2005. Under McEwan, York avoided relegation to the Conference North, with a 17th-place finish in 2004–05. One-third into 2005–06, York were in second place but poor midseason results saw them slide down the table. They pushed for the play-offs after six consecutive wins but finished in eighth place after faltering in the run-in. With 22 goals, Andy Bishop was the Conference National top scorer in 2005–06. Financial problems arose again; a loss of £150,000 was <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> season, and there were problems meeting the first annual payment of £100,000 to the FSIF. McGill's company JM Packaging made a proposal to the ST to become majority shareholders, and would lend the club £650,000 to cover the current losses and meet the loan repayments for the next five years. ST members approved the proposal in June 2006, and JM Packaging became 75% shareholders, reducing the ST's previous 85% ownership to 25%. York made a good start to 2006–07, and were never out of the top five from early November 2006. They finished the season in fourth place and played Morecambe in the play-off semi-final; after drawing 0–0 at home in the first leg, they were beaten 2–1 at Christie Park in the second leg.|$|E
