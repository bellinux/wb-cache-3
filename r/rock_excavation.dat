25|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} tasks {{during the course of}} the construction was a <b>rock</b> <b>excavation</b> work costing S$1.5 million along Woodlands Avenue 3, in which explosives were used to make way for the train viaduct. Another difficult project was the levelling of land covered in thick vegetation in Kadut, Woodlands and Sembawang. The laying of a 22-metre long concrete beam weighing 165 tonnes in October 1994 marked the completion of the structural link between the existing MRT network and the Woodlands extension line. The entire Woodlands extension line consists of around 1,163 beams. The tracks were then laid, followed by the installation of the electrical and mechanical systems and equipment. A real-time information system, costing S$400,000, was first introduced on the Woodlands MRT line. It provides passengers with train arrival times and informs them if trains are late or disrupted. The information is displayed on electronic boards installed at the entrance of each station.|$|E

5000|$|Gillette claimed, {{that this}} was [...] "the first {{published}} volume treating of earth economics in a comprehensive way." [...] In line with this topic Gillette in 1904 published Rock excavation: methods and cost. In its preface Gillette (1904) gave an introduction of mineral production and rock excavation:The value of the mineral products of America annually exceeds $1,000,000,000. For explosives alone the sum of $20,000,000 is expended each year, and it is well within limits to say that fully twice as great a sum is paid out to drillers and blasters. When we consider the labor, {{the power and the}} powder required to mine and to quarry products in the aggregate so enormously valuable, we can not fail to be impressed with the scantiness of literature on the economics of <b>rock</b> <b>excavation.</b> A dozen years ago, when called upon to estimate the cost of some open cut <b>rock</b> <b>excavation,</b> I was astonished to find no text book that in the least served to guide me. I subsequently learned also that most of the matter {{to be found in the}} few books on blasting was either theoretic or too meagre to be of material value. What was true then has unfortunately remained true.|$|E
50|$|Drilling and Blasting is the {{controlled}} use of explosives and other {{methods such as}} gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics, to break <b>rock</b> for <b>excavation.</b> It is practiced most often in mining, quarrying and civil engineering such as dam or road construction.

50|$|The Lithgow Zig Zag {{operated}} between 1870 and 1910. By then it {{had become}} an increasingly inefficient bottleneck owing to the growing traffic on the line between Lithgow and Sydney. The Top Points were also too short. In 1901 a goods engine burst through the buffer stops located at the top 'wing' and almost fell into the valley below. To alleviate the congestion until a new deviation opened the 'top' and 'bottom' wings were improved. The 'top' wing was abandoned and a new line constructed which involved a sharp curve, heavy <b>rock</b> <b>excavations</b> and earth filings {{to a depth of}} 60 ft. The 'bottom' wing was lengthened without any re-location. However, accidents still continued to occur, as was seen on 8 December 1908 when a Sydney bound goods train stalled just beyond Clarence Tunnel. The train was divided into two but the bottom portion accidentally became a runaway and eventually crashed into the rock cutting of Top Points.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an extensive laboratory investigation on the geotechnical properties of waste <b>excavation</b> <b>rock</b> in pavement sub-bases. The waste <b>excavation</b> <b>rock</b> {{used in this study}} originated from 'basalt floaters' or surface <b>excavation</b> basalt <b>rock</b> (basalt). Traditionally this material would have been disposed as waste, often into landfill. The engineering properties of the crushed basaltic waste rock were compared with the local road authority specifications to assess its performance as a pavement sub-base material. The experimental programme was extensive and included tests such as particle size distribution, modified Proctor compaction, particle density, water absorption, California Bearing Ratio, Los Angeles abrasion loss, pH, organic content, static triaxial and repeated load triaxial tests. The Los Angeles abrasion loss value obtained indicated that the crushed basaltic waste rock is durable. California Bearing Ratio values were found to satisfy the local state road authority requirements for a lower sub-base material. Repeated load triaxial testing established that the crushed basaltic waste rock would perform satisfactorily as a pavement sub-base material in the field. The results of the laboratory testing undertaken in this research indicated that crushed basaltic waste <b>excavation</b> <b>rock</b> satisfied the criteria for use in pavement sub-base applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study to}} determine the stability of <b>rock</b> <b>excavations</b> in the La Yesca spillway channel using numerical analysis. The results of the analysis led to implementing important changes in the original conception of the spillway (reorientation, channel geometry and length) {{in order to ensure}} rock slope stability under static and seismic conditions. This paper describes the 3 D numerical modeling of a 280 m high slope (corresponding to the original project) cut in a rock mass having complex geological formations. The modeling was carried out to evaluate both the static and dynamic stability of the projected rock slope. The construction site presented complex geological features such as faults and dikes as well as several geological formations resulting from varying qualities and fracture conditions. Available field data made it possible to incorporate the most important geological and topographical features. The spillway excavation was simulated using four stages. The effect of blast-induced damage and stress relaxation on the rock mass was also taken into account. After the simulation of the excavation process was completed, the seismic motion design for the La Yesca dam was input. These dynamic analysis simulated the three-dimensional behavior of the spillway which enabled identifying possible block instabilities, thereby determining whether to stabilize them or modify the original spillway layout...|$|R

The purpose of the rockfall catchment area is to prevent rockfall originating from the slope above the highway from reaching highway lanes.

However, the width of catchment increases the volume of <b>rock</b> excavated and <b>excavation</b> cost. For high rock cuts, catchment width that would successfully retain all rockfall from reaching travelled highway lanes is considered excessively expensive and conservatively wide in most cases.

50|$|The {{bridge was}} built by {{contractor}} Daelim Industrial Co., LTD, at a contract price of 40.3 million USD. Concrete pylon height with typical H-shape is 103m and constructed by auto climbing form. The main span of 327m across the lake is constructed using the free cantilever method and the side span of 57.5m is constructed by the full staging method.The combination of composite section (reinforced concrete deck and I-shaped steel girder) for the center span and concrete section for side spans applied to the bridge because of decreasing effect of weight balance. Concrete pylon has typical H-shape. The leg shape beneath the superstructure level, on the other hand, needs to be narrow {{down a little bit}} to make the size of foundation smaller mainly for less <b>rock</b> <b>excavation</b> at foundation locations and better handling of construction unit(caisson) considering the site condition. Cable is MSS(Multi Strand System) as 2 planes semi-fan. An extra pier support in each side span has been applied. To maximize the counter weight effect by concrete girder at side span, it is necessary to make the side span heavier as possible and not to have excessive bending moment by increasing dead load at the same time. Here, the extra pier support gives more opportunity for having more weight and stiffness in side span without resulting in excessive bending moment in girders and pylons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{present day}} {{location}} of the inlet is several thousand yards south of its location in 1868, the inlet had been near the former Manasquan Coast Guard Station which was adjacent to Stockton lake. [...] The Manasquan inlet historically had always been shallow, which {{made it difficult for}} large boats to navigate. When the Point Pleasant Canal was dug in 1926, the Manasquan river's water rapidly flowed through the man-made opening disrupting the natural flow of the river, this caused the inlet to completely close with sand for several years. The inlet's closure was so complete {{that it was possible to}} walk from Manasquan to Point Pleasant beach on dry ground. From 1926 to 1931 several efforts were made to reopen the inlet, including the use of high pressure water by the National Guard and local firemen to erode a narrow channel through the sand. These efforts however failed to keep the channel open and the inlet remained closed. In 1930 work begun to reopen the inlet. The Army Corps of Engineers put up temporary piers and begin building jetties. The jetties were constructed with <b>rock</b> <b>excavation</b> from the Second Avenue Subway in Manhattan.
