40|$|The {{international}} community and many financial experts have singled out the positive elements of how strong institutional reforms following Mexico’s 1995 and Turkey’s 2001 banking crisis have shielded their banking sectors to- day from the wider {{economic impact of the}} world financial crisis. By contrast, this article argues from a historical materialist analytical approach that the 1995 and 2001 bank rescues and reforms preserved, renewed, and intensified the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of finance-led neoliberal capitalism in forms institutionally specific to Mexican and Turkish society. The post-crisis reforms reinforced the dominance of banking and finance capital in Mexico and Turkey at the expense of popular classes and society in general, and it is this dynamic of power that explains the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> today...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{thoroughly}} evaluate the sensitivity of Czech commercial banks to a run on banks. Our sample includes a significant part of the Czech banking sector in the period 2006 - 2013. We use three liquidity ratios that we stress via a stress scenario simulating a run on banks accompanied by a 20 % withdrawal rate of deposits. We measure the impact of the scenario by the relative changes of these ratios. The results show that, in spite of a decrease in liquidity, most Czech banks would be able to finance such a scenario. The financial crisis influenced bank sensitivity to a run, but with a significant time lag. The severity of the impact of the bank run increases with the size of the bank; large banks are the most vulnerable. The <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> is also determined by their strategy for liquidity risk management...|$|E

This paper addresses the issue of namely which macroeconomic indicators {{that are capable of}} signaling adverse shocks towards the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> in Indonesia. This research uses an extraction signal approach as EWS mechanism. The results suggest that there are several indicators that (1) IBRI, which is composed from standardized deposit and financing, is able to figure out the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> Islamic <b>banking.</b> The <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> was considered stable since the index was moving below the normal line during the global financial crises, and (2) Some selected macro financial indicators, M 2 /reserve (M 2 res), credit growth (CG), real effective exchange rate (REER), and inflation rate (INF) empirically show low noise to signal ratio. It means that these four variables are capable of signaling vulnerabilities due to adverse external shocks.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the cross-country heterogeneity {{in retail}} bank lending {{rates in the}} euro area and presents newly developed pass-through models that account for the riskiness of borrowers, the balance sheet constraints of lenders and sovereign debt tensions affecting interest rate-setting behaviour. Country evidence for the four largest euro area countries shows that downward adjustments in policy rates and market reference rates have translated into a concomitant reduction in bank lending rates. In the case of Spain and Italy, however, sovereign bond market tensions and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment have put upward pressure on composite lending rates to non-financial corporations and households. At the same time, model simulations suggest that higher lending rates have propagated to the broader economy by depressing economic activity and inflation. As a response to increasing financial fragmentation, the ECB has introduced several standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. These measures have {{gone a long way}} towards alleviating financial market tensions in the euro area. However, in order to ensure the adequate transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets is reduced further and the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> strengthened where needed.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis the systemic importance of banks for the stability of the financial system became evident. Finansinspektionen classifies the banks Nordea, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Svenska Handelsbanken and Swedbank as systemically important for the Swedish financial system. The Basel accords strive to increase the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> and the financial system by imposing stricter regulatory capital requirements. It is debated how these restraints affect the banks’ cost of capital which prompt the first research question of the study: How has the increase in regulation regarding the capital structure of banks affected Sweden’s major banks’ cost of capital? According to Modigliani & Miller a firm’s cost of capital is independent of its capital structure. The second research question is thus: Does the development regarding Sweden’s major bank’s cost of capital align itself with the Modigliani-Miller theorem? The purpose of the study is thus to assess how the increase in regulatory capital requirements have affected the Swedish major banks’ cost of capital and to what extent these developments align with the Modigliani-Miller theorem. The researchers utilizes a quantitative method and collected secondary data for the period 2008 to 2016 to answer the formulated hypotheses which are deduced from the theoretical framework.   The results from the study illustrate significant correlations between increased regulatory capital requirements and the cost of capital. The authors can however not assert the irrelevance of capital structure for the banks’ cost capital but find that reduced tax shields only have modest effects on the banks’ cost of capital...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis in 2008 / 09 there has been heightened concern about the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> systems in Southeast Asia. This paper proposes a methodology that uses a macroprudential perspective to assess the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> systems in member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It then proceeds to apply this methodology to examine the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> the Philippine <b>banking</b> system. Data on financial soundness in the Philippine banking system are utilized in a vector autoregression model to study the dynamic relationships that exist among financial and macroeconomic indicators. Using impulse response functions, a simulation of financial ratios in the banking system is conducted by assuming unlikely but plausible stress scenarios to determine whether banking system credit and capital could withstand the impact of such circumstances. In the stress scenarios, the estimated impact of macroeconomic shocks on nonperforming loan and capital adequacy ratios is generally minimal. The results, however, do suggest that the Philippine banking system has some vulnerability to interest rate and stock market shocks. The results of such stress testing provide {{a better understanding of}} the level of preparedness required for managing risks in the financial system, especially in the wake of continuing global economic uncertainty.

40|$|The most pernicious {{effect of}} the global {{financial}} crisis is that it triggers a sequence of unpleasant consequences for the banking sector and for the entire economy as a whole. The recent financial crisis has compelled regulators {{to focus on the}} necessity of <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> towards risks and sudden financial shocks. The riskiness of banks assets and its equity are two important factors for valuation of banks. These risks can be incorporated in market valuation only through Black-Scholes-Merton Model. This paper uses Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation approach for calculation of the market value and volatility of bank’s assets for a random sample of 13 Public and 8 Private sector banks in India over the period from March 2003 to March 2012. Further, it calculates yearly Z-score for each bank, allowing for capital adequacy as per the Basel II and III norms, for the periods before and after 2008 financial crisis. The obtained Z-scores suggest that the Indian banks are far from default and the impact of global recession of 2008 on the banks solvency was insignificant. All the Indian banks have market value to enterprise value ratio typically in the range of 93 to 99 per cent, suggesting that market value of bank’s assets obtained from Black-Scholes-Merton is characteristically below its enterprise value since market value considers the riskiness of the equity and assets both. It is found that the volatility of banks assets is significantly different for public and private sector banks over the period of study. Investigation of NPA to Total Assets reveals that presently NPA levels of the public sector banks are increasing whereas it is declining for the private sector banks. ...|$|E

40|$|Of {{the current}} debate on the <b>resilience</b> <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> systems, {{what seems to be}} one of the most {{critical}} issues is with regards to the inherent pro-cyclicality in banking systems all over the world particularly in its capital, credit extension and loan loss provisioning. The critical nature of this problem lies in the systemic risks it poses to the economy at large during economic downturns. This study examines the pro-cyclical nature of loan loss provisions in 65 banks from the oil-rich Gulf Co-operation Council region and also estimates whether these banks use discretion in loan loss provisions to manage their regulatory capital and income. Results establish that loan loss provisions are indeed pro-cyclical and backward looking. On the other hand, the study finds that banks do not use discretionary provisions to manage their capital. The study however does not find sufficient evidence whether banks smooth their incomes using provisions or not. The evidence of pro-cyclicality in provisioning amongst GCC banks established in this study is particularly important to regulators and banks in the GCC region to adopt more prudent provisioning practises that are forward-looking and counter-cyclical in order to curtail the systemic risk banks may pose otherwise on the economy...|$|R
