25|$|Kickers and slingshots are <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> which {{propel the}} ball away upon impact, like bumpers, but are usually a {{horizontal}} side of a wall. Every recent pinball machine includes slingshots to the upper left and upper right of the lowest set of flippers; older games used more experimental arrangements. They operate similarly to pop bumpers, with a switch {{on each side of}} a solenoid-operated lever arm in a typical arrangement. The switches are closed by ball contact with the rubber {{on the face of the}} kicker and this activates the solenoid.|$|E
25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E

Other differences between the Spanish Leopard 2E and other Leopard2A6s include an auxiliary power unit, manufactured by SAPA, an air conditioning system and new <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> for the vehicle's tracks to increase their lifespan on the irregular Spanish terrain. About 60% of each Leopard2E was manufactured in Spain, as opposed to [...] 30% for the Swedish Leopard2S, for example.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Peart {{augmented}} his acoustic setup with diverse percussion instruments including orchestra bells, tubular bells, wind chimes, crotales, timbales, timpani, gong, temple blocks, bell tree, triangle, and melodic cowbells. Since the mid-1980s, Peart has replaced {{several of these}} pieces with MIDI trigger pads. This was done in order to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area. Some purely electronic non-instrumental sounds are also used. One classic MIDI pad used is the Malletkat Express which is a two-octave electronic MIDI device that resembles a xylophone or piano. The Malletkat Express is composed of <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> for the [...] "keys" [...] so that any stick can be used. Beginning with 1984's Grace Under Pressure, he used Simmons electronic drums in conjunction with Akai digital samplers. Peart has performed several songs primarily using the electronic portion of his drum kit. (e.g. [...] "Red Sector A", [...] "Closer to the Heart" [...] on A Show of Hands and [...] "Mystic Rhythms" [...] on [...]) Peart's drum solos also feature sections performed primarily on the electronic portion of his kit.|$|E
2500|$|A semi-traditional floor {{would have}} wood battens laid on pads made of neoprene, {{which is more}} durable than <b>rubber.</b> <b>Pads</b> are {{typically}} laid [...] apart and are [...] thick. Then more wood battens are put on top at right angles, halfway between the pads. A traditional floor might have three layers of this springing. Then two layers of plywood are placed on top, offset by 45–90 degrees so that the joints do not match up. The plywood spreads the load. Finally, the actual surface is made from a layer of strong, durable wood like oak, beech or maple, or other types of wood that are covered with a vinyl surface. There may also be provision to prevent the floor from depressing too much if a very heavy weight is placed on it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, batch by batch {{reliability}} of buses could be unpredictable and often required running adjustments. The combination the build quality of early AEC vehicles and the professionalism of the Corporation's garage staff produced in-service mileage figures and engine life that Commercial Motor praised as [...] "exceptionally good". Measures taken included mandatory defect reporting by drivers {{at the end}} of each shift, a preventative maintenance regime which called for inspection/repairs every 10 days (with the spare parts inventory including complete engines) with close monitoring of parts usage, and an overhaul/repaint cycle of every 18 months. In order to improve the system, the Corporation was performing its own modifications to buses as early as 1921, experimenting with a new type of rear shock absorber using <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> on one of its Leylands, and widening the doors of buses during overhaul. Examples of in-house innovation included portable bus electrics testing apparatus in 1932 and the establishment in the 1940s of a soap making plant inside the Laundry at Shrubhill Depot, in response to the need for a soap which didn't damage vehicle paintwork.|$|E

50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> by a blank holder, through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the ram slides down, then the blank holder moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} experimental {{analysis of}} <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> forming, combined {{with part of}} the PhD research into sheet metal stamping with elastic media. For small-scale production, <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> stamping is {{the best choice for}} thin sheet metal parts, compared with traditional stamping methods. The drawback of stamping with elastic media is the relatively large amount of technological wastage, resulting from the need to withstand the forces involved and hold the technological bridges. By finding out the surface dependence of friction between the sheet material, base plate and elastic area, it is possible to precisely calculate the minimum size of the technological bridge. Further research is therefore required in order to enhance the efficiency of <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> stamping technology...|$|R

50|$|In the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> {{forming process}} only a milled lower die is {{required}} {{on which a}} metal plate is placed. Afterwards, {{the shape of the}} lower die is pressed in the plate with the rubber mold. In most cases, the contour, hole patterns and the like will be cut with a 3D laser cutter.The simplicity of the rubber press tool causes tooling costs to be around 85 to 90% lower than those of regular deep drawing while the variable costs are higher. This combination makes <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> pressing very suitable for smaller and medium-sized series (up to 5,000-10,000 pieces per year), even though traditional cutting, lace, welding, finishing etc. is used more due to the unfamiliarity with <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> forming.|$|R
