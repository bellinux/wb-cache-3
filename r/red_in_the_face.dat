500|$|In 2013, Khan {{appeared}} in three films, the first being Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola, a political satire {{set in the}} rustic surroundings of a village in Haryana. Co-starring with Pankaj Kapur, Anushka Sharma and Shabana Azmi, Khan played Hukum Singh Matru, an educated community activist and Kapur's right-hand man. To prepare for the role, he lived in Delhi for three months and learned to speak Haryanvi from theatre group Act One. The film (and his performance) generated mixed reviews from critics, and its eventual box-office profit was poor. Reuters Shilpa Jamkhandikar wrote, [...] "Imran Khan goes <b>red</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> trying to muster up a Haryanvi accent and act tough. You can actually see the effort in his acting and that's why it jars all the more." [...] Subhash K Jha {{described it as a}} good effort, at best. Khan also sang for the film's soundtrack in [...] "Chaar Dina Ki".|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{also became}} {{known for his}} {{explosive}} temper, which was focused particularly on a criminal defense lawyer named Warren A. Taylor who would later go {{on to become the}} Alaska Legislature's first Speaker of the House in the First Alaska State Legislature. [...] "Ted would get <b>red</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> blow up and stalk out of the courtroom," [...] a former court clerk later recalled of Stevens's relationship with Taylor.|$|E
2500|$|This {{game was}} played {{regularly}} between one of the presenters {{and one of the}} Bungalow Heads, in the Bungalow's attic. The game involved a spinning wheel (akin to a roulette wheel) with twelve different chocolates placed on it, each one shaped like the show's logo. Eleven of these chocolates were milk chocolate (therefore [...] "Yum Yum") and the other one was flavoured with strong chili powder (therefore [...] "Yak"). However, the chocolates all looked identical, and therefore neither the presenter nor the Bungalow Head knew which one of the chocolates was flavoured with chili. The presenter and Bungalow Head would take turns spinning the wheel and eating the chocolate which the wheel landed on. If {{this was one of the}} milk chocolates, the person eating it would say [...] "Yum Yum" [...] to denote this and the game would continue. If however, someone consumed the chili chocolate, it would become immediately evident that they had done so as they would often cry out in pain, go <b>red</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and have to have a drink to cool down. The person who consumed the chili chocolate was deemed the loser.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a little}} silence, in which Cluny seemed always {{as if he was}} about to speak, but said nothing. All the time he grew <b>redder</b> and <b>redder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here we are!' exclaimed that gentleman, {{emerging}} {{with his}} pretty companion from the corner; {{as he did}} so, {{it would have been}} hard to tell which was <b>the</b> <b>redder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> he or <b>the</b> young lady with the black eyes.|$|R

6000|$|One thing must be told, however, {{and that}} is, that when Annie told all the {{wonderful}} story of the post-office order and the Chinese pig, Bessie grew <b>redder</b> and <b>redder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and Susan squeezed both her hands tight together, and said [...] "May I tell, Bessie!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then my ears did not deceive me, and it's not wa-a-x work,' {{said his}} lordship. 'How de do? I'm very happy.' And then his lordship turned to another superlative gentleman, {{something}} older, something stouter, something <b>redder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and something longer upon town, {{and said in}} a loud whisper that the girl was 'deyvlish pitty.' ...|$|R

60|$|Columbine {{stepped forward}} to comply, when Belllounds, leaping down from the wheel, pushed her hack with masterful hand. Opposition to him was like waving a <b>red</b> flag <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a bull. Columbine recoiled from his look as well as touch.|$|R
60|$|He {{tapped his}} folded leg below the knee, and was surprised, flattered, by the {{lighting}} up of her face, which stooped towards him eagerly and remained expectant, the lips girlishly parted, <b>red</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pale <b>face,</b> and quivering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quickened drawing of her breath.|$|R

60|$|Tess {{could hear}} the {{occupants}} of the cottage--gathered together after their day's labour--talking to each other within, and the rattle of their supper-plates was also audible. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village-street she had seen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of one feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print gown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively {{thought it might be}} Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom, surely enough it was she. Marian was even stouter and <b>redder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any previous period of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew <b>the</b> acquaintance <b>in</b> such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded readily to Marian's greeting.|$|R
60|$|Her little {{head with}} its deep blue eyes, eyes of {{tenderness}} and anger under the black arch of fine eyebrows was very still. The mouth looked very <b>red</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white <b>face</b> peeping {{from under the}} veil, the little pointed chin had in its form something aggressive. Slight and even angular in her modest black dress she was an appealing and--yes--she was a desirable little figure.|$|R
60|$|Listening to Wagner, during such {{temporary}} Philistinic mood, {{my sense}} of fair play is outraged. A lone, lorn woman stands upon the stage trying to make herself heard. She has to {{do this sort of}} thing for her living; maybe an invalid mother, younger brothers and sisters are dependent upon her. One hundred and forty men, all armed with powerful instruments, well-organised, and most of them looking well- fed, combine to make it impossible for a single note of that poor woman's voice to be heard above their din. I see her standing there, opening and shutting her mouth, getting <b>redder</b> and <b>redder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> She is singing, one feels sure of it; one could hear her if only those one hundred and forty men would ease up for a minute. She makes one mighty, supreme effort; above the banging of the drums, the blare of the trumpets, the shrieking of the strings, that last despairing note is distinctly heard.|$|R

50|$|This {{dragonfly}} is 24 to 34 millimeters long, with a hindwing 25 to 30 millimeters long. It can {{be identified}} by the brown spots at the bases and tips of the wings. The pterostigma is yellow in younger individuals, and <b>red</b> <b>in</b> older. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> is yellow, turning <b>red</b> <b>in</b> older male specimens. The thorax is yellow-brown with a large dark stripe and several smaller brown stripes. The abdomen is dark with paler markings.|$|R
50|$|Drinking enough {{alcohol to}} cause a blood alcohol {{concentration}} (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes a flushed, <b>red</b> appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} gate comprises two concrete posts and a lintel with Chinese characters on it.

500|$|Drinking {{enough to}} cause a blood alcohol {{concentration}} (BAC) of 0.03–0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria (a [...] "happy" [...] feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, <b>red</b> appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. With all alcoholic beverages, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery {{increases the risk of}} an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.|$|R
40|$|Foragers {{that feed}} on hidden prey are {{uncertain}} about the intake rate they can achieve {{as they enter}} a patch. However, foraging success can inform them, especially if they have prior knowledge about the patch quality distribution in their environment. We experimentally tested whether and how red knots (Calidris canutus) use such information and whether their patch-leaving decisions maximized their long-term net energy intake rate. The {{results suggest that the}} birds combined patch sample information with prior knowledge by making use of the potential value assessment rule. We reject five alternative leaving rules. The potential encounter rate that the birds choose as their critical departure threshold maximized their foraging gain ratio (a modified form of efficiency) while foraging. The high experimental intake rates were constrained by rate of digestion. Under such conditions, maximization of the foraging gain ratio during foraging maximizes net intake rate during total time (foraging time plus digestive breaks). We conclude that molluscivore <b>red</b> knots, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a digestive constraint, are able to combine prior environmental knowledge about patch quality with patch sample information to obtain the highest possible net intake over total time...|$|R
40|$|From the {{nutritional}} standpoint, {{several aspects of}} the biochemistry and physiology of iron are unique. In stark contrast to most other elements, most of <b>the</b> iron <b>in</b> mammals is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood attached to red blood cell hemoglobin and transporting oxygen to cells for oxidative phosphorylation and other purposes. Controlled and uncontrolled blood loss thus has {{a major impact on}} iron availability. Also, in contrast to most other nutrients, iron is poorly absorbed and poorly excreted. Moreover, amounts absorbed (~ 1 mg/day in adults) are much less than the total iron (~ 20 mg/day) cycling into and out of hemoglobin, involving bone marrow erythropoiesis and reticuloendothelial cell degradation of aged <b>red</b> cells. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of uncertainties <b>in</b> iron bioavailability, <b>the</b> mammalian organism has evolved a complex system to retain and store iron not immediately in use, and to make that iron available when and where it is needed. Iron is stored innocuously <b>in</b> <b>the</b> large hollow protein, ferritin, particularly <b>in</b> cells of <b>the</b> liver, spleen and bone marrow. Our current understanding of the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms by which this stored iron in ferritin is mobilized and distributed—within the cell or to other organs—is the subject of this review...|$|R
