40|$|Soil {{phosphates}} exchange oxygen atoms rapidly with {{soil water}} once recycled by intracellular enzymes, thereby approaching an equilibrium δ 18 OP signature {{that depends on}} ambient temperature and the δ 18 OW signature of soil water. We hypothesized that in the topsoil, phosphates reach this equilibrium δ 18 OP signature even if amended by different fertilizers. In the subsoil, however, there might be phosphates with a smaller δ 18 OP value than that <b>represented</b> by <b>the</b> isotopic <b>equilibrium</b> <b>value,</b> a condition that could exist {{in the case of}} limited biological P cycling only. We tested these hypotheses for the HCl-extractable P pool of the Hedley fractionation scheme of arable soil in Germany, which integrates over extended time-scales of the soil P cycle. We sampled several types of fertilizer, the surface soil that received these fertilizer types and composites from a Haplic Luvisol depth profile under long-term agricultural practice. Organic fertilizers had significantly smaller δ 18 OP values than mineral fertilizers. Intriguingly, the fields fertilized organically also tended to have smaller δ 18 OP signatures than other types of surface soil, which calls into question full isotopic equilibrium at all sites. At depths below 50 cm, the soil δ 18 OP values were even depleted relative to the values calculated for isotopic equilibrium. This implies that HCl-extractable phosphates in different soil horizons are of different origins. In addition, it supports the assumption that biological cycling of P by intracellular microbial enzymes might have been relatively inefficient in the deeper subsoil. At depths of 50 – 80 cm, there was a transition zone of declining δ 18 OP values, which might be regarded as the first evidence that the degree of biological P cycling changed at this depth interva...|$|R

Following MacDonald (1997), the approach to the long-run relationship between the real effective exchange rate of the peseta and its fundamental determinants focus on the reasons that keep the actual value of the peseta away from that predicted by the theory of PPP. The cointegration method is used to estimate the reduced form of a multilateral model for Spain for the period 1977 - 97.
