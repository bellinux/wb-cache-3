5|$|Ernst Mayr {{recognised}} the key {{importance of}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> for speciation in his Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942).|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation,</b> a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation,</b> leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since {{even a small}} amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> to evolve.|$|E

40|$|The {{golden lion tamarin}} Leontopithecus rosalia rosalia, one of {{the rarest}} and most {{endangered}} of New World primates, {{has been the focus}} of an intensive research and conservation effort for two decades. During that period, managed breeding from 44 founders has brought the captive population to over 400 individuals, a number that equals or exceeds the estimated number of free-ranging golden lion tamarins. The extent of genetic variation among golden lion tamarins was estimated with an electrophoretic survey of 47 allozyme loci from 67 captive and 73 free-ranging individuals. The amount of variation was low, compared to 15 other primate species, with 4 % of the loci being polymorphic (P), and with an average heterozygosity H estimate of 0. 01 in these callitrichids. Electrophoretic analyses of captive and free-ranging animals (N = 31) of two allopatric morphotypes, Leontopithecus rosalia chrysopygus and L. r. chrysomelas, were similar to the L. r. rosalia findings insofar as they also revealed limited genetic polymorphism. Computation of the Neigenetic distance measurements showed that the three morphotypes were genetically very similar, although discernible differentiation had occurred at two loci. These data are consistent with the occurrence of recent <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolations</b> of these subspecies...|$|R

5|$|These {{characteristics}} are genetically inherited {{and has been}} interpreted as {{the early stages of}} the speciation process. The two ecotypes will eventually become separate species once <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> is achieved. At the moment, both ecotypes are still capable of interbreeding and producing viable offspring, as such they are still considered a single species.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{has been}} {{observed}} multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. In sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> followed by genealogical divergence. There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is allopatric speciation, which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms. As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated {{from the rest of}} their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The time {{evolution}} of the influenza A virus is linked to a nonfixed landscape driven by interactions between hosts and competing influenza strains. Herd-immunity, cross-immunity, and age-structure are among the factors that {{have been shown to}} support strain coexistence and/or disease oscillations. In this study, we put two influenza strains under various levels of (interference) competition. We establish that cross-immunity and host isolation lead to periodic epidemic outbreaks (sustained oscillations) in this multistrain system. We compute the <b>isolation</b> <b>reproductive</b> number for each strain (i) independently, {{as well as for the}} full system (q), and show that when q < 1, both strains die out. Subthreshold coexistence driven by cross-immunity is possible even when the <b>isolation</b> <b>reproductive</b> number of one strain is below 1. Conditions that guarantee a winning type or coexistence are established in general. Oscillatory coexistence is established via Hopf bifurcation theory and confirmed via numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in plants, {{unlike that}} of animals, requires the action of multicellular haploid gametophytes. The male gametophyte (pollen tube) is guided to a female gametophyte through diploid sporophytic cells in the pistil. While interactions between the pollen tube and diploid cells have been described, {{little is known about}} the intercellular recognition systems between the pollen tube and the female gametophyte. In particular, the mechanisms that enable only one pollen tube to interact with each female gametophyte, thereby preventing polysperm, are not understood. We isolated female gametophyte mutants named magatama (maa) from Arabidopsis thaliana by screening for siliques containing half the normal number of mature seeds. In maa 1 and maa 3 mutants, in which the development of the female gametophyte was delayed, pollen tube guidance was affected. Pollen tubes were directed to mutant female gametophytes, but they lost their way just before entering the micropyle and elongated in random directions. Moreover, the mutant female gametophytes attracted two pollen tubes at a high frequency. To explain the interaction between gametophytes, we propose a monogamy model in which a female gametophyte emits two attractants and prevents polyspermy. This prevention process by the female gametophyte could increase a plant's inclusive fitness by facilitating the fertilization of sibling female gametophytes. In addition, repulsion between pollen tubes might help prevent polyspermy. The <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolations</b> observed in interspecific crosses in Brassicaceae are also consistent with the monogamy model...|$|R
40|$|Reticulitermes santonensis is a {{subterranean}} termite that invades {{urban areas}} in France and elsewhere where it causes damage to human-built structures. We investigated the breeding system, colony and population genetic structure, and mode of dispersal of two French populations of R. santonensis. Termite workers were sampled from 43 and 31 collection points, respectively, from a natural population in west-central France (in {{and around the}} island of Oleron) and an urban population (Paris). Ten to 20 workers per collection point were genotyped at nine variable microsatellite loci to determine colony identity and to infer colony breeding structure. There was a total of 26 colonies, {{some of which were}} spatially expansive, extending up to 320 linear metres. Altogether, the analysis of genotype distribution, F-statistics and relatedness coefficients suggested that all colonies were extended families headed by numerous neotenics (nonwinged precocious reproductives) probably descended from pairs of primary (winged) <b>reproductives.</b> <b>Isolation</b> by distance among collection points within two large colonies from both populations suggested spatially separated reproductive centres with restricted movement of workers and neotenics. There was a moderate level of genetic differentiation (F(ST) = 0. 10) between the Oleron and Paris populations, and the number of alleles was significantly higher in Oleron than in Paris, as expected if the Paris population went through bottlenecks when it was introduced from western France. We hypothesize that the diverse and flexible breeding systems found in subterranean termites pre-adapt them to invade new or marginal habitats. Considering that R. santonensis may be an introduced population of the North American species R. flavipes, a breeding system consisting primarily of extended family colonies containing many neotenic reproductives may facilitate human-mediated spread and establishment of R. santonensis in urban areas with harsh climates...|$|R
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation.</b> Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation,</b> which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E
5|$|Nunn and Zino {{estimated}} that the two Macaronesian species diverged {{at the end of}} the Early Pleistocene, 850,000 years ago. An analysis of feather lice taken from Fea's petrels, Pterodroma feae deserti, from Bugio Island, and from Zino's petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated, since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. The species on Zino's petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda petrel, whereas Fea's petrel's lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific Pterodroma species. This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the Desertas Islands. Although their <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation</b> has allowed the separate evolutionary development of the two species, genetic evidence shows the three Macaronesian petrels are each other's closest relatives.|$|E

Repeated administration of operant conditioning sessions for 4 weeks following the ablation resulted in a partial recovery of the operant rate but not of <b>reproductive</b> behavior. Social <b>isolation,</b> which increases reactivity in Macropodus, had no {{significant effect on the}} operant rate in sham-operated or lesioned males.

40|$|We {{compared}} and contrasted {{the physical}} structure of male "courtship" calls of 59 subterranean mole rats {{belonging to the}} Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies in Israel, comprising 11 populations of four chromosomal species (2 N = 52, 54, 58, and 60). We also conducted behavioral auditory discrimination tests of 144 females of the four species in the laboratory. The results indicate that each chromosomal species has a vocal dialect significantly different from all others, although the call of 2 N = 60, the last derivative of speciation, is not yet fully differentiated. Females of 2 N = 52, 54, and 58 preferred their homospecific mates' calls, whereas females of 2 N = 60 did not. We conclude that call differentiation builds up gradually and provides an efficient ethological <b>reproductive</b> premating <b>isolation</b> mechanism between the emerging species in the active speciation of mole rats in Israel...|$|R
40|$|A {{deterministic}} model {{for assessing the}} dynamics of mixed species malaria infections in a human population is presented to investigate the effects of dual infection with Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium falciparum. Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity and boundedness is performed. In addition to the disease free equilibrium, we show that there exists a boundary equilibrium corresponding to each species. The <b>isolation</b> <b>reproductive</b> number of each species is computed {{as well as the}} reproductive number of the full model. Conditions for global stability of the disease free equilibrium as well as local stability of the boundary equilibria are derived. The model has an interior equilibrium which exists if {{at least one of the}} <b>isolation</b> <b>reproductive</b> numbers is greater than unity. Among the interesting dynamical behaviours of the model, the phenomenon of backward bifurcation where a stable boundary equilibrium coexists with a stable interior equilibrium, for a certain range of the associated invasion reproductive number less than unity is observed. Results from analysis of the model show that, when cross-immunity between the two species is weak, there is a high probability of coexistence of the two species and when cross-immunity is strong, competitive exclusion is high. Further, an increase in the reproductive number of species i increases the stability of its boundary equilibrium and its ability to invade an equilibrium of species j. Numerical simulations support our analytical conclusions and illustrate possible behaviour scenarios of the model. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. Articl...|$|R
5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation,</b> as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation.</b> Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
5|$|The third mode is parapatric {{speciation}}. This {{is similar}} to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in {{that there is no}} physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations. Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines. Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete <b>reproductive</b> <b>isolation.</b> Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement, which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.|$|E
40|$|Study of {{molecular}} mechanisms in reproduction {{is essential for}} the understanding of this outstanding process. Our lab studies proteins secreted by reproductive organs and sperm using various biochemical methods for a long time. We have expertise in protein extraction from spermatic cells using different approaches, and by kits for proteins from the sperm surface and distinct subcellular compartments. The proteins of reproductive organ fluids are separated by chromatographic methods, such as size exclusion chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography with reverse phase (RP-HPLC) and affinity chromatography on matrices with various ligands. Proteins are subjected to SDS- or 2 D-electrophoresis for their characterization and comparison of various extraction methods, different mammalian species, and sperm in different functional development. Electrophoretically separated proteins may be transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Western blot) for antibody detection or binding studies with lectin-labelled ligands (lectins, polysaccharides, zona pellucida glycoproteins). We use immunoprecipitation method with specific antibody for protein determination followed by the MALDI identification. Proteins are localized by immunofluorescent techniques on/in spermatic cells and tissue sections of <b>reproductive</b> organs. <b>Isolation</b> of proteins from reproductive tissues and fluids, and the antibody detection is crucial for the studying of reproductive protein origin...|$|R

The {{present study was}} designed to investigate the unsaturated fatty acids of Pteleopsis suberosa stem bark extract (PTSSBE), evaluate its antioxidant properties and examine its biochemical targets on sub-acute mercury-induced testicular dysfunctions. Rats were divided into five groups of 10 animals each. Group I was given distilled water; group II, III, IV and V was orally administered with mercury at a dose of 3. 75  mg/kg body weight. Group III, IV and V were co-treated with PTSSBE of 25, 50 and 100  mg/kg body weight respectively, for 10  days. Rats exposed to mercury significantly decreased the activities of catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the level of reduced glutathione (GSH), while the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased. There was also a marked significant decrease (p <  0. 05) in testicular activities of Δ 5 - 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and Δ 5 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Moreover, the activities of prostatic acid phosphatase, total acid phosphatase and prostatic alkaline phosphatase, were significantly (p <  0. 05) elevated in mercury treated rats. These effects were prevented by co-treatment with PTSSBE in mercury-induced testicular toxicity in rats. Aphrosidiac effects of Pteleopsis suberosa, may find clinical application in <b>reproductive</b> abnormalities. <b>Isolation</b> and translation of individual active ingredient would help to find new drugs to cure and/or prevent male infertility among mercury exposed workers...|$|R
40|$|There is longstanding {{debate in}} {{population}} policy {{about the relationship}} between modern contraception and abortion. Although theory predicts that they should be substitutes, the existing body of empirical evidence is difficult to interpret. What is required is a large 2 ̆ 010 scale intervention that alters the supply (or full price) of one or the other 2 ̆ 013 and importantly, does so in <b>isolation</b> (<b>reproductive</b> health programs often bundle primary health care and family planning 2 ̆ 013 and in some instances, abortion services). In this paper, we study Nepal's 2004 legalization of abortion provision and subsequent expansion of abortion services, an unusual and rapidly 2 ̆ 010 implemented policy meeting these requirements. Using four waves of rich individual 2 ̆ 010 level data representative of fertile 2 ̆ 010 age Nepalese women, we find robust evidence of substitution between modern contraception and abortion. This finding has important implications for public policy and foreign aid, suggesting that an effective strategy for reducing expensive and potentially unsafe abortions may be to expand the supply of modern contraceptives...|$|R
25|$|Adaptation {{is one of}} the {{two main}} {{processes}} that explain the observed diversity of species, such as the different species of Darwin's finches.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this report}} a novel class of mutants that should facilitate the identification of genes required for progression through the mitotic cell cycle during seed development in angiosperms. Three non-allelic titan (ttn) mutants with related but distinct phenotypes are charac-terized. The common feature among these mutants is that endosperm nuclei become greatly enlarged and highly polyploid. The mutant embryo is composed of a few giant cells in ttn 1, several small cells in ttn 2, and produces a normal plant in ttn 3. Condensed chromosomes arrested at prophase of mitosis {{are found in the}} free nuclear endosperm of ttn 1 and ttn 2 seeds. Large mitotic figures with excessive numbers of chromosomes are visible in ttn 3 endosperm. The ttn 1 mutation appears to disrupt cytoskeletal organization because endosperm nuclei fail to migrate to the chalazal end of the seed. How double fertilization leads to the establishment of distinct patterns of mitosis and cytokinesis in the embryo and endosperm is a central question in plant <b>reproductive</b> biology. Molecular <b>isolation</b> of TITAN genes should help to answer this question, as well as related issues concerning cell cycle regulation, chromosome movement and endosperm identity in angiosperms...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} genetic selection for temperament on the way that stressors affect the behaviour and the adrenal and reproductive axes of sheep. We tested three hypotheses: (i) isolation would increase cortisol secretion and decrease luteinising hormone (LH) secretion more in nervous sheep than in calm sheep; (ii) isolation combined with simulated human presence would increase cortisol secretion and decrease LH secretion more in nervous sheep than in calm sheep and (iii) isolation combined with stressors that were not specific to the selection process (i. e. non-selection stressors) would increase cortisol secretion and decrease LH secretion equally in calm and nervous sheep. Isolation alone increased cortisol secretion and decreased LH secretion in nervous sheep but not in calm sheep. Compared to calm sheep, nervous sheep were more agitated during the first 2 h of isolation but not during the second 2 h of isolation. Exposure to non-selection stressors increased cortisol secretion, decreased LH pulse amplitude and the mean plasma concentrations of LH in both calm and nervous sheep. We conclude that genetic selection for temperament affects the behavioural expression of the stress response and the secretion of adrenal and <b>reproductive</b> hormones during <b>isolation,</b> but has less impact on their reactivity to non-selection stressors...|$|R
40|$|High {{pollinator}} specificity and {{the potential}} for simple genetic changes to affect pollinator attraction make sexually deceptive orchids an ideal system for the study of ecological speciation, in which change of flower odour is likely important. This study surveys reproductive barriers and differences in floral phenotypes in a group of four closely related, coflowering sympatric Ophrys species and uses a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach to obtain information on the proportion of the genome that is differentiated between species. Ophrys species were found to effectively lack postpollination barriers, but are strongly isolated by their different pollinators (floral isolation) and, to a smaller extent, by shifts in flowering time (temporal isolation). Although flower morphology and perhaps labellum coloration may contribute to floral <b>isolation,</b> <b>reproductive</b> barriers may largely be due to differences in flower odour chemistry. GBS revealed shared polymorphism throughout the Ophrys genome, with very little population structure between species. Genome scans for FST outliers identified few markers that are highly differentiated between species and repeatable in several populations. These genome scans also revealed highly differentiated polymorphisms in genes with putative involvement in floral odour production, including a previously identified candidate gene thought {{to be involved in the}} biosynthesis of pseudo-pheromones by the orchid flowers. Taken together, these data suggest that ecological speciation associated with different pollinators in sexually deceptive orchids has a genic rather than a genomic basis, placing these species at an early phase of genomic divergence within the ‘speciation continuum’...|$|R

It is furthermore difficult to see how koinophilia might apply to plants, and certain marine creatures that discharge their gametes into the environment to meet up and fuse, it seems, entirely randomly (within conspecific confines). However, when pollen from several compatible donors is used to pollinate stigmata, the donors typically do not sire equal numbers of seeds. Marshall and Diggle state that the existence of some kind of non-random seed paternity is, in fact, not in question in flowering plants. It is how this occurs that remains unknown. Pollen choice is one of the possibilities, taking into account that 50% of the pollen grain’s haploid genome is expressed during its tube’s growth towards the ovule.|$|E
40|$|The floral heads (infructescences) of South African Protea L. {{represent}} {{a most unusual}} niche for fungi of the economically important genus Ophiostoma Syd. and P. Syd. emend. Z. W. de Beer et al. Current consensus holds that most members of Ophiostoma are vectored by tree-infesting bark beetles. However, it has recently been suggested that mites, phoretic on these bark beetles, may {{play a central role}} in the dispersal of Ophiostoma. No bark beetles are known from Protea. Therefore, identifying the vectors of Ophiostoma in Protea infructescences would independently evaluate the role of various arthropods in the dispersal of Ophiostoma. Infructescence-colonizing arthropods were tested for the presence of Ophiostoma DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for <b>reproductive</b> propagules by <b>isolation</b> on agar plates. PCR tests revealed that few insects carried Ophiostoma DNA. In contrast, various mites (Proctolaelaps vandenbergi Ryke, two species of Tarsonemus Canestrini and Fonzago, and one Trichouropoda Berlese species) frequently carried Ophiostoma propagules. DNA sequence comparisons for 28 S ribosomal DNA confirmed the presence of O. splendens G. J. Marais and M. J. Wingf., O. palmiculminatum Roets et al., and O. phasma Roets et al. on these mites. Two apparently undescribed species of Ophiostoma were also identified. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed specialized structures in Trichouropoda and one Tarsonemus sp. that frequently contained Ophiostoma spores. The Trichouropoda sp. was able to complete its life cycle on a diet consisting solely of its identified phoretic Ophiostoma spp. This study provides compelling evidence that mites are the primary vectors of infructescence-associated Ophiostoma spp. in South Africa...|$|R
50|$|The {{patterns}} of autoinfection highlight mother-son mating and the sex ratio. Female biased broods are favored, involving mother-son matings and accessibility to haplodiploids. Colonization {{is accomplished by}} immature stages and female bias is favored at low colonization densities by the fact that, unlike isolated males, isolated females are not lost to the gene pool because they can mate with their parthenogenetically produced sons. In the M. Adamson and D. Ludwig model, colonization was found to occur before mating and male progeny have no fitness unless they colonize a host that contains a female. The ability of a female to produce songs with which to mate is potentially central to the colonization process. This conclusion was specifically called to attention through the case of G. batrachiensis. Using, in pinworms, mother-son matings {{are not expected to}} occur commonly in this life cycle since a female's progeny must leave the host. However, in G. batrachiensis, a second mode of reproduction has developed that makes mother-son matings possible: the method by which females produce two types of eggs, thin and thick shelled, as explored in detail in the earlier sections of this article. Once again, thin-shelled eggs contain well developed larvae that hatch at deposition and develop in the same host as the mother; thick shelled eggs are deposited in the two to four stage of cleavage and must pass to the external environment before they are infective. The colonizing period in G. batrachiensis lasts about three months. During a three year study, the number of adult worms in hosts in late fall varied between 3 and 12. If colonization is assumed to be a random process, then the mean interval between colonizations varied between 9 and 35 days with a mean of 17, which corresponds to the period a female requires to reach reproductive age. Hence, early colonists may often reach <b>reproductive</b> maturity in <b>isolation</b> from others of the opposite sex even though, {{by the end of the}} colonization period, hosts typically contain a dozen worms. Males mature about twice as fast as females, and this lessens the delay in reproduction associated with mating with a son. Brood sex ratio is skewed in G. batrachiensis. In a sample of 234 females, 205 of 296 embryos in thick-shelled eggs were diploid and would develop as females.|$|R
40|$|Reproductive tract {{diseases}} of dairy cows are common world-wide {{and results in}} a decrease in reproductive performance. The research presented in this thesis evaluates the available diagnostic methods for reproductive tract diseases, including the quality of published reports describing these methods in dairy cows. To improve the accuracy of cow-side diagnostic tests for reproductive tract diseases more research is needed, specifically to establish optimal cut-points, timing of examination and test variability (i. e. intra- and interobserver agreement). Moreover, future manuscripts reporting on diagnostic methods for reproductive tract diseases could be improved by using checklists for quality of design and reporting as a guideline. Research was also done to assess the presence of intrauterine bacteria in early postpartum New Zealand dairy cows and their association with the subsequent reproductive tract infection, inflammation and <b>reproductive</b> performance. The <b>isolation</b> of intrauterine bacteria, irrespective of type, at 23 days postpartum {{was associated with a}} decrease in pregnancy within three weeks {{for the start of the}} seasonal breeding programme (planned start of mating; PSM; P = 0. 05). Escherichia coli isolated at 23 days postpartum tended to increase the time to pregnancy (P = 0. 09). However, the presence of E. coli within the first week postpartum was not significantly associated with isolation of Trueperella pyogenes three weeks later (P = 0. 53). An interesting finding was the positive association between the elevated recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells in the early postpartum period and a decreased time to pregnancy (P = 0. 05). Susceptibility data, based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), was generated for a range of antimicrobials against E. coli and T. pyogenes from intrauterine origin. Between-herd and between age-group differences in MIC were detected (P = 0. 05). Cows diagnosed with intrauterine E. coli with an MIC of = 8 µg/mL at 23 days postpartum tended to be at lower risk of pregnancy within six weeks of PSM relative to an MIC of < 8 µg/mL (P = 0. 09). No interpretative criteria are available for MIC data of antimicrobials against uterine isolates. Hence, more research is required on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles for veterinary antimicrobials. This thesis describes the first isolation of apparent antibodies to bovine herpesvirus type 4 and the DNA of bovine lymphotropic herpesvirus in New Zealand dairy cattle, both of which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of reproductive tract diseases. Further studies are required to investigate the true impact of these viruses. The research presented in this thesis provided data useful for further improvement of diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract diseases in dairy cows...|$|R
