40|$|Many {{parts of}} the world {{endeavor}} to extend access to more individuals and institutions by means of the electronic messaging system in the ever-evolving Internet. While that messaging system is continuing to incorporate more and more features such as multimedia information, technical barriers in many {{parts of the}} world or uncontrolled behaviours of originators hinder such expansion. It is the lack of user-requirement based policies in the messaging system that increases the constraints to such environments. At the same time the need to integrate and coordinate other messaging systems such as fax, paging, postal mail etc. with the Internet messaging system still exists. On the other hand whether constrained or not, users wish to administer their <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> in particular manners such as blocking unwanted messages, using alternate message delivery media, using strategic message delivery methods especially for lengthy messages, etc., which in turn leads to a formation of requirement-based policies of the messaging system. Currently there are standards governmg message handling, in particular MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), for exchanging mail messages encompassing a multitude of media, such as graphics images, voice, data and full motion video apart from plain text. However, the MIME standard presupposes certain minimum technical capabilities amongst interconnected and participating mail servers and nodes for distribution of such multimedia mail. In particular, the interconnecting channels between mail servers should be of sufficient bandwidth to conduct the large amount of data in MIME messages at 'reasonable' rates and also the nodes must have adequate storage capacity for the same. This requirement (or bandwidth of channels and storage of mail servers for MIME capability prevents users connected to 'under-privileged' mail nodes from enjoying the benefits brought about by multimedia information and messaging. This may be in spite of the end users owning or having access to resource rich machines. On the other hand, with the introduction of MIME capabilities, users are faced with the essential requirement of administration at the server side owing to the fact that the availability of many media types would impose increased abuses, intended or accidental, especially in the face of new inventions of media types. As a strategic solution to this phenomenon, the concept of an adaptive, service-oriented mail server employing a smart approach to routing of multimedia messages in an inter network of mail servers, disparate in storage capacity, performance, network bandwidth and administration, is presented. This concept, described as Hierarchical Actions Transfer (HAT) concept, involves offsetting the bandwidth and capacity limitations or "desires" of a node at a specific level by requesting a mail node a step higher up to oblige to perform services on its behalf (which the former node is incapable of performing or not willing to, due to capacity or bandwidth limitations or self imposed restrictions). The service requests that are in line with the Requirement-Based Policies are known to the server through a specific configuration mechanism. When delivering messages, the server will first look at the configuration of each connected node and then the message delivery will take place accordingly. It would be inevitably a service-oriented strategy to relieve nodes in constrained environments. An added advantage of the approach is that it implements administrative policies for controlling traffic and congestion arising from MIME mail to a mail server site and the level of MIME services made available to users connected to that site. Further, the technique also integrates conventional and primitive messaging mechanisms, such as postal mail, courier by diskettes/tapes, facsimile and paging, into the realm of electronic messaging. It could be further enhanced by the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence if it could identify patterns of frequent node requests. However, current implementation that uses "send-mail" as the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) focuses only on the manual and semiautomatic configuration of such services...|$|E
40|$|Content-based publish/subscribe (or simply content-based) {{networking}} is {{a relatively}} new communication paradigm compared to IP networking, with a different approach to addressing network hosts. In content- based networking addressing as well as information dissemination center around information and interests. A host's address is represented by its interest and information is routed by a network of brokers to hosts with relevant interests. We advocate the idea that content-based networking should be implemented and offered as a basic network service and be accessible everywhere and to all applications. Best-effort content-based systems which substantiate this idea are high-throughput low-delay publish/subscribe systems in which messages are treated as datagrams without end-to-end or in-network acknowledgments and flow control. In such systems, publishers (senders) do not avoid or even detect congestion, and brokers respond to congestion by simply dropping overflowing messages. These systems are therefore unable to provide reliable message delivery and fair resource allocation and to properly handle traffic anomalies, which may degrade the overall quality of service. Furthermore, extensive usage of concurrent matching and routing algorithms in broker software causes frequent message reordering in the brokers and ultimately out- of-order delivery of messages to clients. These shortcomings of best- effort content-based systems impede their deployment for many applications and environments. For instance, the lack of congestion control hinders the deployment of such systems in the open Internet, where congestion-unaware flows are considered a major threat to the stability of the network. With this motivation, we propose an end-to-end "transport protocol" that improves three key properties of best-effort content-based systems namely, message ordering, reliability, and congestion control. These essential requirements have been previously addressed at the protocol and broker-level, at the cost of much higher complexity and lower messaging efficiency. On the contrary, our guiding principle in designing this transport protocol is to view the underlying best-effort publish/subscribe network as a black box and only assume that it provides a general publish/subscribe API. This design principle has multiple advantages. First, the transport protocol works with virtually every best-effort content-based system, for it makes no assumptions about the underlying network. Second, individual clients can optionally take advantage of this transport protocol for better quality of service while those with relaxed requirements can opt out and avoid unnecessary overheads. More importantly, the end-to-end protocol has a minimum impact on the favorable performance and inherent simplicity of the best-effort network since it does not require the involvement of the broker network. Our methodology in developing this transport protocol, on the one hand, is based on understanding the body of related research on end-to-end solutions for FIFO ordering, reliability and congestion control, and on the other hand, dealing with challenges in adopting them for our purpose. This requires understanding the key distinguishing characteristics of traffic in content-based networks, and their practical implications on the design of the transport protocol. In particular, message loss detection is a canonical issue which we discuss in detail in the thesis. Our transport protocol is comprised of three separate components for FIFO ordering, reliability, and congestion control, where the FIFO ordering protocol is prerequisite for the other two. Our FIFO ordering protocol, which is also responsible for loss detection, is probabilistic in that it does not guarantee deterministic FIFO ordering on all messages but it eliminates a vast majority of out-of-order deliveries. This compromise in the precision of message ordering is to minimize its overhead on the network. The reliability and congestion control protocols are inspired by existing proposals for IP multicast. We will detail the challenges in adopting these protocols for our purpose and propose methods and enhancements for their application in our target context. In brief, the reliability component of our protocol is based on a technique, similar to reliable multicast, that takes advantage of collaborative caching and <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> by the clients through a request/repair process. The proposed congestion-control protocol is also inspired by an existing rate-control scheme for IP multicast. This protocol uses an equation-based flow-control algorithm that reacts to congestion {{in a manner similar to}} and compatible with TCP. For the purposes of fairness and efficiency, this protocol is also content- aware, meaning that it modulates specific content-based traffic flows along a congested path. We have a complete implementation of the proposed transport protocol. Experimental results with a best-effort content-based system and our transport protocol reveal that the protocol improves message ordering and reliable delivery by up to 95 %. Also, congestion control protocol eliminates a large number of messages losses and provides considerably better resource sharing among concurrent content-based and TCP flows. Most importantly, our results show that these improvements come with a minimum compromise in the throughput and end-to-end delay of the messaging service. In summary, the experimental results are encouraging and confirm our fundamental hypothesis that the basic service provided by best-effort content-based networks can be significantly improved in terms of key quality measures, using an end-to-end transport protocol...|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of real-time and highly accurate information in large-scale distributed systems is technically difficult and approximations imply uncertainty. In economic science, however, reliable information about markets, its specifications, {{and the behavior}} of its participants is essential for sophisticated and efficient negotiation strategies. There {{is the need for}} a system that provides and allows consulting an overall knowledge of economic information in distributed markets, while managing the accuracy of information for the user. This paper evaluates the influences of uncertainties for information retrieval within distributed Grid markets. It proposes an uncertainty management component for a Decentralized Market Information System (DMIS), which regulates the accuracy of information and the number <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> for the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> economic data from a scalable market. First, we analyze the properties and the completeness of information in Grid markets. Therefore, we simulate Grid market specific scenarios under complete and incomplete information provision by varying the information accessibility. The results confirm the influence of the accuracy on the stability of the market. Based on these results, an optimization mechanism, which uses approximations is introduced for the <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> information. The approximations are controlled by the uncertainty management to find a trade-off between the amount <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> and the accuracy of information.

40|$|Abstract — Users of {{computer}} systems may often require the private transfer of messages/communications between parties across a network. However, unwanted interception/sniffing of such communications {{is also a}} possibility. An elementary stealthy transfer scheme is therefore proposed by the author. This scheme makes use of encoding, splitting <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> {{and the use of}} a hashing algorithm to verify the correctness <b>of</b> the reconstructed <b>message.</b> For this proof-of-concept purpose, the authors have experimented with the random sending of encoded parts <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> and the construction thereof to demonstrate how data can stealthily be transferred across a network so as to prevent the obvious <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> data...|$|R
