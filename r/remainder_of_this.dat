5|$|In {{the last}} arc, Air, Yukito's final wish to save Misuzu's life is heard. The {{timeline}} of the Dream arc has been reset, {{although it is}} now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.|$|E

30|$|The <b>remainders</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper {{have been}} {{constructed}} as follows. Firstly, it discusses the experimental work that was carried to extract the data set. The next step is presented in which modeling of the polymer solution viscosity was carried out along with a complete explanation of the procedure. Presented next are the prediction accuracies of the models which were then evaluated using several statistical indices, such as the coefficient of determination (R 2) and {{root mean square error}} (RMSE). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the matter of RSM was employed to check any significant lack of fit. In the next step, extrapolation capabilities of both developed models, RSM and ANFIS models, were evaluated for unseen data. After performance evaluation of the developed models, the paper ended up with the main conclusions.|$|R
