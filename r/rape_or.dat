5|$|As {{a result}} of Hodgson's appeal, Operation Iceberg {{was created by the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) with the aim of using DNA {{evidence}} in pre-1990 <b>rape</b> <b>or</b> murder cases. This led to the review of 240 other convictions. The CCRC also requested that the Crown Prosecution Service identify and review similar murder cases from the time before DNA testing was available. In September 2009, on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body, police named David Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder, had confessed to police in 1983 that he had raped and killed DeSimone, but officers refused to believe him. Lace committed suicide in December 1988.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Macedonian painted artwork {{includes}} frescoes and murals, {{but also}} decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still {{exist on the}} bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for <b>rape</b> <b>or</b> marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their general}} {{opposition}} to abortion, fundamentalist churches {{that include the}} conservative evangelical, Non-denominational, Southern Baptist and Pentecostal movements, {{do not have a}} consensus doctrine regarding abortion.

Some argue that the lives of both the mother and fetus should be given equal consideration, in effect condemning all abortion including those performed to save the life of the mother.
