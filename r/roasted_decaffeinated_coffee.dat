40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{epidemiological}} {{association between}} coffee drinking and decreased risk of {{type 2 diabetes}} is strong. However, caffeinated coffee acutely impairs glucose metabolism. We assessed acute effects of <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> on glucose and insulin levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This was a randomized, cross-over, placebocontrolled trial {{of the effects of}} <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee,</b> caffeinated coffee, and caffeine on glucose, insulin, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels during a 2 -h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 11 young men. RESULTS — Within the first hour of the OGTT, glucose and insulin were higher for <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> than for placebo (P � 0. 05). During the whole OGTT, <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> yielded higher insulin than placebo and lower glucose and a higher insulin sensitivity index than caffeine. Changes in GIP could not explain any beverage effects on glucose and insulin. CONCLUSIONS — Some types of <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> may acutely impair glucose metabolism but less than caffeine. Nineteen of 22 epidemiological studies concluded that long-term consumption of coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes (1 – 3), but several investigators have warned that the caffeine in caffeinated coffee can impair glucose metabolism (e. g., 4, 5). While <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> contains very little caffeine and may safely protect against diabetes, there have been conflicting reports on <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee’s</b> acute effects on glucose metabolism (6 – 9).

40|$|Caffeine exerts {{positive}} effects on cognitive and behavioral processes, especially in sub-optimal conditions when arousal is low. Apart from caffeine, coffee contains other compounds including the phenolic compounds ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and the chlorogenic acids, which have purported antioxidant properties. The chlorogenic acids are the most abundant family of compounds found in coffee, yet their effects on cognition and mood have not been investigated. This study aims to ascertain whether a coffee rich in chlorogenic acid modulates brain function. The present pilot study examined the acute effects of <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> with regular chlorogenic acid content and <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> with high chlorogenic acid content on mood and cognitive processes, as measured by behavioral tasks and event-related potentials (ERPs). Performance and ERP responses to a battery of cognitive tasks were recorded at baseline and following the equivalent of three cups of coffee in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 39 healthy older participants. Compared with the <b>decaffeinated</b> <b>coffee</b> with regular chlorogenic acid and placebo, caffeinated coffee showed a robust positive effect on higher-level mood and attention processes.
