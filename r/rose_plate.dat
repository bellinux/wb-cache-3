40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle in Port Sudan city, the Red Sea Sate, Sudan. Two hundred and fifteen blood samples were collected aseptically from three locations in the city bearing in mind the density of animals in each location. Sera were separated from clotted blood samples and tested by four screen tests: The modified <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test, the <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test, the Serum Agglutination Test and the competitive Enzyme-linked Immuosorbent Assay. The seroprevalence rate was 21 % by modified <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>plate</b> Test and 13. 0 % by <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>plate</b> Test. The Serum Agglutination Test detected 93 % of the 27 samples positive for the <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test. The highest titre for SAT was 1488 IU/ml and the lowest was 20 IU/ml. Only 46 % of 46 cattle found positive with the modified <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>plate</b> Test were confirmed by the modified Rose Bengal plateTest prove positive by the competitive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay. The {{results showed that the}} modified <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test was the most sensitive of the four followed by the <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test but were less sensitive than the competitive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay. These findings are discussed with respect to improved diagnosis and control of brucellosis in animals and humans in Eastern Sudan with emphasis on urban areas...|$|R

In the present study a 1 ´ 10 (9) CFU dose for both sheep and goats conjunctivally vaccinated was tested to evaluate the duration of serological responses. Conjunctival vaccination with Rev. 1 performed in adult animals induced a rapid rise in serological titres as measured by <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test (RBPT), Complement Fixation Test (CF) and Modified <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test (MRBPT).

40|$|Abstract: A {{total of}} 1106 {{livestock}} sera from pastoral and agro-pastoral farming system were screened for antibodies for Brucella species using the <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test. Brucella antibody was detected in all study districts and an overall herd seroprevalence of 11. 2 % were recorded {{from the study}} areas. Accordingly, in pastoral area the prevalence of brucellosis was 15. 2 % whereas in agro-pastoral 4. 1 %. The study revealed that pastoral animals were {{more than three times}} more likely of being exposed to Brucella infection compared to animals in the agro-pastoral farming systems. Cattle in pastoral farming system had significantly higher Brucella antibodies (P 2 years) whereas this parameter relatively remained low, 10. 2 %, in younger animals (2 years). This study therefore, showed that Brucella antibodies was present in both pastoral and agro pastoral area of East Showa Zone of Oromia Regional State thus calling for formulation of strategic control measures in order to reduce associated reproductive wastage and the public health risks.

40|$|The {{serological}} {{profiles of}} 33 female bovines, vaccinated at three {{to eight months}} of age with the B 19 standard strain of Brucella abortus, were studied {{over a period of}} 728 days, using the following agglutination procedures: plate agglutination, tube agglutination, <b>rose</b> bengal <b>plate</b> and mercaptoethanol test. Maximum levels of antibodies detected reached by the plate agglutination and tube agglutination tests were found between the 14 (th) and 42 (nd) day, and with mercaptoethanol test, between the 28 (th) and 42 (nd) day. Anti-Brucella antibodies decreased thereafter. At 182 days after vaccination, five suspected animals and one positive were detected by the plate agglutination test, while by the tube agglutination test, only one animal was suspected and another one was positive. During the same period, positive reactions were found in six animals by means of the mercaptoethanol test, and five positives by the rose bengal test. By means of tube agglutination and plate agglutination tests, the animals became serologically negative at 245 and 273 days, respectively, after the vaccination, based on the rules adopted for the vaccinated animals.

40|$|Purpose Nigeria is {{the largest}} cattle-rearing nation in Africa with most animals kept under {{traditional}} husbandry practices. While bovine brucellosis does not receive much attention, a relatively high seroprevalence is found in samples submitted for laboratory testing. The aim {{of the study was}} to provide serological evidence of brucellosis in cattle from some of the main cattle-rearing states of the country and to validate a simple and rapid field test for the serodiagnosis of bovine brucellosis. Method Serum samples collected in various states of Nigeria from cattle because of suspicion of brucellosis were investigated in the <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>plate</b> test, and results were compared with a newly developed rapid field test for the detection of Brucella-specific antibodies. Results Serological evidence for the presence of brucellosis in cattle was obtained for all states included in the study and a high herd prevalence was observed. The seroprevalence was also high among trade and slaughter animals. Results of a rapid field test for the serodiagnosis of bovine brucellosis correlated well with the <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>plate</b> test (agreement, 95. 7 %; kappa value, 0. 80). Conclusions The results indicate that bovine brucellosis is an important veterinarian problem in Nigeria.

40|$|A sero-prevalence {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Kuku Dairy Scheme, Khartoum North, Sudan. The scheme was proved to be endemic with bovine brucellosis. Cross-reaction with other bacteria and the possibility of false positive reactor animals due to vaccination had justified the use of competitive ELISA test for serum detection as a confirmatory test. The number of cattle examined, throughout the study, was 574 out of 845 cows kept in Kuku Dairy Scheme. All the obtained sera were screened using <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test (RBPT). Twenty eight out of the thirty herds of the sample had at least one positive reactor, resulting in 93. 3 % herd prevalence rate. All sera positive to <b>Rose</b> Bengal <b>Plate</b> Test (n = 178) were subjected to further confirmatory test using Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (c-ELISA). 143 cows (80. 3 %) were confirmed positive by c-ELISA.

40|$|The {{reactivity}} of monoclonal antibody (MAb) 12 G 12 was analyzed {{in regard to}} the main biovars of Brucella species and some members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrionaceae which present serological cross-reactions with the smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) of Brucella species. This MAb was strictly directed against the common specific epitope of the Brucella S-LPS. It recognized all of the smooth Brucella strains and biovars except B. suis biovar 2. In order to improve the specificity of the serological diagnosis of brucellosis, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) was developed with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated MAbs 12 G 12 and S-LPS of B. melitensis Rev 1. The specificity of the cELISA was analyzed with 936 serum samples from healthy cattle. The assay was evaluated with sera from heifers (n = 18) experimentally infected with B. abortus 544. After infection, the performance of the cELISA was in agreement with those of the complement fixation test and the <b>rose</b> Bengal <b>plate</b> test. Finally, the specificity of the assay was also evaluated in regard to false-positive serological reactions by using sera from heifers experimentally infected with Yersinia enterocolitica 0 : 9 (n = 4) and with field sera presenting false-positive reactions (n = 74).
