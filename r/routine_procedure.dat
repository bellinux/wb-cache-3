25|$|At {{one time}} shaving {{of the area}} around the vagina, was common {{practice}} due to the belief that hair removal reduced the risk of infection, made an episiotomy (a surgical cut to enlarge the vaginal entrance) easier, and helped with instrumental deliveries. It is currently less common, though it is still a <b>routine</b> <b>procedure</b> in some countries even though a systematic review found no evidence to recommend shaving. Side effects appear later, including irritation, redness, and multiple superficial scratches from the razor. Another effort to prevent infection has been the use of the antiseptic chlorhexidine or providone-iodine solution in the vagina. Evidence of benefit with chlorhexidine is lacking. A decreased risk is found with providone-iodine when a cesarean section is to be performed.|$|E
25|$|On 4 May 1789, al-Jazzar {{dispatched}} two of {{his senior}} mamluk commanders and their troops to collect taxes from Emir Yusuf, which the latter had been reticent to pay. For this purpose, Salim Pasha al-Saghir was sent with 2,000 cavalry to Hasbaya, while Sulayman Pasha was sent with 800 infantry to the coast. According to French consul Jean-Pierre Renaudot, the relatively large size of mobilized troops sent for a relatively <b>routine</b> <b>procedure</b> such as collecting taxes was actually an attempt by al-Jazzar to avoid contributing his forces to the Ottoman war effort with Russia by demonstrating how his forces were still needed to combat the Druze of Mount Lebanon. On 8 May, al-Jazzar became aware of sexual relations between {{a number of his}} mamluks and women from his harem. He consequently cut off the arms of the mamluks who were headquartered in Acre's seraglio (where the harem was located) and had a number of women drowned at sea. On 9 May, al-Jazzar proceeded to purge his mamluks, arresting many, a number of whom were then executed, with the assistance of 30 Bosnian soldiers. The mamluks of Acre subsequently revolted and barricaded themselves in the treasury, which was located in Acre's Big Tower. Angered by the execution of his favored valet, the treasurer, a brother of Salim Pasha, then broke the incarcerated mamluks out of prison and linked up with the mamluk rebels at the Big Tower. The mamluks aimed the artillery pieces of the Big Tower at the seraglio and threatened to destroy it.|$|E
40|$|Aim.   To {{determine}} which <b>routine</b> nursing <b>procedures</b> performed on conscious {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) patients were painful and which <b>routine</b> <b>procedures</b> were not painful. Background.   Current empirical evidence supports that <b>routine</b> <b>procedures</b> are often not viewed {{in the context of}} causing pain to the critically ill patient. Given the complexity of illness and the need to prioritize care in ICU patients, clinicians may not consider <b>routine</b> <b>procedures</b> as causing pain. With patients in intensive care undergoing frequent <b>routine</b> <b>procedures,</b> greater understanding of which procedures inflict pain is warranted to improve patient care and inform and shape nursing practice. Design.   A prospective, descriptive study using a convenience sample of ICU patients was used. Methods.   Sixty-one patients were asked to rate pain intensity experienced prior to and during a <b>routine</b> nursing <b>procedure</b> using a verbal numeric rating scale. The procedures observed were turning, tracheal suctioning, line removal, deep breathing and coughing exercises, simple dressings and drain removal. Results.   Results showed that certain <b>routine</b> <b>procedures</b> cause pain with significant differences observed between pre- and postprocedure pain scores for drain removal (p = 0 · 042), deep breathing and coughing exercises (p = 0 · 003), suctioning (p = 0 · 025), positional change (p = 0 · 000) and line removal (p = 0 · 010). A higher proportion of morphine was administered to those patients undergoing drain removal (50...|$|R

500|$|The team faces many {{diagnostic}} difficulties from patients' concealment of symptoms, circumstances, {{or personal}} histories, so House frequently proclaims during the team's deliberations, [...] "The patient is lying", or mutters [...] "Everybody lies"; such an assumption guides House's decisions and diagnoses, {{and makes the}} countermeasure of housebreaking a <b>routine</b> <b>procedure.</b> Because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights, he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior, who {{in all but the}} final season is hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy. This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable. Frequent disagreements occur between House and his team, especially Dr. Allison Cameron, whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters.|$|E
500|$|As {{with any}} other organic compound, it is prudent to {{characterize}} synthetic oligonucleotides upon their preparation. In more complex cases (research and large scale syntheses) oligonucleotides are characterized after their deprotection and after purification. Although the ultimate approach to the characterization is sequencing, a relatively inexpensive and <b>routine</b> <b>procedure,</b> the considerations of the cost reduction preclude its use in routine manufacturing of oligonucleotides. In day-by-day practice, it is sufficient to obtain the molecular mass of an oligonucleotide by recording its mass spectrum. Two methods are currently widely used for characterization of oligonucleotides: electrospray mass spectrometry (ES MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). To obtain informative spectra, {{it is very important}} to exchange all metal ions that might be present in the sample for ammonium or trialkylammonium [...] ions prior to submitting a sample to the analysis by either of the methods.|$|E

2500|$|Clinical {{application}} of cardiac catheterization began with Werner Forssmann in the 1930s, who inserted a catheter into the brachial vein {{of his own}} forearm, guided it fluoroscopically into his right atrium, and took an X-ray picture of it.

[...] He tied down her arms while inserting the catheter into his own arm, only releasing her at the point {{it was too late to}} change, and he needed her assistance. Forssmann was twice fired for carrying out these self-experiments, but shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1956 for this achievement.

2500|$|In {{her last}} message {{received}} at Howland Island, Earhart {{reported that they}} were flying a standard position line (or sun line), a <b>routine</b> <b>procedure</b> for an experienced navigator like Noonan. This line passed within sight of Gardner Island (now called Nikumaroro) in the Phoenix Island Group to the southeast, and there is a range of documented, archaeological, and anecdotal evidence supporting the hypothesis that Earhart and Noonan found Gardner Island, uninhabited at the time, landed the Electra on a flat reef near the wreck of a freighter, and sent sporadic radio messages from there. It has been surmised that Earhart and Noonan might have survived on Nikumaroro for several weeks before dying as castaways. In 1940, Gerald Gallagher, a British colonial officer and a licensed pilot, radioed his superiors to tell them that he believed he had found Earhart's skeleton, along with a sextant box, under a tree on the island's southeast corner. In a 1998 report to the American Anthropological Association, researchers, including a forensic anthropologist and an archaeologist, concluded, [...] "What we can be certain of is that bones were found on the island in 1939–40, associated with what were observed to be women’s shoes and a navigator’s sextant box, and that the morphology of the recovered bones, insofar as we can tell by applying contemporary forensic methods to measurements taken at the time, appears consistent with a female of Earhart’s height and ethnic origin.|$|E
