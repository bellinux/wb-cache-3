500|$|When {{the riders}} are seated a catch car {{connects to the}} gondola and raises {{it to the top}} of the tower, which takes about one minute. Although the tower is [...] high, the gondola stops [...] lower. When it <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> height the seats tilt forward, with a computer-randomized wait time from one to five seconds. When the wait time ends, the gondola is {{released}} from the catch car into a five-second free fall reaching a maximum speed of [...] As the gondola passes through the pre-braking section, the seats rotate back into a vertical position. After the pre-brake the gondola enters the main magnetic-brake run, where riders experience approximately 3.5g (34m/s2) of deceleration as the gondola slows. When it comes to a full stop at the base of the tower, the riders disembark. One cycle of the ride lasts about one and a half minutes. Busch Gardens Tampa placed an Easter egg in the form of a painted Falcon's Fury logo on top of one of its buildings, which can be seen only from a certain side of the gondola.|$|E

Acela trains use tilting technology, which helps control lateral centrifugal forces, allowing the train to travel at higher speeds on the sharply curved NEC without disturbing passengers. The high-speed operation occurs mostly along the [...] route from New York's Penn Station to Washington DC's Union Station, with a fastest scheduled time of 2 hours and 45 minutes and an average speed of , including time spent at intermediate stops. Over this route, Acela and the Northeast Regional line captured a 75% share of air/train commuters between New York and Washington in 2011, up from 37% in 2000. Due to this competition, one airline canceled service between Washington and New York.|$|E
