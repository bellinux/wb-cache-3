40|$|In this paper, {{we design}} and {{evaluate}} an efficient and dynamic <b>regrouping</b> approach to optimize a large continuous query workload. The key idea of our <b>regrouping</b> algorithm {{is to find}} a best solution by removing redundant groups within the existing solution from incremental group optimization. Since the existing query groups usually constitute a very small portion of the entire search space, such a heuristic-based approach is key to achieving an efficient <b>regrouping</b> algorithm. In addition, timing of <b>regrouping</b> is also critical to the efficiency of <b>regrouping.</b> Overall, we believe that constant incremental grouping in conjunction with occasional dynamic <b>regrouping</b> can achieve a high-quality grouping at a fairly low cost for optimizing a large, dynamic continuous query workload. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is as follows : (1) the {{analyzing}} of difference between the main two rules in subtraction with regrouping; 1. <b>regrouping</b> minuend rule : (Genka rule) 12 － 8 ＝(10 － 8) ＋ 2 2. <b>regrouping</b> subtrahend rule : (Gengen rule) 12 － 3 ＝ 12 － 2 － 1 (2) the investigation of the relation of the follwing three elements; 1. subtraction skill 2. subtraction rules 3. scholastic ability First, we described the theory of subtraction with <b>regrouping</b> from the viewpoints of mathematics, psychology, and teaching method. According to this theory, we investigated the variation of the relation with age. Subjects were three elementary school-, four junior high school-, four high school-, one university-students, 694 in all. This investigation made clear the following facts; (1) They used six subtraction rules : <b>regrouping</b> minuend, <b>regrouping</b> subtrahend, additive subtraction, subtraction with intuition, abacus, and using multiple. In most cases, they used the <b>regrouping</b> minuend rule. (2) After they have learned the <b>regrouping</b> minuend rule, they learn the <b>regrouping</b> subtrahend rule and others. Lastly in high school, they can use any of subtraction rules intuitively. (3) The subtraction skill makes progress as age increases. (4) The child who has high scholastic ability has high subtraction skill, but not vice versa. (5) There are some relations between the type of subtraction with <b>regrouping</b> and subtraction rules. Lastly we suggested the desirable sequence of learning the subtraction with <b>regrouping...</b>|$|R
5|$|With the 79th Infantry Regiment {{having lost}} around 50% of its {{strength}} and with ammunition and food running low (by {{the end of}} the month, they had been reduced to quarter rations), the Japanese divisional commander, Katagiri, made the decision to call off the attack in order to pull back from Jivevaneng and Katika and <b>regroup</b> on the higher ground further west around the mission.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an action research that {{aimed at improving}} pupils’ performance in doing subtraction with <b>regrouping</b> of 1 -digit numbers from 2 -digit numbers and 2 -digit numbers from 2 -digit numbers.

The study examines the effectiveness of the method called “Shortcut for Subtraction” in improving pupils’ skills in doing subtraction with <b>regrouping</b> problems.

It involves managing and planning (such as <b>regrouping)</b> of schools distribution in Lebanon {{with the aim of}} satisfying educational, economical and national criteria. In this work, we have developed a software tool referred to as the Schools <b>Regrouping</b> Decision Support System (SRDSS), that consists of four components: (a) Schools database that contains information about students, teachers, and schools, (b) Towns Database that contains information about the town's population and geographical location, (c) Schools <b>Regrouping</b> Algorithm, and (d) Geographical Information System that help in visualizing data and the algorithm's results. The original contributions of this work are: (a) the formulation of the schools <b>regrouping</b> problem as a weighted graph problem, and (b) the application of the pcenters schools <b>regrouping</b> algorithm to determinehow the current schools, in a userdefined region, can be <b>regrouped</b> to a smaller user-defined number, p, of schools such that user-defined criteria are satisfied. The experimental application of the algorithm to the Aley Caza shows the flexibility of the algorithm in supporting <b>regrouping</b> decisions and gives good results that are clearly consistent with the stated criteria. 1 bound copy: 1 v.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the consequences}} of repeated <b>regrouping</b> of dairy heifers according to their behaviour, stress physiology and production. Thirty-two Holstein heifers were housed in pairs. Between 11 and 13 months of age, half were subjected to 16 pen relocations each time with a new peer (<b>regrouped</b> heifers), while the other half remained in the same pen with the same peer (controls). The heifers were observed in standardised behavioural tests comprising sudden (opening of an umbrella), novel (an unfamiliar arena) or predator-related (dog) stimuli. All behavioural tests were conducted on three sessions between the 13 th and the 16 th regroupings. The functioning of the HPA axis was assessed through blockade by dexamethasone and stimulation by ACTH after the 14 th <b>regrouping</b> and stimulation by CRF after the 15 th <b>regrouping.</b> Weight gain was assessed during the <b>regrouping</b> period and reproduction (No. of inseminations before successful insemination) thereafter. <b>Regrouped</b> heifers reacted less than the controls to the umbrella (= 8. 23, P < 0. 05). They started eating more quickly in the arena (F = 10. 8, P < 0. 01). In {{the presence of the}} dog, they were less active (F = 6. 26, P < 0. 05) and tended to look at the dog less often (F = 3. 63, P < 0. 10). The reduction in behavioural responses from one session to the next one was more pronounced in <b>regrouped</b> heifers (e. g. number of eating bouts: F (session treatment) = 4. 23, P < 0. 05). <b>Regrouped</b> heifers had lower cortisol responses to CRF. In conclusion, repeatedly <b>regrouped</b> heifers appear less disturbed by unusual situations and habituate to those more quickly. According to the behaviour of heifers and as suggested by their lower cortisol responses, diversity rather than stability of the social environment appears more beneficial to them. v 2006 o...|$|R
40|$|<b>Regrouping</b> female rabbits in group-housing {{systems is}} common {{management}} practice in rabbit breeding, which may, however, induce agonistic interactions resulting in social stress and severe injuries. Here we compared two methods of <b>regrouping</b> female rabbits {{with respect to}} their effects on behaviour, stress and injuries. Thus, we introduced two unfamiliar rabbits into a group of rabbits either in the group's familiar pen (HOME) or in a novel disinfected pen (NOVEL), and assessed the effects of these treatments on general activity, number and duration of agonistic interactions, number and severity of injuries and body temperature as a measure of stress. General activities were not affected by the method of <b>regrouping.</b> Also, treatment had no effect on the number and duration of agonistic interactions. However, the numbers of injuries (P= 0. 030) as well as body temperature on the first clay after <b>regrouping</b> (p= 0. 0036) were increased in rabbits <b>regrouped</b> in a novel clean pen. These findings question the recommendation to introduce unfamiliar does into established groups in a neutral environment and indicate that <b>regrouping</b> in the group's home pen may decrease the risk of severe injuries and social stress.

40|$|Abstract—Particle swarm {{optimization}} (PSO) {{is known}} to suffer from stagnation once particles have prematurely converged to any particular region of the search space. The proposed <b>regrouping</b> PSO (RegPSO) avoids the stagnation problem by automatically triggering swarm <b>regrouping</b> when premature convergence is detected. This mechanism liberates particles from sub-optimal solutions and enables continued progress toward the true global minimum. Particles are <b>regrouped</b> within a range on each dimension proportional {{to the degree of}} uncertainty implied by the maximum deviation of any particle from the globally best position. This is a computationally simple yet effective addition to the computationally simple PSO algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed RegPSO successfully reduces each popular benchmark tested to its approximate global minimum.
