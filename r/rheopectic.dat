50|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{aggressive}} research into {{new ways to}} make and use <b>rheopectic</b> materials. There is great interest in possible military uses of this technology. Moreover, {{the high end of}} the sports market has also begun to respond to it. Body armor and combat vehicle armor are key areas where efforts are being made to use <b>rheopectic</b> materials. Work is also being done to use these materials in other kinds of protective equipment, which is seen as potentially useful to reduce apparent impact stress in athletics, motor sports, transportation accidents, and all forms of parachuting. In particular, footwear with <b>rheopectic</b> shock absorption is being pursued as a dual-use technology that can provide better support to those who must frequently run, leap, climb, or descend.|$|E

50|$|Just as the {{opposite}} behaviour of becoming thinner with time is thixotropism (time dependent pseudoplastic behaviour), <b>rheopectic</b> behaviour may {{be described as}} time-dependent dilatant behaviour.|$|E
50|$|An {{incorrect}} example {{often used}} to demonstrate rheopecty is cornstarch mixed with water, {{which is a very}} viscous, white fluid. It is a cheap and simple demonstrator, which can be picked up by hand as a semi-solid, but flows easily when not under pressure. However, cornstarch in water is actually a dilatant fluid, since it does not show the time-dependent, shear-induced change required in order to be labeled <b>rheopectic.</b> These terms are often and easily confused since the terms are rarely used; a true <b>rheopectic</b> fluid would when shaken be liquid at first, becoming thicker as shaking continued.|$|E
50|$|Some fluids are anti-thixotropic: {{constant}} {{shear stress}} {{for a time}} causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing.

50|$|There {{are also}} fluids whose strain rate is a {{function}} of time. Fluids that require a gradually increasing shear stress to maintain a constant strain rate are referred to as <b>rheopectic.</b> An opposite case of this is a fluid that thins out with time and requires a decreasing stress to maintain a constant strain rate (thixotropic).|$|E
50|$|Rheopecty or {{rheopexy}} is {{the rare}} property of some non-Newtonian fluids {{to show a}} time-dependent increase in viscosity (time-dependent viscosity); the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. <b>Rheopectic</b> fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken. The opposite and much more common type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called thixotropy.|$|E
50|$|Most commonly, in a non-Newtonian fluid, the {{viscosity}} (the {{measure of}} a fluid's ability to resist gradual deformation by shear or tensile stresses) of the fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history (time). These shear-thickening fluids are divided into two groups: time dependent and time-independent viscosity. In the case of time dependent viscosity, the apparent viscosity of a fluid changes with time as the fluid is continuously sheared. They can be termed as memory materials. If the apparent viscosity decreases with time, the fluid is called thixotropic and if it increases with time, it is called <b>rheopectic.</b> Thixotropic behaviour {{is the result of}} a break down in the microstructure of the material as shearing continues. This happens when the shear is exceeded of a limit. It leads to non-linear stress-strain behaviour. Thixotropy can be associated with the effect of bubbles. Examples of these types of fluids are gelatine, shortening, cream, paints, yogurt, xanthan gum solutions, aqueous iron oxide gels, gelatine gels, pectin gels, synovial fluid, hydrogenated castor oil, some clays (including bentonite, and montmorillonite), carbon black suspension in molten tire rubber, some drilling muds, many paints, many floc suspensions, and many colloidal suspensions. In the case of rheopatic fluids, the structure builds as shearing continues. <b>Rheopectic</b> behaviour may be described as time-dependent dilatant behaviour. This type of behaviour is much less common but can occur in highly concentrated starch solutions over long periods of time. Shear induced crystallization may be responsible for rheopatic behaviour. Other examples are gypsum pastes and printer inks.|$|E

[...] Much of bentonite's usefulness in the drilling and geotechnical engineering industry comes from its unique rheological properties. Relatively small quantities of bentonite suspended in water form a viscous, shear-thinning material. Most often, bentonite suspensions are also thixotropic, although rare cases of <b>rheopectic</b> behavior have also been reported. At high enough concentrations (about 60 grams of bentonite per litre of suspension), bentonite suspensions begin {{to take on the}} characteristics of a gel (a fluid with a minimum yield strength required to make it move). So, it is a common component of drilling mud used to curtail drilling fluid invasion by its propensity for aiding in the formation of mud cake.|$|E
50|$|It is {{essential}} that large particles (> 150 μm for calcium carbonate and > 45 μm for quartz) should be eliminated from the rawmix, to facilitate chemical combination in the kiln. In the case of slurries, larger particles can be removed by hydrocyclones or sieving devices. These require {{a certain amount of}} energy, supplied by high pressure pumping. This process, and the moving and blending of the slurry, require careful control of the slurry viscosity. Clearly, a thinner slurry is easily obtained by adding more water, but at the expense of high energy consumption for its subsequent removal. In practice, the slurry is therefore made as thick as the plant equipment can handle. Cement rawmix slurries are Bingham plastics which can also exhibit thixotropic or <b>rheopectic</b> behaviour. The energy needed to pump slurry at a desired rate is controlled mainly by the slurry's yield stress, and this in turn varies more or less exponentially with the slurry solids/liquid ratio. In practice, deflocculants are often added in order to maintain pumpability at low moisture contents. Common deflocculants used (at typical dose rates of 0.005-0.03%) are sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium polyphosphates and lignosulfonates. Under favourable circumstances, pumpable slurries with less than 25% water can be obtained.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{lime putty}} is a non-Newtonian fluid {{that can be}} either {{thixotropic}} or <b>rheopectic</b> depending on burning process of the lime, {{the presence of the}} quartz sand and other parameters. One of the most important lime putty characteristics is its plasticity which affects its workability and use. It is possible to increase the lime putty plasticity by mechanical activation. This work focuses on the effect of the mechanical activation of the lime putty on its rheological behavior and on properties of lime hydrosilicate autoclaved materials. Fresh lime putty was activated in a high-speed mixer at 1000 RPM for 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes. Non-activated lime putties show <b>rheopectic</b> behavior. <b>Rheopectic</b> behavior becomes slightly more distinct after 1 min. of activation and then less distinct with increasing time of activation. After 10 min. of activation, the system shows no time-dependent properties, nor even slight thixotropic behavior. This trend can be related to process where smaller and smaller aggregates are fragmented in the suspension. The hydrosilicate materials were prepared in two series from quicklime and finely ground sand with the ratio C/S 0. 85, under hydrothermal conditions. The amount of xonotlite in hydrosilicate material increases with activation time as the increased amount of portlandite particles retards the reaction. 11. 3 Å tobermorite crystallizes more slowly and formation of xonotlite is accelerated...|$|E
40|$|Different {{viscosity}} {{models were}} developed to describe the viscosity of unprocessed fruit and vegetable purees under dynamic conditions. Temperature hysteresis cycles were carried out for three purees with different structural characteristics (tomato, carrot, and broccoli), with heating and cooling phases from 10 to 80 degrees C with isothermal (holding) phases at 10, 30, 60 or 80 degrees C. The apparent viscosity was measured continuously with a rotational rheometer and the data was analyzed with time-independent and time-dependent models (quantifying rheopexy, thixotropy, or both). The results revealed clear thixotropic behavior in tomato puree, attributed to shearing effects, and <b>rheopectic</b> in broccoli puree, attributed to gel formation at the higher temperatures. Although carrot puree data from the isothermal periods could be quantified satisfactorily with no time dependency, analysis of the nonisothermal periods proved that <b>rheopectic</b> effects also needed to be included.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of fluid instabilities {{in the relevant}} limit of vanishing fluid inertia (i. e., arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number) has been investigated for the well-known Kolmogorov flow. The time-lagged viscosity change from lower to higher values due to shear changes is the crucial ingredient for the instabilities to emerge. This behavior characterizes the so-called <b>rheopectic</b> fluids. The instability does not emerge in shear-thinning or -thickening fluids where viscosity adjustment to local shear occurs instantaneously. No instability arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number is either observed in thixotropic fluids, even though the viscosity adjustment time to shear is finite like in <b>rheopectic</b> fluids. Numerical tools (through suitable eigenvalue problems from the linear stability analysis) and multiple-scale homogenization techniques are utilized to lead to our conclusions. Our findings may have important consequences in all situations where purely hydrodynamic fluid instabilities or mixing are inhibited due to negligible inertia, such as in microfluidics. To trigger mixing in these situations, suitable (not necessarily viscoelastic) non-Newtonian fluid solutions appear as a valid answer.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of ﬂuid instabilities {{in the relevant}} limit of vanishing ﬂuid inertia (i. e., arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number) has been investigated for the well-known Kolmogorov ﬂow. The ﬁnite-time shear-induced order-disorder transition of the non-Newtonian microstructure and the corresponding viscosity change from lower to higher values are the crucial ingredients for the instabilities to emerge. The ﬁnite-time low-to-high viscosity change for increasing shear characterizes the <b>rheopectic</b> ﬂuids. The instability does not emerge in shear-thinning or -thickening ﬂuids where viscosity adjustment to local shear occurs instantaneously. The lack of instabilities arbitrarily close to zero Reynolds number is also observed for thixotropic ﬂuids, {{in spite of the}} fact that the viscosity adjustment time to shear is ﬁnite as in <b>rheopectic</b> ﬂuids.

40|$|Water soluble {{polymers}} {{are widely}} used in oil and gas reservoirs and usually injected into the reservoir rocks to alter their flow properties. The rheologies of the polymer solution and their adsorption or interaction with the porous system are crucial {{for the success of}} the injection. This work aims to investigate the formation of residual polymer multilayers {{as a result of the}} flow of aqueous solutions of high-molecular-weight cationic (CPAM) and non-ionic (PAM) polyacrylamides through single, circular and rectangular capillaries. Polymer solutions in de-ionized water and weak brine were injected at different flow rates into glass capillaries of circular and rectangular cross sectional area. The adsorption energy and layer thickness on glass surfaces of these polymer solutions have been investigated by Al-Hashmi and Luckham (2010) under static conditions using colloidal force measurements. The apparent viscosity of the polymer in solution on both increasing and decreasing the shear rate are presented to indicate the thixotropic or anti-thixotropic behaviour of the solution. Also, the viscosity-time curves are presented to investigate the <b>rheopectic</b> behaviour of the polymer solutions. The flow CPAM in water solution through the capillaries resulted in very thick residual polymer layers, around 15 times thicker than those measured under static conditions. This solution shows both anti-thixtropic and <b>rheopectic</b> behaviour, which may be attributed to flow-induced-microgel formations in the bulk of the polymer solution. The same polymer solution has shown almost instantaneous adsorption from the colloidal force measurements due to electrostatic attraction of the cationic groups of the polymer to the negative glass surface. Such thick layers are not formed when CPAM in 0. 34. M NaCl is used. Although it has shown strong adsorption on glass, the CPAM in 0. 34. M NaCl exhibits neither anti-thixotropic nor <b>rheopectic</b> behaviour. Though it has shown <b>rheopectic</b> behaviour, the non-ionic polyacrylamide in water solution does not result in significantly thick layers, which might be due to its weak adsorption on glass. In the current study, a new mechanism is proposed to attribute the apparent formation of residual multilayer under the name of flow-induced-microgel adsorption (FIMGA). According to the new mechanism, two criteria have to be satisfied for polymer multilayer formation: the formation of sizable shear-induced-microgel structures in the bulk of the solution, and sufficiently high adsorption energy of the polymer to the solid surface. The new understanding in view of this new mechanism will contribute to more successful applications of polymers in oilfields. It will also allow faster screening of the chemicals for a specific application which may warrant different characteristics of flow and adsorption. For example, polymers used in enhanced oil recovery should have high injectivity and low adsorption. On the other hand, high adsorption and thick residual polymer layers are the key for a successful use of polymers in water shut-off in oil and gas wells...|$|E

In this paper the interaction between anionic polyelectrolyte - sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) and cationic surfactant - cethyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB) has been investigated by rheological measurements. Addition of electrolyte NaBr and nonionic surfactant - Tween 80 reduced the binding strength, prevented the precipitation of the complex and increased the viscosity of the system.

30|$|There is {{continuous}} development of fluid rheologies {{to improve the}} desired flow characteristics with better viscosity manipulation {{as well as to}} reduce the use of undesirable chemicals. Both goals can be achieved if the rheology is “tuned” to the reservoir and in particular to the distribution of permeabilities or fracture sizes for the oil and tight gas cases, respectively. For the oil recovery problem, the classic enhanced oil recovery current “standard” are gelling polymers which are added to water (Raffa et al. 2016). The gelling effect is time delayed until the solution has penetrated the high permeability portions at which point the solution viscosifies and (hopefully) selectively blocks these volumes. The solutions themselves are shear thinning (for injection purposes) and show a component of <b>rheopectic</b> behaviour (i.e., thickening with time). This is the same characteristic as the guar gum industry standard which is used for the shale gas fracking application.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{show that}} besides simple or {{thixotropic}} yield stress fluids {{there exists a}} third class of yield stress fluids. This is illustrated through the rheological behavior of a carbon black suspension, which is shown to exhibit a viscosity bifurcation effect around a critical stress along with <b>rheopectic</b> trends, i. e., after a preshear at a given stress the fluid tends to accelerate when it is submitted to a lower stress. Viscosity bifurcation displays here original features: the yield stress and the critical shear rate depend on the previous flow history. The most spectacular property due to these specificities is that the material structure can be adjusted at will through an appropriate flow history. In particular {{it is possible to}} tune the material yield stress to arbitrary low values. A simple model assuming that the stress is the sum of one component due to structure deformation and one component due to hydrodynamic interactions predicts all rheological trends observed and appears to well represent quantitatively the data...|$|E
