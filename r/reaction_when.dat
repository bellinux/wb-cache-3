5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Lamb showed no <b>reaction</b> <b>when</b> the verdict was read.|$|E

The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25µm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color <b>reaction</b> <b>when</b> stained with Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of Lepiota babruzalka.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} nuclear reactions which generate nucleogenic neon isotopes {{start from}} 24Mg and 25Mg, which produce 21Ne and 22Ne, respectively, after neutron capture and immediate emission of an alpha particle. The neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles, in turn derived from uranium-series decay chains. The net result yields a trend towards lower 20Ne/22Ne and higher 21Ne/22Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as granites. 21Ne {{may also be}} produced in a nucleogenic <b>reaction,</b> <b>when</b> 20Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.|$|E
5|$|The quatrains, {{published}} in a book titled Les Propheties (The Prophecies), received a mixed <b>reaction</b> <b>when</b> they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, {{while many of the}} elite evidently thought otherwise. Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II of France, was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King Charles IX of France.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway <b>reaction.</b> <b>When</b> a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another <b>reaction</b> <b>when</b> stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E

25|$|Acamprosate, {{disulfiram}} and topiramate (a novel anticonvulsant sulphonated sugar) {{are also}} used to treat alcohol addiction. Acamprosate has shown effectiveness for patients with severe dependence, helping them to maintain abstinence for several weeks or months. Disulfiram (also called Antabuse) produces a very unpleasant <b>reaction</b> <b>when</b> drinking alcohol that includes flushing, nausea and palpitations. It is more effective for patients with high motivation and some addicts use it only for high risk situations.|$|E
