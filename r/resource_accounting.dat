40|$|Consumption depletes one’s {{available}} resources, but {{consumers may}} {{be unaware of}} the total resources available for consumption and, therefore, {{be influenced by the}} temporary accessibility of <b>resource</b> <b>accounts.</b> Consistent with this possibility, consumers in four experiments perceived a unit of consumption to be smaller and consequently consumed more, when large <b>resource</b> <b>accounts</b> of money, calories, or time (e. g., the money in their savings account) were made temporarily accessible compared with when small <b>resource</b> <b>accounts</b> were made temporarily accessible (e. g., the money in their wallet).

This paper provides an example of how NRA can be used for policy analysis based on work conducted in Indonesia. An environmental-economic model is constructed by integrating the NRA with a 30 -sector, dynamic input-output model. To assess the environmental implications of Indonesia's second long-term development plan, six alternative scenarios of ways to achieve the objectives of the plan were constructed for the period 1984 - 2020. These scenarios were based on combinations of assumptions about rates of economic growth and technological change, especially where this growth or change affects resource use. Economic and environmental results of the alternative scenarios are discussed. Natural <b>resource</b> <b>accounts,</b> dynamic input-output model, environmental-economic model, Indonesia,...|$|R
