5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual <b>reproduction</b> over the more efficient asexual <b>reproduction.</b> It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual <b>reproduction</b> affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual <b>reproduction</b> variability for fitness not seen in the asexual <b>reproduction,</b> which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker <b>reproduction.</b> Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt <b>reproduction.</b> More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain <b>reproduction</b> occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker <b>reproduction.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fungal <b>reproduction</b> is complex, {{reflecting}} {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated {{that a third of}} all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, <b>reproduction</b> may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual <b>reproduction.</b> These structures aid <b>reproduction</b> by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{propagation}} {{include both}} sexual and asexual <b>reproduction.</b> Commercial cultivars are usually sterile.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual <b>reproduction</b> {{in the wild}} is rare, and {{probably}} a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual <b>reproduction</b> diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual <b>reproduction</b> {{may have contributed to}} the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} the {{complexity}} of bronze <b>reproduction,</b> France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit <b>reproduction</b> to twelve casts– the maximum number {{that can be made}} from an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, asexual <b>reproduction</b> may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual <b>reproduction</b> with asexual <b>reproduction</b> and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual <b>reproduction</b> for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, <b>reproduction</b> through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
