6000|$|... 2. We are induced to {{make that}} change through a desire to place {{a large amount of}} revenue at the {{disposal}} of Government to meet the expense of giving protection to life and property in those countries, {{and at the same time}} from a well-founded conviction that persons really bent upon visiting the gold district will as readily pay the increased as the lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is {{the custom}} of the slave-dealers, on going into the {{interior}} {{for the purpose of}} procuring slaves, to offer to buy them from such tribes as are disposed to sell. This most of the tribes are willing to do. Fathers do not indeed, sell their own children, or husbands their wives, from preference, but chiefs and head-men are by no means loath to get rid of their criminals in this way--their bad stock, as it were, of black ivory. They also sell orphans and other defenceless ones of their tribes, the usual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> being about two or three yards of calico for a man, woman, or child.|$|E

50|$|For {{tapering}} <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge,</b> {{an average}} <b>of</b> 1.67 volts should be maintained across the cell terminals throughout the charge. The current value {{at the start}} <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> varies according to the electrical resistance.

50|$|Low-energy {{exposure}} to high voltage may be harmless, {{such as the}} spark produced in a dry climate when touching a doorknob after walking across a carpeted floor.

50|$|The most well-studied defects {{assisting}} in the leakage current are those produced by charge trapping in the oxide. This model provides {{a point of}} attack and has stimulated researchers to develop methods to decrease the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> trapping by mechanisms such as nitrous oxide (N2O) nitridation of the oxide.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium-ion {{batteries}} have {{a relatively}} short shelf life. The combination of heat, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge,</b> and cycling can dramatically decrease energy capacity. When metal ion batteries are fully discharged, {{they can no longer}} be recharged. Ionic electrolyte materials are expensive. Like most batteries, they have a far lower energy density than gasoline.|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} charge transport (CT) through self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of oligoglycines {{having an}} N-terminal cysteine group that anchors the molecule to a gold substrate, and demonstrate that CT is rapid (relative to SAMs of n-alkanethiolates). Comparisons <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transport-using junctions with the structure AuTS/SAM//Ga 2 O 3 /EGaIn (across these SAMs of oligoglycines, and across SAMs {{of a number}} of structurally and electronically related molecules) established that <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> tunneling along SAMs of oligoglycines are comparable to that along SAMs of oligophenyl groups (of comparable length). The mechanism of tunneling in oligoglycines is compatible with superexchange, and involves interactions among high-energy occupied orbitals in multiple, consecutive amide bonds, which may by separated by one to three methylene groups. This mechanistic conclusion is supported by density functional theory (DFT) ...|$|R
40|$|Houseflies (Musca domestica L.) {{have been}} found to {{accumulate}} significant electrostatic charges when walking on uncharged dielectric surfaces. The number of steps taken was found to determine the amount <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transferred whereas time, on its own, did not play a significant role. After walking only a short distance, typically 30 cm, flies reached saturation <b>charge.</b> The level <b>of</b> this varied according to the position of the surface in the triboelectric series relative to the fly. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> (pC/footstep) was directly proportional to the difference between the fly's charge and its saturation charge, hence the initial <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> for an uncharged fly was directly proportional to the saturation charge. A model has been fitted to the relationship between distance travelled (and hence the number of steps taken) with charge. The reciprocal charge left on the surface has been visualised using photocopier toner. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. <br/...|$|R
50|$|In practice, the {{convention}} states were supplied with British Indian postage stamps (the majority of stamps supplied depicted the monarch's head), which were overprinted {{in the name}} of the state and also the word 'SERVICE' in case of official stamps.

50|$|Other {{classical}} electrostatic machines like a Wimshurst {{machine or}} a Bonetti machine can easily produce more current than a Van de Graaff generator for experiments with electrostatics and have {{positive and negative}} outputs. For these generators, however, corona discharge from exposed metal parts at high potentials and poorer insulation result in smaller voltages. In an electrostatic generator, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transported (current) to the high-voltage electrode is very small, so the maximal voltage is obtained when the leakage current from the electrode equals the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transport. In the Van de Graaff generator, the belt allows the transport of charge into {{the interior of a}} large hollow spherical electrode. This is the ideal shape to minimize leakage and corona discharge, so the Van de Graaff generator can produce the greatest voltage. This is why the Van de Graaff design has been used for all electrostatic particle accelerators.|$|E
50|$|All credit {{contracts}} {{are covered by}} the Act. Responsibility for issuing credit {{is that of the}} creditor, that is, the merchant. The Act requires all creditors to inform them of any issuance. It is perfectly legal to ask the consumer to pay a premium for credit card purchases or any other form of credit, or to buy a car or motorcycle on lease, but the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> must be declared to the consumer.|$|E

50|$|Some {{concepts}} see battery {{exchanges and}} battery charging stations, much like gas/petrol stations today. Clearly these will require enormous storage and charging potentials, {{which could be}} manipulated to vary the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging,</b> and to output power during shortage periods, much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grids.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of nanometer aerosol particles in atmospheric air during quiet periods of new particle formation {{is low and}} direct measuring is difficult. We study what information about neutral particles {{can be drawn from}} measurements of intermediate ions, which are the electrically charged particles between 1. 5 â€“ 7. 5 nm in diameter. If the coagulation sink of nanoparticles and the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> particles are known, then the steady state equations allow us to calculate the size distribution of neutral nanoparticles. Variations in the trial value <b>of</b> the growth <b>rate</b> have a minor effect on the estimates of the concentrations and size distributions. There exists a value of the constant growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> nanoparticles that leads to a minimum deviation of the estimated growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> neutral nanoparticles from the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> nanoparticles. Rough estimates <b>of</b> the growth <b>rate</b> and size distribution of neutral nanoparticles are derived {{despite the fact that the}} sample data of intermediate ion measurements is not accompanied by simultaneous measurements of the background aerosol and ionization rate. In the case of a near-median intermediate ion {{concentration of}} 21 Â± 2 cm âˆ’ 3 in the urban air of a small town, the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nanoparticles is estimated to be about 2 nm h âˆ’ 1, while the growth flux or apparent nucleation rate is about 0. 5 cm âˆ’ 3 s âˆ’ 1 at 3 nm and about 0. 08 cm âˆ’ 3 s âˆ’ 1 at 7 nm. The results suggest that the process of new particle formation is not interrupted during the quiet periods between events of intensive nucleation of atmospheric aerosols...|$|R
50|$|The lease {{arrangement}} with the GWR was again the source of controversy, and the GWR {{was considered to be}} exploiting an unfairly high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> while providing inadequate wagons for available goods traffic, and it was only after considerable negotiation that agreement was reached; even then the SWR gave notice to terminate the agreement at the earliest opportunity, on 30 June 1857.|$|R
50|$|The {{quantum yield}} for an ideal system {{undergoing}} photocatalytic events is measured {{as the number}} of events occurring per photon absorbed. The typical assumption in determining the quantum yield is that all photons are absorbed on the semiconductor surface, and the quantum yield {{is referred to as the}} apparent quantum yield. This assumption is necessary due to the difficulty in measuring the actual photons absorbed by the solid surface. The relation between the quantum yield, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transfer, kCT, and the electron/hole recombination rate, kR, is given by the following equation.|$|E
5000|$|The RN {{created the}} rate of Warrant Officer Class 2 on 1 April 2004. Previously, there was a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Charge</b> Chief Petty Officer, who usually ranked as OR-7, {{although}} above other CPOs. A Charge Chief Artificer (a highly qualified technical CCPO) could be given a NATO OR-8 status, but still ranked below WO2 in the Army and Royal Marines. On the creation of WO2, all CCPOs were upgraded to this rate.By 2014, the rating of WO2 in the RN will disappear {{and there will be}} a single WO rate, that is, WO1.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electronic}} ballistic chronograph {{was invented}} by Kiryako ("Jerry") Arvanetakis in the 1950s. As consulting engineer under contract by NACA (later NASA), {{he was asked to}} find a way to accurately measure the velocity of various projectiles fired at hyper-velocities into a variety of engineered materials in anticipation of manned space flight. His first design was an open rectangular frame of square aluminum tubing with a screen of fine copper wire at both ends. Breaking the first wire started charging a capacitor, breaking the second wire stopped it. Measuring the accumulated voltage and knowing the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> the elapsed time could be accurately calculated.|$|E
40|$|The {{energy loss}} {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> particles in silicon is approximated {{by a simple}} analytical parametrization. Its use is demonstrated through several examples. With the help of energy deposits in sensing elements of the detector, the position of track segments and the corresponding deposited energy are estimated with improved accuracy and less bias. The parametrization is successfully used to estimate the energy loss <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> particles, and it is applied to detector gain calibration tasks...|$|R

5000|$|Relaxation {{oscillators}} {{can generate}} a sawtooth or triangular waveform. They {{are commonly used}} in monolithic integrated circuits (ICs). They can provide {{a wide range of}} operational frequencies with a minimal number of external components. Relaxation oscillator VCOs can have three topologies: 1) grounded-capacitor VCOs, 2) emitter-coupled VCOs, and 3) delay-based ring VCOs. The first two of these types operate similarly. The time spent in each state depends on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> or discharge of a capacitor. The delay-based ring VCO operates somewhat differently however. For this type, the gain stages are connected in a ring. The output frequency is then a function of the delay in each stage.|$|E
50|$|Diode opto-isolators employ LEDs {{as sources}} of light and silicon {{photodiode}}s as sensors. When the photodiode is reverse-biased with an external voltage source, incoming light increases the reverse current flowing through the diode. The diode itself does not generate energy; it modulates the flow of energy from an external source. This mode of operation is called photoconductive mode. Alternatively, {{in the absence of}} external bias the diode converts the energy of light into electric energy by charging its terminals to a voltage of up to 0.7 V. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> is proportional to the intensity of incoming light. The energy is harvested by draining the charge through an external high-impedance path; the ratio of current transfer can reach 0.2%. This mode of operation is called photovoltaic mode.|$|E
5000|$|The Regulation {{requires}} direct- {{and indirect}} mortgage sellers {{to provide the}} customer with a European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS), in which the key features and risks of the mortgage contract are disclosed to the customer before contract closure. [...] In many countries there already exists a paper which discloses information {{with regards to the}} mortgage contract, but the ESIS extends and clarifies this information. Included in the ESIS is a right of a seven-day reflection period, and information regarding the potential impact of interest rate changes. Furthermore, the ESIS sets out an Annual Percentage <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Charge</b> (APRC) and provides example monthly payments in the case the interest rate rises to the highest level of the past 20 years. The ESIS must be issued in good time before the conclusion of the credit agreement, to enable the customer to compare and reflect on the mortgage contract and enable the customer to ask for third party advise.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe compute {{characteristic}} (quasinormal) frequencies {{corresponding to}} decay <b>of</b> a massive <b>charged</b> scalar field in a Reissnerâ€“Nordstrom black hole background.

In the limit of the extremal black hole the damping <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> and neutral perturbations coincides. Possible connection of this with the critical collapse in a massive scalar electrodynamics is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A general {{technique}} to investigate <b>charge</b> storage characteristics <b>of</b> conducting polymer films has been developed. A redox reaction is conducted on a polymer film on a rotating disk electrode under potentiostatic condition {{so that the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> the film equals the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> removal <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> by the reaction. In an experiment on polyaniline film deposited on platinum substrate, using Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + in HCl as the redox system, the voltammogram shows five distinct linear segments (bands) with discontinuity in the slope at specific transition potentials. These bands {{are the same as}} those indicated by ESR/Raman spectroscopy with comparable transition potentials. From the dependence of the slopes of the bands on concentration of ferrous and ferric ions, it was possible to estimate the energies <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> carrier in different bands. It is shown that the charge storage in the film is capacitive...|$|R
