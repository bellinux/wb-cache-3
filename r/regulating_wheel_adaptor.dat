50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} {{is a form}} of grinding {{where there}} is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its rotary speed. The workblade is angled slightly towards the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel,</b> with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. Centerless grinding is much easier to combine with automatic loading procedures than centered grinding; throughfeed grinding, where the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.|$|R

A fuzzy logic approach is appealing for traction control because of the non-linearities and time-varying uncertainties in traction control systems.

The other fuzzy logic controller <b>regulates</b> <b>wheel</b> slip at any desired value.

An experimental apparatus has been designed and constructed. Tests involving the rotational driving of a workpiece were then conducted on the apparatus, which showed that the workpiece rotational speed depended on the AC voltage and its frequency.

50|$|In {{centerless}} grinding, {{the workpiece}} is held between two wheels, rotating {{in the same}} direction at different speeds, and a workholding platform. One wheel, known as the grinding wheel (stationary wheel in the diagram), is on a fixed axis and rotates such that the force applied to the workpiece is directed downward, against the workholding platform. This wheel usually performs the grinding action by having a higher tangential speed than the workpiece at the point of contact. The other wheel, known as the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> (moving wheel in the diagram), is movable. This wheel is positioned to apply lateral pressure to the workpiece, and usually has either a very rough or rubber-bonded abrasive to trap the workpiece.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation method for investigating the form generation mechanism in the centerless grinding process is described. In this work, instantaneous {{change of the}} apparent depth of cut during grinding was modeled using absolute coordinate systems. The result of the simulation was not affected by the coordinate system (the location of the reference circle center and the radius of the reference circle). Also, analytical models of the interference phenomena at the contact points were developed to investigate their effects on the roundness profile of a centerless ground workpiece. In order to {{study the effects of}} grinding variables on grinding mechanism, details of the machining factor were formulated using such process variables as grinding wheel speed, <b>wheel</b> specification, <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> speed, dressing condition, etc. A least squares contact line was formulated to include the effect of workpiece orientation relative to the grinding machine. Using these formulas, 2 -D, 3 -D infeed, and 3 -D through-feed centerless grinding simulation models were developed. For the 3 -D through-feed simulation model, grinding forces of previous and/or following workpieces were assumed {{as a function of the}} current workpiece location. ^ The experiments and {{computer simulation}}s were carried out using three types of cylindrical workpiece shapes with varying flat length. To validate these models, simulation results were compared with the experimental results. It was found that the number of lobes and the angular displacement of peaks and corresponding valleys of the simulation results were identical with those of the roundness profiles of ground workpieces. Through 2 -D simulation, it was verified that grinding wheel interference is affected not only by geometry but also by machine elasticity. 3 -D simulation results revealed that the effect of flat end is propagated to the opposite end through workpiece reorientation. It was shown that the inherent tapering error of the through-feed centerless grinding exists. The effects of the center height angle (β), the number of workpiece rotations, the <b>regulating</b> <b>wheel</b> tilt angle (φ), and the slope of the grinding wheel inlet crown on the geometric tolerance of a cylindrically centerless ground workpiece were investigated. ...|$|R

This research pointed energy efficient bearing design in a new direction. For example, tapered roller bearing designers typically specified rollers of minimum length to reduce problems associated with rolling contact.

This dissertation investigates the workpiece shape generating mechanism in the through-feed {{centerless grinding}} process. Specifically, the workpiece lobing mechanism and axial guidance through the grinding gap were studied. ^ To study the workpiece lobing mechanism, a computer simulation of the plunge centerless grinding process was developed.

The simulation correctly predicted which frequencies on the workpiece surface were more susceptible to roundness errors than others. These results were found to also be compatible with a previous linear lobing model (ZHOU 94).

40|$|Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) {{produced}} in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) has been studied extensively for its roles in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. POMC-derived peptides signal satiation and contribute to meal termination, thus individuals lacking POMC exhibit hyperphagic obesity. Neural circuits regulating feeding cross-talk extensively with other neural and endocrine pathways and therefore could affect physiological systems {{not directly related to}} feeding. However, these potential functions of ArcPOMC have not been well characterized. We generated a genetic mouse model that lacks Pomc expression specifically in Arc neurons (ArcPomc-knockout (KO)) and used these mice to identify roles for POMC in regulation of locomotor activity and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. We assessed spontaneous home cage and voluntary wheel running activity in wildtype control mice, obese ArcPomc-KO mice, and ArcPomc-KO mice weight-matched to wildtype controls by caloric restriction. Obese ArcPomc-KO mice had decreased home cage activity that was normalized by weight-matching. In contrast, both obese and weight-matched ArcPomc-KO mice exhibited less voluntary wheel running activity than controls. These results indicate that spontaneous locomotor activity is not directly regulated by ArcPomc but can decrease secondary to obesity. However, ArcPomc intrinsically <b>regulates</b> voluntary <b>wheel</b> running behavior, which is known to be rewarding, independently of body weight, suggesting a reward deficit in ArcPomc-KO mice. Additionally, we extensively characterized the HPA axis of ArcPomc-KO mice. Obese and weight-matched ArcPomc-KO mice developed adrenocortical hypertrophy, and obese ArcPomc-KO mice had elevated stress hormones as well as increased expression of hypothalamic and pituitary HPA axis related genes. We identified hypothalamic arginine vasopressin as a potential downstream effector of this dysregulation, but ArcPomc-KO mice crossed with vasopressin receptor 1 b (Avpr 1 b) -KO mice did not exhibit a rescued HPA phenotype. Therefore, we conclude that ArcPomc tonically inhibits the HPA axis and vasopressin signaling is not necessary for the hyperactivity of the axis caused by POMC-deficiency. Collectively, we have shown that in addition to its role in feeding behavior, ArcPOMC also regulates locomotor activity levels and the HPA stress axis. Both of these pathways are involved in body weight adjustment and may be additional mechanisms whereby POMC deficiency leads to obesity...|$|R
40|$|These {{experiments}} {{explore a}} wheel running work-response function {{with the goal}} of paralleling the drug magnitude-response (dose-response) function, as a way of measuring the value of running for rats. Friction levels were manipulated by varying the amount of weight applied to running wheels. Experiment 1 examined how male running patterns changed in response to weights applied on alternate days and calculated the work-response scores for each weight. Experiment 2 explored how male running changed when weights were applied for only a portion of the night, on an alternate night schedule. Experiments 3 and 4 replicated the procedures used in Experiments 1 and 2 with females. The results demonstrated that, whereas baseline running gradually decreased over days, it decreased further as the weights were increased for both males and females. However, the actual work expended running first increased then decreased as the weights increased. When the weights were applied and increased during the first few hours of the night, running decreased. After the weights were removed, male rats compensated by running more during the remaining friction-free hours of the night, however female rats did not show the same compensatory response pattern as the males. It is suggested that in males, the total distance traveled in the wheel rather than the total amount of work expended may more accurately represent what male rats <b>regulate</b> in their <b>wheel</b> running, which {{does not appear to be}} the case in females.
