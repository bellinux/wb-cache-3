40|$|Typically, {{inspiration}} {{is preferred}} when xraying the lungs. The x-ray technologist will ask {{a patient to}} be still and {{to take a deep}} breath and to hold it. This not only reduces the possibility of a blurred image but also enhances the quality of the image since air-filled lungs are easier to see on x-ray film. However, inspiration causes low density in the inner part of lung field. That means that ribs in the inner part of lung field have lower density than the other parts nearer to the border of the lung field. That is why edge detection algorithms often fail to detect ribs. Therefore to make rib edges clear we try to produce an expiration lung field using a 'hemi-elliptical cavity. ' Based on the expiration lung field, we extract the rib edges using canny edge detector and a new connectivity method, called ' 4 way with 10 -neighbors connectivity' to detect clavicle and <b>rib</b> <b>edge</b> candidates. Once the edge candidates are formed, our system selects the best candidates using knowledge-based constraints such as a gradient, length and location. The edges can be paired and labeled as superior <b>rib</b> <b>edge</b> and inferior <b>rib</b> <b>edge.</b> Then the system uses the clavicle, which is obtained in a same method for the <b>rib</b> <b>edge</b> detection, as a landmark to label all detected ribs...|$|E

The intrinsic information of rib structures is eliminated and a higher image quality for the diagnosis of pulmonal structures is achieved. An essential task of the algorithm is the robust detection of the rib borders. In this paper we introduce three algorithms to perform this task. The first, introduced by Schreckenberg and Joswig, 1 uses the hough transform to find rib borders, the second one uses a synergetic classifier to estimate the matching between <b>rib</b> <b>edge</b> templates and rib borders. The last one, the sinking lead algorithm, gives the best classification results by performing a matched template technique in combination with partial methods from the former two algorithms.

40|$|Silicon-based optical phase {{modulators}} were studied. Two {{and three}} terminal devices integrated into rib waveguides were interrogated using device physics and optical modelling software packages. The device performance benchmarks are the drive current {{required to achieve}} a given phase shift and the device transient rise and fall times. The slower of the two provides the device operating bandwidth. Among the n-p-n devices with a silicon overlayer thickness of 0. 98 mum studied, the most efficient device is one with constant doping profiles at a concentration of 1020 atoms/cm 3 in each contact, the side dopant profiles extended {{right up to the}} buried oxide and are located close to the <b>rib</b> <b>edge.</b> This device was predicted to require a pi-phase shift current of 0. 5 mA with rise and fall times of 0. 3 ns and 0. 12 ns respectively, which gives an operating bandwidth of approximately 1. 7 GHz. Optimised side dopants for the n-p-n and p-n-p variants were developed. An alternative theoretical voltage waveform was developed which is predicted to increase nominal operating bandwidth tremendously. A n-p-p device excited by this waveform obtained operating bandwidth in excess of 40 GHz. At the time this work was carried out, this was the fastest prediction for a silicon-based optical phase modulator. It is concluded that silicon-based modulators studied in this work is capable of achieving MHz and GHz modulation. Numerous variants of the two most promising device designs were fabricated. They are the n-p-n and p-n-p variants. Critical fabrication aspects such as rib spacer thickness, doping, and annealing temperatures were studied. Modelling and experimental results are in agreement. This suggests that the additional theoretical results for devices not fabricated are reliable. A large number of the devices failed optically and a methodological failure analysis method was established. Failure analysis observations were consistent with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) {{is rapidly}} {{emerging}} as a non-invasive treatment for soft tissue tumours. HIFU is used to generate small regions of high intensity sound at the focus of geometrically or electronically focused transducers. These intensities are used to raise the tissue temperature rapidly to form a region of coagulative necrosis, known as a lesion. Clinical use of HIFU {{has shown that the}} technique is safe and is capable of ablating tumours. However, the technique {{is still in its infancy}} and, consequently, appropriate methods of treatment delivery, planning and monitoring are under development. In this thesis, ways ofimproving clinical treatment delivery are investigated. During HIFU treatments of the liver, it is desirable to avoid rib exposure. The high ultrasound absorption in bone means that it can heat up, leading to damage of the periosteum and overlying skin. A solution to this problem has been identified as the use a linearly segmented transducer with 10 independent elements. The acoustic field from a number of active drive element configurations of the transducer was investigated with theoretical modelling. In corresponding experiments, the acoustic field and the temperature rise on a rib phantom were measured. A novel method of visualising the heating pattern i~ the beam, namely using a temperature sensitive thermo-chromic liquid crystal, was investigated. The ability to shape the HIFU beam to spare the ribs was demonstrated, allowing the sound axis to be directed approximately a centimetre closer to the <b>rib</b> <b>edge.</b> The use of a diagnostic ultrasound scanner for measurements of ultrasound attenuation of tissue (BAE) and for thermometry (BTl) in HIFU using ultrasound backscatter is investigated. Methods of data acquisition and processing for both techniques are described together with their limitations. These techniques were used to determine the correct HIFU drive power in a lesioning experiment aiming to improve reproducibility of single lesion formation in an ex-vivo liver tissue model. Some evidence that BAE and BTl can be used as tools to improve the reproducibility of single lesion formation has been obtainedwith a reduction in the variance oflesion size and shape. In conclusion, a number of potential ways of improving HIFU treatment delivery have been demonstrated. The techniques for rib sparing, BAE and BTl are ready to be tested in a situation more representative of the clinical scenario, where multiple tissue layers, backscatter inhomogeneity and tissue motion are likely to pose more significant limits on their application.

40|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the development of active silicon opto-electronic devices over the last 15 years. This is primarily due to the widely accepted belief that the free carrier effect is the most efficient optical modulation and switching mechanism in silicon, along with the potential advantages of combining optical and electronic devices onto a single silicon substrate rather than using discrete components. A study of the scientific literature shows that whilst numerous devices have been reported, few have been seriously optimised. In the literature, devices have consisted primarily of two or three terminal devices based around a rib waveguide. The three terminal devices are fewer in number but generally perform better. Conversely, two terminal devices have received a little more attention in terms of producing faster devices. Therefore, this work provides an in depth analysis of the performance of p+-i-n+ diodes when configured as optical modulators, with the aim of improving both the device DC and transient performance characteristics. The primary DC performance characteristic is the current required to achieve a given phase change and the transient performance characteristics are measured in terms of the device rise and fall times. These characteristics have been studied with variations in geometrical and fabrication based parameters such as the position and doping concentration of the contacts, the aspect ratio of the rib waveguides, and the overall dimensions. The key result from the modelling is that the most efficient multi-micron size device is a three terminal device with high doping concentration, constant doping profiles and large diffusion depth doped regions located close to the <b>rib</b> <b>edge.</b> A theoretical device of this nature required a current of only 2. 7 mA for a ? radian phase shift with rise and fall times of 22 ns and 2 ns respectively. The best previously achieved was a device which theoretically required 4 mA for a ? radian phase shift. Additionally, by including isolation trenches on either side of the doped regions the DC performance characteristics can be further improved by up to 74 %. There are also advantages in reducing the dimensions of the devices to 1 micron or less. At these dimensions the DC and transient performance characteristics are improved by more than a further order of magnitude, hence requiring fractions of 1 mA for a ? radian phase shift. Two of the most promising designs have been fabricated and experimentally analysed. Due to fabrication constraints the most efficient device was not fabricated. However, both two and three terminal devices were fabricated. The best device tested experimentally was a three terminal device that required a current of 14 mA for a ? phase shift. The modelling and experimental results agree well therefore validating the modelling. Therefore we can be confident that the additional theoretical results for devices that could not be fabricated are reliable, and hence significant further improvements could be made by fabricating these devices. Likely roles for these types of devices are medium bandwidth modulators/switches and a variety of sensor applications...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} experimental {{investigations of}} local heat transfer in a rectangular channel (aspect ratio AR = 4) with continuous transverse ribs {{as well as}} an obstacle. Liquid crystal thermography (LCT) is employed to obtain the temperature fields in the heat transfer experiments. The liquid crystal applied here has a red start at 35 °C and a bandwidth of 1 °C. The work consists of (1) periodic ribs, (2) obstacle (3) integration of ribs with an obstacle. (1) The effect of (a) rib-pitch-to rib height ratio (p/e), and (b) rib height-to-channel hydraulic diameter ratio (e/Dh) on the local heat transfer in the first inter-rib regions (i. e., where thermal field is not yet periodically fully developed) are investigated. The Reynolds number, based on the channel hydraulic diameter, has the values 57000, 89000, and 127000. Concerning (a) with e/Dh = 0. 078, the particular emphasis is on large p/e ratios, i. e., 10, 20 and 30, in the first inter-rib regions. It is conjectured that the main flow for all studied p/e ratios separates {{at the edge of the}} first rib and reattaches in the first inter-rib region at a distance of about 9 - 10 e from the upstream <b>rib</b> <b>edge,</b> where a local maximum of the Nu number occurs. This distance is larger than that typically occurring in the periodically fully developed region. This may negatively affect the heat transfer in the entrance region if the p/e ratio is less than 10. Concerning (b), e/Dh = 0. 039 and 0. 078 have been selected for p/e = 10 and 20. The significant effect of the small blockage ratio on the local Nu number in the first inter-rib regions is found remarkable compared to the high blockage ratio. This effect is explained by the small thickness of the boundary layer in the developing region and it is conjectured that the core flow is strongly disturbed by the presence of the rib with high blockage ratio. (2) The end-wall heat transfer around a single obstacle is studied. The obstacle has a rectangular cross-section and blocks the whole height of the channel. The Reynolds number, based on the spanwise width of the obstacle, has the values 35600, 55600, and 79400. The appearance of a double peak of locally high heat transfer in the upstream junction indicates the existence of more than one vortex. As the Reynolds number increased, this double peak merged to a single peak. The Reynolds number effect is expected to affect the strength of the vortices demonstrated by higher local heat transfer from Reynolds number 35600 to 79400. The size of wake region with low heat transfer is shrinking by increasing the Reynolds numbers. (3) The aim is to control the heat transfer around an obstacle with the aid of a rib. The rib is positioned in (a) upstream region, and (b) downstream region of the obstacle. The Reynolds number varies between 35600 and 55600. In this study, the spacing between the rib and the obstacle is of primary importance. Concerning (a), the spacing S is normalized by the spanwise width of the obstacle and had values 1. 25 d and 0. 625 d. The effect of e/Dh is also of concern. The e/Dh varies between 0. 039 and 0. 078. It is found that the local heat transfer especially in the upstream region was strongly affected by the S/d and e/Dh. In the downstream region, the local heat transfer was more affected by the Reynolds number than S/d and e/Dh. Concerning (b) the spacing between the rib and the obstacle had the value 1. 25 d. It is shown that the local heat transfer in the upstream region of the obstacle remained unaffected by the presence of the rib for the considered rib heights and Reynolds numbers. In the downstream region of the obstacle, the heat transfer pattern was substantially modified by the presence of the rib for two considered rib height. In the upstream region of the rib, the small rib height presents higher local heat transfer than the large rib height for the considered Reynolds numbers. A larger region of high transfer in the downstream area of the rib reflects a stronger effect on the reattachment process caused by the large rib height...|$|E

40|$|Scoliosis is a 3 D {{deformity}} of {{the spine}} and rib cage. Extensive validation of 3 D reconstruction methods {{of the spine}} from biplanar radiography has already been published. In this article, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the rib cage, using the same biplanar views as for the 3 D reconstruction of the spine, to allow clinical assessment of whole trunk deformities.

In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex <b>ribs</b> <b>edged</b> with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood.

The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control.
