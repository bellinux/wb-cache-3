5|$|<b>Ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{has been}} shown to be {{inhibited}} by the antimetabolite fluorouracil, a drug used in the chemotherapy of cancer. It is one of the most successful drugs for treating solid tumors. In yeast cells treated with fluorouracil, defects were found in the processing of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> identical to those seen when the activity of the exosome was blocked by molecular biological strategies. Lack of correct <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> processing is lethal to cells, explaining the antimetabolic effect of the drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladogram}} {{of relationships}} within the order {{is based on}} a 2002 molecular phylogeny using <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA,</b> a nuclear elongation factor gene, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. The Annulipalpia and Integripalpia are clades, but the relationships within the Spicipalpia are unclear.|$|E

5|$|A {{major step}} forward {{in the study of}} {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of 16S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA,</b> and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the three-domain system.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} the sequences of the D1/D2 regions of the large subunit <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> gene and the internal transcribed spacer regions of rRNA, T.mesenterica is most closely related to T.coalescens, T.tropica, and T.brasiliensis. This analysis included 20 of the estimated 120 Tremella species.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{sequencing}} {{begins with}} a culture of identical cells {{as a source of}} DNA. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> sequences which are relatively short, often conserved within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species, indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> (rRNA) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample. Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed {{that the vast majority of}} microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.|$|E
40|$|Cucumis sativus L. {{seeds and}} 5 -day-old dark-grown cotyledons contain 25 and 18 S cytoplasmic <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNAs</b> as main components. The major {{increase}} in nucleic acid content in both green and etiolated cotyledons occurs between days 5 and 7 of germination. This increase {{is characterized by}} an important synthesis of 23 and 16 S plastid (chloroplast and proplastid) <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Proplastid RNA synthesis appears to continue {{for a longer period}} in the dark-grown cotyledons, despite a total RNA content considerably less than in the light-grown cotyledons...|$|R

5|$|A typical protein-coding gene {{is first}} copied into RNA as an {{intermediate}} {{in the manufacture of}} the final protein product. In other cases, the RNA molecules are the actual functional products, as in the synthesis of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> and transfer RNA. Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has a regulatory role. The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as non-coding RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|Some RNA {{molecules}} play {{an active}} role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the length}} of RNA chain, RNA {{includes}} small RNA and long RNA. Usually, small RNAs are shorter than 200nt in length, and long RNAs are greater than 200nt long. Long RNAs, also called large RNAs, mainly include long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA. Small RNAs mainly include 5.8S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> (rRNA), 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) and small rDNA-derived RNA (srRNA).|$|E

25|$|Small {{nucleolar}} RNAs (snoRNAs) are a {{class of}} small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other <b>RNAs,</b> mainly <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNAs,</b> transfer RNAs and small nuclear RNAs. There are two main classes of snoRNA, the C/D box snoRNAs, which are associated with methylation, and the H/ACA box snoRNAs, which are associated with pseudouridylation.|$|R

5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA.</b> This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} evidence from ITS and large subunit <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa belongs in the Tricholomataceae family. However, the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to Phaeolepiota aurea, a species of unclear status in the Agaricales, and it confirms that L.decorosa does not belong in the family Agaricaceae. According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
25|$|Small subunit <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{in several}} Chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts lack motifs for shine-dalgarno {{sequence}} recognition, {{which is considered}} essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the mitochondrial genome of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, has been determined. The circular genome consisting of 16, 644 base pairs encodes thirteen proteins, the 12 S and 16 S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNAs,</b> and 22 transfer RNAs. These genes are ordered {{in the same way}} as most other vertebrates. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNAs</b> and the thirteen protein-coding genes were compared with those of other salmonids such as Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmo salar, Salvelinus fontinalis, Salvelinus alpinus and Coregonus lavaretus. The sequence features of the control region (D-loop), the origin of L-strand replication and a putative peptide codified by the 16 S mitochondrial RNA are described and discussed...|$|R
5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is one of}} 19 species in the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of spiny {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original spiny lobster genus, Palinurus. Its closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> genes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 100 other {{naturally}} occurring modified nucleosides. The greatest structural diversity of modifications {{can be found in}} tRNA, while pseudouridine and nucleosides with 2'-O-methylribose often present in rRNA are the most common. The specific roles of many of these modifications in RNA are not fully understood. However, it is notable that, in <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA,</b> many of the post-transcriptional modifications occur in highly functional regions, such as the peptidyl transferase center and the subunit interface, implying that they are important for normal function.|$|E
5|$|These {{so-called}} non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded {{by their}} own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> (rRNA), {{both of which are}} involved in the process of translation. There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Vincent Demoulin {{described}} the species Lycoperdon americanum {{on the basis}} of a specimen found in North Carolina. Although he believed it to be a unique species, several authors consider it synonymous with L.echinatum. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence and secondary structure of the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> (rRNA) genes coding for the internal transcribed spacer units suggests that Lycoperdon echinatum forms a clade with the puffball genus Handkea, separate from the type species of Lycoperdon, Lycoperdon perlatum. In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison, L.echinatum formed a clade with L.mammiforme, L.foetidum, and Bovistella radicata (now known as Lycoperdon radicatum), but separate from L.pyriforme.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} exosome {{contains}} a six-membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex {{is present in the}} cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus, although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to substrates specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include messenger RNA, <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA,</b> and many species of small RNAs. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the 3′ end in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.|$|E
5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNA</b> (rRNA) operons, and 86 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9 -THC) on the cellular levels of histone mRNAs and <b>ribosomal</b> <b>RNAs</b> was examined in several normal and transformed human cell lines [...] HeLa S 3 cells, WI- 38 human diploid fibroblasts, SV 40 -transformed WI- 38 cells, and A 549 lung carcinoma cells.
