40|$|Non-transparency {{is a term}} {{given in}} this paper {{to a set of}} {{government}} policies that increase the risk and uncertainty faced by economic actors foreign investors. This increase in risk and uncertainty stems from the presence of bribery and corruption, unstable economic policies, weak and poorly enforced property rights, and inefficient government institutions. Our empirical analysis shows that the degree of non-transparency {{is an important factor in}} a country's attractiveness to foreign investors. High levels of non-transparency can greatly retard the amount of foreign investment that a country might otherwise expect. The simulation exercise presented in the statistical part of this paper reveals that on average a country could expect 40 percent increase in FDI from a one point increase in their transparency <b>ranking.</b> <b>Pari</b> <b>passu,</b> non-transparent policies translate into lower levels of FDI and hence lower levels of welfare and efficiency in the host country's economy. A nation that takes steps to increase the degree of transparency in its policies and institutions could expect significant increases in the level of foreign investment into their country. This increased investment translates into more resources, which in turn increases social welfare and economic efficiency...|$|R
500|$|Where {{funds are}} mixed with those of another trust, or mixed with the funds of an [...] "innocent volunteer", certain general {{principles}} apply. As laid out in Re Diplock, the principle applied is that the claimant's entitlement <b>ranks</b> <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> {{to that of the}} volunteer; each has an equal claim to their funds. Whether the fund decreases or increases in value, each party can claim a percentage equal to their contribution. The problem here comes if the mixed funds are used in unequal chunks to acquire other property. The long-standing rule is that established in Clayton's Case; that the money deposited first is deemed to be spent on the first property purchased. The problem with this is that if the first property becomes less valuable than the second property purchased, the first claimant loses some of their money while the second claimant is able to claim their money in its entirety. The alternate approach is the previously mentioned <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> idea; whatever the total property is worth, the claimants get a share proportionate to their input, without assuming that the first claimant's money is tied to the first property purchased and the second claimant's money to the second property. In Barlow Clowes International v Vaughan, the Court of Appeal applied a similar set of principles, holding that the size of the contribution and the amount of time the money was part of the mixed fund were the factors to be considered.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{in various}} jurisdictions and circumstances, {{nominally}} [...] "senior" [...] debt may not <b>rank</b> <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> {{with all other}} senior obligations. For example, in the 2008 Washington Mutual Bank seizure, all assets and most (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank's liabilities were assumed by JPMorgan Chase. However other debt claims, including unsecured senior debt, were not. By doing this, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) effectively subordinated the unsecured senior debt to depositors, thereby fully protecting depositors while also eliminating any potential deposit insurance liability to the FDIC itself. In this and similar cases, specific regulatory and oversight powers can lead to senior lenders being subordinated in potentially unexpected ways.|$|E

40|$|It can be {{said that}} the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause mistakenly {{migrated}} from secured private lending to unsecured sovereign lending. Once rooted in unsecured sovereign lending instruments it faced certain provisions like the ones in Spain or the Philippines that can allow a creditor to create a preference positioning itself in a better position vis-a-vis other creditors, and become a 'must have' provision in this type of debt instruments. Then, <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clauses stayed in unsecured debt instruments due to the fear of the earmarking revenues or the risk of the sovereign preferring a group of creditors over another. These two fears were tackled by an expanded negative pledge clause and the Libra and Allied Bank cases. Therefore, if a proper due diligence was conducted {{there was no need to}} have a <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause unless in exceptional circumstances alike the ones of Spain or the Philippines. Unfortunately, a misguided interpretation of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause in the Elliot case opened the door to litigation on incorrect grounds (payment interpretation or broad interpretation of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause). It was an 'aberration', but one that caused furore. The problem was that in Elliot there was no breach of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause, just a wrong understanding of its meaning. In the case of Argentina the whole story could be different since it can be correctly interpreted as a breach of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause in its ranking or narrow form. The importance of this article lies precisely in explaining the different interpretations of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause in sovereign debt instruments in context to provide a clear understanding of the issue for the sake of the international capital markets...|$|R

We {{show that in}} the presence of asymmetric information on a sovereign borrower’s ability to pay, an ambiguous <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause gives rise to a collective action problem among creditors that can reduce sovereign moral hazard. By varying the clause ambiguity, parties can induce an (ex ante) optimal probability of costly renegotiation breakdown resulting from creditors’failure to coordinate. As information asymmetry decreases, a <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause becomes a coarser instrument for configuring creditors’incentives and thereby resolving moral hazard...|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{federal court}} rulings against Argentina since 2012 {{have turned the}} <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause in {{sovereign}} bond contracts into the most promising debt collection tool against immune governments {{since the days of}} gunboat diplomacy. The large literature on <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> (“equal step” in Latin) assumes that the clause had not been used for enforcement before the late 1990 s, and that it was first construed by a Belgian court in a case against Peru in the year 2000. The Belgian decision was criticized for wrongly concluding that <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> promised ratable payment to all holders of Peru’s external debt. A decade later, the U. S. courts adopted the same interpretation against Argentina, despite interventions by the United States, Brazil, France, Mexico and a slew of experts. The case is now caught up in litigation around the world involving bondholders, trustees, payment and clearing systems. Debates about the meaning of <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> have so far been drawn on bond language, contract practices and diplomatic statements, not judicial interpretation. This essay reports on a once-famous lawsuit in Swiss courts, brought by Swedish holders of German government bonds against the Bank for International Settlements as bond trustee in 1935. The Swedish creditors claimed that the BIS violated the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause when it paid them nominal value, while it indexed payments to other bondholders to the value of gold. Three Swiss courts concluded that such payment discrimination was a breach of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause; one even suggested that it could give rise to inter-creditor remedies. However, all three courts held against the bondholders {{on the grounds that the}} trustee’s duties in this case were limited to following Germany’s instructions. Subsequent commentators criticized the Swiss courts’ views of the trustee’s role, but did not disagree with its reading of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause. The case has featured prominently in 20 th century sovereign debt literature, but the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> angle appears to have been forgotten...|$|R

As a result, the holdouts realized that while Argentina could not force the holdouts to accept the terms in the 2005 or 2010 restructurings, NML could use the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause to force Argentina to choose between paying all its bondholders (including NML) or none of them.|$|R

40|$|The rise of {{vulture fund}} {{investing}} in sovereign bonds has created additional hurdles to successful restructuring in an already fragile ad hoc process. Recent litigation in NML Capital, Ltd. v. Argentina has proven courts’ willingness to utilize powers of equity {{to enforce a}} ratable payment interpretation of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause—the equal treatment provision commonly found in sovereign bond contracts—creating much uncertainty on how the ruling will affect future restructuring efforts. By looking to the tension in interpretations of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause, discrepancies in remedial relief awarded, and international institutions’ proposed solutions, this Note analyzes {{the role of the}} <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause as a tool for holdout creditors to disrupt restructurings. This Note argues for a contractual solution targeted at preventing vulture fund investors from access to <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> injunctive relief coupled with creative restructuring strategies for outstanding bonds awaiting maturity. This resolution seeks to retain some protection for traditional holdout creditors while disincentivizing investments made with intent to derail restructurings from the start. Unlike debtors in the domestic bankruptcy system, sovereigns have no overarching mechanism to facilitate a successful restructuring when their debt burden becomes unsustainable. Using the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause as a means to enjoin payment to restructured bondholders leaves sovereign debtors with little recourse but to cede to the demands of holdout creditors and can have a devastating long-term impact on the sovereign’s capacity to rebuild debt sustainability. On the other hand, removing <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> injunctive relief strips holdout creditors of a valuable enforcement mechanism and can leave sovereigns unrestrained. This Note balances these concerns by advocating for a solution that diminishes vulture creditor leverage that can obstruct a restructuring, while otherwise preserving creditor rights against unfair or coercive exchange terms...|$|R

40|$|In October 2000 a {{hedge fund}} holding an unpaid debt claim won an {{enormous}} victory against the debtor, the Republic of Peru, through an opportunistic interpretation of the common <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause by a Brussels court. This development was met by charges from policy makers and practitioners that the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision (its novel interpretation of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause) {{would lead to a}} dramatic increase in the risks of holdout litigation faced by sovereign debtors. Over the ensuing years, multiple reform solutions were proposed including the revision of certain contractual terms, the filing of amicus briefs in a key case, and the imposition of an international bankruptcy regime for sovereigns. The question, looking back, that this Article empirically investigates is whether the capital markets actually perceived a significant increase in risk {{at the time of the}} October 2000 Brussels court decision. Equally important is whether markets discriminate among competing versions of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause based on their relative risks for holdouts. And, to the extent the markets did react to the increase in legal risk, did any of the antidotes that were implemented to reduce the supposed increased holdout risk work? We offer evidence that bond prices did respond to this legal shock, that markets do discriminate based on the relative holdout risk posed by differing forms of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> clause, and provide surprising evidence regarding the efficacy of the government-sponsored antidote, the advent of collective action clauses...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> rule in English law. That rule, {{commonly}} understood, provides for equal (or pro rata) treatment of creditors belonging to the same class. The rule has been developed through both legislative and judicial activities over a long passage of legal history. This thesis will analyse the construct given to this rule by both legislators and judges, particularly, {{with reference to the}} extent it has been adapted {{to meet the needs of}} modern insolvency law. Such a perspective is especially acute in the light of recent reforms to the position of unsecured creditors introduced by the Enterprise Act 2002. The effects of the current financial downturn have furthermore focused attention on insolvency law from the perspective of corporate rescue or the treatment of creditors, and the increasingly global nature of commerce has meant that different jurisdictions face similar challenges in the enforcement of their insolvency laws. This work engages in a doctrinal study which contrasts the conception of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> rule which is widely known and applied (though subject to criticism) with the actual operation of the rule in a private law and public policy context. Accordingly, the development of the rule is traced from its origins to its present application. An effort is made to determine the extent to which the judicial model of <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> is substantiated in practice and commercial realities. It is argued that this model can be distinguished from the manner in which the rule actually applies in the context of managing the relationship between unsecured creditors within their class, and in the promotion of wider social interests. Regard is made of developments in insolvency law which may have diminished the view of the rules of insolvency distribution as an indicator of the social values of a legal system. The manifestation of the rule in ‘international insolvencies’ is one such development. An examination of the advent of a more flexible approach to <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> in international insolvencies would thus be necessary. It will be shown that a revised construct of <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> which more strongly accords with modern imperatives is needed. This study centres primarily on United Kingdom insolvency law, and draws on the experience of other (mainly common law) jurisdictions to demonstrate important issues in the enforcement of the <b>pari</b> <b>passu</b> rule and provide comparisons, where appropriate.
