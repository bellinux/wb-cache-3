5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his <b>rear</b> <b>tyres</b> which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell {{to the back of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his <b>rear</b> <b>tyres</b> was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E
5|$|One lap later, Daniil Kvyat {{suffered}} a heavy impact at the penultimate corner, causing another safety car period. Both Hamilton and Vettel used this to change tyres again, as did Button on lap 45. The safety car {{came back in}} {{at the end of}} lap 46, with the order being: Rosberg, Hamilton, Verstappen, Vettel, Alonso, Pérez, Button and Maldonado. At the restart, Verstappen tried to move past Hamilton but failed and was in turn overtaken by Vettel. On lap 48, Nico Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton after sliding off track due to wheelspin in his <b>rear</b> <b>tyres.</b> The German later declared that his mistake was caused by a strong gust of wind. Hamilton soon opened up a gap to his teammate, while Jenson Button moved up into sixth ahead of Alonso on lap 50, but lost the position again to Sainz {{before the end of the}} race. His teammate Alonso had been running fifth, but a loss of power from his engine moved him down the order to eventually finish eleventh. In the closing laps, Vettel edged closer to Rosberg in second, but was unable to overtake. This meant that Hamilton, who crossed the line as race winner, also took his third career championship title, with both Vettel and Rosberg now too far behind.|$|E
2500|$|There was initial {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} the accident was caused by a driver error or a deflating <b>rear</b> <b>tyre,</b> and the Lotus was investigated thoroughly by aircraft crash investigators for three weeks. Many drivers including Surtees and Brabham were convinced that the crash was caused by a deflating <b>rear</b> <b>tyre</b> and were adamant {{that it was not a}} driver error—simply because they believed Clark was not capable of making such a mistake. According to Andrew Marriott of the classic journal Motor Sport who was covering the race as a young reporter [...] "Deaths in the sport were a regular occurrence in those days, but surely someone of Clark's sublime talent and skill? People reckoned that the <b>rear</b> <b>tyre</b> had deflated, and there is another theory that the mechanical metering unit [...] on the Cosworth FVA engine had seized and caused Clark to crash." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Prost paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Félix da Costa in second, and Lopez third. D'Ambrosio and Ma Qinghua (who was unable to {{complete}} a maximum power lap) were the group's two slowest drivers. Buemi was the fastest driver in the second group, half a second ahead of teammate Turvey. Heidfeld, Sarazzin, and Evans rounded out the top five. In the third group, Vergne recorded the overall fastest time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 20.993 seconds. Di Grassi qualified 12th overall after narrowly avoiding colliding with the wall between the sixth and seventh turns. His teammate Abt was second quickest in the group, ahead of di Grassi, Maro Engel, and Duval (who went wide on his timed lap which was recorded on reduced power). Rosenqvist immediately employed his car's full power capacity and was the fastest driver in the fourth (and last) group. He finished ahead of Bird, who equalled Vergne's pace at first, but then his rear tyre made contact with the wall which cost him time. Piquet was third on his fastest lap which saw him make contact with the wall once. Robin Frijns and Adam Carroll were the slowest drivers of the fourth group; the latter locked his <b>rear</b> <b>tyres</b> and went wide at the first corner, resulting in him starting 20th (and last). At the end of the group qualifying stage, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Buemi, Bird and Piquet were the five drivers to qualify for the Super Pole round.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. Vettel set the fastest times {{in the second and third}} sessions and clinched his fourth pole position of the season with a time of 1:37.587. It was the Red Bull team's eighth pole in the season's nine races. He was joined on the grid's front row by Webber who recorded a lap time 0.075 seconds slower than Vettel. Hamilton qualified third but locked his <b>rear</b> <b>tyres</b> on his final timed heading into turn 17 and slowed down, preventing him from improving his grid position. The two Ferrari drivers were fourth and fifth (with Alonso ahead of Massa); Massa encountered slower cars which prevented him from gaining optimum tyre temperature and could not improve his fastest lap time. Kubica took sixth position and felt more movement on his Renault when he had the medium compound tyre equipped. Button had oversteer through turn 24 and made a mistake in the following corner which restricted him to seventh. Nico Hülkenberg was eighth, ahead of Williams teammate Barrichello in ninth who was affected by a brake-warm up problem. Petrov rounded out the top ten and made mistakes on his final timed lap which prevented him from getting a better starting position.|$|E
5|$|Saturday evening's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final qualifying session {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in dry weather conditions. Alonso was fastest in the first and third sessions, and clinched his second consecutive pole position with a lap time of 1:45.390 which he set on his first run of the third session. He was restricted to one timed lap in the second session because of an engine mapping problem, which meant Ferrari immediately re-programmed Alonso's engine upon discovering the issue. Alonso was joined on the front row of the grid by Vettel, who recorded a lap 0.067seconds off Alonso's pace, and felt he could have taken pole position as he misjudged a gap while following Schumacher and brushed the wall exiting the Singapore Sling chicane. Hamilton qualified third and was happy with his starting position despite losing downforce on the track's final sector while running in teammate Button's tow. Button secured fourth and pushed hard in the final session which meant he had slight damage to his <b>rear</b> <b>tyres</b> on his first run, and could not get the optimum tyre temperature in the first section on his second run. Webber managed fifth and admitted that he was struggling to find a good rhythm when driving the circuit. Barrichello qualified in sixth. The two Mercedes drivers took seventh and ninth; Rosberg ahead of Schumacher. Rosberg believed that he should have performed better in qualifying than in the practice session, as he felt the soft tyres lacked grip; Schumacher was satisfied with his qualifying performance. The Mercedes drivers were separated by Kubica, in the faster Renault, who was happy with his lap time despite his car sliding from a lack of grip. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten qualifiers.|$|E

Bottas also made a pit stop but was heavily delayed after his seat belt had undone itself and his team made {{adjustments}} to it, allowing Button into fourth and Bottas rejoined in 12th place. Hamilton began to lap faster than any other driver {{in an effort to}} move into the lead upon making his pit stop. He was asked by his team on lap 28 to make an energy recover switch to increase his car's harvesting rate but had not made a forward brake bias adjustment. When Hamilton applied his brakes for the Descida do Lado turn, his rear tyre locked and attempted to regain control of his oversteering car but went off into the corner's run-off area. He returned to the track but lost seven seconds worth of time. He made his pit stop on the same lap and emerged in second, 7.4 seconds behind teammate Rosberg. Button closed up to Kvyat and feigned a passing move on the latter but waited until the main straight to overtake Kvyat with DRS assistance heading into the Senna chicane on lap 30. Hamilton reduced the gap to teammate Rosberg to five seconds by the 35th lap despite running on blistered <b>rear</b> <b>tyres.</b> Räikkönen made a pit stop from third on the same lap but lost time after the front jack was lowered before his right-front tyre was installed and emerged in 13th behind Grosjean.|$|E
25|$|Ricciardo {{qualified}} in third, and {{was unable}} to improve on his fastest time after sliding on his final timed lap. His teammate Vettel could not use his energy recovery system {{in the first part of}} qualifying; he ran in a different mode and the yellow flags meant he was restricted to fourth. The two Ferrari cars of Alonso and Räikkönen were fifth and sixth; both had tyre warming problems. Despite his final lap being affected by the yellow flags, Vergne took seventh and his teammate Kvyat secured ninth after struggling with rear-end control and hit the barriers lining the circuit. He drove to the pit lane for a replacement nose cone. They were separated by Magnussen in eighth and Pérez rounded out the top ten after locking his tyres driving into the Novelle chicane. Hülkenberg was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 17.846 second was nearly two seconds slower than Hamilton's pace in the second session. Button was delayed by a Toro Rosso on his final lap at the Swimming Pool complex and was restricted to 12th. Bottas had front tyre heating problems and was only able to qualify 13th. Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado in the two Lotus cars took 14th and 15th with Massa unable to record a lap time. Ericsson locked his <b>rear</b> <b>tyres</b> going into Mirabeau corner and glanced Massa's car heading into the turn, causing both drivers to hit the barriers. The stewards investigated the incident and Ericsson was handed two penalty points on his super licence and was required to start from the pit lane. Gutiérrez failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, and was followed by Sauber teammate Adrian Sutil. Jules Bianchi lost half a second because of slower traffic and yellow flags and took 19th. He received a five-place grid penalty, because his team changed a problematic gearbox overnight. As a result, his Marussia teammate Chilton inherited 19th. Kamui Kobayashi used super soft compound tyres on his first two timed laps and made a front wing adjustment but {{was unable to}} improve and qualified in 20th.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a study of the}} effect of the passage of multi-axle {{harvesting}} machines on the soil physical properties. In particular, it investigates the effect of the <b>rear</b> <b>tyre</b> of a combine harvester on the amount of soil compaction subsequent to the passage of the front tyre/track. The work was conducted in controlled laboratory conditions to determine the effect of a simulated self-propelled combine harvester with a total machine weight of 30 – 33 t. This was assessed by embedding talcum powder tracer lines in the soil to measure soil displacement and soil density changes. Dry bulk density and penetrometer resistance were also measured. The results showed that the benefit of the rubber track found by Ansorge and Godwin [2007 a. The effect of tyres and a rubber track at high axle loads on soil compaction: Part 1 : Single Axle Studies. Biosystems Engineering 98 (1), 115 – 126] was maintained after the additional passage of the <b>rear</b> <b>tyre.</b> After the passage of a track the effect of <b>rear</b> <b>tyre</b> size was insignificant, but the <b>rear</b> <b>tyre</b> size had a significant influence on soil density when following a leading tyre. This was due to a higher strength layer at the soil surface created by the track which was able to withstand the load of the subsequent passes and protect the soil below from further compaction. Results similar to those found for a tracked machine were also achieved by three passes of a 900 mm section width tyre at 5 t load and 0. 5 bar inflation pressure. The track results for the 33 t machine were very similar to those of a smaller combine harvester with a total load of 11 t and similar rut width. The study confirmed the benefit of tracks with regard to soil compaction and emphasised the fact that total axle loads and machine weights are less important than how the loads are distributed to the soil...|$|R
