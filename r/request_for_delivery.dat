50|$|Mons Claudianus {{was linked}} to the river Nile by a {{traceable}} surviving Roman road marked by way-stations spaced out at one day intervals. The stones from the quarries, which were shaped in the desert, were then taken along the road to the Nile Valley for trans-shipment to Rome. Documents that were found on site referred to 12-wheeled and 4-wheeled carts, and include a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>delivery</b> of new axles. The journey would last approximately five days or longer. The way-stations, which resembled small defended 'forts', with many rooms accompanied by stabling and a water-supply, served as motels where the men and animals moving the stones could rest, eat and drink. Donkeys may have been used to transport food and water needed by men between way-stations as well as to pull the wagons; however, for larger loads it seems that both human and animal labour was used. Camels were used for communication and for the transport of food and water.The columns may have also been dragged more than 100 km from the quarry to the river on wooden sledges, though the terrain from quarry to the Nile is such that the route was downhill the entire length. They were floated by barge down the Nile River when the water level was high during the spring floods, and then transferred to vessels to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Roman port of Ostia. There, they were transferred back onto barges and pulled up the Tiber River to Rome.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{consistently}} high cesarean section rate in most developed Western {{countries has}} been attributed {{in part to}} maternal request. This controversial view demands critical analysis. This paper provides a critique of published research relating to women's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> cesarean <b>delivery.</b> Method: A search of the major databases was undertaken using the search term "cesarean section" with "maternal request,""decision-making,""patient-participation,""decision-making-patient,""patient-satisfaction,""patient-preference," and "maternal-choice. " Ten research articles examining women's preferred mode of birth were retrieved, nine of which focused on women's preference <b>for</b> cesarean <b>delivery.</b> Results: The methodology of some studies may result in overreporting women's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a cesarean <b>delivery.</b> The role of the woman's caregiver in the generation, collection, and entry of data, and the occurrence of post hoc rationalization, recall bias, and women's tendency to be less critical of their care immediately after birth are possible areas of concern. Due consideration is rarely given {{to the influence of}} obstetric risk for women who may be requesting a cesarean section or to the information women used in making their decision. Women's perceptions of their involvement in decision-making regarding cesarean section are used to draw conclusions regarding women's request. Conclusions: Few women request a cesarean section in the absence of current or previous obstetric complications. The focus on women's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> cesarean section may divert attention away from physician-led influences on the continuing high cesarean section rates.

40|$|Background: The {{influence}} of women's birth preferences on the rising cesarean section rates is uncertain and possibly changing. This review of publications relating to women's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> cesarean <b>delivery</b> explores assumptions {{related to the}} social, cultural, and political-economic contexts of maternity care and decision making. Method: A search of major databases was undertaken using the following terms: "c(a) esarean section" with "maternal request,""decision-making,""patient participation,""decision-making-patient,""patient satisfaction,""patient preference,""maternal choice,""on demand," and "consumer demand. " Seventeen papers examining women's preferred type of birth were retrieved. Results: No studies systematically examined information provided to women by health professionals to inform their decision. Some studies did not adequately acknowledge the {{influence of}} obstetric and psychological factors in relation to women's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a cesarean section. Other potential influences were poorly addressed, including {{whether or not the}} doctor advised a vaginal birth, women's access to midwifery care in pregnancy, information provision, quality of care, and cultural issues. Discussion: The psychosocial context of obstetric care reveals a power imbalance in favor of physicians. Research into decision making about cesarean section that does not account for the way care is offered, observe interactions between women and practitioners, and analyze the context of care should be interpreted with caution.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{manufacturing}} structures {{there has been an}} obvious shift from mass production to a flexible manufacturing of small lot sizes. Moreover the customers have become more and more fastidious as far as a prompt delivery, the speed of reaction and the product quality are concerned. Finally the number of variants of the products to be manufactured has clearly increased. These are the reasons why nowadays much more orders, each with smaller lot sizes, have to be machined. Due to this and to the growing interdependencies within and between the single orders or operations the complexity in the fields of planning and controlling has obviously increased. Besides it became evident, that because of the frequency of the occurring disturbances and the resulting consequences the realisation of the idea of a pure control system with open loop generally does not fulfil the given requests.

40|$|Nowadays, {{customer}} orders {{with high}} product variety in small quantities are often received and <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> timely <b>delivery.</b> However, the order-picking {{process is a}} labour-intensive and costly activity to handle those small orders separately. In such cases, small orders are often grouped into batches so that two or more orders can be served at once to increase the picking efficiency and thus reduce the travel distance. In this paper, an order-picking operations system (OPOS) is proposed to assist the formulation of an order-picking plan and batch-handling sequence. The study integrates a mathematical model and fuzzy logic technique to divide the receiving orders into batches and prioritise the batch-handling sequence for picking, respectively. Through the proposed system, the order-picking process can be managed as batches with common picking locations to minimise the travel distance, and the batch-picking sequence can be determined as well. To demonstrate {{the use of the}} system, a case study in a third-party logistics warehouse is presented, and the result shows that both the order-picking activity and labour utilisation can be better organised.

40|$|Abstract In this article, {{we use the}} principlist {{approach}} to identify, analyse and attempt to solve the ethical problem raised by a pregnant woman's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> cesarean <b>delivery</b> in absence of medical indications. We use {{two different types of}} premises: factual (facts about cesarean delivery and specifically attitudes of obstetricians as derived from the EUROBS European study) and value premises (principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice). Beneficence/non-maleficence entails physicians' responsibility to minimise harms and maximise benefits. Avoiding its inherent risks makes a prima facie case against cesarean section without medical indication. However, as vaginal delivery can have unintended consequences, {{there is a need to}} balance the somewhat dissimilar risks and benefits. The principle of autonomy poses a challenge in case of disagreement between the pregnant woman and the physician. Improved communication aimed to enable better informed choice may overcome some instances of disagreement. The principle of justice prohibits unfair discrimination, and broadly favours optimising resource utilisation. Available evidence supports vaginal birth in uncomplicated term pregnancies as the standard of care. The principlist approach offered a useful framework for ethical analysis of cesarean delivery on maternal request, identified the rights and duties of those involved, and helped reach a conclusion, although conflict at the individual level may remain challenging. </p...|$|R

The GPRS is a new GSM service, which is currently being standardized by ETSI for GSM Phase 2 C and it provides packet switched data services over GSM network resources. The role of acknowledgment procedures is to assure the delivery of packets on GPRS radio interface. This paper gives {{a brief description of}} GPRS radio interface with a special attention to the Radio Link Control and Medium Access Control (RLC/MAC) layer procedures. Particularly, the acknowledgment parameters and operations are described and their performance is evaluated. The delay introduced by acknowledgment procedures is studied analytically. In order to ameliorate the performance of RLC acknowledgment mechanism, we propose and describe a new additional hybrid FEC/ARQ mechanism, which can operate with the current one. The purpose of new mechanism is to decrease the number of control blocks used for RLC acknowledgment mechanism and thus reduces the delay <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> a packet <b>delivery.</b> After presenting the channel models used, we evaluate by simu-lation the performance of acknowledgment procedures presented in ETSI specifications and the proposed one over a stationary channel model and over a noisy wireless channel model affected by burst of errors...|$|R

40|$|For undocumented persons, federal Medicaid funds {{may only}} be used {{to provide health care}} {{services}} for life threatening emergencies or labor and <b>delivery</b> services <b>for</b> pregnant women. The Sixth Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (SOBRA) was enacted by Congress in 1986 to provide a funding stream for these services. In Kansas, eligibility for this program is processed through Social and Rehabilitative Services (SRS) area offices. If the medical event is labor and delivery, the case worker can approve SOBRA eligibility. If the event is not labor and delivery, the provider of the service receives a form to fill out and return with the medical record. The Medicaid fiscal agent, EDS, receives this information and works with the SOBRA program manager to approve or deny eligibility. In 2007, there were 576 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> non-labor and <b>delivery</b> medical expenses of which 295 were denied.

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} attitudes of obstetricians to performe a {{caesarean}} section on maternal request {{in the absence of}} medical indication. Design Cluster sampling cross-sectional survey. Setting Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) associated maternity units in eight European countries. Population Obstetricians with at least 6 months clinical experience. Methods NICU-associated maternity units were chosen by census in Luxembourg, Netherlands and Sweden and by geographically stratified random sampling in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK. An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Main outcome measures Obstetricians’ willingness to perform a caesarean section on maternal request. Results One hundred and five units and 1530 obstetricians participated in the study (response rates of 70 and 77 %, respectively). Compliance with a hypothetical woman’s <b>request</b> <b>for</b> elective caesarean section simply because it was ‘her choice’ was lowest in Spain (15 %), France (19 %) and Netherlands (22 %); highest in Germany (75 %) and UK (79 %) and intermediate in the remaining countries. Using weighted multivariate logistic regression, country of practice (P < 0. 001), fear of litigation (P = 0. 004) and working in a university-affiliated hospital (P = 0. 001) were associated with physicians’ likelihood to agree to patient’s request. The subset of female doctors with children was less likely to agree (OR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 20 – 0. 42). Conclusions The differences in obstetricians’ attitudes are not founded on concrete medical evidence.
