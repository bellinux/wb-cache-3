The pediatric health care system in Italy is part of the national health system. It is made up of 3 main levels of intervention: first access/primary care, secondary care/hospital care, and tertiary care based on specialty hospital care. This overview will also include a brief report on neonatal care, pediatric preventive health care, health service accreditation programs, and postgraduate training in pediatrics. The quality of the Italian child health care system is now considered to be in serious danger because of the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in public health caused both by the 2008 global and national economic crisis and by a reduction of the pediatric workforce as a result of progressively insufficient replacement of specialists in pediatrics...|$|E

40|$|This Final Technical Report of the {{research}} project 'Possible Employment Effects and Regional Economic Consequences of a Consistent Development of Renewable Energy Systems in North-Rhine-Westfalia', which was financially supported by the 'Arbeitsgemeinschaft Solar Nordrhein-Westfalen', shows, to what extend {{a change in the}} energy supply structures based on an intensified use of renewable energy carriers can be connected with not only positive ecological but also economical effects. The existing obstacles of responsible politicians concerning an intensified extension of innovative energy systems could be reduced, if a connection between climate protective strategies due to new energy systems and positive economical effects could be proved. Based on an ecologically orientated carbon dioxide reduction mix, which represents cost minimized extension strategies of new energy systems for the purpose of a maximum carbon dioxide reduction in North-Rhine Westphalia, total cost courses of various extension scenarios are figured out, which reflect the necessary investments and running costs during the average period of use of the planned energy systems. Based on an input-output analysis the sectoral employment effects are quantified, whereby not only future possible costs reductions, sectorally classified cost structures and expected <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> {{as a result of a}} lack of production capacities of the planned energy systems, but also additional employment effects due to decreasing imports of primary energy are considered.

40|$|In March 2007, Indonesia's {{parliament}} {{approved a}} landmark new law on investment. Law 25 / 2007 replaces separate laws on {{foreign and domestic}} investment from 1967 and 1968, and provides a single legislative framework for domestic and foreign investment.

This paper summarises the results of four sector studies undertaken to review implementation <b>of</b> the <b>investment</b> law. The purpose of the DNI is to provide certainty to investors by documenting restrictions in a single list, thereby eliminating the power of ministries to set their own rules.

Furthermore, new ministerial decrees and laws appear to bypass the list and may reflect a trend towards greater <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>investment</b> in Indonesia. ...|$|R

The decision by airport management for the provision of specific terminal facilities (TFs) may be dependent on budget <b>restrictions,</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>investment,</b> land availability and the preferences of the major customers, that is, in the case of LCTs, the low-cost carriers (LCCs). Consequently, most (but not all) LCT designs are based on the concept of a basic terminal layout with limited terminal facilities in order to reduce both construction and operating costs, a shorter construction time, acceptable service standards and minimum aircraft turnaround time. However, there are contradictions. For example, passenger expectations of terminal facilities do not always coincide with those of airline and airport management. Furthermore, a consequent low level of aeronautical revenue drives the requirement to maximise commercial revenues. The paper will conclude by suggesting guidelines for LCT development that will seek to optimise the relative aspirations of all parties concerned...|$|R

40|$|This {{is one of}} {{a series}} of {{analytic}} papers that supported the OECD’s ageing study, a “horizontal ” project in the sense that it involved a number of OECD directorates. The results of the entire project are summarised in Maintaining Prosperity in an Ageing Society, OECD 1998. In particular, Chapters II and IV of Maintaining Prosperity drew on this paper. The paper evaluates the economics <b>of</b> foreign <b>investment</b> regulation for pension funds, with a focus on developing countries, where fully-funded pension systems are being started de novo. The analysis produces three observations. First, the benefits of global portfolio diversification apply particularly to developing-country pension assets because the volatility of asset returns is high while the risk tolerance of pensioners is low. Second, <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>investment</b> by domestic pension funds can hardly be justified on grounds of financial-development arguments: cross-country evidence suggests little support for the claim that the accumulation of pension assets would provide strong externalities for financial development. Moreover, the home bias generally observed in pension fund investment should translate into sufficient potential demand for domestic financial assets so as to deepen markets and develop the institutional infrastructure. Third, a case for initial localisation requirements, however, can be derived from the fiscal costs of moving from unfunded to fully-funded pension systems if a rise in domestic interest rates due to fiscal illusion and domestic tax collection costs are important.

We first estimate the model using conventional pooled panel data estimators, based on data at five-year intervals, allowing at most intercepts to differ across regions. Then we relax the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> homogeneous slope coefficients by estimating separate time-series models for each region based on annual data, using Pesaran and Smith's (1995) mean group estimator. To account for spatial dependence, we employ the common correlated effects approach of Pesaran (2006). Our empirical analysis indicates important differences across regions in the speed of adjustment to region-specific long-run paths for the level of income per capita. Allowing for heterogeneous coefficients doubles the speed of adjustment to 22 % per year on average compared to the homogenous case, which suggests downward bias in the latter.
