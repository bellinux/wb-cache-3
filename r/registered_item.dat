50|$|Belarusian press began {{reporting}} on the Belt of Vytautas in March 2004. The belt was sold to a Russian firm which listed it with Paragis (Парагис) auction house in November 2005. The initial bid price was set at US$80,000. The item was not sold, possibly because as a <b>registered</b> <b>item</b> of cultural heritage of Belarus it cannot be transported outside of Belarus. The auction attracted further public attention and in 2006 the Supreme Court of Belarus ruled to nationalize the belt. It is now kept by the Belarusian National History Museum. It was exhibited at the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius in April-July 2015.|$|E

50|$|Purchasing a short-barreled rifle is {{accomplished}} by finding the item desired, paying for it and then arranging for {{the transfer of the}} <b>registered</b> <b>item.</b> An individual will be required to file a BATFE Form 4, Application for Tax Paid Transfer and Registration of a Firearm, and paying a $200 tax. A short-barreled rifle must be transferred by a Class 3 or a Class 2 SOT dealer if the transfer will be across state lines. For transfers within a state the transfer may be accomplished by the individuals involved though the $200 transfer tax is still due. For transfers between dealers or manufacturers the Form 3- application for tax exempt transfer is filled out. For transfers to or from govt agencies (police departments, et al.) a Form 5 is used for tax exempt transfer to dealers or individuals(there is no tax due on transfers to or from govt agencies). When an individual wishes to build a short-barreled rifle, he or she must beforehand submit a completed BATFE Form 1, Application to Make and Register a Firearm, along with $200 for payment of the making tax.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{the item}} is {{pre-paid}} with the normal postage rate {{and an additional}} charge known as a registration fee. Upon payment of this fee the sender is given a receipt, and (usually) a unique numbered registration label is affixed to the letter. As the letter travels from post office to post office and through any sorting office, {{it has to be}} signed for on a ledger. This process is completed when the letter is delivered and the receiver signs for the item. With computerization and barcode technology, much of the logging once done manually has become simpler and leads to greater options for the sender and receiver alike to access the status of their shipment via the internet.

40|$|Mental {{tasks that}} feature {{algorithmic}} processing with symbolic items are shown {{to rely on}} brain regions known for visualspatial functions. Yet, exactly how these functions may help execution of amodal tasks remains an open question. Here we propose a hypothesis for manipulation of items in working memory, which relies on <b>registering</b> <b>items</b> in a spatiallyorganized short-term memory store. Switching executive attention to items that need processing may then be embodied through shifting spatial attention towards those registry locations. We studied gaze shifts of human subjects during memory tasks {{as a proxy for}} shifts in spatial attention. Analysis of gaze shifts during sorting random sequences of five decimal digits indicates that sorting in memory elicits gaze shifts that correlate with sorting procedure. Our proposal establishes a functional relationship between general-purpose production mechanisms that support algorithmic memory tasks with amodal items, and modal systems for perception and action...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] Long-term {{effects of}} multisensory {{stimulation}} were assessed using a ‘‘Snoezelen’’ room on older residents with dementia. Thirty patients {{were randomly assigned}} to 3 groups: multisensory stimulation environment (MSSE) group, individualized activities (activity) group, and control group. The MSSE and activity groups participated in two 30 -minute weekly individualized intervention sessions over 16 weeks. Pre-, mid-, posttrial, and 8 -week follow-up behavior, mood, cognitive, and functional impairment in basic activities of daily living were <b>registered.</b> <b>Items</b> included in the physically nonaggressive behavior factor improved significantly in post- versus pretrial in the MSSE group compared to the activity group, with no significant differences between MSSE and control groups. The MSSE and activity groups demonstrated behavior improvements and higher scores on the Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory, verbal agitated behavior factor, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Nursing Home, with no significant differences between groups. The MSSE could have long-term positive effects on such neuropsychiatric symptoms in older people with dementia...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} aims to {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} style of group working in the teams’ performance in a midsize services company in Parana State. For this purpose an exploratory interview was originally performed. Then the questionnaires were applied: Working Group Style, proposed by Parker (1994) and Evaluation of a Success Team, proposed by Chang (1999). Besides the questionnaires, non-participant observations were made that intended to <b>register</b> <b>items</b> which interest the research objectives. Finally, the data analysis was carried out, making intersection with the interviews and the non-participant observations. The results identified some influences of the group working styles in the performance of teams. The different behaviors determined the degree of influence which help or not the performance of teams in this study. Two result matrices were found. The first with a relatively uniform distribution of styles, but presenting lower performance; the second showed a predominant contributor style and a higher performance of teams...|$|R
