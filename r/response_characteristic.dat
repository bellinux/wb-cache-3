25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral leishmaniasis patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune <b>response</b> <b>characteristic</b> of visceral leishmaniasis. CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral leishmaniasis a second time. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E

Two bacterial species associated with periodontitis are implicated as mediators of protein citrullination in the gums of patients with RA. Porphyromonas gingivalis expresses a bacterial PAD that is thought to citrullinate alpha-enolase. The bacterial virulence factor leukotoxin A from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was shown to induce hypercitrullination in neutrophils, and exposure to leukotoxin A is associated with ACPA and mediates the genetic risk conferred by HLA-DRB1 shared epitope alleles.|$|E

50|$|When {{performing}} FFT-based spectral measurements, traditionally {{a window}} function {{has been used}} to reduce the effects of discontinuities at the ends of the FFT buffer, but these result in spectral leakage. When generating a single frequency test signal for FFT analysis, it is possible to create the frequency such that it aligns perfectly within an FFT bin-centre frequency. These frequencies are multiples of the frequency resolution of the FFT, given by the sample rate divided by the number of sample points. This results in no spectral leakage and all the power from the signal is present in only one FFT bin. Viewed in the time domain, a sine wave will fit in the centre of an FFT bin if it has a complete number of cycles within the length of the sample buffer. Such signals can be analysed without an FFT window function provided the system is synchronous (i.e., the signal generation and analysis are using the same clock source.) It follows that a stimulus can be constructed of many sine waves (as many as there are FFT bins) and the signal can still be analysed without an FFT window function. This is called multitone analysis. The amplitude and phase of these sine components can be freely adjusted in order to construct a signal with a particular frequency <b>response</b> <b>characteristic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Burantashi {{is used as}} a food {{additive}} to barbecued meat (suya) in Nigeria, {{especially the}} Northern parts. The extracts contain the alkaloid yohimbine, an alpha-2 antagonist that has been used widely with variable success in erectile dysfunction, but the whole bark of the tree was not studied until recently. In one recent study, pure Burantashi powder obtained from a local suya vendor in Lagos, Nigeria was extracted aqueously and studied on the renal circulation of Sprague-Dawley rats. In the in vivo study, the extract code-named [...] "CCD-X", caused a rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and a rise in renal medullary blood flow (MBF). This systemic vasoconstrictor and renal medullary dilator action was attenuated separately by the endothelin -A receptor blocker - BMS-182874, ET-B blocker -BQ788, but blocked by their combination. Further, the nitric oxide inhibitor (NO), L-Nomega - nitro-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) 10 mg/kg totally inhibited the rise in medullary blood flow due to CCD-X. In vitro studies in isolated perfused kidneys (IPK) and in pressurised microvessels (PMV) confirmed the in vivo effect to cause vasoconstriction, which was inhibited by endothelin A and B antagonists. The pressor dose <b>response</b> <b>characteristic</b> of CCD-X on PMV was similar to that of endothelin-1 with EC50 close to 100 ng. It was concluded from these studies that, the aqueous extract exhibited a vasoconstrictor effect -possibly alpha-2 mediated like yohimbine. However, it possessed additional effects as an andothelin receptor A and B agonist, and also released nitric oxide. The possibility of a post-receptor cross-talk among ET-B, alpha-2 receptors and NO release was also considered. Thin layer chromatography showed that the bark is rich in sesquiterpenes, and has antifungal and antibiotic properties as well. Whether CCD-X will be useful in sickle cell disease (releasing NO) is unknown. Further basic and clinical research are needed before the effects of Burantashi can be effectively evaluated.|$|E
