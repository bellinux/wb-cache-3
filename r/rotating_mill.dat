Interactions between particles are specified by means of a pairwise potential, repulsive at short ranges and attractive at longer ranges. The exponentially decaying Morse potential is a typical choice, and is known to reproduce certain types of collective motion observed in nature, particularly aligned flocks and <b>rotating</b> <b>mills.</b> We introduce a class of interaction potentials, that we call Quasi-Morse, for which flock and <b>rotating</b> <b>mills</b> states are also observed numerically, however in that case the corresponding macroscopic equations allow for explicit solutions in terms of special functions, with coefficients that can be obtained numerically without solving the particle evolution.

40|$|Networked {{control systems}} (NCS) have {{recently}} been attracting significant attention as they are easier to monitor and modify and have reduced costs for wiring compared to the standard wired solutions. Wireless systems, on top of these traits, can overcome several physical impossibilities of wiring, i. e. they could enable installing a sensor on a <b>rotating</b> <b>mill.</b> However, wireless communication systems have evident imperfections, such as time-varying delay and packet dropout. The stochastic packet transmission process makes the critical assumptions of classical control theory appear invalid. Therefore new system theory and engineering methodology for NCSs need to be developed. PID Controllers, being simple and effective, overwhelmingly dominate the industrial controllers. It is not far-fetched to believe that, as the migration from wired systems to wireless systems continues, PID controllers will remain the dominant controllers in industry. This study, therefore investigates the application of PID controllers to wireless systems. Two particular control structures from the literature have been examined, followed by a newly developed estimation-based controller structure for networked PID control. Various simulations have been conducted on many types of plants, and the robustness of the system against packet losses and plant uncertainties, among others, have been evaluated. It {{has been shown that}} the newly proposed controller structure has a significantly better performance than earlier proposals.

40|$|Tumbling mills {{describe}} {{a class of}} mechanical systems defined by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rock that rotates around its own longitudinal axis. This class of mechanical systems is used to grind to a desired quality different material {{in at least three}} industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries (ore, clinker and metal powder). These tumbling mills range in size from small 1 ft diameter lab mills to a 40 ft diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are composed of three main interactive and interdependent elements: the mill shell, liners/lifters and charge. These three elements work together to impact energy to the mill charge through the rotational motion of the mill shell. As with any mechanical system, the natural frequency of that system is essentially dictated by its mass and stiffness. In the case of a tumbling mill, a rotating system, the natural frequency of a given mill, as seen by a stationary observer, is also a function of the rotation speed. The aim of this paper The consequence for a <b>rotating</b> <b>mill,</b> and for that matter any rotating system, is that if the natural frequency of the mill should happen to match the operating rotating speed of the mill, resonance of the mill will occur.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the project MODPULP which is a {{collaboration}} between Boliden and Luleå University of Technology. The goal is to simulate the contents of <b>rotating</b> <b>mills</b> which grind ore in the mining industry. The task of the thesis has been to develop a measurement system for measuring the power input to the contents of a mill during grinding. This has been implemented by building on an existing lab mill. The mill has been equipped with a new measurement system with associated software for data processing and calibration. The input power is calculated from the torque and rotational speed. The experiments which have been conducted show that the system is capable of measuring both the torque and rotational speed with good accuracy. Theoretical calculations and experiments suggest an uncertainty in the average torque of ± 0. 2 Nm (corresponding to about ± 2 %). For speed measurement uncertainty is negligible. In addition to being used by Boliden for ongoing laboratory experiments, the aim is also to use data from the equipment to validate simulation results from MODPULP.
