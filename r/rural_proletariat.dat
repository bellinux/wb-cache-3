25|$|Cankar {{started as}} a poet. He {{published}} his first poems already {{as a teenager in}} the liberal literary magazine Ljubljanski zvon. In Vienna, he frequented a group of young Slovene artists and authors, among whom were Oton Župančič, Fran Eller and Fran Govekar, who introduced him to the modernist currents of European literature. In 1899, Cankar published his first collection of poetry under the title Erotika. Decadentist and sensualist influences were evident and the then bishop of Ljubljana Anton Bonaventura Jeglič was so scandalized by the book that he bought all the copies and ordered their destruction. Another edition was issued three years later, but by that time Cankar had already abandoned poetry and moved to engaged literature. In 1902, he wrote his first play Za narodov blagor (For the Welfare of the Nation), which was a violent parody of the liberal nationalist elite in the Slovene Lands, especially in Carniola. The same year, he published the short novel Na klancu (On the Hill), in which he described the misery of the small <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> and the poor material and spiritual conditions of the common people. The novel, which still showed strong naturalistic features, combined with allegorical symbolism and an unusual, biblically inspired style, gained him widespread recognition.|$|E

Instead Lenin argued that the rural communes had already been wiped out by capitalism and statistics showed the degree to which feudalism was already dying in Russia. Lenin noted the growth of a national market for goods in Russia replacing local markets, the tendency to grow cash crops rather than rely on subsistence agriculture and a growth of individual rather than communal property ownership. Lenin also noted the growth of class division amongst the peasants with a growing division between a landholding rural bourgeoise and a mostly landless <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> recruited from a diminishing middle peasantry. Lenin saw a community of interest between rural and urban proletariat and the possibility of a worker peasant alliance against the representatives of capital.|$|E

5000|$|Agriculture was {{transformed}} by the Revolution. It abolished tithes owed to local churches as well as feudal dues owed to local landlords. The result hurt the tenants, who paid both higher rents and higher taxes. [...] It nationalized all church lands, as well as lands belonging to royalist enemies who went into exile. It planned to use these seized lands to finance the government by issuing assignats. With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became permanently a land of small independent farms. The <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> and nobility both {{gave way to the}} commercial farmer. [...] Cobban says the revolution [...] "bequeathed to the nation [...] "a ruling class of landowners." [...] In the cities entrepreneurship on a small scale flourished, as restrictive monopolies, privileges, barriers, rules, taxes and guilds gave way. However the British blockade severely damaged overseas trade. Overall the Revolution did not greatly change the French business system, and probably helped freeze in place the horizons of the small business owner. The typical businessman owned a small store, mill or shop, with family help and a few paid employees; large-scale industry was less common than in other industrializing nations.|$|E
40|$|The <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> {{constitute}} a substantial {{proportion of the}} global poor. Leading better lives is central to their political practices. In this paper, I aim to elaborate the political practices that attend to these aspirations, interrogations and contests.

I locate the program against the backdrop of neoliberal transformations in India. I then examine {{the ways in which the}} <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> engage with the program, even when other opportunities in the agricultural sector are available. Based on these examinations, I argue that the practices spawned by the program are to be understood as 'encroachments' into the extant social customs, norms and habits of rural India. This perspective, I contend, is more fruitful than locating the rural proletariat's engagement with the NREGA as a coping strategy or a tactic of resistance against rural elites.

40|$|Based {{on field}} {{work in the}} Zona da Mata of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, this article {{discusses}} the transformations of the sugar estates and mills of the region through {{an analysis of the}} local "feiras" and markets in which workers who had been expelled from the estates were able to buy the items for their subsistence. Besides signaling the growth of a <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat,</b> the expansion of rural markets ("feiras") revealed the emergence of smallholders who had gained a degree of autonomy inside the sugar estates. The system for provisioning the regional rural population, which had previously been controlled through the sugar estate general stores ("barracões") was thus transformed. The counterpoint between feira and barracão reveals the complexities of change in the region and demonstrated the importance of ethnography of market places for the understanding of wider processes of social transformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} rural history and social unrest in the English {{countryside}} has concentrated largely on East Anglia and southern England. Apart {{from one or}} two recent studies, the western agricultural counties have been relatively ignored. More importantly, apart from giving some detailed accounts {{of the lives of}} rural political activists, many historians have paid less attention to the daily lives of the majority of agricultural labourers. This has led to a general acceptance that most labourers were part of a <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> whose loss of common rights and declining living standards culminated in the Last Labourers’ Revolt of 1830. This thesis seeks to broaden this view by providing a more holistic view of labourers’ lives in Worcestershire in order to determine what social and economic changes had the most impact on rural life in general and on three settlements in particular. The introduction demonstrates how romantic views of the past have influenced some historians’ attitudes. It then determines the empirical basis for this study...|$|E
40|$|In {{some areas}} in sub-Saharan Africa a <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> has emerged, {{consisting}} mainly of labourers {{living and working}} on plantations and large mixed farms. Besides these fully proletarianized estate workers, {{there is also a}} category of workers that can be labelled 'semi-proletarianized'. They live outside the agricultural estates, perform seasonal agricultural wage labour and still have control over some means of (re) production, usually a small piece of land. Based on a survey of large farms and households conducted in 1989 in Kenya's Trans Nzoia District, the present authors investigate whether differences in the degree of proletarianization of workers are reflected in differences in socioeconomic situation and living conditions (such as access to a latrine and improved drinking water, the number of household members per room, level of food consumption, nutritional condition). They also compare the situation of labourers with that of a group of non-labourers (households in which nobody had performed any agricultural wage labour in the year preceding the survey). They conclude that in terms of land and income as well as living conditions, labourers are disadvantaged when compared with non-labourers. With respect to the labourers, a higher degree of proletarianization coincides with a lower level of income but not necessarily with poorer living conditions. Bibliogr., notes, ref., su...|$|E
40|$|Saxony is {{the only}} large European {{territory}} where we can make reliable estimates of the absolute increase of the different social classes and strata (Blaschke 1967). Here, from {{the midst of the}} 16 th until the midst of the 19 th century the overall population tripled. However, the absolute number of peasants (Vollbauern) remained nearly the same, the number of full citizens in towns doubled, and in villages the cottars (Häusler) and laborers (Handarbeiter) were in 1850 ten times as numerous as in 1550 and their relative proportion rose from about one tenth to more than one half of the total population. For anybody who is confronted with these figures and who remembers the number of siblings of his great-grandfather, it seems to be obvious that there was a disproportionate increase of the <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> as a consequence of its higher natural increase. Accordingly, Charles Tilly (1984; p. 39) proposed the following hypothesis: “On the average, proletarians responded to economic expansion with greater decline in mortality and greater increases in fertility than nonproletarians did, and responded to economic contraction with greater increases in mortality but no greater declines in fertility than nonproletarians did.

40|$|It is {{established}} historiographical wisdom {{to say that}} the spectacular rise of the Cuban sugar industry in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries brought with it a stifling of an alternative developmental path for Cuban rural society — an ‘anti-commodity’ vision of ‘little Cuba’, built not upon the plantation complex, but upon a multitude of diverse agricultural and pastoral practices, based upon a free rural population of smallholders, combined {{in such a way as}} to bring economic and social sustainability. But sugar came to dominate the island instead, bringing about the dispossession of vast swathes of the peasantry, marginalising smallholders or pushing them into the growing ranks of a <b>rural</b> <b>proletariat</b> mobilised to service the increasingly massive cane farms and sugar factories. The story would seem to be one of a great tide of sugar sweeping all before it as its frontier voraciously extended itself to swallow up all available land, and pulling all aspects of Cuban life under its influence. But while in many areas this pervasive description holds true, this is only one aspect of the story. The ‘little Cuba’ of smallholding diversity was not entirely consumed but continued to maintain a presence, albeit beneath the lengthening shadow of cane. While this was clearly the case in parts of the island to which the sugar frontier did not extend, the divide between ‘little Cuba’ and the plantation complex was not a strictly geographical one...|$|E
