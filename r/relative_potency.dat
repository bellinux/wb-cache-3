25|$|The EPA has {{established}} guidance {{for assessing the}} cumulative risk for multiroute exposures to pesticide groups determined to have a common mechanism of toxicity. The Agency has also published guidance on determining whether chemicals share a common mechanism of toxicity, i.e., whether they can be assessed as a common mechanism group. The risk calculation is based on dose addition, where individual pesticide exposure levels are scaled by their <b>relative</b> <b>potency</b> and then summed. Some key uncertainties in this approach include the possibility that <b>relative</b> <b>potency</b> changes with dose, {{and the potential for}} toxicological interactions (dose addition assumes no toxicological interactions). Another caution is that the resulting risk assessments are not complete environmental health evaluations of all chemical exposures, but only represent risks from those common mechanism pesticides.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted to determine equivalence ratios comparing the <b>relative</b> <b>potency</b> of opioids. Given a dose of an opioid, an equianalgesic table is used to find the equivalent dosage of another. Such tables are used in opioid rotation practices, and to describe an opioid by comparison to morphine, the reference opioid. Equianalgesic tables typically list drug half-lives, and sometimes equianalgesic doses of the same drug by means of administration, such as morphine: oral and intravenous.|$|E

These two approaches yielded analogous results. The formyl tetrapeptlde fMet-Leu-Phe-Phe showed rapid and saturable binding to the same chemotactic receptors as the less potent fermyl tripeptides with which It was compared. Its equilibrium-binding pattern, however, was different: fMet-Leu-Phe-Phe showed a homogeneous binding pattern, in contrast to the heterogeneity seen with the less potent compounds. The <b>relative</b> <b>potencies</b> for high-affinity binding of the two standard formyl tripeptldes and fMet-Leu-Phe-Phe correlated well with their <b>relative</b> <b>potencies</b> for stimulating the biological response of degranulation; the <b>relative</b> <b>potencies</b> for low-affinity binding correlated less well...|$|R

25|$|Diacetylmorphine (better {{known as}} heroin) was {{synthesized}} from morphine in 1874 {{and brought to}} market by Bayer in 1898. Heroin is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more potent than morphine weight for weight.

60|$|On {{the other}} side, I found a vast body of {{testimony}} that savages had no religion at all. But that testimony, en masse, was refuted by Roskoff, and also, in places, by Tylor. When three witnesses {{were brought to}} swear that they saw the Irishman commit a crime, he offered to bring a dozen witnesses who did NOT see him. Negative evidence of squatters, sailors and colonists, who did NOT see any religion among this or that race, is not worth much against evidence of trained observers and linguists who DID find what the others missed, and who found more the more they knew the tribe in question. Again, like others, I thought savages incapable of such relatively pure ideas as I now believe {{some of them to}} possess. But I could not resist the evidence, and I abandoned my a priori notions. The evidence forcibly attests gradations in the central belief. It is found in various shades, from <b>relative</b> <b>potency</b> down to a vanishing trace, and it is found in significant proportion to the prevalence of animistic ideas, being weakest where they are most developed, strongest where they are least developed. There must be a reason for these phenomena, and that reason, as it seems to me, is the overlaying and supersession of a rudely Theistic by an animistic creed.

40|$|The {{relaxation}} of the carbachol-contracted rat isolated caecum by noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A) and isoproterenol (1) was investigated, {{to identify the}} pharmacological receptors involved. the organs were pretreated with cocaine to block neuronal uptake. the <b>relative</b> <b>potencies</b> of the three agonists were I much greater than A greater-than-or-equal-to NA, indicating the presence of beta-adrenoceptors.

Initial attempts to verify if alpha-adrenoceptors were involved, by using the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, were unsuccessful, since the shifts of the concentration-response curves were small and were not concentration dependent, leading to Schild lines with slopes significantly lower than unity. When the experiments with prazosin were repeated {{in the presence of}} a large concentration of propranolol (10 (- 5) mol/l) to block beta-adrenoceptors, the <b>relative</b> <b>potencies</b> were changed to NA > A greater-than-or-equal-to I, reflecting the presence of alpha-adrenoceptors. in addition. the shifts induced by prazosin against A lead to Schild lines with slopes not different from 1.
