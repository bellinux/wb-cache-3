In particular, anatase titanium dioxide (TiO 2), {{with a high}} natural abundance, nontoxicity, a small volume change (less than 4 %), and low production cost, has attracted extensive attention as a promising anode material for SIBs [18]. However, TiO 2 has inherent defects, such as inferior electrical conductivity (10 − 12  S cm− 1) as well as narrow ionic channels that cannot support rapid transfer of sodium ions [19, 20, 21], resulting in low specific capacity and serious capacity loss at high current densities. In order to improve its sodium storage performance, an important strategy is to increase its conductivity. One typical approach is to decrease the size of TiO 2 particles or design novel nanostructures such as nanowires [22], nanospheres [23], or nanotubes [24], which can greatly shorten the sodium ion diffusion distance and promote electronic transport. Another effective method is recombination with carbon or doping of multivalent ions with Fe [25], S [26], Nb [27], or N [28].|$|R

40|$|The {{reversible}} {{reaction of}} calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) to calcium oxide (CaO) and water vapor {{is well known}} in the context of thermochemical energy storage. Cheap material costs, a theoretically very high energy density and the potentially wide temperature range of the reaction imply that the storage system could be beneficial for many high temperature processes. For example the system could be applied to store and reutilize industrial waste heat or as an alternative storage solution in future concentrated solar power plants. In this publication the reaction is experimentally investigated in an indirectly operated fixed bed reactor at different technically relevant but so far not investigated operating conditions. This in particular means the thermal charging and discharging of the storage at low water vapor pressures under different heating and cooling loads induced by a heat transfer fluid.

AddftlonalKeyphrase: intermethod comparison A number of mechanized methods for determining blood glucose have been developed. Some of these, such as the hexokinase method, are very specific, but their relatively high cost usually precludes their routine use.
