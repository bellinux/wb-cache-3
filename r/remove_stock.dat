40|$|Chamaecytisus palmensis (Tagasaste) is a leguminous {{perennial}} shrub which grows {{well in a}} {{range of}} climatic zones. Tagasaste was introduced from the Canary Islands to Australia in 1879 and a number of farmers are growing the shrub for fodder production and soil conservation. The most economical means of utilizing tagasaste in Australia appears to be direct grazing by sheep. This thesis reports on a study of tagasaste and lucerne as a supplementary summer feed for sheep in the Strathfieldsaye Research Station, East Gippsland, Victoria. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the relative value of feeding tagasaste and lucerne (Medicago sativa) as a supplementary feed for sheep during summer. Growth performance of sheep, dry matter consumed and the chemical composition of feeds were examined over the four months of the experimental period. The 240 two year old Merino sheep were divided into 12 groups for grazing eight plots of tagasaste and four plots of lucerne as a supplement to summer pasture. Each plot had been fenced into four or six subplots for tagasaste or lucerne respectively, to allow stock to be rotated in four months. The estimation of the dry matter consumed in each subplot was done by selecting 50 sample quadrats before and after grazing for each experimental month. The mean liveweight gain for all sheep in the lucerne plots (11. 3 kg/head) was not significantly different from tagasaste (10. 6 kg/head) at the end of the experiment. The mean total change in standing dry matter due to grazing in the tagasaste treatment (5360 kg/ha) over the four months was greater than for the lucerne treatment (3384 kg/ha). The overall daily growth efficiency over the daily dry matter (LW (g) /DM (g)) eaten by sheep in tagasaste was 0. 20 % and 0. 34 % for lucerne over the experimental period. In both treatments the pattern of pasture dry matter consumption did not resemble the pattern of liveweight gain. The digestibility and total nitrogen content of feed types were not significantly different between trial months. However, the leaf part of tagasaste had significantly greater values than other feed types during the trial although lucerne leaf was not measured. During the trial there was no loss of liveweight in sheep fed tagasaste or lucerne as a supplement. A second experiment indicated that tagasaste regrowth after grazing was significantly better in lightly grazed plots than in heavily grazed plots suggesting that farmers <b>remove</b> <b>stock</b> before all leaf has been eaten. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that there is scope for the summer grazing tagasaste as a supplement to dry pasture however lucerne remains a better feed than tagasaste on this site. The high quality of tagasaste foliage (leaf) and low rate of liveweight gain of the experimental sheep suggest that further study is necessary to identify the cause of low stock performance.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{behavioural}} ecology of the woylie (Bettongia penicillata) was conducted between November 1986 and September 1987 on a population that had been introduced to Island A, Venus Bay in South Australia. The primary {{aim of the research}} was to establish the reasons for the success of this population of approximately 20 individuals which survives in an environment which is considerably different from the pockets of forest and woodland habitats comprising the present range of this species in Western Australia. This knowledge will assist wildlife authorities to identify suitable reintroduction sites within the former mainland range of B. penicillata. Scat analysis revealed that woylies on Island A consumed a catholic diet of dicotyledon leaf material, seasonal fruits and berries, and invertebrates. Endomycorrhizal fungal spores were common in scats during spring and are possibly derived from the gut of Scarab beetle larvae that were present in the scats at this time. Fungi are an insignificant dietary component of woylies at Venus Bay. The home ranges of woylies on Island A overlapped considerably and were significantly smaller than the "feeding" areas recorded for Western Australian conspecifics. Separate "feeding" and "nest" areas could not be identified on Island A as refuges were dispersed throughout the home range and were at a density of approximately three times that reported for Western Australian woylies. The refuge sites used by woylies on Island A were relatively simple constructions and contrasted with the more complex double-layered structures described for mainland woylies. Refuge sites on Island A were generally located beneath dense bushes. They provided little protection from prevailing temperature and relative humidity but did provide cover and ameliorate the effects of insolation. Refuges were exclusive to individuals. Males maintained a greater degree of spatial separation from one another during refuge occupation than they did from females, or females from each other. No significant difference between male and female body masses was detected, while the mean body mass recorded in December was significantly higher than at other times. The woylies at Venus Bay had significantly lower masses than those reported for a population of woylies at Tuttanning in Western Australia. The limited genetic base of the founding population and competition for food among this high density population are the most likely reasons for the lower masses of woylies on Island A. This study demonstrates that woylies can be successfully introduced into a wild, modified environment if their basic habitat requirements of suitable cover and diet are met. A broad diet, the abundance of suitable food species and adequate refuge sites within a small area, together with the absence of predators and fire, have all contributed {{to the success of the}} woylie population introduced to Island A. Active management is required to monitor and manipulate such small populations to ensure that genetic viability is maintained and the long term survival of the species is secured. Management: Recommendations 1. Monitor the population dynamics and genetic profiles of wild woylie populations in Western Australia. 2. Monitor the genetic profiles of woylies on Island A and other introduced populations. 3. Identify and acquire habitats similar to, and within, those of B. penicillata's former range, <b>remove</b> <b>stock</b> and exotic herbivores, implement and maintain predator control measures, and foster the growth of food species suitable for woylies. 4. Conduct research at proposed introduction sites to establish the fire regimes that would maintain adequate food and cover for woylies. 5. Introduce fresh genetic stock from wild Western Australian populations into the existing small populations in South Australia and simultaneously cull adults from the receiving population. 6. Maintain management practices to protect relic populations in Western Australia and newly established populations at introduction sites...|$|E

40|$|NoWe {{study the}} price and {{liquidity}} effects following the FTSE 100 index revisions. We employ the standard GARCH(1, 1) model to allow the residual variance of the single index model (SIM) to vary systematically over time and use a Kalman filter approach to model SIM coefficients as a random walk process. We show that the observed price effect depends on the abnormal return estimation methods. Specifically, the OLS-based abnormal returns indicate that the price effect associated with the index revision is temporary, whereas both SIM with random coefficients and GARCH(1, 1) model suggest that both additions and deletions experience permanent price change.

The toolpath generation is based on cutting planes slicing a meshed surface to provide toolpath tracks on the surface. The cutting planes can be orthogonal to each other, and positions of these planes are computed consequently so that a next iteration considers regions machined at the previous iterations. The developed algorithm alternates between several candidate tracks {{to ensure that a}} track with the best performance, which may be formulated variously, is selected. Each candidate track is computed to result in a tool swept volume that completely <b>removes</b> <b>stock</b> material between the toolpath track and the boundary of the un-machined region.

40|$|In Australian markets, authors seek {{to clarify}} the {{relationship}} of stock return performances with their beta, firm market capitalization and trading activity. This study leads us {{to consider the possibility}} that asset pricing studies can be dominated by the stocks of the very small companies to the extent of having little relevance to institutional share management. For example, the paper observes how the pattern of returns for stocks of the very small firms leads to generalizations that are reversed in respect to the stocks of larger firms. Additionally, the study reveals how outcomes may be compromised by "reversals of causality" in the data, so that, for example, beta estimates may be the outcome, rather than the explanation of stock price performances. Overall, the paper finds that when the stocks of the very small firms are <b>removed,</b> <b>stock</b> returns have a positive relationship with firm capitalization, while bearing no pronounced relation to either of stock beta or trading activity...|$|R

40|$|Producers {{of complex}} {{machines}} offer lasting service contracts to their customers. To {{be able to}} provide service, spare parts are held in stock. Since the service period is typically much larger than the production period, the service department places a large 'final order' for spare parts at the moment the machine is taken out of production. This final order is expected to last until all service contracts have ended. In this paper we deal with finding (close to) optimal final order quantities. The main result is the derivation of a close to optimal final order quantity, given by an explicit formula. Furthermore, we also determine 'remove-down-to' levels for spare parts. These levels are used to reduce cost by <b>removing</b> <b>stock</b> before all service contracts have expired. The effects of introducing remove-down-to levels on the expected cost and the optimal final order quantity are shown. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
