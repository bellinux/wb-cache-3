It is presently authorised for use with chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a minimum dose of 1 x 107 CFU/kg of complete feedingstuffs. The applicant is now seeking authorisation for use with chickens reared for laying, ducks <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and ostriches. B. subtilis is a species that is considered by EFSA to be suitable for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The sensitivity to antibiotics {{and the absence of}} toxigenic potential qualified the strain for QPS status. On this basis the product can be presumed safe for chickens reared for laying, ducks <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> and ostriches, <b>for</b> consumers of products derived from thes...|$|R
40|$|Cylactin® {{consists}} of dehydrated cells of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium. It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe <b>for</b> calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and <b>for</b> rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and rearing. However, lambs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed. An additional study with calves for rearing confirmed these results at the same dose. As the mechanism of action of the additive can be reasonably assumed to be same, the positive results seen in calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and rearing can be extrapolated to kids <b>for</b> rearing and <b>fattening.</b> Conclusions on {{the efficacy of the}} product for sheep would derive from results with lambs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> which were not made available...|$|R

40|$|Livestock {{houses are}} {{major sources of}} {{airborne}} particulate matter (PM), which can originate from manure, feed, feathers, skin and bedding and may contain and transport microorganisms. Improved knowledge of particle size, morphology, chemical and microbiological composition of PM in livestock houses can help identify major sources of PM {{and contribute to the}} development of appropriate source-specific reduction techniques. In rabbit production systems, however, there is limited information on specific particle characteristics. The objective of this study was to characterise airborne PM in rabbit farms in terms of morphology, chemical compositions and bacterial concentration in different size fractions. Size-fractioned PM was sampled in the air of 2 <b>rabbit</b> farms, 1 <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> <b>rabbits</b> and 1 <b>for</b> reproductive does, using a virtual cascade impactor, which simultaneously collected total suspended PM (TSP), PM 10 and PM 2. 5 size fractions. Airborne PM samples were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Representative samples from potential sources of PM were also collected and examined. Additionally, a methodology to extract bacteria from the collected samples of airborne PM was developed to determine the bacterial concentration per PM size fraction. Results showed that airborne PM in rabbit farms is highly complex in particle morphology, especially in size. Broken skin flakes, disintegrated particles from feed or faecal material from mechanical fracture are the main sources of airborne PM in rabbit farms. Major elements found in rabbit airborne PM were S, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl. Bacterial concentrations ranged from 1. 7 × 10 4 to 1. 6 × 10 6 colony forming units (CFU) /m 3 (TSP); from 3. 6 × 10 3 to 3. 0 × 10 4 CFU/m 3 (PM 10); and from 3. 1 × 10 3 to 1. 6 × 10 4 CFU/m 3 (PM 2. 5).

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} how forage triticale in diets <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers influence the body weight and weight gain of broiler chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The survey was conducted on 400 chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> provenance Ross 308 for a period of 42 days. On this occasion, four groups of chickens were formed, with 100 chickens being treated in each group, as follows: K (classic mixture <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers) and O-I (mixtures with triticale variety Kg 20), O-II (mixtures with triticale Favorit) and O-III group (mixtures with triticale Trijumf). The highest average body mass in the groups of chickens (male, female and chicks of both sexes), was scored by broiler chickens of O-II-group. The minimum food consumption for 42 -day-old chicks was achieved by group O-I (4. 275 kg), and the most by O-II group (4. 359 kg). Chickens of O-II- and III-O-group had the best feed conversion, while the chickens of O-I-group had a slightly poorer feed conversion. The mortality of the groups of chickens for the entire period of the study was the lowest in O-II-group, at 2. 0 %, and the highest mortality was found in O-III-group (6. 0 %). The production index was the highest in O-II-group (202. 726) and the lowest in O-I-group.

The identity of the six strains was established. As no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected and as five of the strains qualify for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment, their use is presumed safe for target species and consumers. The Enterococcus faecium strain is not a recognised pathogen for animals and as the additive did not adversely affect growth of chickens or piglets, Probiotic LACTINA® is considered safe for the target species up to 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections. The metabolic pathways of E. faecium are well known. Since no other harmful metabolites are expected and the additive does not contain excipients of concern, it is considered safe for consumers.

40|$|Clinacox® 0. 5 % is a feed {{additive}} containing 0. 5 % diclazuril {{and is used}} to control coccidiosis in poultry. The previous conclusion on the safety of diclazuril in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at the use level of 1 mg/kg complete feed is extended to chickens reared for laying. Chickens reared for laying are in a similar physiological stage as chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The use level proposed for diclazuril in feed {{is the same for}} both categories of birds. Consequently, the metabolic fate and residue status of this additive described <b>for</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> can be extrapolated to chickens reared for laying. Feeding diclazuril at 1 mg/kg complete feed to chickens reared for laying for the first 16 weeks of life would result in negligibly low or absent residues of diclazuril in the first eggs for production. Therefore, maximum residue levels (MRLs) for eggs are not necessary. The previous assessment of consumer safety for the use of diclazuril in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> is confirmed and extended to chickens reared for laying. The same MRLs for tissues as already established can be applied. Clinacox® has a low irritation potential for the eye and skin. Skin sensitisation was not observed. Considering the particle size (particle of respirable size) and dusting potential, exposure by inhalation cannot be excluded, although workers’ exposure has been calculated to be low in comparison with the ADI. In the absence of any data on respiratory toxicity, a hazard from inhalation of dust cannot be entirely excluded and appropriate protective measures should be taken. The use of Clinacox® at 1 mg/kg complete feed does not pose a risk to the terrestrial or aquatic environment. One mg diclazuril/kg complete feed is effective in controlling coccidiosis in chickens reared for laying...|$|R
40|$|Bonvital is a {{preparation}} of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium authorised for use in piglets and pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> in sows and in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The applicant is seeking the further authorisation of Bonvital for use in {{chickens reared for laying}} and minor avian species. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. The safety of Bonvital in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, safety for this animal category can be presumed. As the same dose is proposed for minor avian species, this conclusion can be extrapolated to minor avian species to point of lay. The strain is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. Bonvital is not irritant to skin and eyes. In the absence of data, it should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of Bonvital under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. The efficacy in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, the conclusion on the major species can be extended to this category. As the same dose is proposed for minor avian species and as the mechanism of action of the additive can reasonably be assumed to be the same as in the major species, efficacy in minor avian species to point of lay can be presumed...|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{interest}} in rolled grain has been expressed. Some commercial feeders have purchased rollers in preference to grinders; a few feeders truck grain to town to have it rolled in preference to grinding grain at home. The usual recommendation for grain preparation <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> commercial cattle has been to have it cracked or medium ground, not finely ground. Rolled grain has been considered by most people to be equal to medium ground or cracked grain and {{by some to be}} superior to medium ground or cracked grain. No conclusive experimental evidence was available as to the best method of grain preparation <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> cattle. The objective of this study then is to find out which is the best method of grain preparation: rolling, coarse grinding or fine grinding...|$|R
