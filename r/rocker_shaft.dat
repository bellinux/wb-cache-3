50|$|Because these engines {{needed a}} less {{sophisticated}} rocker setup, {{with only a}} single <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> in each head, they were also cheaper and lighter than their Hemi counterparts. In the Chrysler literature, the Poly engines were also called single <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> (SRS), while the Hemi engines were called dual <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> (DRS).|$|E
5000|$|The first Y-block on Ford {{automobiles}} was the 1954 239 in³ (3.9 L) Ford engine, {{known for}} its deep skirting, which causes the engine block to resemble a Y. Rated at [...] and 193 ft-lbs of torque at 2200rpm, it replaced the [...] 239 in³ (3.9 L) flathead. The Y-block was considered a major advancement over the flathead. It is known for having oiling problems in the <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> because the oil first went to the crankshaft bearing, then to the camshaft bearings, then to the <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> This problem plagued the entire Y-block family and could be remedied by running a copper line from the oil pump to the <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Both engines had alloy {{cylinder}} heads with twin <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> and inlet valves angled at 45 degrees ...|$|R
50|$|Their {{cylinders}} were inclined {{and arranged}} outside the 7/8 in plate frames. The steam chests were arranged between the frames and the unbalanced slide valves were actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... the {{camshaft}} is secured to the cylinder {{head with the}} camcase. An oil passage in the cylinder head provides the passageway in the camcase with oil {{that leads to the}} intake <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b> Oil from {{the camshaft}} is collected {{on the opposite side of}} the passageway leading to the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> to provide oil to the exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{drive cam}} {{is driven by}} the camshaft. This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the {{trunnion}} pin or <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b> Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller tip. A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller tip to a second rocker arm. This rotates about the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft,</b> and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve. In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head.|$|E
50|$|The primary exhaust {{rocker arm}} {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the oil pressure flowing from the exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> into the primary {{exhaust rocker arm}} forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust rocker arm, thereby locking both exhaust rocker arms together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust rocker arm alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust rocker arms together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft,</b> except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary rocker arm.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frame while the slide valves, arranged above the cylinders, were actuated by Stephenson link motion through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> Two sandboxes were mounted atop the boiler, {{fore and aft}} of the steam dome.|$|R
50|$|The engine used Richardson slide valves, {{arranged}} {{above the}} cylinders and actuated by the Stephenson motion and <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The eccentrics were fitted to the trailing coupled wheel axle, {{which resulted in}} exceptionally long valve connecting rods of 7 ft.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Chrysler's {{contemporaneous}} hemi V8 engines, the Hemi-6's {{rocker arms}} are mounted on individual studs (similar to the Chevrolet [...] "big block" [...] V8), {{rather than on}} 2 separate <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> as in all 1951-58 Hemis—Dodge, DeSoto, Imperial, and Chrysler [...] "Firepower" [...] and 1964-'71 426 V8s.|$|R
50|$|The worm and {{sector was}} an older design, used for example in Willys and Chrysler vehicles, and the Ford Falcon (1960's). To reduce {{friction}} the sector {{is replaced by a}} roller or rotating pins on the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> arm.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the intake}} rocker arms are marked {{so they are}} {{correctly}} placed on the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> when servicing. An IN1 or IN2 will be embossed on each rocker arm. As viewed {{from the front of}} the engine the Number 1 intake valve of each cylinder and the number 2 intake valve have an IN1 marked and IN2 marked rocker arm that mates with it. New IN1 rocker arms can also be identified by a Green painted mark on the top of the rocker arm. The IN2 rocker arms have a white mark. Proper positioning is maintained through the use of a wave washer located between the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> arm and rocker arm shaft support.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately {{its most}} popular form was an {{hour-glass}} shaped worm which engages with a double-toothed roller follower on the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> for the steering arm. The {{result is that}} substantially the same leverage is provided from one steering lock to the other.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frame, with balanced slide valves above, actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The locomotives were delivered with type XF tenders, which rode on 2-axle bogies {{and had a}} capacity of 10 lt t coal and 3000 imp gal water.|$|R
5000|$|The engine had {{inclined}} cylinders, arranged {{outside the}} plate frames. Its balanced slide valves were arranged above the cylinders and were actuated by Stephenson link motion through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The locomotives {{were the first}} in South Africa to have [...] "H" [...] section coupling rods and connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had bar {{frames and}} used saturated steam. They had balanced slide valves, arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The firebox was fitted with Stroudley's flexible stays {{and the back}} casing plate was flanged outwards to facilitate {{the removal of the}} internal firebox for renewals.|$|R
50|$|A pair of opposed cams or cam {{surfaces}} {{connected to}} the steering column operate a transverse <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> carrying the vehicle's steering arm. The point of difference {{was the use of}} purely rolling contact and not sliding contact in the meshing elements of a worm-and-follower steering gear.|$|E
50|$|No {{detachable}} tonneau {{to make it}} a four-seater was available. The arched {{front axle}} was tubular. The axle was given a truss and added mid-year was a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> between it and the spring. Single cylinder 98.2 cu. inch engine with an advertised output of 9 horsepower.|$|E
50|$|Engine: In-line 6-cylinder, {{overhead}} pushrod operated {{valve engine}} with 3699cc capacity. Separate cast iron block and aluminum crankcase with detachable cast iron 6-plug head. It has an 82 mm bore with a 114 mm stroke. 7-bearing crankshaft with vibration damper. Pressure fed lubrication with relief valve feeding <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> and timing gears.|$|E
50|$|For {{improved}} accessibility, {{the steam}} chests were mounted outside the frames instead of between them. The slide valves, operated by Stephenson Link motion, were {{on top of}} the cylinders and employed <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The balance weight for the Stephenson motion was seldom used on American locomotives and was replaced by a powerful coiled spring.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} used {{saturated steam}} and had flat [...] "D" [...] type slide valves, placed above the cylinders {{and operated by}} Stephenson Link valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The leading wheels were mounted in a spring control bogie {{which was designed to}} overcome the problems of excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels and rail cutting on curves.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frames, with balanced Richardson type D slide valves arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The hind {{frame of the}} engine was of the plate type and was widened out to receive the Belpaire firebox, which itself was a notable departure from the usual practice of the CGR to use round-topped fireboxes.|$|R
50|$|In the {{overhead}} valve (OHV) design, the cylinder head contains the poppet valves and the spark plugs, along with tracts or 'ports' for the inlet and exhaust gases. The {{operation of the}} valves is initiated by the engine's camshaft, which is sited within the cylinder block, and its moment of operation is transmitted to the valves' pushrods, and then rocker arms mounted on a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> - the rocker arms and shaft also being located within the cylinder head.|$|E
50|$|The oiling {{problem was}} caused by the passage from the center cam bearing to the {{cylinder}} head being offset by an inch and too small. The motor oils of the era were low in detergents, but high in petroleum coke; when combined with short trips and infrequent oil changes, this led to blockage of this passage. This left the lower end with ample oil while the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> assemblies literally burned up. The external oiler kit essentially provided oil to the rocker shafts from the oil pressure port {{on the outside of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, the tappet, also {{termed a}} cam follower, or lifter, {{is that part}} that runs on the {{camshaft}} and is made to move vertically {{by the action of}} the rotating cam. In an overhead valve engine, this tappet is fitted low down in the engine block. From there it drives a long thin pushrod, {{up to the top of}} the engine, above the cylinder head. Here the rockers, arranged on a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> beneath the rocker cover, reverse the direction of the valve movement to press the valves downwards to open them.|$|E
5000|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the frame, while the slide valves were arranged between the frames and actuated by Stephenson valve gear link motion through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The boiler dome was arranged above the firebox, with two Salter safety valves which were adjusted {{to blow off}} at [...] The locomotive was equipped with a No. 40 combination ejector and two vacuum brake cylinders, each 15 in in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inside cylinders, arranged at an incline, with slide valves {{which were}} actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The cylinders and valve gear were placed between the plate frames and {{hidden from view}} by the wheels, which were coupled with external connecting rods. Together with the Cape Town Railway & Dock’s Blackie of 1859, these were the only two-cylinder locomotives with an inside cylinder and valve gear arrangement to see service in South Africa.|$|R
40|$|Component rig tests {{suggest that}} ANS triboconditioning brings {{significant}} improvements in the tribological properties of camshafts, cylinder liners, and <b>rocker</b> arm <b>shafts.</b> Extreme-pressure mechanical treatment of the component surface in combination with a tribochemical deposition of a low-friction antiwear film based on tungsten disulfide allows one to produce, in a single finishing operation, a smoother surface with a significantly reduced coefficient of boundary friction and improved wear-resistance and load-carrying capacity. The treatment proved to be especially efficient for reducing friction and wear in lubricated contacts under high tribological stress. Godkänd; 2012; 20121213 (jenhar...|$|R
5000|$|The E16 is a 1.6 L (1,597 cc) engine {{produced}} from 1982 through 1988. It has a 76 x 88 mm {{bore and stroke}} and produces [...] in the [...] "S" [...] (carbureted) variant and [...] in the [...] "i" [...] (throttle-body injected) variant. The first generation of this engine used a valve cover that bolted to the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> studs. This design was replaced in September 1986 with a valve cover that bolted to the head. Note that the E16 is an engine with [...] "interference valve gear".|$|E
50|$|The in-line six Bristol engine {{fitted to}} the Aceca-Bristol {{was based on}} a design from BMW with cast iron block and {{aluminium}} cylinder head. It has a single camshaft with pushrods running vertically to a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> on the inlet side of the engine and further horizontal pushrods running in 6 tubes {{over the top of the}} engine in order to reach the exhaust rockers. The two inclined rocker covers give the engine a similar appearance to an overhead - camshaft arrangement. Three inline Solex downdraft carburettors were bolted directly to the cylinder head casting using small adaptor plates.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} with the J37A4 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009 Acura TL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and exhaust valves. The intake and exhaust rocker shafts contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust rocker arms, respectively. The primary rocker arm contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary rocker arm contains the return spring. The term [...] "primary" [...] does not refer to which rocker arm forces the valve down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, {{it refers to the}} rocker arm which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|All Swifts (export models) got a {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear fascia {{as well as a}} new dashboard. GS sedans received power steering and new hub caps. The 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine received a new cylinder head assembly: the engine of the previous generation used the same block and corresponding components but featured a head with valves in a V-formation straddling a single camshaft with <b>rocker</b> arms on <b>shafts,</b> whereas now the cylinder head assumed a much slimmer profile, owing to the valves now being in a vertical, inline configuration, actuated by inverted buckets also serving as hydraulic valve lash adjusters, all underneath a single overhead camshaft.|$|R
2500|$|All these engines {{share common}} {{external}} dimensions, light weight - about [...] - forged crankshaft and rods, {{as well as}} most other parts. The stroke for all Gen-1 V8s is [...] Engine displacement was a factor of the bore: the [...] has a [...] bore, [...] , and the [...] a [...] bore. The bore size is cast {{on the top of the}} block near the back of the right bank cylinder head. The block features a deep skirt where the casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, forming a very rigid crankcase gallery. The oil system feeds a central gallery to the cam and crankshaft first from front to rear, and then dividing at the front to feed the two lifter galleries from front to rear. From the rear of the two lifter galleries oil is then supplied up to the two <b>rocker</b> arm <b>shafts</b> which serve as galleries to lubricate the valve train. The fore and aft direction changes are designed to eliminate stale oil areas which tend to form sludge deposits. Juxtaposed with the Rambler V8, the Chevrolet small-block engine feeds both lifter galleries and the central cam and crankshaft galleries simultaneously through a three way split from the rear, having oil proceed to the front of the engine, the lifter galleries feeding oil to the valve train through hollow pushrods.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} failure of a <b>rocker</b> arm <b>shaft</b> of a {{passenger}} car. The shaft failed by brittle fracture across one of the four holes supporting the shaft into the cylinder head. The running distance of the engine just before failure was 40, 626 km. Visual examinations of etched sections of the failed shaft and a new one revealed four distinct zones of darker etching appearance. These zones correspond to the four locations where the rocker arms fit the shaft. Microscopic observations of the failed shaft revealed that the four dark-etching areas are surface hardened zones of martensitic microstructure. Furthermore, scanning the microstructure along the failed shaft showed that the heat treatment was so mistakenly extended by excessive heating so that the structure of the shaft near the supporting holes contains considerable content of martensite phase. This conclusion has been confirmed by the results of hardness measurements along the surface of the shaft. Microscopic investigations of the failed shaft revealed the presence of microcracks close to the supporting holes. These cracks may have been induced in the shaft by the non-uniform cooling during quenching in the course of heat treatment, or may be nucleated by repeated loading during service. This premature failure has occurred by the rapid crack propagation because of the lower fracture toughness of the martensite...|$|R
