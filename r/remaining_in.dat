5|$|Following the score, kickoff, and return, Tech began another {{offensive}} possession at its 24-yard line. The Hokies {{picked up}} two first downs and drove into NC State territory, but the clock continued to tick toward halftime. In the Wolfpack {{side of the}} field, Tech running back Eddie Hunter broke free for a 23-yard run, the longest play by Virginia Tech in the second quarter. There was now just over twominutes <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> the quarter. Tech was unable to pick up another first down after Hunter's run, and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than trying a field goal. When the play was stopped for a loss, however, Virginia Tech was denied points and NC State's offense returned with 47seconds <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> the half.|$|E
5|$|For their Homecoming, Michigan {{hosted the}} Iowa Hawkeyes. Michigan hoped {{to bounce back}} after a tough loss the {{previous}} week to Michigan State.

5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly {{and get a}} {{defensive}} stop {{in order to have}} a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards until late in the drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes <b>remaining</b> <b>in</b> the game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
