It is clear that China has made much progress in developing a credit <b>reporting</b> <b>system,</b> already operating the largest credit reporting database in the world.

25|$|Although 23 states {{established}} mandatory <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> {{for serious}} patient injuries or death by 2005, the national database envisioned in the IOM report was delayed by {{the controversy over}} mandatory versus voluntary reporting. Finally in 2005, the US Congress passed the long-debated Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, establishing a federal reporting database. Hospitals reports of serious patient harm are voluntary, collected by patient safety organizations under contract to analyze errors and recommend improvements. The federal government serves to coordinate data collection and maintain the national database. Reports remain confidential, and cannot be used in liability cases. Consumer groups have objected {{to the lack of}} transparency, claiming it denies the public information on the safety of specific hospitals.|$|E

[...] The disorders covered by SENSOR included silicosis, occupational asthma, carpal tunnel syndrome, lead poisoning, and pesticide poisoning. [...] While each participating state health department had previously done surveillance or interventions for some of these occupational illnesses, SENSOR helped the states to develop and refine their <b>reporting</b> <b>systems</b> and programs.|$|E

2500|$|Patient {{safety is}} a {{discipline}} that emphasizes safety {{in health care}} through the prevention, reduction, reporting, and analysis of medical error that often leads to adverse effects. The frequency and magnitude of avoidable adverse events experienced by patients was not well known until the 1990s, when multiple countries reported staggering numbers of patients harmed and killed by medical errors. Recognizing that healthcare errors impact 1 in every 10 patients around the world, the World Health Organization calls patient safety an endemic concern. [...] Indeed, patient safety {{has emerged as a}} distinct healthcare discipline supported by an immature yet developing scientific framework. [...] There is a significant transdisciplinary body of theoretical and research literature that informs the science of patient safety.

The intent of the trial is to provide more accurate [...] "near real-time" [...] area status via the internet to civilian users, especially to regional air carriers particularly affected by required rerouting around Brownwood MOA. Should the test and the technology prove successful and cost-effective, the result could address long-standing civilian dissatisfaction with the quality and timeliness of FAA-distributed special use airspace status information.
