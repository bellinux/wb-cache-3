5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While {{it is often difficult}} to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement near the top of the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed <b>right</b> <b>below</b> the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen {{quite often}} in {{cartoons}} whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jabberjaw, and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim <b>right</b> <b>below</b> them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{indeterminate}} specimen TMP2002.76.1 is {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to Achelousaurus, the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon. Achelousaurus would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known {{from more than one}} formation. Both animals occur <b>right</b> <b>below</b> the marine shales of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP2002.76.1 is about 500,000years older than the Achelousaurus fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.|$|E

5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits <b>right</b> <b>below</b> similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as {{a luxury}} model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
5|$|Cain was the Giants' {{number three}} starter in 2009. He threw six shutout innings {{and had an}} RBI single against Mike Pelfrey on May 17 in a 20 victory over the Mets. In his next start on May 23, he threw a {{complete}} game, allowing just one run as San Francisco defeated the Seattle Mariners 51. On June 4, {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader, he threw a five-inning complete game, allowing one run in a 41 victory over the Nationals. He allowed one run in a complete game against Oakland on June 14, striking out nine as the Giants won 71. From May 7 through June 14, Cain won seven straight decisions. On July 5, Cain was announced as an All-Star {{for the first time in}} his young career. On Cain's final start before the All-Star Game, he was hit by a line drive <b>right</b> <b>below</b> his elbow and was forced to miss pitching for the NL All-Star Team, although he did still attend and was announced as an All-Star. Duke replaced Cain on the NL All-Star team. Cain threw a complete game on August 3 against Houston; however, he suffered the loss for the first time in his career when throwing a complete game, allowing four runs in a 43 defeat. On September 25, Cain was awarded the Willie Mac Award.|$|E

25|$|While {{flicking}} is used {{to higher}} notes, the whisper key is used for lower notes. From the A <b>right</b> <b>below</b> middle C and lower, the whisper key is pressed with the left thumb and held {{for the duration of}} the note. This prevents cracking, as low notes can sometimes crack into a higher octave. Both flicking and using the whisper key is especially important to ensure notes speak properly during slurring between high and low registers.|$|E

25|$|Substitution tiling systems {{provide a}} rich source of {{aperiodic}} tilings. A set of tiles that forces a substitution structure to emerge is said to enforce the substitution structure. For example, the chair tiles shown below admit a substitution, and a portion of a substitution tiling is shown at <b>right</b> <b>below.</b> These substitution tilings are necessarily non-periodic, in precisely the same manner as described above, but the chair tile itself is not aperiodic—it is easy to find periodic tilings by unmarked chair tiles.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, {{a former}} Spanish colony, the {{tradition}} survives of decorative tiling on staircases, where the tiles {{are placed on}} the vertical rise <b>right</b> <b>below</b> each step. It sees a more ubiquitous application in votive diptych tiles depicting the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, {{as well as other}} religious themes. These tiles, which are also coloured brown or polychrome besides the conventional blue, are placed on the wall beside the front door or principal gate of a house, and are encased in a black metal frame surmounted by a cross.|$|E
25|$|A 2017 C-SPAN survey has Adams {{ranked among}} the middle third of {{president}}s of all-time, <b>right</b> <b>below</b> George H. W. Bush and above Ulysses S. Grant. The survey asked 91 presidential historians to rank the 43 former presidents (including then-out-going president Barack Obama) in various categories {{to come up with}} a composite score, resulting in an overall ranking. Adams was ranked 21st among all former presidents (down from 19th in both the 2009 and 2000 surveys). His rankings in the various categories of this most recent poll were as follows: public persuasion (33), crisis leadership (23), economic management (17), moral authority (16), international relations (15), administrative skills (18), relations with congress (32), vision/setting an agenda (15), pursued equal justice for all (9), performance with context of times (22).|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} face {{is formed}} by Gable Crag, prominent in views from Haystacks {{and the surrounding}} fells. This is the longest continuous wall of crag on the fell and reaches up almost to the summit. Scree slopes fall away below to {{the headwaters of the}} River Liza, beginning their long journey down Ennerdale. There are few crags on the eastern slopes, although these fall steeply to Styhead Tarn, a feeder of the Borrowdale system. About 30feet deep, this tarn occupies a scooped hollow, dammed by boulders fallen from the slopes above. It is reputed to contain trout and is a popular location for wild camping. The southern flank of Great Gable falls 2,300ft direct to Lingmell Beck, one of the main feeders of Wastwater. <b>Right</b> <b>below</b> the summit are the Westmorland Crags, and then a second tier breaks out lower down. These are Kern Knotts, Raven Crag and Great Napes, all footed by great tongues of scree. Finally on the west rough slopes fall below the rocks of White Napes to the narrow valley of Gable Beck, a tributary of Lingmell Beck.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} of social media is another channel or site that business' and brands must seek {{to influence the}} content of. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled {{all aspects of the}} ad, with social media, users are free to post comments <b>right</b> <b>below</b> an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.|$|E

500|$|Although {{americium}} {{was likely}} produced in previous nuclear experiments, {{it was first}} intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in late autumn 1944, at the University of California, Berkeley, by Glenn T. Seaborg, Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso. They used a 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory) of the University of Chicago. Following the lighter neptunium, plutonium, and heavier curium, americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered. At the time, the periodic table had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the lanthanide one. This led to americium being located <b>right</b> <b>below</b> its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after the Americas: [...] "The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element {{on the basis of}} its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series." ...|$|E
