40|$|Space {{constraints}} often {{present the}} greatest challenge in determining the lay-out of specific <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>installations.</b> To fulfill these constraints high density concrete is often employed in construction. We have undertaken a study to establish the transmission of primary, leakage and scatter radiation through {{a particular type of}} high density concrete. In the course of this study various characteristics of leakage and scatter radiation from a 10 MV linac have also been investigated. The results of these studies are reported in this thesis. To establish the correct chamber configuration required for the characterization of the transmission factors for primary, leakage and scatter radiation and to determine the scatter-to-incidence dose ratio a, we have measured the build-up curves and verified the validity of the inverse square law for these different radiations. The build-up data for the radiation scattered from a humanoid phantom at different angles from the primary axis have shown that even at low scatter angles little to no build-up is required for scatter radiation measurements...|$|R
40|$|DIN- 6847 is {{the most}} {{suitable}} standard to estimate shielding requirements in medical <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>installations</b> using linear electron accelerators. Its calculation method {{is based on the}} tenth-value thickness concept for which values given by curves and tables are recommended in DIN- 6847. These parameters have been estimated for both primary and secondary X-ray beams using the MCNP code based on the Monte Carlo method. Results show that DIN- 6847 values are conservative for secondary X-ray beam, but not always for direct radiation. The methodology used has been tested using the mentioned code and results are well consistent. I. INTRODU~ON There is a great number of medical installations using particle accelerators for radiotherapy. The importance of an accurate estimation of the doses due to these installations that can be received by health workers, patients or public is obvious. The lower limits of doses established in the new ICRP recommendations [l] imply a recalculation of items concerning such installations 121. There are only two known standards [3], [4] to estimate shielding requirements in medical installations using linear accelerators, i. e. NCRP- 51 and DIN- 6847. The last one is more suitable for this type of calculations. NCRP- 51 is incomplete and difficult to apply, while DIN- 6847 is fairly comprehensive and easy to apply [2], [S]. However, it is based on various semiempirical approaches which should be adequately verified. In the paper, the tenth-value thickness included in DIN- 6847 for various materials for primary and secondary X-rays produced in electron accelerators has been verified using the MCNP code based on the Monte Carlo method [6]...|$|R

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the third most common cancer in women in Indonesia. Many {{cervical}} cancer cases were found in an advanced stage, so that they were treated by radiation or chemoradiation. Radiation is divided into external radiation and internal radiation. There is no internal radiation done in Arifin Achmad General Hospital Pekanbaru, so that they only use complete external radiation treatment for 25 times. After the therapy, the patient will do a follow-up treatment of pap smears to assess the cancer cells. This research was conducted in <b>Radiotherapy</b> <b>Installation,</b> Pathology Installation and Medical Records Installation at Arifin Achmad General Hospital Pekanbaru to study and reveal the results of radiation and chemoradiation therapy in cervical cancer patients at Arifin Achmad General Hospital Pekanbaru. The results showed that of 79 patients treated with cervical cancer radiation, only 29 patients did the follow up treatment whilst of 31 patients treated with cervical cancer chemoradiation, only 6 patients did the follow up treatment. Only 2 patients treated by radiation {{were found to have}} Malignant cells in the pap smear treatment. Meanwhile, in cervical cancer patients treated by chemoradiation, 2 patients were still found Malignant cells and 1 patient experienced a recurrence. Once treated with radiation, Malignant cells on pap smears are found only in 2 patients, while 27 patients were not found and only 1 patient who experienced a recurrence. After chemoradiation therapy in 6 cervical cancer patients who did the follow up, Malignant cells are found in 2 patients and in 4 patients no Malignant cells was found, while the other 2 patients experienced recurrence. The conclusion of this study is the incompleteness of the data found in the medical records, low patient adherence to do follow-up treatment after therapy, and the lack of education and information given by the health professionals to patients to do a follow up treatment...|$|E
