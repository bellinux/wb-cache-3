50|$|Depending {{on how the}} {{individual}} <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases are arranged in a bimolecular or intramolecular quadruplex, a quadruplex can adopt {{one of a number}} of topologies with varying loop configurations. If all strands of DNA proceed in the same direction, the quadruplex is termed parallel. For intramolecular quadruplexes, this means that any loop regions present must be of the propeller type, positioned to the sides of the quadruplex. If one or more <b>of</b> the <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases has a 5’-3’ direction opposite to the other <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases, the quadruplex is said to have adopted an antiparallel topology. The loops joining <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases in intramolecular antiparallel quadruplexes are either diagonal, joining two diagonally opposite <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases, or lateral (edgewise) type loops, joining two adjacent <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine base pairs.|$|R

5|$|Peacetime {{football}} resumed in 1946–47, {{with the}} same fixture list as the abandoned 1939–40 season. York endured a midseason <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 10 defeats from 11 matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish in 15th place in the Third Division North. They were top of the table by mid September 1947, before a <b>run</b> <b>of</b> two wins from 13 matches saw them drop to 18th place. York finished 1947–48 in 13th place, and the club recorded a net profit of £4,914; a balance surplus of £1,843 was carried forward. In September 1948, York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for £4,075. They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948–49 {{at the peak of}} the post-war attendance boom.

40|$|The primary {{interest}} was {{in predicting the}} distribution runs in a sequence of Bernoulli trials.

40|$|One {{challenge}} for computer graphics and scientific visualization {{is to develop}} techniques to more effectively display and analyze the vast amounts of information we are collating, a race we are currently losing. To meet this goal, a key initiative suggests moving away from small-scale, low-resolution displays to immersive, high-fidelity systems. These environments permit higher levels of interactivity and exploration, but require more power and bandwidth than current graphics systems can deliver. The move to larger and/or higher resolution displays will place {{a greater emphasis on}} the digitization algorithms we employ for even the simplest geometrical primitives.
