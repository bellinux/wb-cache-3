5000|$|Changes in {{the nature}} of work in {{developing}} and developed countries have inspired the International Labour Organization (ILO) to develop standards for atypical and precarious employment. The ILO began to expand its policies to include precarious workers with the Convention Concerning Part-time Work in 1994 and the Convention <b>Concerning</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Work</b> in 1996. While, the Organization’s more recent initiative, titled [...] "Decent Work", began in 1999 and attempts to improve the conditions of all people- waged, unwaged, those in the formal and informal market, by enlarging labor and social protections.|$|R

The final section discusses the directions future evaluative research should take, with special reference to the need for drawing the link between the procedural and outcome dimensions of temporary release...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} policies regarding second home planning in the Swedish municipalities. To do so content analysis was conducted on the regulation document called översiktsplan (translated into English layout plan, land-use plan or sketch plan) of all 290 Swedish municipalities. The ´översiktsplan´ is a document containing directions, policies, guidelines and recommendations for land use in the municipality. Swedish law dictates that all municipalities must have such a document.   This study addresses the phenomenon second homes and second home tourism in the perspective of the destination, in this study represented by the Swedish municipalities regulation document called översiktsplan. Previous research has been taken into account, both concerning Sweden, the Nordic countries and countries in different parts of the world, to describe the phenomenon. The study aims to describe municipality´s characteristics and to analyse the geographical placement of the municipality. This is done by plotting a map over Sweden with the municipalities classified depending on their degree of policies regarding second homes. Then, a comparison with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions classification of Swedish municipalities 2017 was made to analyse the characteristics of municipalities having policies for second homes.   Of the 290 (100 %) Swedish municipalities there are 217 (74, 8 %) that have made policies and preparations regarding second homes and these directions are shown in the översiktsplan. The result shows a clear pattern within the Swedish municipalities regarding directions, policies, guidelines and <b>recommendations</b> <b>concerning</b> second <b>homes.</b> Municipalities containing a minor urban area that accommodate less than 40 000 inhabitants and geographically placed nearby an urban area containing more than 40 000 inhabitants, nearby a ski resort or by the shoreline do have a higher preparation and planning regarding second homes. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{computing}} {{moves from}} the personal desktop into the world around us, the problems of design and usability go beyond technical considerations to contend with preexisting social structure and cultural norms associated with public spaces. While much computing research has been <b>concerned</b> with <b>home</b> or <b>work,</b> the focus has recently been shifting toward “third places”—the spaces between <b>home</b> and <b>work.</b> 1 These are complex spaces, as they are navigated both through physical movement and interpretations of social context. 2 As computing blunders into our personal worlds—annoying, interrupting, or distracting us 3 —it is potentially even more disruptive in public spaces, where friends and strangers alike navigate the complex social context of coexistence. 4 While public space presents challenges to technology design, {{it also has the}} advantage of being more accessible than private spaces such as <b>home</b> or <b>work,</b> affording great potential for both observational studies and field testing of real world applications. Sociological research illustrates that public spaces can be understood as combinations of “front spaces ” for performative action 5 and spaces for semiprivate and private interactions. People inhabit these spaces even as they interpret their surroundings and gauge the mood of these spaces to increase their understanding of where they live. 6 As much as public space brings with it a sense of egalitarianism where civic life is played out and embraced, 7 it also can be fraught with adversity and conflict.

40|$|In the {{decision-making}} literature, "advice" has typically been defined very restrictively, as a <b>recommendation</b> <b>concerning</b> which alternative the decision-maker should choose. The present paper examines decision-makers' reactions {{to this and}} three additional types of advice (a <b>recommendation</b> <b>concerning</b> which alternative not to choose, information about alternatives, and a <b>recommendation</b> <b>concerning</b> {{how to make the}} decision), along with another common form of interpersonal assistance (Social Support), from the perspective of maximizing decision accuracy and maintaining decision autonomy. The role of situational and individual differences is also examined. Results from two multilevel policy-capturing studies indicate that, although they consider recommendations regarding which alternative to choose to be important in some contexts, decision-makers often prefer to receive a type of advice that is greatly understudied by researchers [...] namely, the provision of information about alternatives. The implications of these findings for the study of advice-taking are discussed, as are future research directions.
