25|$|When in 1451 Kosača {{sought to}} improve his own economy through a war with the Republic of Ragusa, Thomas refused to join either side, but still interceded with Pope Nicholas V to prevent his father-in-law's excommunication. Ragusa persisted, however, and promised to <b>return</b> <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> by helping Thomas take Drijeva from Kosača and Hodidjed from the Turks. In the summer, Thomas was even {{approached}} by Kosača's family, namely the King's brother-in-law Vladislav and mother-in-law Jelena, who were gravely offended when the Duke took his son's charming Sienese bride as his concubine. In mid-December, Thomas finally agreed with Ragusa on a pact against his infamous father-in-law, but the war ended abruptly when Hungary and the Ottomans signed a truce which specifically forbade the latter's tributary to attack Ragusa.|$|E

Kirkman managed to go undefeated {{in his first}} eleven matches, including a win over Eddie Machen until stepping up in opposition in New York City he faced skilled Doug Jones in a featured fight held in Seattle. Jones caused a cut over Kirkman's left eye in the first round, but Kirkman managed to keep the veteran at bay with a deluge of heavy punches, eventually knocking Jones to the ropes in Round 7.

500|$|Fuller {{began her}} formal {{education}} at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819 before attending the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies from 1821 to 1822. In 1824, she {{was sent to the}} School for Young Ladies in Groton, on the advice of aunts and uncles, though she resisted the idea at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would <b>return</b> <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> with a governmental appointment. On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the American Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the battle. Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16. At home she studied the classics and trained herself in several modern languages and read world literature. By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, [...] "I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot." [...] Eliza Farrar, wife of Harvard professor John Farrar and author of The Young Lady's Friend (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20, but was never wholly successful.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the success}} of the tribute concerts can be {{attributed}} to the amount of press attention received and the eagerness of other artists to participate in the event. As written by Gaby Wood of The Guardian, Wainwright [...] "sparkled on the cover of Time Out New York" [...] and was [...] "adored in the pages of The New York Times" [...] following the Carnegie Hall shows. In fashion designer Marc Jacobs' menswear boutique in Greenwich Village, [...] "virtually nothing was for sale except T-shirts advertising the show" [...] (the bright orange shirts contained the text [...] "RUFUS RUFUS RUFUS" [...] and [...] "world's greatest entertainer", mimicking promotional material used for Garland 45 years earlier). Film director Sam Mendes planned to create a documentary about Wainwright's re-creation and the work leading up to it, though the project fell through. Dutch designers Viktor & Rolf outfitted Wainwright and his family members for the concerts. To <b>return</b> <b>the</b> <b>favor</b> Wainwright wrote the song [...] "Ode to Antidote" [...] and allowed its use in the promotion of the design duo's cologne, [...] "Antidote". He also helped premiere the cologne at the after-party for his first Garland tribute and later performed [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] at the premiere of their Spring 2007 fashion line. Wainwright wore clothing by Tom Ford at the Hollywood Bowl concert. To promote the album, Wainwright's website linked to an online store where fans could purchase merchandise, including several shirt designs, concert posters, programs and other collectibles. Like the shirts sold by Marc Jacobs, much of the promotional material mimicked posters used for Garland's concert years before.|$|E
