5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the <b>reheat</b> from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E

Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant further development into a production aircraft. As a private venture, Hawker proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19June1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine's <b>reheat.</b> In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost in a crash.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the microstructure and precipitation behavior in an ultra-high strength low carbon niobium-vanadium microalloyed steel that was processed by quenching and high frequency induction tempering. Ultrahigh yield strength of ~ 1000. MPa with high elongation of ~ 15 % and high low temperature toughness of 55. J (half thickness) at - 40. °C was obtained after quenching from austenitization at 900. °C for 30. min, and tempering at 600. °C for 15. min by induction <b>reheating</b> with a <b>reheating</b> rate of ~ 50. °C/s. While the yield strength increase on tempering was similar for both induction <b>reheating</b> and conventional <b>reheating</b> (electrical resistance <b>reheating),</b> there was ~ 100 % increase in low temperature toughness in induction <b>reheated</b> steel {{compared to the}} conventional <b>reheating</b> process. The underlying reason for the increase in toughness was attributed to the transformation of cementite film observed in conventional <b>reheating</b> and tempering to nanoscale cementite in induction <b>reheating</b> and tempering. The precipitation of nanoscale carbides is believed to significantly contribute to ultra-high strength, good ductility, and high toughness in the high frequency induction <b>reheating</b> and tempering process. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{this work}} we address the <b>reheating</b> {{issue in the}} context of $F(R) $ gravity, for {{theories}} that the inflationary era does not obey the slow-roll condition but the constant-roll condition is assumed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the <b>reheating</b> {{constraints}} on inflationary models considering perturbatively decaying inflaton. Important difference {{with the existing}} analysis is the inclusion of explicit decaying dynamics of inflaton during <b>reheating.</b> One of the important findings of our analysis is the possible existence of maximum <b>reheating</b> temperature T_re^max considering perturbative <b>reheating</b> scenario. For all the models under consideration {{the value of this}} temperature turned out to be T_re^max∼ 10 ^ 15 GeV. Corresponding to this value of <b>reheating</b> temperature the duration of <b>reheating</b> period assumes naturally small value, N_re≃ 0. 3 which indicates instantaneous <b>reheating.</b> Most importantly, maximum <b>reheating</b> temperature T^max_re also leads to a maximum values of scalar spectral index n^max_s and inflationary e-folding number N^max_cmb in association with the observed CMB scale.

5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core {{is thought to be}} electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing {{because of a lack of}} convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to <b>reheat</b> the crust.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of <b>reheating</b> methods on the color characteristics of precooked pork patties with various NaCl and phosphate levels. NaCl/phosphate levels for each formulation were as follows; N 1 (1 % NaCl), N 1 +P (1 % NaCl+ 0. 3 % phosphate), N 2 (2 % NaCl), and N 2 +P (2 % NaCl+ 0. 3 % phosphate). The <b>reheating</b> methods used were by electric grill and microwave oven. The surface color of the patties <b>reheated</b> by microwave showed more brown and less-intense red, and the phosphate-treated patties <b>reheated</b> by microwave were more reddish and less brownish.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of perturbative <b>reheating</b> on the {{evolution}} of the curvature perturbation ζ, in two-field inflation models. We use numerical methods to explore the sensitivity of f_NL, n_s and r to the <b>reheating</b> process, and present simple qualitative arguments to explain our results. In general, if a large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of <b>reheating,</b> it will remain non zero at the end of <b>reheating.</b> Unless all isocurvature modes have completely decayed before the start of <b>reheating,</b> we find that the non-linearity parameter, f_NL, can be sensitive to the <b>reheating</b> timescale, and that this dependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only have a minimum in one direction. For potentials with a minimum in both directions, f_NL can also be sensitive to <b>reheating</b> if a mild hierarchy exists between the decay rates of each field. Within the class of models studied, we find that the spectral index n_s, is fairly insensitive to large changes in the field decay rates, indicating that n_s is a more robust inflationary observable, unlike the non-linearity parameter f_NL. Our results imply that the statistics of ζ, especially f_NL, can only be reliably used to discriminate between models of two-field inflation if the physics of <b>reheating</b> are properly accounted for.
