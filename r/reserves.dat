5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold <b>reserves</b> {{shortly before}} gold entered a {{protracted}} bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom. The official reason for selling the gold <b>reserves</b> was {{to reduce the}} portfolio risk of the UK's <b>reserves</b> by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.|$|E
