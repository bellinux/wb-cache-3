40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on how teachers' {{professional}} and <b>religious</b> <b>orientations</b> relate to their reaction intentions when confronted with morally critical incidents. The context of the study is the increasing importance of the moral task of teachers which is complex in current secularized and individualized Western society. The main assumption is that both professional and <b>religious</b> <b>orientations</b> constitute a possible source for understanding differences in teachers' behavior during such incidents. The results suggest that both orientations indeed play a role.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore {{the power of the}} five factor model of {{personality}} to explain individual differences recorded on measures of the three <b>religious</b> <b>orientations,</b> a sample of 198 adults in England completed established measures of the three <b>religious</b> <b>orientations</b> (intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest) and the big five personality factors (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness). The data demonstrated that individual differences in the three <b>religious</b> <b>orientations</b> were largely independent of the five personality factors, apart from a significant positive correlation between intrinsic religiosity and agreeableness. These findings support Piedmont’s contention that religiosity is largely independent of personality when personality is operationalised in terms of the big five factors...|$|R

25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as <b>religious</b> <b>orientation</b> and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} <b>religious</b> <b>orientation</b> and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported <b>religious</b> <b>orientation</b> was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E

25|$|More specifically, it {{has been}} seen by Batson as {{comprising}} a willingness to view religious doubts in a positive manner, acceptance that <b>religious</b> <b>orientation</b> can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quest respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).|$|E
5000|$|Religiosity is {{difficult}} to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about <b>religious</b> <b>orientations</b> and involvement.

25|$|Liberal arts {{colleges are}} {{four-year}} institutions that emphasize interactive instruction, although research {{is still a}} component of these institutions. They are usually residential colleges with most students living on campus in dorms. They tend to have smaller enrollments, class sizes, and lower student-teacher ratios than universities, and encourage teacher-student interaction with classes taught by full-time faculty members rather than graduate students known as teaching assistants. There are further distinctions within the category of liberal arts colleges: some are coeducational, women's colleges, or men's colleges. There are historically black colleges; in addition, while most schools are secular, some stress a particular <b>religious</b> <b>orientation.</b> Most are private colleges {{but there are some}} public ones.|$|E
25|$|The Reformation had {{profound}} {{effects on}} the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their <b>religious</b> <b>orientation,</b> but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the French Wars of Religion, which ended in {{the triumph of the}} Bourbon Dynasty. England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under Elizabeth to a moderate Anglicanism. Much of modern-day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the Holy Roman Empire, which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth is notable in this time for its religious indifference and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.|$|E

25|$|Some questionnaires, {{such as the}} <b>Religious</b> <b>Orientation</b> Scale, {{relate to}} {{different}} religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion {{for the purpose of}} psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a social}} {{identity}} approach, Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens). Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural {{environment in which}} one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected {{to others in the}} world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of prosocial behaviors and values, including: intergroup empathy, valuing diversity, social justice, environmental sustainability, intergroup helping, and a felt responsibility to act. Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components, perception of one’s global knowledge, college professors' attitudes toward global citizenship, belief in an intentional worlds view of culture, participation in a fan group that promotes the identity, use of global citizen related words when describing one's values, possible self as a global citizen, religiosity and <b>religious</b> <b>orientation,</b> threat to one’s nation, interdependent self-construal prime, perception of the university environment, and social media usage.|$|E

500|$|Aileen Fyfe, a {{historian}} {{interested in the}} relationship between science and religion, has argued that Trimmer's text, although inspired by Barbauld's books, differs dramatically from Barbauld's in its <b>religious</b> <b>orientation.</b> Barbauld was a Dissenter and more inclined, according to Fyfe, to [...] "encourage curiosity, observation, and reasoning". In contrast, Trimmer, as a high church Anglican, depicted nature as [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] and as a reflection not only of God's divinity but also of his goodness. These beliefs are reflected even {{in the structure of the}} text; Trimmer's aim was to convey a sense of the awe, therefore her text does not progress in an orderly fashion through a study of the natural world. Barbauld's texts, however, emphasize the slow accumulation of knowledge as well as logical thinking. Thus Evenings at Home, which she co-wrote with her brother, John Aikin, has a [...] "systematic structure". Another difference between the two writers lies in the role of authority: whereas Barbauld's texts and those she wrote with her brother, emphasize dialogues between teacher and pupil, Trimmer's textual conversations, Fyfe notes, were [...] "controlled by the parent".|$|E
2500|$|More recently, this {{distinction}} has been encapsulated {{in the terms}} [...] "intrinsic religion", referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout faith, and [...] "extrinsic religion", referring to a more utilitarian use of religion {{as a means to}} an end, such as church attendance to gain social status. These dimensions of religion were measured on the <b>Religious</b> <b>Orientation</b> Scale of Allport and Ross (1967). A third form of <b>religious</b> <b>orientation</b> has been described by Daniel Batson. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{fields to}} which the concept has been applied include {{industrial}} and organizational psychology, sports psychology, educational psychology and the psychology of religion. Richard Kahoe has published work in the latter field, suggesting that intrinsic <b>religious</b> <b>orientation</b> correlates positively (and extrinsic <b>religious</b> <b>orientation</b> correlates negatively) with internal locus. Of relevance to both health psychology and the psychology of religion {{is the work of}} Holt, Clark, Kreuter and Rubio (2003) on a questionnaire to assess spiritual-health locus of control. The authors distinguished between an active spiritual-health locus of control (in which [...] "God empowers the individual to take healthy actions") and a more passive spiritual-health locus of control (where health is left up to God). In industrial and organizational psychology, it has been found that internals are more likely to take positive action to change their jobs (rather than merely talk about occupational change) than externals.|$|E
