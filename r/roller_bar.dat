40|$|In {{the wood}} thick-slicing process, the {{compressive}} force {{acting on the}} pressure bar face and the compressive deflections caused in wood play important roles, but few studies {{have dealt with the}} exact measurements of the deflections, and so, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} obtain several basic information on them. The clear specimens the end grain surface to which were applied thin sensitive films printed grid patterns, were prepared. After being soused in water up to saturated condition, they were set on the experimental apparatus equipped with two 2 -axis dynamometers (Fig. 1). Then, these test specimens were compressed or rolled out by two types of pressure bars in both stationary and feeding state of the feeding carriage. The distributions of the deflections in the specimens were determined from the moiré fringe pattern or the distortion pattern of grid line. Furthermore, in order to determine the effects of pressure bar compression and restraint in the thick-slicing process, cutting tests were carried out on the experimental apparatus, using a <b>roller</b> <b>bar</b> and a single faced nosebar (sharp bar), and the cutting force components acting on the tool face and the compressive force components acting on the pressure bar face were measured with the two 2 -axis dynanometers. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) The vertical component of the compressive force acting on the bar face (Pv) varies largely with the combinations of horizontal distance (h) and vertical distance (v), whereas the horizontal component of the bar force (PH) varies slightly with h and v (Figs. 11 and 12). (2) In slicing with a <b>roller</b> <b>bar,</b> Pv increases largely with decrease in h. Therefore, the tool edge deflection due to overcompression of bar occurs in the smaller range of h (Fig. 10). (3) The distribution pattern of the deflection in the workpiece varies with the types of pressure bars applied, that is, in the case of sharp bar, the high strain concentrates at the loaded point and the distribution of the deflection is limited to a narrower area, but in the case of <b>roller</b> <b>bar,</b> the strain concentration diminishes and the distribution of the deflection spreads in a large area (Photos. 1 ～ 4). (4) Surfaces of the sliced veneer produced with a <b>roller</b> <b>bar</b> are well smoother than those with a sharp bar (Photos. 5 and 6). (5) From these results, it may be concluded that the major factors affecting the quality of the thick-sliced veneer are not only the bar restraint which is determined by the combinations of such factors as h, v, depth of cut (t), cutting angle (θ) and roller diameter of <b>roller</b> <b>bar</b> (D) but also the contact area between the bar face and the workpiece surface...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Rollers {{may provide}} a viable {{alternative}} to herbicides for terminating cover crops; however, excessive vibration generated by rollers and transferred to tractors hinders the adoption of this technology in the United States. To avoid excessive vibration, producers must limit their operational speed, which increases time and cost of rolling. The effect of speed on cover crop termination rate and vibration level was tested on several roller designs. Two field experiments were conducted with different roller designs to terminate a cover crop of rye (Secale cereale L.). In the first experiment, three single-section roller designs (long straight bars, curved blunt bars, and a smooth roller with an oscillating crimping bar) were tested at 1. 6, 4. 8, and 8 km/h operating speeds. In the second experiment, two triple-section commercial width rollers, one with long straight bars and the other, a smooth roller with an oscillating crimping bar, were tested at speeds 3. 2 and 6. 4 km/h. Data from the first experiment showed that all three roller designs terminated at levels greater than 90 % with the highest termination rate produced by the smooth <b>roller</b> with crimping <b>bar</b> (93. 4 %). Three weeks after rolling, termination rates varied from 88. 3 % to 94. 0 % for all designs and speed ranges, all of which were sufficient mortality rates for rye before planting a cash crop without need to use herbicide. Reduced vibration levels measured on the tractor’s frame were generated by the smooth roller with oscillating crimping bar with the highest vibration levels being generated by the roller with the straight bars. In the second experiment, three weeks after rolling significantly higher rye termination rates resulted from the roller with long straight bars (96 %) in comparison with the smooth roller (94 %). Despite these differences, both rollers effectively terminated rye prio...|$|R
