5|$|Another {{study by}} He et al. used a simple {{epidemic}} model, to incorporate three factors including school opening and closing, temperature changes {{over the course}} of the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of November 5, 2014, {{preliminary}} <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Baker won the gubernatorial election.

5|$|Makemake was {{expected}} to have an atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto but with a lower surface pressure. However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake passed in front of an 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light. The <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4–12 nanobar on the pressure at its surface.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 2014, the South African Rand grew 1.2% {{against the}} US dollar, {{reaching}} {{its highest level}} in four months.

5|$|West Alsek was {{selected}} for a test program {{by the addition of}} coal pulverizers—units that crushed coal and mixed it with air for injection into the boilers. She became the first steamship to cross the Atlantic ocean depending solely on pulverized coal. Test <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> she sailed faster and used less coal than before the conversion. West Alsek was later abandoned by the USSB and scrapped in 1933.|$|E
5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the 15,000YBP dire wolves had {{three times more}} tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} {{her guests}} to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> in addition to making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek {{continued to be a}} test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. On the other hand, the nuclear data shows that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, the <b>results</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was {{along the lines of}} social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
