5|$|Judd makes {{a second}} visit to Cortez, {{indicating}} that {{he wishes to}} join the Palladists. In conversation, Judd unintentionally reveals that Jacqueline is staying with Mary at the <b>rooming</b> house. This makes the audience aware that the Palladists were able to trace Jacqueline to Mary's room to kidnap her. In the truncated theatrical print, how the Palladists found Jacqueline is left unclear.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, {{unmarried}} sisters Catherine and Margaret Flannagan ran a <b>rooming</b> house at 5 Skirving Street, Liverpool. The household {{in the final}} months of 1880 consisted of the two sisters, Catherine's son John, and two lodger families – hod carrier Thomas Higgins and his daughter Mary, and Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret. John Flannagan, 22 and previously healthy, died suddenly in December 1880. His death did not raise any particular comment; Catherine collected £71 (worth roughly £ in 2012 pounds) from the burial society with {{which he had been}} registered and he was interred shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|On 3 December 1938, 11 {{years after}} they had first met, Julia married Alf after proposing to him. They were married in the Bolton Street Register Office, and Julia wrote 'cinema usherette' on the {{marriage}} certificate as her occupation, {{even though she had}} never been one. None of Julia's family were there, but Alf's brother Sydney acted as a witness. They spent their honeymoon eating at 'Reece's' restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where his son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema. On their wedding night, Julia stayed at the Stanleys' house and {{he went back to his}} <b>rooming</b> house.|$|E

25|$|About {{four months}} after Jackie {{disappeared}} with their son, she returned and left him with Gardner. By then, he was earning a small salary {{and was able to}} afford <b>rooming</b> in a flophouse.

Although he was gainfully employed, Gardner and his son secretly struggled with homelessness while he saved money for a rental house in Berkeley.|$|E

25|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{began to}} decline {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, when the advent of streetcars and then automobiles allowed prosperous citizens to live farther from downtown: early residents moved out, notably to up-and-coming districts such as Indian Village and Boston–Edison, and Brush Park became less fashionable. The Woodward Avenue frontage rapidly lost its residential character, as the lavish mansions were demolished to make way for commercial buildings; throughout the subdivision, homes were converted to apartments or <b>rooming</b> houses – often with the construction of two- and three-story rear additions – to accommodate workers of the booming automobile industry, and dozens of structures were razed for surface parking lots. By 1921, all of the homes on Alfred Street were apartments or <b>rooming</b> houses.|$|E

25|$|Among Gurley's first {{businesses}} was a <b>rooming</b> house {{which was}} {{located on a}} dusty trail near the railroad tracks.

They would find refuge in Gurley's building, as the racial persecution from the south was non-existent on Greenwood Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{the first}} floor of Old Queens served as {{classrooms}} where recitation was held, and the second floor housed the college's chapel and library. The wings {{on each side of the}} structure served as living quarters for the faculty of the College. At the time, with no dormitories (until 1890), students at Rutgers found housing within <b>rooming</b> houses and other off-campus locations throughout New Brunswick.|$|E
25|$|In the US, China, UK, Ireland and Canada, a {{dormitory}} {{may be a}} room containing more than one bed. Examples are found in British boarding schools and many <b>rooming</b> houses such as hostels but have nowadays completely vanished {{as a type of}} accommodation in university halls of residence. CADs, or cold-air dormitories, are found in multi-level <b>rooming</b> houses such as fraternities, sororities, and cooperative houses. In CADs and in hostels, the room typically has very few furnishings except for beds. Such rooms can contain anywhere from three to 50 beds (though such very large dormitories are rare except perhaps as military barracks). Such rooms provide little or no privacy for the residents, and very limited storage for personal items in or near the beds. Cold-air dorms get their names from the common practice of keeping the windows open year-round, even in winter. The practice emerged based on the theory that circulation and cold air minimizes the spread of disease. Some communal bedrooms keep the name cold-air dorms or cold dorms despite having modern heating or cooling.|$|E

25|$|According to M. William Phelps, {{author of}} The Devil's <b>Rooming</b> House, {{investigation}} appeared {{to show that}} Amy was buying the arsenic to kill large numbers of rats. However, it appears {{that she did not}} buy all of the arsenic which killed her patients. The doctor and some of the patients had signed off to purchase it. The investigation pursued Dr. King because more evidence was piling up against him, but suspicions were focused back on Amy when someone suggested to clearly check all records of arsenic purchases.|$|E
