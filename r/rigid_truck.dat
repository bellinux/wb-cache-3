50|$|A <b>rigid</b> <b>truck</b> {{and full}} trailer are {{articulated}} inside the cargo area length, so a semi-trailer {{can have a}} longer continuous cargo area. Because of this, a semi-trailer can haul longer objects (logs, pipe, beams, railway track). This depends on the legislation; in some European countries, a full trailer can be {{as long as a}} semi-trailer. However, since a <b>rigid</b> <b>truck</b> is longer than a semi-tractor, this increases the overall length of the combination, making it less maneuverable.|$|E

40|$|Demand {{elasticity}} {{for petrol}} or diesel {{is an important}} policy parameter, both from energy security and global warming perspective. Despite an abundance of literature on petrol demand, there are few studies on diesel demand, and even fewer on demand by different vehicle types. This paper aims to model diesel demand for different freight duty vehicle types (e. g. heavy vs. light goods vehicles and <b>rigid</b> vs. articulated <b>trucks)</b> in the UK. We argue that the switch to diesel from petrol engines in the light vehicles sectors could have biased earlier petrol or diesel demand elasticities in Europe, and show that it was indeed {{the case for the}} light goods vehicle sector. Results show that both light and heavy goods vehicles have similar income elasticities, although within the heavy duty sector, articulated trucks are more elastic than <b>rigid</b> <b>trucks.</b> Overall, heavy goods vehicles were responsive to fuel prices, but light goods vehicles were not. Within the heavy duty sector, <b>rigid</b> <b>trucks</b> showed statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks did not respond to changes in fuel prices. Our results show that price-based policies to curb fuel consumption from the light or heavy goods vehicles are unlikely to be effective...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{were done}} on the National Research Council's (NRC) four-actuator road {{simulator}} to verify whether or not dynamic wheel loads could be reproduced using measured road profiles. These experiments have also provided a mean of evaluating a suspension's performance isolated from {{the performance of the}} whole vehicle. Three instrumented vehicles were tested, namely the two <b>rigid</b> two-axle <b>trucks</b> from TRL (Transport Research Laboratory, UK) and FHWA (Federal Highway Administration, USA) and a five-axle tractor-semitrailer from NRC. Results from the two <b>rigid</b> <b>trucks</b> have shown that the accuracy with which dynamic wheel loads can be reproduced is limited mostly by the accuracy of the vehicles' on-board instrumentation. Results found for the NRC vehicle indicated that the performance of a certain suspension and of the whole vehicle must be evaluated independently. (orig.)

40|$|Objectives: Evidence {{concerning}} crash {{risk for}} older heavy vehicle drivers is sparse, {{making it difficult}} to assess if it is prudent to encourage older drivers to remain in the workforce in a climate of labour shortages. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate annual crash rate ratios of older male heavy vehicle drivers relative to their middle aged peers. Methods: Data utilized in this study includes all crashes meeting inclusion criteria involving heavy goods vehicles, categorised as <b>rigid</b> <b>trucks</b> and articulated trucks; this data was recorded by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority. The exposure to the risk of a crash was represented by distance travelled for each vehicle type and year, by age of driver, as estimated by the Australian Survey of Motor Vehicle Use. Negative binomial regression modelling was applied to estimate annual crash incidence rate ratios for male drivers in various age groups. Results: A total of 26, 146 crashes occurred in New South Wales during 1999 - 2006, involving a total of 54, 191 vehicles; removing observations that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 19, 736 observations remained representing 12, 501 crashes. For <b>rigid</b> <b>trucks,</b> the incidence rate ratio for drivers aged 65 + years, compared to 45 - 54. year olds, was 0. 74 (95 % CI 0. 51, 0. 98). For articulated trucks, the annual crash incidence rate ratio for drivers aged 65 + years compared to 45 - 54. year olds was 1. 4 (95 % CI 0. 96, 1. 9), and that for drivers aged 55 - 64. years compared to 45 - 54. year olds was 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 83, 1. 3). Conclusions: Older male professional drivers of heavy goods vehicles have lower risk of crashes in rigid vehicles, possibly due to accrued driving experience and self-selection of healthy individuals remaining in the workforce. Thus, encouraging these drivers to remain in the workforce is appropriate in the climate of labour shortages, as this study provides evidence that to do so would not endanger road safety...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for minimizing the aerodynamic drag that results when tractors, trailers, <b>rigid</b> <b>trucks,</b> lorries, and other vehicles are moving through air. In particular {{the invention relates}} to a plate-shaped flow conductor (31) having a front edge, a lower edge, a rear edge and an upper edge. The flow conductor is mountable along the upper edge (34) in a substantially vertical position to a body portion of a pulled vehicle of a vehicle combination {{of at least two}} pivotally connected vehicles. When mounted the flow conductor extends at least partially under the body portion in a longitudinal- direction of the 1 pulled vehicle. Characteristic for the flow conductor according to the invention is that the flow conductor comprises locally in conjunction with the front edge a thickened portion (78, 85), which has a streamlined outer contour (83, 84) in a cross section transversally to the front edge.

50|$|When using a dolly, which {{generally}} {{has to be}} equipped with lights and a license plate, <b>rigid</b> <b>trucks</b> {{can be used to}} pull semi-trailers. The dolly is equipped with a fifth wheel to which the trailer is coupled. Because the dolly attaches to a pintle hitch on the truck, maneuvering a trailer hooked to a dolly is different from maneuvering a fifth wheel trailer. Backing the vehicle requires same technique as backing an ordinary truck/full trailer combination, though the dolly/semi setup is probably longer, thus requiring more space for maneuvering. The tractor/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor/semi-trailer setup.|$|R
