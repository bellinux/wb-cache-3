500|$|In 2007, it was {{revealed}} that a Broken Sword film was in the works and would be produced by CastleBright studios, although there has been no sign of development for many years, which may indicate that the project has been abandoned. However, in 2015, Matt Smalley of Cheltenham, UK, started fund raising on a new planned Broken Sword film. According to Matt Smalley [...] "Fund Raising is going well, I send out at least 50 emails and Facebook posts a week and hope to <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> target amount shortly. But not before sending out some more emails and recurring Facebook posts." ...|$|E
500|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} active as first lady, however, she had {{less time for}} Hickok. Hickok grew angry and jealous at {{perceived}} slights, and demanded more time alone, which Roosevelt was unable to give; at other times, she attempted unsuccessfully to separate herself from Roosevelt. Though the pair remained friends throughout their lives, they continued to grow apart {{in the years that}} followed. In 1937, Roosevelt wrote to Hickok that [...] "I never meant to hurt you in any way, but that is no excuse having done it [...] [...] [...] I am pulling back from all my contacts now [...] [...] [...] Such cruelty & stupidity is unpardonable when you <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> age." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{singing the}} lines [...] "So rock {{right up to}} the side of my {{mountain}} / Climb until you <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> peak babe my peak, the peak / And reach right into the bottom of my fountain", Beyoncé uses sexual innuendos. [...] She also incorporates similar double entendres and euphemisms in the lyrics, [...] "Reach right into the bottom of my fountain / dip me under to where you can feel my river flow / Rock it till water falls". During the end of the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "You rock hard / I rock steady" [...] eventually [...] "erupting into an orgasmic finish" [...] as stated by Puja Patel of Spin. During the last part, she sings [...] "Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin / And you're comfortable in my skin". It was noted that during the end of the song, the protagonist becomes ready to be sexually subordinate and [...] "discipline" [...] as opposed to the first part where she adopted a more dominant persona; this is further exemplified in the lines [...] "Punish me, punish me please" [...] where Beyoncé uses soft vocals.|$|E

I will not relax till I <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> goal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cuban is {{an admirer}} of author and philosopher Ayn Rand. About Rand's novel The Fountainhead, he said, [...] " [...] was {{incredibly}} motivating to me. It encouraged me to think as an individual, take risks to <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> goals, and responsibility for my successes and failures. I loved it." [...] His political views have leaned toward libertarianism. He held {{a position on the}} centrist Unity08 political organization's advisory council. [...] While leaning towards libertarianism, Cuban posted an entry on his blog claiming paying more taxes to be the most patriotic thing someone can do.|$|E

Sentenced to two years in jail, he was pardoned but exiled to Salonica as a postal clerk.|$|E

2500|$|Adult Swim {{has also}} {{produced}} bumpers parodying the Super Friends. [...] The {{first was a}} clip from the episode [...] "The Time Trap", with bleeping edited in to {{give the appearance of}} profanity. They produced similar clips using other Hanna-Barbera cartoons. In another bumper, they lampooned {{the manner in which the}} Super Friends described every action before completing it (e.g., [...] "I need to <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> utility belt so that I may free myself!") In this commercial, the heroes went to a movie and struggled to find money for popcorn. [...] Several bumpers consist of little more than Aquaman walking into a realistic photograph and then proceeding to dance to some rump-shaking music.|$|E
2500|$|While the Union Army paused, Longstreet {{reinforced}} {{his line}} {{so that there}} were four ranks of infantrymen behind the stone wall. Brig. Gen. Thomas R. R. Cobb of Georgia, who had commanded the key sector of the line, was mortally wounded by an exploding artillery shell {{and was replaced by}} Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw. General Lee expressed concerns to Longstreet about the massing troops breaking his line, but Longstreet assured his commander, [...] "General, if you put every man {{on the other side of}} the Potomac on that field to approach me over the same line, and give me plenty of ammunition, I will kill them all before they <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> line." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, Plunkett {{struggled}} with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. In October 2012, Plunkett signed {{to play for}} Yorkshire. He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, I believe that a fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me <b>reach</b> <b>my</b> goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
