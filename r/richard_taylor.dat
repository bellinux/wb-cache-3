5|$|The {{documentation}} of the surrender of Lieutenant General Richard Taylor's small force in Alabama was another stage {{in the process of}} concluding the American Civil War. The son of former U.S. President Zachary Taylor, <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> commanded the Confederate troops in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana of about ten thousand troops. On May 4 Taylor's subordinate Col. J.Q. Chenowith surrendered the Department to Union officer Col. John A. Hottenstein.|$|E
5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given free rein on material from The Lord of the Rings universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually {{for the first time}} in the game's cut scenes. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when telling a story, and he was pleased to have Weaving on the project as the primary storyteller.|$|E
5|$|Jackson began storyboarding {{the series}} with Christian Rivers in August 1997 and {{assigned}} his crew to begin designing Middle-earth {{at the same}} time. Jackson hired long-time collaborator <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997, famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project. Most of the imagery in the films is based on their various illustrations. Production designer Grant Major was charged {{with the task of}} converting Lee and Howe's designs into architecture, creating models of the sets, while Dan Hennah worked as art director, scouting locations and organising the building of sets.|$|E

5|$|On 30 August 1861, a {{nomination}} meeting {{was held for}} {{the election of a}} Canterbury Superintendent, and to fill the four positions on the Provincial Council available in the City of Christchurch electorate. Moorhouse was returned unopposed as Superintendent, and ten candidates were nominated for the Provincial Council. The election was held the next day, and Brittan topped the polls with 140 votes, followed by Isaac Thomas Cookson with 139, Frederick Thompson with 114, and Richard Westenra with 100, these being the men who were elected. Isaac Luck, Edward Reece, George Wilmer, William Barnard, John Cracroft Wilson, and <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> were defeated.|$|E
5|$|To develop {{fight and}} sword choreography for the series, the filmmakers {{employed}} Hollywood sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson worked {{directly with the}} talent including Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban to develop the film's many sword fights and stunts. Bob Anderson's role in The Lord of the Rings series was highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade. This documentary on sword martial arts also featured Weta Workshop and <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor,</b> The Lord of the Rings illustrator John Howe and actors Viggo Mortensen and Karl Urban. All discussed their roles {{and work on the}} series as related to the sword.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{rendezvous}} with Robert E. Lee's retreating forces at Farmville, Virginia, Breckinridge moved south to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he, Naval Secretary Stephen Mallory, and Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan joined Generals Joseph E. Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard to urge surrender. Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin initially resisted, but eventually asked Major General William T. Sherman to parley. Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who had assumed the presidency on Lincoln's assassination on April 15) rejected them as too generous. On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his men {{would refuse to}} fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at Appomattox.|$|E

Gen. <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor's</b> Army at the {{significant}} Confederate victories at the Battle of Mansfield (April 8, 1864), and the Battle of Pleasant Hill (April 9, 1864), critical engagements in the Red River Campaign.|$|R
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis {{considered}} replacing John Bell Hood {{in command of the}} Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E. Lee to find out if Beauregard would be interested. Beauregard was indeed interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously considered the appointment, and in the end decided to retain Hood. Davis met with Beauregard in Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with the armies of Hood and <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency. Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the assignment.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's Weta Digital {{created the}} visual effects, which {{included}} computer-generated imagery, {{as well as}} scale models (which were necessary to make Wellington look American), prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company {{that had been in}} existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on The Nutty Professor. Makeup artist Brian Penikas (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) fulfilled Baker's duties.|$|E
5|$|Lacking that guidance, discussions {{began on}} how the bequest money should be spent. The City Lands Committee {{suggested}} in a report that the bequest should be spent on educating {{a larger number of}} boys and this approach was adopted in 1826. A number of people including <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor,</b> a printer and an assistant to the founding of University College London, urged the Corporation of London to spend the bequest on creating a day school for the largest possible number of boys. In 1830, they proposed that the City of London Corporation School be founded with Taylor as a governor, and that the school to be established {{on the site of the}} disused London Workhouse. In the mean time, a small number of boys, who became known as Carpenter's scholars, were sent to Tonbridge School. In 1829, an Act of Parliament was passed to transform the workhouse into a school and governors were appointed. Conditions at the workhouse site had deteriorated and much money was needed for its maintenance. The only funds available, though, were the same £300 (about £22,000 in 2008) a year budget the workhouse had received.|$|E

5|$|Universal {{approved}} of the script with Robert Zemeckis as executive producer, and pre-production for King Kong started. The plan was to begin filming sometime in 1997 for a summer 1998 release date. Weta Digital and Weta Workshop, {{under the supervision of}} <b>Richard</b> <b>Taylor</b> and Christian Rivers, began work on early visual effects tests, specifically the complex task of building a CGI version of New York City circa 1933. Jackson and Walsh progressed with a second draft script, sets were being designed and location scouting commenced in Sumatra and New Zealand. In late 1996, Jackson flew to production of the 1997 film Titanic in Mexico to discuss the part of Ann Darrow with Kate Winslet, with whom he previously worked with on his 1994 film Heavenly Creatures. Minnie Driver was also being reportedly considered. Jackson's choices for Jack Driscoll and Carl Denham included George Clooney and Robert De Niro. However, development for King Kong was stalled in January 1997 when Universal became concerned over the upcoming release of the 1998 film Godzilla, as well as other ape-related remakes with the 1998 film Mighty Joe Young and the 2001 film Planet of the Apes. Universal abandoned King Kong in February 1997 after Weta Workshop and Weta Digital had already designed six months worth pre-production. Jackson then decided to start work on The Lord of the Rings film series.|$|E
