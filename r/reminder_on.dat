5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt <b>reminder</b> <b>on</b> the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Less than 20 {{percent of}} elderly and other high-risk persons {{targeted}} for annual influenza vaccination are immunized each year.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of microcompute [...] generated <b>reminders</b> <b>on</b> influenza vaccination rates in a university-based family practice center. The practice uses an interactive encounter form system from which updated clinical information is routinely entered into a cumulative database. During a 2 -month period, 686 patients were identified in the database as eligible to receive influenza vaccine according to accepted criteria. Practice physicians (n = 32) were stratified by level of training and randomized to one of three groups, thereby receiving printed <b>reminders</b> <b>on</b> the encounter forms of all, none, or half of their eligible patients. Patients of physicians who always received reminders were more likely to receive influenza vaccine during the study period than patients of the neve [...] reminded physicians (51 percent versus 30 percent, P < 0. 001). Patients whose physicians received reminders for only half their patients had an intermediate likelihood of receiving a vaccination if a reminder was printed (38 percent) but were less likely than the patients of never-reminded physicians to receive the vaccine if no reminder was printed (20 percent, P < 0. 001).
