40|$|Abstract — Kalman filter is {{an optimal}} {{filtering}} solution in certain cases, however, {{it is more}} often than not, regarded as a non-robust filter. The slight mismatch in noise statistics or process model may lead to large performance deterioration {{and the loss of}} optimality. This research paper proposes an alternative method for robust adaptive filtering concerning lack of information of noise statistics. The method is based on the application of <b>recurrent</b> neural networks <b>trained</b> by a dynamic identity observer. The method is explained in details and tested in the case analysis of object tracking model. Performance evaluation is made for cases of the standard Kalman filter, a noise-adaptive Kalman filter, the adaptive filter with a <b>recurrent</b> neural network <b>trained</b> by a static identity observer, and the adaptive filter with <b>recurrent</b> neural network <b>trained</b> by a dynamic identity observer. The results for different noise statistics as well as noise statistics mismatches are compared and presented.
