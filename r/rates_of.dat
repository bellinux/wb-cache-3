5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|Conveyor belts offer a very {{efficient}} method of loading, with standard loading rates varying between 100 and 700tons per hour, although {{the most advanced}} ports can offer <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> 16,000tons per hour. Start-up and shutdown procedures with conveyor belts, though, are complicated and require time to carry out.

25|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> a RAFT polymerization, that is, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> {{conversion}} of monomer into polymer, mainly {{depends on the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the Propagation reaction (Figure 5) because the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> initiation and termination are {{much higher than the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> propagation. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> propagation is proportional to the concentration, , of the active species P•, whereas the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the termination reaction, being second order, is proportional to the square 2. This means that during rate-retarded RAFT polymerizations, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> formation of termination products is suppressed {{to a greater extent than}} the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> chain growth.|$|R

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E

5|$|Models are {{initialized}} {{using this}} observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid). The data are then {{used in the}} model {{as the starting point}} for a forecast. Commonly, the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations. These equations are initialized from the analysis data and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> change are determined. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> change, and these new <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid.|$|E
