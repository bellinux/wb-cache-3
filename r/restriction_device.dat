5000|$|The Split S {{without a}} {{beginning}} half-roll was a standard manoeuvre in early World War II by German pilots seeking to evade British fighters. The Merlin engine used in British fighters was carburetted, and the float valves would malfunction under negative g-force leading to reduced power or a stalled engine (The German fighters were {{not subject to}} this problem since they used fuel injection). This could be prevented by quarter-rolling the aircraft before starting the dive, but doing so took up enough time to give the German pilots an excellent chance of escaping. The beginnings of a solution was provided by [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a fuel-flow <b>restriction</b> <b>device,</b> and was finally solved by changing from the original S.U. carburetters to Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettors, and later to S.U. injection carburettors.|$|E

However, less {{is known about the}} efficacy of executing a respiratory muscle warm-up (RWU) immediately prior to high-intensity exercise. Our study purpose was to use a practitioner-friendly airflow <b>restriction</b> <b>device</b> to investigate the effects of a high, medium, or low intensity RWU on short, high-intensity exercise and pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic function. Eleven recreationally active, males (24. 9 ± 4. 2 y, 178. 8 ± 9. 0 cm, 78. 5 ± 10. 4 kg, 13. 4 % ± 4. 2 % body fat) cycled at 85 % peak power to exhaustion (TTE) following four different RWU conditions (separate days, in random order) : (1) high; (2) medium; (3) low airflow inspiration restriction, or no RWU. When analyzed as a group, TTE did not improve following any RWU (4. 73 ± 0. 33 min). However, 10 of the 11 participants improved ≥ 25 s in one of the three RWU conditions (average = 47. 6 ± 13. 2 s), which was significantly better than (p < 0. 05) the control trial (CON). Neither blood lactate nor perceived difficulty was altered by condition. In general, respiratory exchange ratios were significantly lower during the early stages of TTE in all RWU conditions. Our findings suggest RWU efficacy is predicated on identifying optimal inspiration intensity, which clearly differs between individuals...|$|E
40|$|Cavitation {{generally}} {{occurs when}} the pressure at certain location drops to the vapor pressure and the liquid water evaporates as a consequence. For the past several decades, numerous experimental researches have been conducted to investigate this phenomenon due to its degradation effects on hydraulic device structures, such as erosion, noise and vibration. A plate orifice is an important <b>restriction</b> <b>device</b> that is widely used in many industries. It serves functions as restricting flow and measuring flow rate within a pipe. The plate orifice is also subject to intense cavitation at high pressure difference, therefore, the simulation research of the cavitation phenomenon within an orifice flow becomes quite essential for understanding the causes of cavitation and searching for possible preventing methods. In this paper, all researches are simulation-oriented by using ANSYS FLUENT due to its high resolution comparing to experiments. Standard orifice plates based on ASME PTC 19. 5 - 2004 are chosen and modeled in the study with the diameter ratio from 0. 2 to 0. 75. Steady state studies are conducted for each diameter ratio at the cavitation number roughly from 0. 2 to 2. 5 to investigate the dependency of discharge coefficient on the cavitation number. Meanwhile, {{a study of the}} flow regime transition due to cavitation is also carried out based on the steady state results. Moreover, a transient study is done to clarify the relationship between cavitation at the orifice and cavitation at the downstream pipe wall. Several conclusions can be made from this numerical study. The discharge coefficient of the orifice plate is independent of cavitation number; As cavitation number decreases, cavitation tends to be more intense and the flow regime transit to super cavitation eventually; In addition to cavitation occurring at the orifice edge, it also initiates at downstream pipe wall...|$|E

40|$|Valves and {{orifices}} are {{the most}} widely devices of flow control used in oil and gas industry. In particular, they are installed in relief piping system {{in order to control}} the discharge flow during potential plant overpressuring scenarios, thus ensuring plant safety. It is a common practice to flow liquid and gas mixtures through such <b>restriction</b> <b>devices.</b> Rigorous models are available to precisely size pressure relief devices operating in single phase flow; however for two-phase flow, no models are considered sufficiently reliable for predicting the relevant flow conditions. In the present paper, two-phase flow of hydrocarbons fluids through an orifice under critical conditions has been numerically investigated. The existing literature has been analyzed and data on two-phase flow of highly volatile mixtures of hydrocarbons through openings have been collected. A comparison has been carried out with numerical simulations carried out by the multiphase flow simulation tool OLGA by SPT. The Henry-Fauske model has been used as orifice choke model and the orifice discharge flow coefficient, required as input by OLGA, has been calculated by Chisholm's model. Comparison between OLGA's results and experimental data shows that Henry-Fauske model markedly underestimates the mass flow rate through the orifice, if Chisholm's model is used to calculate discharge coefficient. It was found that the error of the model could be minimized using different values of orifice discharge coefficient (Cd). A new discharge flow coefficient model, suitable for choked two-phase flow across orifices, is proposed in this study and it has been determined to match the above mentioned experimental measurements...|$|R
