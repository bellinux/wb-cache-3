25|$|The {{production}} of badges and emblems changed in 1956 to the <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> now in current use, thus eliminating the various colored backgrounds. The outside oval was then changed to red. With {{the introduction of}} the Improved Scouting Program in 1972 came an overhaul of many badges and emblems. The new stylized Eagle Scout badge with no text was a major change that proved to be unpopular. It appears that some Scouters commissioned reproductions of the 1956 badge for issue in place of the 1972 version. In 1975 the badge design partially reverted to the 1956 version. 1985 saw a reversion to the 1956 issue with some minor differences. The border and the eagle were done in silver metalized thread and the Be Prepared text was in blue. In 1986 the metalized eagle changed back to standard thread due to problems with wearing and the scroll and text were enlarged. The metalized border was changed to standard thread in 1989. Later variants increased the thread count of the white stripe to eliminate the visible background.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis {{of mouth}} ulcers usually {{consists}} of a medical history followed by an oral examination as well as examination of any other involved area. The following details may be pertinent: The duration that the lesion has been present, the location, the number of ulcers, the size, the color and whether {{it is hard to}} touch, bleeds or has a <b>rolled</b> <b>edge.</b> As a general rule, a mouth ulcer that does not heal within 2 or 3weeks should be examined by a health care professional who is able to rule out oral cancer (e.g. a dentist, oral physician, oral surgeon, or maxillofacial surgeon). [...] If there have been previous ulcers which have healed, then this again makes cancer unlikely.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric rolling of {{thin strip}} has become {{important}} {{due to a}} significant decrease of rolling force, which contributes to obtain the extremely thin strip, to reduce the rolling passes, and to save the energy by a decrease of anneal treatment. In asymmetric rolling of thin strip, <b>edges</b> of work <b>rolls</b> may contact and deform when no or small work roll bending force is applied. Work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact forms a new deformation feature. In this paper, the effects of initial thickness of strip and friction coefficient on the rolling pressure, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact length and strip crown during asymmetric rolling of thin strip with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact effect has been discussed, and the calculated rolling force with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact is compared with the measured value...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of {{cold rolling}} of thin strip with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact was {{performed}} using a developed modified influence function method. Surface roughness of the rolled strip {{on a cold}} rolling mill was characterized by a surface profilometer. <b>Roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact and related surface roughness transfer are discussed. The focus of this work on cold rolling of thin strip was to justify the roll bite contact mechanics and to analyse the friction in the roll bite {{and the effect of}} the friction on the strip profile and the surface finish. The work roll wear and its value are also discussed. The work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact affects the work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> wear significantly. The strip surface finish becomes better after rolling, and the calculated rolling forces are in good agreement with the measured values...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric rolling {{can reduce}} the {{thickness}} of rolled strip and rolling load significantly. In this paper, the asymmetric cold rolling of thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss was analysed theoretically and the rolling pressure, intermediate force between the work roll and backup roll, the work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force, the strip profile after rolling are obtained for this special asymmetric rolling. The rolling pressure, intermediate force, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force and the strip profile are compared for various roll speed ratios, reduction and friction coefficients. Simulation result shows that the roll speed ratio and reduction have significant influence on the profile of rolled strip, and the calculated rolling forces {{are consistent with the}} measured values. The effect of friction in the roll bite on mechanics of the asymmetric cold rolling of thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss is also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The M1942 {{design was}} a result of wartime demands. The <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> on the shell was eliminated, {{creating}} an unfinished edge along the rim. This edge slightly flared out, along the base of the skirt. The elimination of the <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> expedited the manufacturing process and reduced the amount of metal used in each helmet. Shell paint colors were typically matte gray-green (Heer) or gray-blue (Luftwaffe), and the decals were eliminated in 1943 to speed up production and reduce the helmet's combat visibility. Greater manufacturing flaws were also observed in M1942 helmets made late in the war.|$|E
50|$|Some {{contemporary}} cap-style {{hard hats}} feature a <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> {{that acts as}} a rain gutter to channel rainwater to the front, allowing water to drain off the bill, instead of running down the wearer's neck. A cowboy hard hat is a hard hat resembling a wide brimmed cowboy hat, although some organizations disallow their use.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the cold}} rolling {{experiments}} of ultra thin steel strip {{were carried out}} on an experimental rolling mill. The cold rolling of ultra thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss was analysed theoretically, and the rolling force, intermediate force between the work roll and backup <b>roll,</b> the <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force, the strip shape after rolling are obtained for this special rolling, and they are compared for various reduction and friction coefficients. Simulation {{results show that the}} reduction has a significant influence on the shape of rolled strip, and the calculated rolling forces and strip profile are consistent with the measured values. The effect of friction in the roll bite on cold rolling of ultra thin strip with <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss is also discussed. Surface characteristic was measured and it is shown that the steel surface roughness value reduces with an increase of reduction...|$|R
40|$|An {{influence}} function method {{has been developed}} to simulate the asymmetric cold rolling of thin strip with work <b>roll</b> kiss at <b>edges.</b> The numerical simulation model was obtained based on the deformation compatibility of the roll system in rolling and lateral directions. The strip plastic deformation has been considered in the formulation, which is {{significantly different from the}} traditional theory of metal rolling. The rolling mechanics and crown of the strip with work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss, which are new findings for cold rolling of thin strip, are obtained. A comparison of the rolling force, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force and the strip crown after rolling has been conducted for various cross shear regions in the roll bite. Results show that the calculated strip crown is in good agreement with Ameasured value, and the rolling force and strip crown decrease with an increase of cross shear regions, as well as the work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> kiss force and edge wear decrease. The friction also has an influence on the profile of the rolled thin strip...|$|R
40|$|Multi-pass slab vertical-horizontal (V-H) {{rolling process}} with {{variable}} <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> shape have been simulated with explicit dynamic {{finite element method}} and updating geometric method. The distributions of plastic strain contour in slab during rolling process with different <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> and under different rolling stage have been obtained. The results show that there exist two thin strain assembling zones in slab when the flat <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> is used, and there just exist one strain assembling zone in slab when the <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> with groove is used. And compared the deformation equality between flat <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> and <b>edging</b> <b>roll</b> with groove, the later {{is better than the}} former, which supplies the theory prove to the slab deformation distribution during V-H rolling process and is helpful for predicting the slab texture...|$|R

50|$|Visually, a {{very sharp}} knife has an edge that {{is too small to}} see with the eye; it may even be hard or {{impossible}} to focus in a microscope. The shape near the edge can be highlighted by rotating the knife and watching changes in reflection. Nicks and rolled edges can also be seen, as the <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> provides a reflective surface, while a properly straightened edge will be invisible when viewed head-on.|$|E

50|$|Plants in this genus are small, woody {{shrubs and}} subshrubs. They have leaves with <b>rolled</b> <b>edges,</b> phyllaries with white to opaque tips, and staminate central florets. The plants grow in high-elevation habitat types.|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric rolling is used {{to produce}} thinner strip, which can reduce rolling force significantly. When a thinner strip is rolled on a rolling mill, work <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> may contact each other, which affects the {{mechanics}} of this special asymmetric rolling and the crown of the rolled strip. In this paper, the authors developed a numerical model to simulate this special rolling and obtained the rolling force, intermediate force, <b>roll</b> <b>edge</b> contact force, the crown of the rolled strip and the edge contact length. The effects of the initial thickness of strip and the friction variation at upper and lower work rolls on the rolling force and crown of the rolled strip are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the patient's sexual history and on physical examination revealing a painless, [...] "beefy-red ulcer" [...] with a characteristic <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> of granulation tissue. In contrast to syphilitic ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy is generally mild or absent. Tissue biopsy and Wright-Giemsa stain are used to aid in the diagnosis. The presence of Donovan bodies in the tissue sample confirms donovanosis. Donovan bodies are rod-shaped, oval organisms that {{can be seen in the}} cytoplasm of mononuclear phagocytes or histiocytes in tissue samples from patients with granuloma inguinale.|$|E

50|$|Steeling helps {{maintain}} sharpness. This process realigns the edge, correcting for dulling causes {{such as a}} <b>rolled</b> <b>edge.</b> A sharpening {{steel is}} a type of hardened cylindrical rod used similarly to honing stones. For example, a butcher steel is a round file with the teeth running the long way, while a packer steel (used in the meat packer's industry) is a smooth, polished steel rod designed for straightening the turned edge of a knife, and is also useful for burnishing a newly finished edge. Because steels have a small diameter they exert high local pressure, and therefore affect the knife metal when used with very little force. They are intended for mild steel knives that are steeled several times a day, but are not well suited for today's tougher and harder blade steels. Diamond steels are now available that have an industrial diamond coating and can remove blade metal as well as straighten, therefore used correctly they can re-profile a knife instead of just honing.|$|E

5000|$|This is a shrub {{which is}} quite {{variable}} in appearance. There are many varieties, {{some of which are}} isolated to small geographical distributions.

5000|$|The {{more acute}} the blade the more easily it will dull. As the blade is thin {{there is little}} {{material}} to remove from the fine edge before the edge is worn away to a thicker section. Also, thin blades will fracture easily. Thin edges are also very weak and the edge can literally roll over when force is applied it to and form something like the bottom part of a letter [...] "J". Straight edge razors, for example, are frequently stropped not to grind metal from the edge but to straighten the edge. Sharpening blades by grinding the edge thin {{to such a degree}} that a burr results on the side of the edge away from the stone. This burr, like the <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> of a straight edge razor or other knife, can be felt by running the finger from the spine to the edge and it will only be felt on the curled side. Steeling, whether on a grooved or smooth steel or even very gentle pressure on a curved stone, can straighten this roll as can stropping.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} to design blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> terminations for arbitrary rim shape compact range main reflectors is presented. The reflector may be center-fed or offset-fed. The design procedure {{leads to a}} reflector which has a continuous and smooth surface. This procedure also ensures small diffracted fields from the junction between the paraboloid and the blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> while satisfying certain constraints regarding the maximum height of the reflector and minimum operating frequency of the system.

40|$|Compact ranges offer many {{advantages}} over {{other types of}} ranges, {{and as a result}} much effort is being directed toward the improvement of their performance. The use of concave edge contours and blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> terminations to reduce the unwanted energy diffracted into the target zone from the termination of the main reflector is discussed. The proposed shaping of the edge contour minimizes the diffracted fields by virtue of reducing the spread factor; whereas, the blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> terminations reduce the diffracted fields by creating a smooth transition in the reflected field. Two design examples are treated in order to illustrate these concepts...|$|E
