50|$|Basketball cards {{will feature}} {{one or more}} players of the National Basketball Association, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Olympic {{basketball}}, Women's National Basketball Association, Women's Professional Basketball League, or some other basketball related theme. The first basketball cards were produced in 1910, in a series cataloged as College Athlete Felts B-33. The complete series included ten different sports, with only 30-cards being associated with basketball. The cards were issued as a cigarette <b>redemption</b> <b>premium</b> by Egyptiene Cigarettes. The number of cigarette packages needed to redeem for the tobacco cards is not known.|$|E
25|$|Yield: Yield of the {{convertible}} bond at the issuance date, could {{be different from}} the coupon value if the bond is offering a <b>premium</b> <b>redemption.</b> In those cases the yield value would determine the <b>premium</b> <b>redemption</b> value and intermediary put redemption value.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Premium</b> <b>redemption</b> {{convertibles}} such as {{the majority}} of French convertibles and zero-coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs), provide a fixed interest return at issue which is significantly (or completely) {{accounted for by the}} appreciation to the redemption price. If, however, the bonds are converted by investors before the maturity date, the issuer will have benefited by having issued the bonds on a low or even zero-coupon. [...] The higher the <b>premium</b> <b>redemption</b> price, (1) the more the shares have to travel for conversion to take place before the maturity date, and (2) the lower the conversion premium has to be at issue to ensure that the conversion rights are credible.|$|R
