5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the <b>relative</b> <b>angle</b> of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Use of the Sensor Bar {{allows the}} Wii Remote {{to be used}} as an {{accurate}} pointing device up to 5meters (approx. 16ft) away from the bar. The Wii Remote's image sensor is used to locate the Sensor Bar's points of light in the Wii Remote's field of view. The light emitted from each end of the Sensor Bar is focused onto the image sensor which sees the light as two bright dots separated by a distance [...] "mi" [...] on the image sensor. The second distance [...] "m" [...] between the two clusters of light emitters in the Sensor Bar is a fixed distance. From these two distances m and mi, the Wii CPU calculates the distance between the Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar using triangulation. In addition, rotation of the Wii Remote with respect to the ground can also be calculated from the <b>relative</b> <b>angle</b> of the two dots of light on the image sensor. Games can be programmed to sense whether the image sensor is covered, which is demonstrated in a Microgame of , where if the player does not uncover the sensor, the champagne bottle that the remote represents will not open.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} to the static convergence and purity problems {{is a set of}} color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their magnetic fields parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [...] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the <b>relative</b> <b>angle</b> between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{directional}} analysis tool for On-line signatures that decomposes the given input signature into directional bands {{on the basis}} of <b>relative</b> <b>angles.</b> Our directional analysis tool takes the independent trajectories (horizontal and vertical) as an input and then decomposes them into directional bands {{on the basis of}} <b>relative</b> <b>angles.</b> We have used both user-dependent and user-independent thresholds for selecting an optimal number of partitions for each signer. By decomposing signature trajectories based upon <b>relative</b> <b>angles</b> of an individual’s signature, the resulting process {{can be thought of as}} one that exploits inter-feature dependencies. In the verification phase, distances of each partitioned trajectory of a test signature are calculated against a similarly partitioned template trajectory for a known signer. Each partition is then weighted based on its quality and quantity. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach to On-line signature verification in comparison with other techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>relative</b> contact <b>angle</b> (θRCA) {{for seven}} iron ore fines was {{measured}} by using Washburn Osmotic Pressure method under laboratory conditions. By choosing cyclohexane as the reference that can perfectly wet iron ore particles, the <b>relative</b> contact <b>angles</b> were measured and varied from 57 ° to 73 °. With the volume % of goethite (φG) as the variable, a new model for <b>relative</b> contact <b>angle</b> was developed. The expected <b>relative</b> contact <b>angle</b> for pure goethite is about 56 °, while that for goethite free samples is about 77 °. Physical properties, such as surface morphology (SMI) and pore volume (Vpore) can influence the <b>relative</b> contact <b>angle.</b> The φG can be expressed {{as a function of}} SMI and VPore. Thus, we inferred that the <b>relative</b> contact <b>angle</b> is a function of φG for the iron ores used. The measured <b>relative</b> contact <b>angles</b> were found to be in good agreement (Radj 2 > 0. 97) with the calculated ones based on the research from Iveson, et al. (2004). Comparing with the model developed by Iveson et al. (2004), the new model for contact angle proposed in this paper is similar, but more detailed with two meaningful physical parameters. The modification of physicochemical properties on iron ores would be another topic in the further study on granulation...|$|R

We find that the Hall effect notably changes the magnetic torques in the pseudo-disk, and strengthens and weakens the magnetic braking in cores with an acute and obtuse <b>relative</b> <b>angles</b> between and, respectively. This suggests that the bimodal evolution of the disk size may occur in early disk evolutionary phase even if and are randomly distributed.

Utilizing the LaSalle's invariance principle, we prove that the system is stable. Specially, we develop a flocking controller in local form. By using the local controller, the robots in the flocking system only need to know local information (relative distances and <b>relative</b> <b>angles</b> between neighbours). To evaluate performance of the flocking system, we simulate the flocking system tracking trajectories with different shapes. The local flocking algorithm is tested with three Pioneer robots.
