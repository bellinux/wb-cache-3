5|$|Aspirin {{decomposes}} {{rapidly in}} solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses {{in contact with}} moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds <b>rapidly</b> <b>and</b> the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to reproduce vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they can spread <b>rapidly,</b> <b>and</b> may need to be controlled as weeds.|$|E

5|$|By the 1870s the {{population}} of Caversham was growing <b>rapidly,</b> <b>and</b> in 1877, with {{the population}} at around 4,000, it was declared a borough.

5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. There is little evidence of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew <b>rapidly</b> <b>and</b> 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to winter {{closures}} due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which can create sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline. Several Emergency Detour Routes {{have been established}} further inland to guide drivers around such closures.

5|$|It has {{recently}} been determined that the echolocation vocalizations {{do not agree with}} evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison.

5|$|On July 6, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa. Moving westward, the disturbance gradually organized until July10, at which point convection became more concentrated, and it is estimated Tropical Depression Five formed in the central tropical Atlantic that evening. Late on July11, it strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Emily. Initially forecast to strengthen <b>rapidly</b> <b>and</b> move west-northwest through the Greater Antilles, Emily instead moved almost due west toward the Windward Islands, remaining a moderate tropical storm. The storm languished while moving quickly west, and struggled with maintaining its form. Contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind, Hurricane Dennis had made portions of the Caribbean Sea warmer, and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development. Late on July13, Emily strengthened <b>rapidly</b> <b>and</b> reached hurricane strength while passing Tobago and entering the eastern Caribbean. On July14, Emily made landfall in northern Grenada with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E
5|$|Scouting in South Africa grew <b>rapidly,</b> <b>and</b> in 1912 Robert Baden-Powell visited South African Scouts.

These councils had no direct {{contact with each other}} and reported directly to Imperial Scout Headquarters in London.|$|E
