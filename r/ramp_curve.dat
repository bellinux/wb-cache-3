40|$|A {{suitable}} short-time {{test for}} analysis of long term stability is presented for the case of passivated NiCr thin film resistors revealing an aging characteristic which is not of Arrhenius type. Based on the in-situ measurement of resistance change during a continuous temperature rise, so-called temperature <b>ramp</b> <b>curve,</b> a well-defined correlation is found between the film stability and a characteristic temperature Tp where the temperature <b>ramp</b> <b>curve</b> exhibits a maximum. In this way, a reliable prediction of the long term stability can be made within only a few hours. The influence of the heating rate on the characteristic temperature Tp is shown. Furthermore, it is experimentally proved that the values of Tp are not essentially determined by the reversible resistance changes due to differential temperature coefficient of resistance, but indeed by irreversible aging processes...|$|E
40|$|Mountainous freeways always {{suffer from}} {{accidents}} due to special terrain, weather conditions, driving environment, and so on. Based on {{the records of}} 898 accidents that occurred on mountainous freeways in Chongqing during the past 6 years, the partial proportional odds model is used to identify the factors affecting the accident severity. The time of the accident, season, involvement of trucks, accident characteristics, speeding, maximum driving experience of involved drivers, and weather and road conditions {{are found to be}} important for the levels of accident severity. Zero to 6 [*]a. m. and 19 to 24 [*]p. m. are the times prone to serious traffic accidents. The probability of serious traffic accidents in summer and autumn is greater than that in spring and winter. Once a truck is involved in an accident, the consequence is often more severe. Turnover and speeding will result in a grave accident. When there is an experienced driver, the probability of serious traffic accidents is low. The fog is extremely unfavorable weather conditions. The probability of serious accident happening in the downgrade, <b>ramp,</b> <b>curve,</b> bridge, and tunnel sections is greater than the others.

40|$|In {{order to}} relieve traffic congestion, irregularly-shaped bridges {{have been widely}} used in urban overpasses. However, the {{analysis}} on modal characteristics of irregularly-shaped bridges is not exhaustive, and the effect of design parameters on modal characteristics will be deeply investigated in future studies. In this paper, a novel strategy based on a free-interface mode synthesis algorithm is proposed to evaluate the parameters’ effect on the modal characteristics of irregularly-shaped bridges. First, a complicated, irregularly-shaped bridge is divided into several substructures based on its properties. Then, the modal characteristics of the overall structure can be obtained, only by a few low-order modal parameters of each substructure, using a free-interface mode synthesis method. A numerical model of a typical irregularly-shaped bridge is employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Simulation results reveal that the free-interface mode synthesis method possesses favorable calculation accuracy for analyzing the modal characteristics of irregularly-shaped bridges. The effect of design parameters such as <b>ramp</b> <b>curve</b> radius, diaphragm beam stiffness, cross-section feature, and bearing conditions on the modal characteristics of an irregularly-shaped bridge is evaluated in detail. Analysis results can provide references for further research into and the design of irregularly-shaped bridges...|$|E

The electrical traction chain was well analyzed and studied from the Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) battery, the buck {{boost to the}} mechanical load behavior. The speed of the four wheels is calculated independently during the turning with the electronic differential system computations which distributes torque and power to each in-wheel motor according to the requirements, adapts the speed of each motor to the driving conditions. The basic idea of this work is to maintain the initial {{battery state of charge}} (SOC) equal to 60 % and the prototype was tested in several topology conditions and under speed. Our electric vehicle direct torque control is simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK environment. 4 WD Electric vehicle (EV) has demonstrated satisfactory results in all kind of roads constraints: straight, <b>ramp,</b> <b>curved</b> road and downhill.

40|$|Deceleration lanes are {{important}} because they help drivers transition from high-speed lanes to low-speed ramps. Although {{they are designed to}} allow vehicles to depart the freeway safely and efficiently, many studies report high accident rates on exit ramps with the highest percentage of crashes taking place in deceleration lanes. This paper describes the results of adriving simulator study that focused on driving performance while approaching a divergence area and decelerating during the exiting maneuver. Three different traffic scenarios were simulated to analyze the influence of traffic volume on driving performance. Thirty drivers drove in the simulator in these scenarios while data on their lateral position, speed and deceleration were collected. Our results indicate there are considerable differences between the main assumptions of models generally used to design decelerationlanes and actual driving performance. In particular, diverging drivers begin to decelerate before arriving at the decelerationlane, causing interference with the main flow. Moreover, speeds recorded {{at the end of the}} decelerationlane exceed those for which the <b>ramp's</b> <b>curves</b> are designed; this creates risky driving conditions that could explain the high crash rates found in studies of exit ramps. Finally, statistical analyses demonstrate significant influences of traffic volume on some aspects of exiting drivers’ performance: lower traffic volume results in elevated exiting speed and deceleration, and diverging drivers begin to decelerate earlier along the main lane when traffic volume is low. However, speeds at the end of the decelerationlane and the site of lane changing are not significantly influenced by traffic volume...|$|R

40|$|The jughandle is a {{category}} of unconventional intersection that redistributes left turns to improve capacity and safety. The New Jersey Department of Transportation, a pioneer in jughandle design, classifies jughandles as either Type A (forward ramp intersecting the cross street), Type B (forward <b>ramp</b> <b>curving</b> left to intersect the mainline), or Type C (reverse loop ramp). This research has developed {{a new type of}} jughandle design referred to as Type A+B. This design closes the minor approaches at intersections and directs traffic through a jughandle onto the mainline. It also accommodates U-turns and mainline left turns {{in a manner similar to}} traditional Type B jughandles. A unique type of signal phasing, developed to accommodate this design, allows both jughandles to move concurrently. This type of intersection is hypothesized to be most appropriate for the retrofit of suburban arterials requiring installation of a median barrier. The retrofit would install a median barrier with the jughandles, and eliminate signals at intersections with low cross-street volumes, replacing them with right turns followed by U-turns (RTUT). The objective of this research is to determine whether this is an appropriate context for the design, and under what general volume conditions the Type A+B jughandle can reduce delay. Simulation software was used to compare performance measures for the Type A+B jughandle against a conventional intersection and a traditional Type A jughandle, for a wide range of traffic volumes whose turn movement proportions were modeled after a suburban arterial. The research also tested use of this design on an existing suburban arterial in the Pittsburgh region. Measures of performance evaluated include intersection delay, additional footprint, fuel consumption, and number of stops. It was found that the Type A+B jughandle significantly reduced delay under high-volume conditions, and resulted in a much larger intersection footprint...|$|R
