2500|$|In April 1970, the {{government}} drew up an Action Programme for the Promotion of the <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Handicapped</b> <b>Persons.</b> During that same year, bills were tabled to extend and increase housing allowances (passed in 1970), to extend and standardise {{the promotion of}} vocational training (passed in 1971), to automatically index pensions for war victims (passed in 1970), to increase family allowances (passed in 1970), and to reform “shop rules” (which came into force in 1972). In 1974, a bankruptcy allowance was introduced for employed persons when their employers became insolvent. Developments in accident insurance led to the inclusion of schoolchildren, students and children at kindergarten and thus to more widespread measures for accident prevention. In addition, farm and household assistance was introduced as a new service in agricultural accident insurance. A major pension reform law extended the accessibility of pension insurance by providing generous possibilities for backpayments of contributions, while adjustment of currently paid out pensions was brought forward by 6 months. The Rehabilitation and Assimilation Law of 1974 improved and standardised benefits for the disabled, while a law was passed that same year on {{the establishment of an}} additional relief fund for persons employed in agriculture and forestry. The Law on the Improvement of Works’ Old Age Schemes of 1974 brought conditional non-forfeiture of qualifying periods for works pensions as well as the prohibition of cuts in works pensions due to increases in social insurance pensions. In addition, a number of reforms in areas such as civil and consumer rights the environment, education, and urban renewal were carried out. in 1972, a pension reform act was passed which, according to one historical study, ensured that workers “would not suffer financial hardship and could maintain an adequate standard of living after retirement.” In 1973, sickness benefits became available in cases where a parent had to care for a sick child. In March 1974, Social Assistance (SA) was expanded, “concerning family supplements, means test, and certain additional payments.” ...|$|E

The field of active exoskeletons experiences also its renaissance and attracts an increasing attention of researchers worldwide. The objective of this article was to indicate the beginnings and review the history of the development of active exoskeletons, their original purpose and role in the systems for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> severely <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons.</b> The present-day development of active exoskeletons has to a large extent determined their future and applications in both the military and some specific activities that come out of the frame <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> systems and go deeply into special systems for enhancing power and expanding physical and working capabilities of the man. However, the beginnings of robotics, and especially of humanoid robotics, did not foreshadow such a progress. We take a look back on the beginnings of the development of humanoid robots, especially bipedal locomotion systems and active exoskeletons, whose development {{marked the beginning of the}} research in the domain of humanoid robotics.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of professional preparation and employment <b>of</b> visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons.</b> Employment <b>of</b> <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> {{is a general}} problem. Visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> belong to group with the least prospect on labour market but it is concurrently clear {{that they want to}} be employed. The theoretical part of this thesis is focused to definition <b>of</b> visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> including specificities <b>of</b> their development. The second chapter deals with teaching the visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> in primary-, secondary- and tertiary education, with attention paid also to the choice of profession. Conclusion of the theoretical part deals with employment <b>of</b> visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> and namely with employment policy. The practical part describes concepts of and expectations from employing the visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons,</b> motivation to work, a valuation list of the respondent visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> and a role of parents in the choice of profession. Furthermore, it describes accomplishments necessary for job finding gained by the respondent visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons,</b> opinions on possible causes of unemployment <b>of</b> visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> and supporting mechanisms of employing such persons, utilized by particular respondents. Research was carried out in a form of dialogue with six visually handicapped respondents with handicaps in the range of amblyopia and sightlessness. One of the main goals of this thesis was to monitor study possibilities for visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons.</b> The next goal was to find out what were the problems <b>of</b> visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> during their studies, what was perceived as obstacles during studies, during the choice of profession or, appropriately, during pursuance of the profession. A problem may be in wrong choice of the school e. g. due to insufficient self-confidence <b>of</b> the <b>handicapped</b> <b>person</b> and low confidence of the family and teachers. Prejudice of the employers is an important and still persisting problem, as well as the lack of job opportunities for visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons.</b> In my opinion, the possibilities for employment <b>of</b> visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> do improve but there are persisting barriers mainly in the attitudes of intact people and potential employers. They are frequently affected by insufficient information on the support and possibilities of employing <b>persons</b> with visual <b>handicap.</b> The attitude <b>of</b> the nowaday´s society placing emphasis on quickness and quantity plays its role also. With visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> it is necessary to build up their self-confidence already since their childhood. Contemporarily, it would be appropriate to enhance the awareness of potential employers, what could be provided by means of media and seminars. Cooperation of intact pupils with visually handicapped ones could be carried out at schools. It would be necessary to perceive the handicap as something common already since the childhood. However, to change thinking of the society may still last long...|$|R
