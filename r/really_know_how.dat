500|$|The {{concept of}} Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper, {{president}} of Screen Gems, and was shared with David Loughery, {{who wrote the}} screenplay. Producer William Packer read the script and signed on; executive producers for the film were Glenn S. Gainor, Jeff Graup, Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson, Beyoncé, Mathew Knowles, Damon Lee and Loughery, while Nicholas Stern and George Flynn served as co-producer and associate producer, respectively. Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board. Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black–white theme was ignored; [...] "It's {{not mentioned in the}} film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ... To me, that was very refreshing that the studio execs didn't want to make an issue of it." [...] Obsessed was allocated a production budget of $20 million. Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters' motivations. Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as [...] "not a villain in a traditional sense; she's not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody's life. She really believes that [...] is in love with her." [...] Lisa's past was deliberately omitted from the film, explaining, [...] "It's scarier if we never <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> she's developed this personality that can go from very loving to ultimately deadly." ...|$|E
500|$|Bauer {{said that}} {{nobody in the}} {{administration}} itself directly discussed the offer with Sestak, {{and he does not}} believe there was anything improper, illegal or unethical about the conduct. Republicans in Congress disagreed, arguing the action contradicted claims Obama made during his presidential campaign about ethical conduct and transparency in government. Darrell Issa, in particular, felt it was an impeachable offense and referred to it as [...] "Obama's Watergate". Nevertheless, the matter gradually became less of a focus during the primary election, where other topics like spending and the economy took the spotlight. With Issa poised to become chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform following the Republican Party recapturing the house during the 2010 midterm elections, it was widely expected he would launch an official investigation into the job offer based on his prior critical comments about the matter. However, on November 5, Issa announced he would not pursue an investigation. Some politicians and members of the media said that the job offer made to Sestak was neither illegal nor abhorrent, and that such deals are regularly made by politicians of all levels. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post felt the matter only appeared to be a scandal because the White House badly mishandled the response, and Chicago Tribune writer John Kass wrote, [...] "Offering a spot to an ambitious young politician to protect an old servile weakling isn't new. Presidents do it, governors do it. Big-city mayors <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Hendrix {{defense team}} did not dispute that the drugs {{were found in}} his bag. They instead {{developed}} a strategy intended to demonstrate {{that he was not}} aware of its contents. Further, they offered substantiated accounts of how common it was for him to receive gifts from fans, which often included drugs. Hendrix was called as the first witness for the defense; he testified that fans showered gifts on him, including teddy bears, scarves, clothing, and jewelry. He explained that while in Beverly Hills, California, a female fan had given him a vial of what he thought was Bromo-Seltzer—a legal medication—which he put in his bag without knowledge of the illegal substances contained therein. Malone countered: [...] "You are charged with a serious offense, and your evidence is you don't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it got there, or who put it there", to which Hendrix responded: [...] "Yes." [...] The prosecutor then held up the aluminum tube in which the hashish was found and asked Hendrix to explain what he thought it was, he replied: [...] "A pea shooter", drawing uproarious laughter from the court. When asked about his drug use, he denied that he had ever used heroin or amphetamines, but admitted to smoking cannabis and hashish. He also admitted that he had used cocaine twice and LSD five times. He testified that his cannabis use had declined over the previous year, stating: [...] "I feel I have outgrown it". Hendrix admitted that he had seen people use heroin, but denied any further knowledge of the drug. He testified that he was given some gifts at a fan club meeting for the Beatles that were intended for the English group; when he opened them he found several joints as well as what appeared to be doses of LSD.|$|E

The reference of such terms as mass is only partially determined: we don't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> Newton intended his use of this term to be applied. As a consequence, neither of the two terms fully denotes (refers). It follows that it is improper to maintain that a term has changed its reference during a scientific revolution; it is more appropriate to describe terms such as [...] "mass" [...] as [...] "having undergone a denotional refinement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kiedis {{was briefly}} {{kicked out of}} the band, and given a month to rehabilitate. Kiedis {{completed}} the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Flea has referred to the album as [...] "the 'rockingest' record" [...] the band has ever made. The Uplift Mofo Party Plan proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums, registering at number 148 on the Billboard 200. Following the Uplift tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed. On 28 June 1988, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to deal with that sadness, and I don't think [...] knew {{how to deal with it}} either." [...] Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.|$|E
2500|$|Richter {{explained}} {{his approach to}} performance as follows: [...] "The interpreter is really an executant, carrying out the composer's intentions to the letter. [...] He doesn't add anything that isn't already in the work. [...] If he is talented, he allows us to glimpse {{the truth of the}} work that is in itself a thing of genius and that is reflected in him. [...] He shouldn't dominate the music, but should dissolve into it." [...] Or, similarly: [...] "I am not a complete idiot, but whether from weakness or laziness have no talent for thinking. I know only how to reflect: I am a mirror [...] [...] [...] Logic does not exist for me. I float on the waves of art and life and never <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to distinguish what belongs to the one or the other or what is common to both. Life unfolds for me like a theatre presenting a sequence of somewhat unreal sentiments; while the things of art are real to me and go straight to my heart." ...|$|E

The romantic feelings quickly resurface when the duo pretend to be romantically involved to spite Michael. [...] "Kiki has rediscovered her feelings for Morgan, for sure" [...] said Erin.
