40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe interaction {{of a sound}} field and a seamount has been studied by physically modeling the ocean surface over 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional models of Dickens Seamount. By using a smooth ocean surface, and one with a surface of scaled Rayleigh roughness to model a 35 knot wind, the relative contributions are determined for off-axis scattering elements, multiple reflection from the ocean surface, and diffraction over {{the crest of the}} seamount. Boundary wave generation over a randomly <b>rough</b> <b>plane</b> <b>surface</b> is studied experimentally. The ratio of boundary wave amplitude to volume wave amplitude is found to be proportional to (frequency) ³/² and (range) ¹/² and the ratio of the empirical scattering parameter to the rms height of the roughness elements is found to be approximately 0. 3. The spatial correlation length of the randomly rough surface takes the place of the center-to-center separation of the hemispherical bosses used in Tolstoy's theoretical treatment.

40|$|The laws of {{friction}} are reasonably well understood {{for the case}} of blocks in contact with <b>rough</b> <b>plane</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, as far as bodies with circular sections are concerned, the physics {{of friction}} becomes more involving {{and it is not}} possible to adopt a simple conceptual framework to explain all phenomena. In particular, there is no approach so far to the problem of the resistance force that opposes to circular bodies that remain at rest while acted upon by small forces. Here we fill this gap by introducing a mechanical model based on both the elasticity theory and Hertz contact mechanics. Our approach furnishes a quantitative expression for the critical force beyond which rest can no longer be maintained. Besides confirming the expected proportionality of the resistance force with the load, our result contains no free parameters and is expressed solely in terms of physical properties of the problem, such as the pressure of the body per unit of superficial area, a relation between the Young modulus of the surface and its Poisson ratio, and the symmetry of the contact.

40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} {{have been}} used to throw light on the mechanical deformation and the atomic mixing processes taking place when two different metallic systems collide at low temperature. To this end, two semicrystals terminating with a free surface were pushed each against the other at a given relative velocity. Surfaces of different roughness were considered under different impact conditions. Simple mechanical loads on <b>plane</b> <b>surfaces</b> did not induce any significant mixing of atomic species at the interface, observed instead in collisions involving either <b>rough</b> <b>surfaces</b> or <b>plane</b> <b>surfaces</b> undergoing a relative sliding. In the case of rough surfaces, the local contact between the semicrystals is initially sustained by surface asperities. The atoms there located experience thus sudden mechanical loads and an unusual localization of kinetic energy, which enhance their mobility and favor the mixing process. A diffuse interfacial region with a disordered structure correspondingly appears. Its structural features were not significantly modified by the thermal relaxation processes occurring after the compressive load removal...|$|R
40|$|Fully {{developed}} turbulent {{flows in}} six square ducts consisting of smooth and <b>rough</b> <b>planes</b> were experimentally investigated {{by measuring the}} velocity profiles in a cross section, the pressure gradient along the duct and the wall shear stress distributions on smooth planes which were measured {{by means of a}} Preston tube. It was shown that the pattern of the constant velocity contour lines and the wall shear stress distributions across a plane were strongly influenced by the variation of surface condition of the four planes forming the duct. The contribution of each wall plane of a duct to the total flow resistance of the duct was investigated and it was revealed that the degree of the contribution of a plane changed considerably by the arrangement of the surrounding wall planes as well as the number of <b>rough</b> <b>planes</b> forming the duct. Based on these results equations for practical use were proposed to predict the mean flow resistance coefficient of the flow in the square ducts consisting of smooth and <b>rough</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R

The lubricant in the continuum film hydrodynamic contact is assumed as Newtonian. The whole contact between these two planes is obtained by periodically distributing the ridge on the plane. Theoretical analysis are developed for this mode of contact, respectively for triangle and truncated triangle surface ridges for wide operational parameters when the plane ridge, respectively undergoes elastic and plastic deformations and the hydrodynamic contact areas between the planes are varied.

The exact three-dimensional wetted surface of the hull is where the body boundary condition is fulfilled. The sprays region detaching both in front of the stagnation root line and from the wet portion of the chine are modeled in the numerical scheme by means of additional vortex lattice regions. The dynamic boundary condition at the stern of the hull is non-linear with respect to the perturbation potential. Results show the dynamic pressure consistently accounts for the 3 D features of the flow {{especially in the case of}} cambered <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The numerical method is verified by a systematic analysis against semi-empirical methods and it is finally validated with experimental results on prismatic as well as cambered dihedral <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Excellent correlations are found for both types of <b>planing</b> <b>surfaces</b> that range in the same confidence interval of higher fidelity numerical models, such as RANSE solvers...|$|R

40|$|Fast {{mapping of}} roads plays an {{important}} role in many geospatial applications, such as infrastructure planning, traffic monitoring, and driver assistance. How to extract various road edges fast and robustly is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a fast and robust algorithm for the automatic road edges extraction from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data. The algorithm is based on a key observation: most roads around edges have difference in elevation and road edges with pavement are seen in two different planes. In our algorithm, we firstly extract a <b>rough</b> <b>plane</b> based on RANSAC algorithm, and then multiple refined planes which only contains pavement are extracted from the <b>rough</b> <b>plane.</b> The road edges are extracted based on these refined planes. In practice, there is a serious problem that the <b>rough</b> and refined <b>planes</b> usually extracted badly due to rough roads and different density of point cloud. To eliminate the influence of rough roads, the technology which is similar with the difference of DSM (digital surface model) and DTM (digital terrain model) is used, and we also propose a method which adjust the point clouds to a similar density to eliminate the influence of different density. Experiments show the validities of the proposed method with multiple datasets (e. g. urban road, highway, and some rural road).
