500|$|Fargo then built a {{pumping plant}} {{employing}} seven electric powered <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps,</b> to move river water up a [...] pipeline to a bluff about [...] above the Muskegon River. A diameter reduction to [...] increased {{the pressure to}} about 80 PSI, and the water was fed into nozzles via flexible rubber hoses. The high pressure streams of water carried away a soil water mix into iron troughs which routed the material about [...] at a slight downgrade back to the dam site. As the material was deposited it was layered, and the water allowed to drain off, compacting it. During this phase, the river was allowed to run through the powerhouse raceways and out the spillway.|$|E

50|$|Advantages: <b>Rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are very}} {{efficient}} because they naturally remove {{air from the}} lines, eliminating the need to bleed the air from the lines manually.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are driven}} by a {{crankshaft}} that is rotated by handles on two flywheels attached {{to the ends of}} the shaft on each side of the pump. <b>Rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> can be built with two and three cylinders, and are operated by a team of two men. Pistons attached to the crankshaft draw in air through the inlet valves and then pump it through the outlet valves to an air hose which delivers the air to the helmet of the diver. Cylinders, valves and outlet fittings for air are generally made from brass for corrosion resistance in the marine environment.|$|E
50|$|Drawbacks: The {{nature of}} the pump {{requires}} very close clearances between the rotating pump and the outer edge, making it rotate at a slow, steady speed. If <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> are operated at high speeds, the fluids cause erosion, which eventually causes enlarged clearances that liquid can pass through, which reduces efficiency.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can handle}} solids (e.g., {{cherries}} and olives), slurries, pastes, {{and a variety}} of liquids. If wetted, they offer self-priming performance. A gentle pumping action minimizes product degradation. They also offer continuous and intermittent reversible flows and can operate dry for brief periods of time. Flow is relatively independent of changes in process pressure, too, so output is relatively constant and continuous.|$|E

50|$|In a {{conventional}} water impounded hopper (WIH) system, the clinker lumps get crushed to small sizes by clinker grinders mounted under water and fall {{down into a}} trough from where a water ejector takes them out to a sump. From there it is pumped out by suitable <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> to dumping yard far away. In another arrangement a continuous link chain scrapes out the clinkers from under water and feeds them to clinker grinders outside the bottom ash hopper.|$|E
50|$|A {{screw pump}} {{is a more}} {{complicated}} type of rotary pump that uses two or three screws with opposing thread â€” e.g., one screw turns clockwise and the other counterclockwise. The screws are mounted on parallel shafts that have gears that mesh so the shafts turn together and everything stays in place. The screws turn on the shafts and drive fluid through the pump. As with other forms of <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps,</b> the clearance between moving parts and the pump's casing is minimal.|$|E

The Vacuum laboratory, a part of first year M.

The proposed laboratory will help both the graduate and under graduate students of our institute to conduct different experiments under vacuum environment. Two experiments using <b>rotary</b> <b>pump</b> [1] namely; Pumping speed measurement and conductance measurement of different piping analogy need to be set up. For which we designed a vacuum chamber [3] with suitable capacity first, decided pump down time allowable to get ultimate vacuum level of a <b>rotary</b> <b>pump</b> {{in accordance with the}} total lab hrs assigned to each sessions, and finally we calculated pumping speed [2] required for the <b>pump.</b> The same <b>rotary</b> <b>pump</b> set up will be used for conductance measurement too, but with different piping analogy.

50|$|Heilman, {{with several}} Medrad Intec employees, formed VASCOR in 1986 {{to develop an}} implantable left {{ventricular}} assist device or VAD to help patients suffering from advanced heart failure. VASCOR has explored several potential heart assist methods, including devices that would push on the outside surface of a failing left ventricle, using magnetic levitation for supporting a bladed rotor in an axial or mixed flow pump {{and the use of}} a moving valve placed in series with the heart's failing left ventricle. Finding none of these approaches fully satisfactory, VASCOR has settled on a unique method for using a failsafe counter-pulsation heart assist device powered by a transcutaneous electrical transmission system or TETS. The TETS eliminates driveline infections, a common adverse event experience with existing heart assist devices. The TETS technology has been found fully satisfactory in animal testing and pump animal testing is expected in 2016. Avoiding the spinning rotor of the now commonly used <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> eliminates the associated blood shear with its blood shear related clotting and bleeding complications.|$|E
