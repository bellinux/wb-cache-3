40|$|International audienceWe {{show how}} the {{measured}} particle ratios at RHIC {{can be used to}} provide non-trivial information about the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition. This is obtained by including the effects of highly massive Hagedorn resonances on statistical models, which are used to describe hadronic yields. Hagedorn states are relevant close <b>to</b> <b>T</b> <b>c</b> and have been shown to decrease η/s to the KSS limit and allow for quick chemical equilibrium times in dynamical calculations of hadrons. The inclusion of Hagedorn states creates a dependence of the thermal fits on the Hagedorn temperature, T H, which is assumed to be equal <b>to</b> <b>T</b> <b>c,</b> and leads <b>to</b> an overall improvement of thermal fits. We find that for Au+Au collisions at RHIC at √ s N N = 200 GeV the best square fit measure, χ 2, occurs at <b>T</b> <b>c</b> ∼ 176 MeV and produces a chemical freeze-out temperature of 170. 4 MeV and a baryon chemical potential of 27. 8 MeV...|$|R

X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analysis of ceramic samples prepared by the sol-gel method revealed that specimens are single phase and have average grain size of similar to 0. 5 mu m. Magnetization and 4 -probe dc electrical resistivity rho(T,H) experiments showed that a ferromagnetic transition at T(C) similar to 170 K {{is closely related to}} a metal-insulator (MI) transition occurring at essentially the same temperature T(MI). The magnetoresistance effect was found to be more pronounced at low applied fields (H <= 2. 5 T) and temperatures close to the MI transition. The ac electrical transport was investigated by impedance spectroscopy Z(f,T,H) under applied magnetic field H up <b>to</b> 1 <b>T.</b> The Z(f,T,H) data exhibited two well-defined relaxation processes that exhibit different behaviors depending on the temperature and applied magnetic field. Pronounced effects were observed close <b>to</b> <b>T</b> (<b>C)</b> and were associated with the coexistence of clusters with different electronic and magnetic properties.

In parallel, we measured mice survival <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3 <b>C</b> 9 challenge, primary replication, and growth in and spread to the brain. The results show that <b>T</b> 3 <b>C</b> 9 infection increased IL- 1 α only in the brain of neonatal mice, whereas LPS enhanced IL- 1 α in the brain and in the blood in both neonatal and adult mice. In neonatal mice, a <b>T</b> 3 <b>C</b> 9 -induced IL- 1 α increase coincided with viral replication-induced nervous tissue injury and preceded death.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Most {{studies of}} phase {{transitions}} {{have concentrated on}} systems where the transition is driven by a change in temperature, i. e. starting from an ordered state at low temperature, thermal fluctuations {{become more and more}} important as the temperature is raised until, at the transition temperature <b>T</b> <b>c,</b> the order is destroyed. There are, however, interesting systems in which the transition is driven by quantum fluctuations. These are transitions which occur at T = 0 (so there are no thermal fluctuations) when some parameter in the system is changed. A transition occurring at a finite temperature always has the behavior of a classical thermally driven transition sufficiently close <b>to</b> <b>T</b> <b>c,</b> though, if <b>T</b> <b>c</b> is small, there may be a range of temperature where quantum behavior is seen.
