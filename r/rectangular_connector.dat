50|$|MIL-DTL-5015 {{circular}} connectors {{are used}} primarily for their ease of engagement and disengagement, ability to house {{different types of}} contacts, {{a wide range of}} allowable contact voltages and currents, and their rugged mechanical performance under a variety of environmental conditions. Their primary disadvantage is loss of panel space when used in arrays when compared to <b>rectangular</b> <b>connector</b> housings.|$|E
50|$|MagSafe has {{connector}} pins {{that are designed}} so the <b>rectangular</b> <b>connector</b> can be inserted in either orientation (however, the L-shaped version of the connector can only be fitted in one orientation without blocking neighboring ports, such as USB). LEDs on both {{the top and bottom}} of the connector show green if the computer battery is fully charged and amber or red if the battery is charging. MagSafe can be found on the MacBook, MacBook Pro and MacBook Air notebook computers, as well as the Apple LED Cinema Display.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is used on}} the International Space Station (ISS). PDGFs can be [...] "grappled" [...] by the Canadarm2 robotic arm, {{in order}} to allow the arm to {{manipulate}} and power a grappled object, or be commanded by operators based inside the ISS. PDGFs located around much of the station provide connections for the arm. They have four <b>rectangular</b> <b>connectors</b> to transfer data, video and electrical power. During STS-134 a PDGF was installed on the Zarya module to support Canadarm2 operations based from the Russian segment.|$|R
50|$|The term Circular Connector {{applies to}} any {{electrical}} connector possessing multipin interconnects with cylindrical contact housings and circular contact interface geometries. Circular connectors are selected {{for ease of}} engagement and disengagement, their ability to conveniently house different types of contacts, their wide range of allowable contact voltages and currents, their ease of environmental sealing and their rugged mechanical performance. In military, aerospace, and other high-reliability applications, the MIL-DTL-5015 and MIL-DTL-38999 {{are among the most}} commonly specified types. The primary disadvantage of the circular design is loss of panel space when used in arrays when compared to <b>rectangular</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The main {{stimulus}} {{for the development}} of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board. Formerly electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 had used inductive charger couplers. These were ruled out in favor of conductive coupling to supply electricity for recharging with the California Air Resources Board settling upon the SAE J1772-2001 standard as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001. Avcon manufactured a <b>rectangular</b> <b>connector</b> compliant with that SAE J1772 REV NOV 2001 specification that was capable of delivering up to 6.6 kW of electrical power. [...] (Photos and description of this old-revision rectangular [...] "AVCon connector" [...] and [...] "AVCon inlet" [...] are at [...] ) ...|$|E
5000|$|MIL-DTL-83527, (formerly DoD-C-83527 and MIL-C-83527) {{describes}} the requirements, quality assurance criteria and test {{procedures for the}} design and fabrication of an environment resisting low insertion force, multiple insert <b>rectangular</b> <b>connector</b> used in the electrical/electronic bay areas of military aircraft. The connector provides the electrical interface between the avionics equipment and the equipment rack or tray. These connectors are military unique because they must operate satisfactory at high altitude 50,000 feet (15.2 km), endure 500 hours of salt spray, vibration testing (functional and endurance), shock (30 g's), and temperatures from -65 to +125 °C. These connectors must be {{used in conjunction with}} DoD-STD-1842 which {{describes the}} insert arrangements for use with MIL-DTL-83527 Rack-to-Panel connectors. The insert arrangements are provided in DOD-STD-1842.|$|E

40|$|Microstrip {{lines and}} other planar {{structures}} are {{very common in}} millimeter wave active circuits. However, in the Ka band (26. 5 - 40 GHz) the standard interface between subsystems is the <b>rectangular</b> waveguide <b>connector,</b> and transitions are needed. Using a modular approach the mechanical constraints in the prototype design process can be minimized. This paper presents several modular solutions according to the waveguide transition to be used.

50|$|The PBI is {{implemented}} as a <b>rectangular</b> 50-pin edge <b>connector</b> {{on the back}} of XL machines. The pins include all 16 address lines (A0 through A15) and 8 data lines (D0 through D7). Other pins include various electrical supplies, clock signals, interrupts, memory strobes, and even an analog audio input.|$|R
5000|$|MIL-DTL-83513, (formerly MIL-C-83513) {{describes}} polarized shell, micro-miniature, <b>rectangular</b> electrical <b>connectors</b> with solder or non-removable crimp contacts. The connector meets demanding {{applications and}} harsh environments {{and it is}} mechanically robust and durable, with low contact resistance, high current capability and high dielectric strength, and it has an excellent resistance to shock and vibration, while offering a high pin density, small size and lightweight body. Often {{referred to as a}} Micro-D connector system, the connector is suited to a multitude of systems where weight, miniaturization or signal transmission integrity are paramount, such as missiles and their guidance systems, aerospace avionics, radars, shoulder-launched weapon systems, advanced soldier technology systems, military Global Positioning Systems, satellites, medical devices and down-hole drilling tools. [...] The insert arrangements are provided in the associated specification sheets.|$|R
40|$|Waves can {{propagate}} freely without {{reflection in}} a certain class of non-uniform one-dimensional waveguides even though {{the properties of the}} waveguide vary rapidly. In these cases, the amplitude of the wave changes as a function of position but the power associated with the wave is preserved along the waveguide as in uniform waveguides. A generalised wave approach based on reflection, transmission and propagation of waves is used for the analysis of such non-uniform waveguides. The positive- and negative-going wave motions are separated so that the problem is always well-posed. Examples include longitudinal motion of bars and bending motion of Euler–Bernoulli beams, where the cross-section varies as a power of the length. The energy transport velocity, which is the velocity at which energy is carried by the waves in these waveguides, is derived using the relationship between power and energy. It is shown that this energy transport velocity depends on position as well as frequency and differs from the group velocity. Numerical results for wave transmission through a <b>rectangular</b> <b>connector</b> with linearly tapered thickness and constant width are obtained in a straightforward manner without approximation errors and at a low computational cost, irrespective of frequency...|$|E
25|$|In Norway {{and parts}} of Sweden a 25 A {{grounded}} <b>connector,</b> <b>rectangular</b> shaped with rounded corners, is used for single phase stoves. The <b>connector</b> has three <b>rectangular</b> pins in a row, with the grounding pin longer than other two. The corresponding socket is recessed to prevent shocks. The Norwegian standard is NEK502:2005 - standard sheet X (socket) and sheet XI (plug). They are {{also known as the}} two pole and earth variants of CEE7/10 (socket) and CEE7/11 (plug).|$|R

5000|$|Semko 17 were 3/4-pin 3-phase connectors, with (4-pin) {{or without}} (3-pin) a neutral connector. Earth were {{provided}} via the shield. The connectors {{were available in}} different sizes, 16 A with rounded corners; 25 A and 63 A were <b>rectangular.</b> These <b>connectors</b> were used mainly in industrial and agricultural installations. Manufacturing and selling of Semko-17 connectors with metal shells was prohibited in 1989. A few years later manufacturing and selling of all Semko-17 connectors were prohibited. Existing connectors may be used but not by any employee (prohibited by [...] "Arbetsmiljöverket"). The reason for the prohibition is that Semko-17 had several safety issues. The ground connection can become oxidized and when the shells are made of metal any ground fault goes right through {{the hands of a}} person connecting/disconnecting a male and a female cable connector (unless the person wears insulating gloves). Incorrect use of the ground connector as a neutral was not uncommon. Perhaps the worst issue is that in some connectors the ground screw could rust so severely that the ground wire comes loose and in the worst case make contact with a line (phase) wire nearby.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a two-port TEM cell has been numerically {{investigated}} {{with respect to the}} shape of the transitions connecting the small <b>rectangular</b> terminations, where <b>connectors</b> are fixed, and the TEM cell rectangular central part. At first, using a commercial code, the model has been developed and its validation has been done on an existing TEM cell. Then, starting from this TEM cell, a parametric analysis has been performed. The numerical results are shown and the effects of each parameter on the voltage standing wave ratio are discussed, with simple and practical diagrams useful for the {{design of a}} TEM cell. On the basis of the numerical analysis, modifications of the septum were performed on the TEM cell, and a substantial reduction of the highest values of VSWR has been obtained. Finally, a numerical optimized solution for the TEM cell with a maximum VSWR of 1. 02 has been identified...|$|R
