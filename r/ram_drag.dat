We investigate the impact of ram pressure on tidal dwarf galaxies in a parameter study, varying dwarf galaxy properties and ram pressures. We submit model tidal dwarf galaxies to wind-tunnel style tests using a toy ram pressure model. The effects of ram pressure are found to be substantial, resulting in stellar losses. If tidal dwarf galaxies have their gas stripped, they may be completely destroyed. <b>Ram</b> pressure <b>drag</b> causes acceleration of our dwarf galaxy models, and this further enhances stellar losses.

50|$|Parasitic drag is drag {{that results}} when an object is moved through a fluid medium. In {{the case of}} {{aerodynamic}} drag, the fluid medium is the atmosphere. Parasitic drag {{is a combination of}} form drag, skin friction drag and interference drag.

Parasitic drag does not result from the induction of lift on the body, hence it is considered parasitic.|$|E
50|$|The above {{equation}} {{applies only}} for air-breathing jet engines. It {{does not apply}} to rocket engines. Most types of jet engine have an air intake, which provides the bulk of the fluid exiting the exhaust. Conventional rocket engines, however, do not have an intake, the oxidizer and fuel both being carried within the vehicle. Therefore, rocket engines do not have <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> and the gross thrust of the rocket engine nozzle is the net thrust of the engine. Consequently, the thrust characteristics of a rocket motor are different from that of an air breathing jet engine, and thrust is independent of velocity.|$|E
50|$|Initially as the {{aircraft}} gains speed down the runway, {{there will be}} little increase in nozzle pressure and temperature, because the ram rise in the intake is very small. There will also be little change in mass flow. Consequently, nozzle gross thrust initially only increases marginally with flight speed. However, being an air breathing engine (unlike a conventional rocket) there is a penalty for taking on-board air from the atmosphere. This is known as <b>ram</b> <b>drag.</b> Although the penalty is zero at static conditions, it rapidly increases with flight speed causing the net thrust to be eroded.|$|E
50|$|As flight speed {{builds up}} after take-off, the ram {{rise in the}} intake starts to have a {{significant}} effect upon nozzle pressure/temperature and intake airflow, causing nozzle gross thrust to climb more rapidly. This term now starts to offset the still increasing <b>ram</b> <b>drag,</b> eventually causing net thrust to start to increase. In some engines, the net thrust at say Mach 1.0, sea level can even be slightly greater than the static thrust. Above Mach 1.0, with a subsonic inlet design, shock losses tend to decrease net thrust, however a suitably designed supersonic inlet can give a lower reduction in intake pressure recovery, allowing net thrust to continue to climb in the supersonic regime.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the potential reduction in fuel burned for BLI (boundary layer ingestion) inlets on a BWB (blended wing body) airplane employing AFC (active flow control). The BWB is a revolutionary type airplane configuration with engines on the aft upper surface where thick boundary layer offers the greatest opportunity for <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> reduction. AFC is an emerging technology for boundary layer control. Several BLI inlet configurations were analyzed in the NASA-developed RANS Overflow CFD code. The study determined that, while large reductions in <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> result from BLI, lower inlet pressure recovery produces engine performance penalties that largely offset this <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> reduction. AFC could, however, enable a short BLI inlet that allows surface mounting of the engine which, when coupled with a short diffuser, would significantly reduce drag and weight for a potential 10 % reduction in fuel burned. Continuing studies are therefore recommended to achieve this reduction in fuel burned considering the use of more modest amounts of BLI coupled with both AFC and PFC (Passive Flow Control) to produce a fail-operational system...|$|E

This study is an initial investigation into coupling the aerodynamics of the fuselage with a BLI propulsion system to determine if there is sufficient potential to warrant further investigation of this concept. Numerical simulations of flow around baseline, Boundary Layer Controlled (BLC), and propelled boundary layer controlled airships were performed. Computed results showed good agreement with wind tunnel data and previous numerical studies. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis were then conducted on four BLI configurations. The two design variables selected for the parametric study of the new configurations were the inlet area and the inlet to exit area ratio. Current results show that BLI propulsors may offer power savings of up to 85 % over the baseline configuration. These interim results include the simplifying assumption that inlet <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> is negligible and therefore likely overstate the reduction in power.

40|$|This report investigates {{spanwise}} blowing {{from the}} wingtip {{as a potential}} means to increase lift and reduce induced drag. Wingtip blowing entails exhausting one or more jets of air from the wingtip in a generally spanwise direction, {{as shown in figure}} 1. The parameter used to characterize the jet-blowing magnitude is the jet momentum coefficient, (C Âµ). For this study, the reference quantities used to define the jet momentum coefficient are the freestream dynamic pressure and the wing reference area. Thus, the magnitude of the jet momentum can be directly compared with the wing lift and drag when using the appropriate coefficients. Two types of jets have been studied: a single, long-chord jet and several discrete, short-chord jets. Air for the jet can be bled from the propulsion system, removed from the flow at the aircraft surface by a laminar-flow-control system, or ducted from the region of the stagnation line along the wing leading edge. The jet momentum is treated as a gross thrust or force. To account for all the forces properly, the mass flow for the jet is assumed to be decelerated to a stagnant condition. The force to decelerate the jet mass flow {{is referred to as the}} "ram drag. " If engine bleed air is used, the <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> of the extra air must be included when evaluating the results. The use of air ducted from the leading edge, as shown in figure 2, would provide a passive system with a portion of the <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> already included. However, only relatively small mass-flow rates and jet momentum coefficients would be available from such a system. Early work in wingtip blowing (refs. 2 [...] 5) addressed lift augmentation of low-aspect-ratio wings.

The STOVL aircraft uses ejectors powered by engine bypass flow together with vectored core exhaust to achieve vertical thrust capability.

One of the six candidate engines was selected for the flight demonstrator configuration. Propulsion related to this aircraft concept was studied.

40|$|The Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) {{airplane}} concept {{represents a}} potential revolution in subsonic transport efficiency for Very Large Airplanes (VLA's). NASA is sponsoring an advanced concept study to demonstrate feasibility and begin {{development of this}} new class of airplane. In this study, 800 passenger BWB and conventional configuration airplanes have been compared for a 7000 nautical mile design range, where both airplanes are based on technology keyed to 2015 entry into service.

The BWB advantage results from a double deck cabin that extends spanwise providing structural and aerodynamic overlap with the wing. This reduces the total wetted area of the airplane and allows a high aspect ratio to be achieved, since the deep and stiff centerbody provides efficient structural wingspan.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional airframe design methodology for low noise emission and high fuel efficiency, {{based on a}} blended-wing-body type aircraft. The design methodology uses a combination {{of high and low}} fidelity tools to assess the performance and acoustics of the aircraft. The goal set by the Silent* * Aircraft Initiative is a viable, commercial aircraft design with noise levels imperceptible outside the airport perimeter in a well-populated urban environment. To be viable, the aircraft requires a fuel burn comparable to modern conventional aircraft. The detailed airframe design incorporates leading edge camber of the centerbody to provide pitch trim without penalties in induced drag, wave drag, and trim drag. A low noise approach is achieved with reduced approach velocity and increased distance between the airframe and the observer. This slow and steep approach profile is enabled through a combination of thrust vectoring, quiet drag generation, and leading edge high-lift devices. The blended-wing-body type airframe design presented in this paper is both quiet with an OASPL of approximately 65 dBA and highly efficient with a cruise ML/D of 18. 5.

40|$|The {{proposed}} U. S. High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) will revolutionize commercial {{air travel}} by providing economical supersonic passenger service to destinations worldwide. Unlike the high-bypass turbofan engines that propel today's subsonic airliners, HSCT engines will have much higher jet exhaust speeds. Jet noise, {{caused by the}} turbulent mixing of high-speed exhaust with the surrounding air, poses a significant challenge for HSCT engine designers. To resolve this challenge, engineers have designed advanced mixer rejector nozzles that reduce HSCT jet noise to airport noise certification levels by entraining and mixing large quantities of ambient air with the engines' jet streams. Although this works well during the first several minutes of flight, {{far away from the}} airport, as the HSCT gains speed and climbs, poor ejector inlet recovery and ejector <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> contribute to poor thrust, making it advantageous to turn off the ejector. Doing so prematurely, however, can cause unacceptable noise levels to propagate to the ground, even when the aircraft is many miles from the airport. This situation lends itself ideally to optimization, where the aircraft trajectory, throttle setting, and ejector setting can be varied (subject to practical aircraft constraints) to minimize the noise propagated to the ground. A method was developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center that employs a variation of the classic energy state approximation: a trajectory analysis technique historically used to minimize climb time or fuel burned in many aircraft problems. To minimize the noise on the ground at any given throttle setting, high aircraft altitudes are desirable; but the HSCT may either climb quickly to high altitudes using a high, noisy throttle setting or climb more slowly at a lower, quieter throttle setting. An optimizer has been programmed into NASA's existing aircraft and noise analysis codes to balance these options by dynamically choosing the best altitude-velocity path and throttle setting history. The noise level standard, or metric, used in the optimizer should be one that accurately reflects the subjective annoyance levels of ground-based observers under the flight path. A variety of noise metrics are available, many of which are practical for airport-vicinity noise certification. Unlike airport noise, however, the HSCT's climb noise will be characterized by relatively low noise levels, long durations, and low-frequency spectra. The noise metrics used in these calculations are based on the recommendations of researchers at the NASA Langley Research Center, who have correlated the flyover noise annoyance levels of actual laboratory subjects with a variety of measurements. Analysis of data from this optimizer has shown that significant reductions in noise may be obtained with trajectory optimization. And since throttling operations are performed in the subsonic portion of the climb path (where thrust is plentiful), only small penalties in HSCT range or fuel performance occur...|$|E
40|$|As {{the demand}} {{to improve the}} fuel {{efficiency}} of current commercial aircraft increases, new commercial airliner concepts such as the Blended Wing Body has been researched on and studied in various aspects {{over the years as}} an efficient alternative to the conventional transport configuration. One particular aspect of the Blended Wing Body is the use of the propulsive fuselage concept. In this concept, the fuselage boundary layer is ingested by the engine and this is aimed at producing benefits such as improved fuel efficiency, reduced <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> as well as lower structural weight of the engine. During the ingestion process, the low momentum boundary layer is re-energized by the propulsion system before exiting into the atmosphere. In this way, the ingested flow does not contribute to the wake deficit and hence, the overall drag of the aircraft is reduced. Since thrust equal drag in steady and level flight, and power is equal to thrust multiplied by velocity, the reduction in drag implies a reduction in the power required to drive the vehicle. In essence, the ingestion of the boundary layer which leads to a lower inlet stagnation pressure represents a direct thermodynamic penalty. However, the momentum deficit captured by the engine represents a drag reduction to the aircraft. In this way, the propulsion system performance suffers a decrease in engine efficiency while the aircraft drag is reduced in proportion to the amount of boundary layer flow that is ingested. Therefore, a trade-off exists between the increase in aircraft drag reduction and the decrease in engine performance as more boundary layer is consumed. Another important concern is the significant flow distortion which can lead to increased vibration and fatigue of the fan and compressor blades in particular. This flow distortion is characterized by the distortion coefficient, a standard widely used in the aircraft engine industry. While {{it was found that the}} ingestion of the boundary layer can provide a decrease in fuel burn of several percentages, the benefits of boundary layer ingestion have shown to be very sensitive to the magnitude of the fan and duct losses. Hence, it is crucial that fan designers are able to design new rotor blades that are able to withstand the flow distortion while ensuring that engine performance degradation is kept to a minimum in order to maximize the overall gain in fuel efficiency. The main aim of this research is therefore to understand and analyse the rotor performance under both uniform and non-uniform inflow condition. This will then provide insights into the main fluid mechanism affecting rotor performance under such conditions. As such, the early phase of this research was focused on the development of an in-house blade modeller which was then later used in the parametrization and reconstruction of the NASA Rotor 67. Other than the development of the Blade Modeller, this research was also focused on the coupling of an open-source meshing software, SALOME to the Blade modeller which will then allow the user to achieve automated meshing needed for the design optimization process. The main highlight of this thesis is on the detailed analysis of the blade to blade domain as well as the overall rotor performance under non uniform inflow condition. ...|$|E
40|$|Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) is {{a concept}} in which the {{fuselage}} boundary layer is ingested by the engine to produce benefits like improved fuel efficiency, reduction of <b>ram</b> <b>drag</b> and lower structural weight of the configuration. Blended Wing Body (BWB) concept has been researched on and studied in various forms {{over the years as}} an efficient alternative to the conventional transport configurations. Past studies have concluded that of the podded and embedded engine configurations, the BWB architecture is particularly suited to flush mounted embedded engines, as the balance requirements already place them near the aft of the airframe. Despite the benefits, effect of BLI on engine performance is also known to be detrimental because BLI increases pressure distortion and reduces total pressure recovery at the engine fan face. Most of these drawbacks are caused by secondary flow losses (vortices created due to boundary layer separation) due to an adverse pressure gradient in the S-Duct and a non-uniform mass flow ratio. An improved inlet design becomes necessary to reduce these limitations. The aim of this research is to design an inlet embedded on a BWB that ingests significant amount of fuselage boundary layer and produces minimum pressure loss and distortion in the process. Two major consequences of BLI are vital in this regard namely, loss of total pressure recovery and increased total pressure distortion at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP) or the engine fan-face. Hence the inlet performance is measured by the total Pressure Recovery Factor (PRF) and Distortion Coefficient (DC 60). Therefore, this research work aims to design an embedded inlet on a BWB that produces maximum value of PRF and minimum DC 60. An extensive literature study was carried out {{in order to understand the}} effects of BLI on inlet performance and research work conducted in the past to minimize the losses associated with BLI. Many of these studies focus on S-Ducts ingesting boundary layer and minimization of the losses using flow control techniques. Few studies have focussed on design of a novel inlet configuration that produces best results in terms of PRF and DC 60. This thesis has focussed on the design of the inlet based on computational analysis of different inlet configurations to achieve an optimum design. The framework of this report first follows description of criteria and parameters for embedded inlet design. This is followed by an elaboration on the numerical methodology and approach to be used for the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The CFD simulations and analyses conducted in this thesis are divided into 2 main stages. The first stage deals with the computational analysis of a BWB in clean configuration (without engines) to obtain velocity profiles over aft fuselage, where the inlets will be embedded. The second stage comprises of the main inlet design. Three main geometrical parameters are chosen for the geometrical design of the inlet, namely inlet aspect ratio (ratio of inlet ellipse major axis length and semi-minor axis length), duct length and duct height. A number of tests are conducted to find out the influence of these parameters on the inlet performance. Few other inlet configurations are investigated, which can produce improved results and finally the design of the internal nacelle lip concludes the design of the inlet. Since the BWB in this research operates at cruise conditions (at M= 0. 82), initially pressure losses were high. Testing of different inlet aspect ratios with constant length and height of duct showed that an aspect ratio of 1. 75 performs best with a PRF of 97. 01 % and a DC 60 value of 41. 59 %, which was quite high. Further tests regarding variation in duct height showed most optimum results for the lowest height of duct due to reduced secondary flow losses. The duct with a height of 0. 3 m performed best with PRF= 97. 7 % and DC 60 = 28. 45 %. Finally length of duct was varied keeping previously obtained aspect ratio and height and the shortest duct length (4. 85 m) performed best with PRF= 97. 7 % and DC 60 = 28. 45 % (previous variations in duct height and aspect ratios were conducted using the same length value, hence the results for duct height are similar). Therefore, the inlet obtained from the testing concluded the design as an S-Duct inlet with AR= 1. 75, L= 4. 85 m and H= 0. 3 m with PRF= 97. 7 %, DC 60 = 28. 45 % and Mach number at the AIP as 0. 6. After investigating other configurations like the reverse s-duct, double gradient duct, zero-gradient duct and zero-height duct, the zero-gradient duct (duct with flat bottom wall for boundary layer and no separation inside the inlet, L= 4. 85 m, AR= 1. 75, H= 1. 615 m) showed best results with PRF= 98. 04 % and DC 60 = 20. 55 %. The internal nacelle was designed using a contraction ratio of 1. 04 and a lip major-to-minor axis ratio (m/n) of 2. The final design of inlet was a zero-gradient duct with L= 4. 85 m, AR= 1. 75, H= 1. 615 m, CR= 1. 04, m/n= 2, PRF= 98. 04 %, DC 60 = 20. 55 % and Mach number at the AIP = 0. 538. The same final design model was also tested using ParaPy (a high level Python language) and results showed a zero-gradient duct with L= 4. 85 m, AR= 1. 75, H= 1. 615 m, CR= 1. 04, m/n= 2, PRF= 98. 3 %, DC 60 = 20. 14 % and Mach number at the AIP = 0. 539. A podded inlet configuration of L= 6. 46 m and area-ratio= 1. 37 with same mass flow rate and fan-face Mach number as that of the embedded engine was also analysed to compare BLI case with no-BLI. The results showed a pressure loss of nearly 10 % for the podded case and a larger wetted area. But the DC 60 value was significantly lower (2. 6 %) in comparison to embedded inlet. Follow up studies can be conducted to improve the results using flow control techniques. Flight Performance and PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
