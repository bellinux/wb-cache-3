50|$|Connected {{health is}} a socio-technical model for {{healthcare}} management and delivery by using technology to provide healthcare services remotely. Connected health aims to maximize healthcare resources and provide increased, flexible opportunities {{for consumers to}} engage with clinicians and better self-manage their care. It uses technology - often leveraging readily available consumer technologies - to deliver patient care outside of the hospital or doctor's office. Connected health encompasses programs in telehealth, <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> (such as home care) and disease and lifestyle management, often leverages existing technologies such as connected devices using existing cellular networks and is associated with efforts to improve chronic care.|$|E

There are also lifestyle coaching programs, in which an individual receives healthcare information to facilitate behavior change to improve their fitness and/or general well being, (see wellness) or to reduce or eliminate {{the impact of a}} particular behavior that presents a risk to their health status.

As a result, it has lobbied for reform of laws on guardianship and the right to be legally recognised as a person in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. Stanev v Bulgaria (2012), concerned the long-term placement, torture and ill-treatment of a man diagnosed with a mental illness in a <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> institution by his guardian. He had no recourse to legally challenge the decision in Bulgarian courts. This {{was the first time the}} Court found a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of torture) in a disability case. It was also the first time the court found that a person in a social care institution was unlawfully detained. Shtukaturov v Russia (2008), concerned the detention of a man diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was placed under guardianship without being informed of the decision. His guardian unlawfully allowed for his detention in a psychiatric hospital for seven months without a court review, and he was forcibly injected with psychiatric medication against his will. MDAC took his case to the European Court of Human Rights and he won.|$|E

Besides its proper functional requirements, this system presents interesting timing constraints. They make the TRMCS a difficult case study to deal with. The di [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} a planned project to design, implement, and evaluate <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> for adults using cochlear implants and compare their outcomes with those following the standard care pathway. Method: Sixty people with cochlear implants will be recruited and randomized {{to either the}} <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> group or a control group. The <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> group will use new tools for 6 months: remote and self-monitoring, self-adjustment of device, and a personalized online support tool. The main outcome measure is patient empowerment, with secondary outcomes of hearing {{and quality of life}} stability, patient and clinician preference, and use of clinic resources. Conclusion: The clinical trial ends in summer 2016. <b>Remote</b> <b>care</b> may offer a viable method of follow-up for some adults with cochlear implants. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} organisational {{factors influencing}} the implementation challenges of redesigning services {{for people with}} long term conditions in three locations in England, using <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> (telehealth and telecare). Methods Case-studies of three sites forming the UK Department of Health’s Whole Systems Demonstrator (WSD) Programme. Qualitative research techniques were used to obtain data from various sources, including semi-structured interviews, observation of meetings over the course programme and prior to its launch, and document review. Participants were managers and practitioners involved {{in the implementation of}} <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> services. Results The implementation of <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> was nested within a large pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), which formed a core element of the WSD programme. To produce robust benefits evidence, many aspect of the trial design could not be easily adapted to local circumstances. While <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> was successfully rolled-out, wider implementation lessons and levels of organisational learning across the sites were hindered by the requirements of the RCT. Conclusions The implementation of a complex innovation such as <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> requires it to organically evolve, be responsive and adaptable to the local health and social care system, driven by support from front-line staff and management. This need for evolution was not always aligned with the imperative to gather robust benefits evidence. This tension needs to be resolved if government ambitions for the evidence-based scaling-up of <b>remote</b> <b>care</b> are to be realised. </p...|$|E
