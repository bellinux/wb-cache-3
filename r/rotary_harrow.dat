The soil tillage system influenced the humidity along the whole period of vegetation for all culture, showing differences between the classic tillage system (plough), the minimum tillage system (chisel and paraplow) and the <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> tillage.

All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow.</b> Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (field cultivator, disk harrow, <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow)</b> and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron. The incorporation of herbicides in the soil with disk harrow or field cultivator compared to <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow,</b> provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of disk harrow and field cultivator were {{lower than that of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow.</b> The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton. Finally, drip irrigation combined with the PPI application of s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron and incorporated in the soil with field cultivator or disk harrow should be the first choice of cotton growers in integrated crop management systems. ...|$|E

However, agricultural plants environment in the organic field characterized by physical, chemical and biological properties which different from intensive farming options.

Research on the adaptation of the basic crop cultivation technologies to the requirements of organic production is carried out in IAEP. For that purpose we developed a model of perspective technical and technological provision of organic farmers. The model considers a set of organic crop rotation, and for each crop of which the corresponding organic technology used. Technical means are selected from the general list contained in the model, {{depending on the size of}} the farm and the selected level of crop productivity. Economic and environment indicators are also calculated. Particular attention of the model is drawn to the following group operations: mechanical tillage, application of organic fertilizers, weed and pest control. Generally, organic farmers use ordinary technical means, but the model also considers promising. We use tillage system with different depths for organic crop rotation: cereal crops - at depth of 12 - 16 cm, for vegetable crops and potatoes at depth of 22 - 24 cm by mould board plough. In the presence of strongly marked "subsoil layer" or waterproof horizon the subsoil shattering is conducted to a depth of 45 cm by chisel cultivator. Fall tillage is an effective way to control weeds, diseases and pests. Promising is the use of technical means for the local application of solid manure in the furrow. A particularly important task in organic agriculture is weed control. In addition to crop rotation, the cultivation of root crops used ridge system and previously developed and then half-forgotten, <b>rotary</b> <b>harrows</b> to handle the ridge slopes during the growing season. Such <b>rotary</b> <b>harrows</b> were very effective for weed control in potatoes field experiment in 2016. Following operations: seeds cover by biological drugs; biological drugs application during seeding and on plants during vegetations, are including in technologies for organic control of deceases and pests. As a promising area is consider to use one of the physical methods for the precise removal of weeds. Also, the idea of precision agriculture can be used for imaging of a disease or pest on vegetation and accurate extermination on the small patch by biological drugs. The model of promising technical and technological provision of organic farm can be transformed into a software system that will be useful for agricultural producers engaged in organic crop production, as well as organizations providing their technical means...|$|R

Depending on location and year, stale seedbed preparations followed by weed control prior to planting reduced the amount of weeds during crop growth by 43 ¿ 83 %. Control of the emerged seedlings after a stale seedbed preparation was more effective with glyphosate than with a <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow.</b> Covering the <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> during control to prevent light reaching the soil improved its effect on the weed density during crop growth in two of 3 years. Radiation with far red light (FR) did not reduce the number of emerging weeds in this study. Mechanical control by finger weeder, torsion weeder and hoe was applied without stale seedbed preparations. These measures reduced the weed densities by 88 ¿ 99 %, compared with the untreated control and were more effective than chemical weed control with carbetamide and chlorpropham. The results show that the stale seedbed technique in combination with mechanical control of emerging weeds can reduce the weed population during crop growth as effectively as chemical control.

Na štirih poskusnih poljih smo predsetveno pripravo tal opravili s predsetvenikom ali vrtavkasto brano, nato smo opravili setev z dvema razlicnima sejalnicama. Prva je pnevmatska nadtlacna, druga pnevmatska podtlacna. Pri vseh opravilih smo merili porabo goriva in casa, pri setvi pa še porabo semena. Po 14 dnevih smo opazovali vznik. Jeseni smo izmerili pridelek na vseh poskusnih parcelah in izmerili vlago zrnja koruze. Zbrali smo tudi vremenske podatke za celo leto. Ugotovili smo, da se predsetvena priprava tal opravi hitreje in bolje z vrtavkasto brano v primerjavi s predsetvenikom poleg tega pa prihranimo tudi gorivo. Setev s podtlacno sejalnico je bolj natancna, poraba semena pa je nižja v primerjavi z nadtlacno sejalnico.

40|$|Non-chemical {{methods for}} weed control play an {{important}} role for the management of weeds in organic cropping systems in Europe. With the expansion of the organic area in recent years, more research has been conducted to develop new methods and improve management strategies. Currently, weed <b>harrows,</b> <b>rotary</b> cultivators and inter-row cultivators are the principal methods used for full-width treatments in large agricultural crops, such as cereals, oil seed rape, maize and pulses. The mechanical methods are often combined with cultural measures, e. g. stale seedbeds, delayed sowing, placement of fertilizers etc., to benefit from the additive and sometimes even synergistic effects of combining direct and cultural methods. In row crops, such as sugar beets and horticultural crops, thermal and mechanical methods are mostly combined to remove as many weeds in the rows as possible in order to minimize the need for manual weeding. Weeds growing between the rows are easily controlled by inter-row cultivation. Robotic weeding for intra-row weed control is now possible for transplanted crops, and inter-row hoes have been equipped with GPS-systems and cameras for optimizing precision and steering. Works on new GPS technology is currently focusing on seeding systems with the ability to create parallel or diamond crop establishment patterns, which enable inter-row hoeing to be conducted in different directions. So far, non-chemical methods have had little uptake in conventional farming but national and EU-based legislative initiatives may change the situation radically in the near future. Several European countries have launched pesticide action plans and the EU a new directive for the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM); all aiming for minimizing the reliance on herbicides.

40|$|A web-based {{digital image}} {{analysis}} tool (IMAGING Crop Response Analyser) has been developed, tested and made public (www. imaging-crops. dk). This new technology makes possible objective estimations of crop-soil cover (i. e. how much crop is buried with soil) associated with post-emergence weed control with spring tine <b>harrows,</b> <b>rotary</b> hoes and other weeders. Objective estimation of crop-soil cover offers new possibilities to improve decision support of physical weed control practises with low selectivity because trade-offs between weed control and resulting injury to the associated crop now may be quantified, communicated and incorporated into models. The objective of this resentation is to suggest key parameters and research priorities for future research and to suggest standards for estimation and statistical test of the analytical parameters. The overall aim is to help researchers deliver reliable parameter estimates that may help to predict the optimal intensity and timing of physical weed control with low selectivity and, thereby, contribute to the theoretical and methodological framework of physical weed control. Selectivity and crop recovery are suggested as key parameters because they are crucial in predictive models and are less influenced by site-specific soil conditions and implement settings than other parameters. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} ratio between weed control and crop-soil cover and crop recovery is defined as the ability of the crop to recover from soil coverage. Both parameters depend on the intensity of tillage. To facilitate comparisons between different studies, it is suggested that the crop soil cover associated with 80 % weed control and the relative crop yield loss associated with 25 % crop-soil cover are calculated with 95 %-confidence intervals. Experimental protocols needed to make such calculations are outlined and factors that influence - or may influence - selectivity and recovery are listed and research priorities are given. Crop tolerance has previously been used to express the susceptibility of the crop to physical weed control, but crop recovery is shown to be more useful in decision support models than crop tolerance. Recent studies using the new {{digital image analysis}} tool and the above suggested parameter estimation procedure show that timing of weed harrowing is of lesser importance if the intensity of tillage is correctly adjusted to the growth stage compared with prediction of the optimal intensity in sitespecific conditions. This latter issue remains the major challenge for future development...|$|R

Knowing these influences scientifically fundaments the identification of the strong and weak points of the soil tilling systems for the corn production, so that from the data presented in this paper the recorded production differences can be noted. The production values vary by the soil tillage, with values between 3423 and 4300 kg/ha. With the chisel and <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> alternatives, the values are practically equal, having distinctly significant negative differences as compared to the classical plowing system and the unconventional paraplow system, with which productions were the highest. The highest crop increase is of 11. 6 %, also recorded with the paraplow tilling alternative (a 3), as compared to the standard alternative. With the unconventional systems, the preparation depth of the germinating layer is smaller, which creates vulnerability regarding the lack of water. On the clay and sand clay texture soils in arid years the seed germination is hindered, and applying the unconventional systems constitues a benefit regarding water accumulation in the soil, preventing the soil erosion and micro-organisms activity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen the {{spreading}} {{of a disease}} depends on the proportion of infected residues remaining at soil surface it is of crucial importance to analyse the effects of tillage practices on the vertical distribution of stubble. This {{is the case with}} phoma stem canker (blackleg), whose epidemics are initiated in autumn, by air-borne ascospores released from stubble located at the soil surface. We compared initial vertical distribution of oilseed rape residues to those observed after sowing and various tillage operations (rotary harrowing, stubble disking, chiselling and mouldboard ploughing). Almost 20 % of the initially buried residue was brought back to soil surface with seeding. <b>Rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> brought 40 % of the residue buried in the 0 - 10 cm layer up to the surface and left unburied about 70 % of surface residue. Stubble disking appeared to be more efficient for residue burial than chiselling. Mouldboard plough was the only tool that buried all residues. A simple model was developed that predicted burial and return to the soil surface of potentially infected residues as a function of tillage practices used after harvest. Simulation of different tillage sequences showed that the order in which tools were used also affected location of residues. Our results highlighted the importance of tillage in the cultural control of phoma stem canker and will contribute to the definition of integrated pest management strategies for oilseed rape...|$|E
40|$|In a {{recently}} started long-term field trial (2002 - 2011), located in Frick (1000 mm mean annual precipi-tation) near Basle (Switzerland), {{the effect of}} reduced tillage on crop yield, weed infestation, and oc-currence of toxigenic fusaria was studied on a heavy soil (45 % clay) in a crop rotation under organic farming conditions. Here, we present results {{of the first two}} experimental years (2003 - 2004), which are considered as the conversion period. Wheat yield was 16 % higher (p < 0. 001) in ploughed plots than in the plots with reduced tillage (chisel and <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow).</b> In the following year, sunflower yield was enhanced by 5 % (p = 0. 06) in reduced tilled plots. Reduced tilled plots manifested a higher weed infestation, in particular with Convolvulus arvensis and Stellaria media. With the exception of low levels of Fusarium poae, no toxigenic fusaria were detected in wheat grains possibly due to the excep-tionally dry and hot summer 2003. The deoxynivalenol (DON) content was low in all treatments. While the DON content in wheat straw was increased after reduced tillage, it was decreased after ap-plication of biodynamic preparations (p < 0. 05). Overall, we assume that even on heavy soils, reduced tillage systems may be applicable on organic farms, but with a considerably higher input of labour...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{tests on}} {{seed-bed}} preparation {{by means of}} three rotary harrows (with tools rotating on a vertical axe) and three rotary hoes (with tools rotating on an horizontal axe) were performed during 1996 on a loam soil at the Experimental Center for Agro-Environment Research “E. Avanzi” of the University of Pisa (Italy). Both the mechanical and operative performances (working time and capacity, fuel consumption, power requirement, etc.) {{and the quality of}} work (clod size distribution and soil roughness) were evaluated. 	The results emphasized that there were no relevant differences between the operative performances of the two typologies of machines tested. Thus specific power (usable power per meter of working width and centimeter of working depth) both of rotary harrows and rotary hoes was always of the same order. In contrast seed-bed quality was notably different. Use of rotary hoes led to a high degree of soil crumbling, which was also homogeneous throughout the tilled layer, while rotary harrows resulted in a lower degree of soil crumbling, with a distribution of larger diameter clods in the shallowest layer. As a consequence, soil roughness was decidedly higher after harrowing. 	Therefore, given the absence of significant differences between the operative performances of the two typologies of pto powered operative machines, choice of implement can be based on desired seed-bed quality, in order to obtain either pronounced soil crumbling and leveling (rotary hoe) or greater “protection” of tilled soil from crusting and erosion (<b>rotary</b> <b>harrow)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The stubble {{cultivation}} {{cuts the}} dock roots below growth points. The vegetative plant parts are then {{cut off from}} the water and nutrient supply, and regrowth is inhibited. Practical recommendation •	Summer dock treatment is especially worthwhile in dry summers with catch crop cultivation and after early maturing crops (winter barley, whole-crop silage) or with an early tillage of grass-clover. •	After grass-clover lay or cereal harvest, undercut the dock plants at a depth of 12 - 15 cm with a skim plough (without skimmer) with a support wheel, a stubble cleaner or an overlapping flat cultivator. •	Bring the roots to the surface by passing over the field with a spring-tine harrow every 7 - 14 days. Additionally, apply a <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> in heavy soils to expose the roots. •	After every round, collect roots manually or let them dry in suitable weather conditions. Only leave fully dead roots on the field. Information •	Plan deep-rooted crops and annual or perennial cover crops in the crop rotation {{in order to reduce the}} water and nutrient supply in deeper soil layers and thus impair the growth conditions for dock plants. •	After a short dock treatment sow a suitable catch crop as quickly as possible, and only leave the field fallow until autumn sowing of cereals, if you intend to perform a longer treatment. •	If the dock pressure is high, refrain from sowing 4 -year, slowly growing mixtures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIf {{it comes}} to the {{advantages}} of conservation tillage practices, a considerable amount of evidence supports positive effects towards reduction of surface runoff and soil erosion. However studies concerning arable land frequently are conducted under ideal laboratory conditions or “controlled” field conditions, meaning that the experimental approaches were not managed by farmers in the way they usually perform conservation tillage but managed towards an optimisation of the tested features. In addition, applicability of different existing conservation tillage techniques such as no tillage or mulching may be regionally different. The alpine forelands of Central Europe are dominated by small scale farming systems which frequently have limited access to special machinery which is needed to successfully implement no tillage treatments. We therefore carried out rainfall simulation experiments employing conservation tillage practices to test the effectiveness of actual real life conservation tillage methods under conditions prevailing in the alpine forelands of Central Europe. Experiments were carried out in the years 2011 and 2012 for testing the relative performance of different mulching and no tillage treatments on surface runoff and erosion. The tested treatments for the year 2011 were a) no tillage with prior rough seedbed (NT 1), b) no tillage with prior fine seedbed (NT 2), c) mulching with <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> (M 1), d) mulching with <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> and disc harrow (M 2) and e) conventional tillage (CT 11). The tested treatments for the year 2012 were a) combined mulching (MC), b) mulching with loosened wheel tracks (M−T), c) mulching without loosened wheel tracks (M+T) and d) conventional tillage (CT 12). In 2011, total surface runoff and total soil loss for the different treatments were ordered as follows: NT 1 <NT 2 <CT 11 <M 1 <M 2. No significant differences for total soil loss could be identified. For total surface runoff differences were significant (p< 0. 05) between all treatments, except for NT 2 and CT 11. The treatments also differed with respect to runoff initiation, sediment concentrations and shear stress. As a main reason for the unexpected bad performance of the mulching treatments M 1 and M 2 lack of sufficient soil cover (M 1 : 6 %, M 2 : 11 %) together with shallow surface cultivation were identified. In 2012, total surface runoff and total soil loss for the different treatments were ordered as follows: MC<M−T<CT 12 <M+T. Although there were a visible trend in these results, significant differences could only be observed for total surface runoff between treatments MC and M+T (p< 0. 05). We attribute the good performance of treatment MC to the improved soil cover (25 %). Wheel tracks of treatment M+T obviously had influenced soil erosion and surface runoff. Under real life conditions of agricultural conservation practices in small scale farming systems, a sufficient soil cover was not obtained for mulching treatments in 2011 and only partially in 2012. In contrast to the vast majority of literature that stresses the positive and even dramatically positive effects of conservation tillage treatments compared with conventional agricultural management techniques, our results reveal possible problems when applying these best management techniques in small scale farming systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews a study {{over six}} years to assess the {{potential}} of stale seed beds in various crops. Using stale seed beds, the farmer has to optimize the combined effect of, firstly, the delaying of the sowing time of the crop and, secondly, {{the timing of the}} stale seed bed (i. e. the period after the soil has been cultivated properly to stimulate emergence of weeds that are subsequently controlled by the definitive seed bed preparation). The effect of delaying crop sowing was analyzed using a historical data set from field experiments with 14 crops, e. g. broad bean, red beet, celeriac, green pea, evening primrose, scorzonera, silage maize, sugar beet. For sugar beet and maize, the experimental data were further analyzed using a model for crop growth. These analyses resulted into a table that gives for each crop the sowing date with on average the highest yield, and a yield reduction factor for every day the sowing is delayed. Effects of the length of the stale seedbed were analyzed using another historical data set on periodicity of emergence {{of a large number of}} different weed species. By combining results on both effects, a prototype Decision Support System was developed to advice the farmer in which crop and with which weed species a stale seedbed will be cost effective. In addition, innovations were developed to further increase the weed reduction, e. g. by covering a <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow</b> to prevent light induced weed germination while controlling the weeds. The results are discussed considering the response of farmers on the result...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} {{the evolution of}} luvisol in its 40 years use as arable soil (with conventional working system), in comparison with its profile in hay field use, within the same ecologically homogenous terrain. The modifications registered in arable field can be synthesized as follows: The worked stratum (Ap) has a different structure and settlement compared to hayfield field. The texture differentiation is intensified, the texture differentiation index grows from 1. 12 to 1. 2. The pseudogleization phenomenon is accentuated in A/Bw horizon. The drop of humus reserve in the first 50 cm of depth, 151 t/ha in the grassland profile compared to 134 t/ha in the arable profile, {{is a consequence of}} intensifying the mineralization processes. A slight soil compaction is observed in the arable and sub-arable horizons, showed by the increase of bulk density from 1. 27 - 1. 43 g/cm 3 to 1. 39 - 1. 46 g/cm 3. pH drops in the Ap horizon from 5. 20 to 5. 17 and rise in the sub-arable horizon with 0. 52 units. The P supply increase in the Ap horizon from 2 to 16 - 17 ppm as a result of fertilisers ’ application. The researches follow then the changes of arable soil properties by a 10 years application of 4 working systems of soil (conventional, paraplow, chisel plow and <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow).</b> The appliance of minimum tillage systems determine an increasing of the humus content and an increasing of the hydro stabile aggregates content with 4. 7 - 13. 6 % on 0 - 30 cm depth towards the classical system [...] T Keywords—Soil usage, soil tillage, soil propertie...|$|E
40|$|Human action upon soil by tillage determines {{important}} morphological, physical-chemical {{and biological}} changes, with different intensities and evaluative directions. Nowadays, it is internationally accepted {{the fact that}} global climatic changes are the results of human intervention in the bio-geo-chemical water and material cycle, and the sequestration of carbon in soil is considered an important intervention to limit these changes. Carbon sequestration in soil is net advantageous, improving the productivity and sustainability. The more the organic content in soil is higher the better soil aggregation is. The soil without organic content is compact. This reduces its capacity to infiltrate water, nutrients solubility and productivity, and that way it reduces the soil capacity for carbon sequestration. Organic matter is an extremely important constituent of soils and is vital {{to many of the}} hydrological, biological and chemical reactions required for sustaining plant life. We present the influence of conventional plough tillage system on soil, water and organic matter conservation in comparison with an alternative minimum tillage system (paraplow, chisel plow and <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow).</b> The application of minimum tillage systems increased the organic matter content 0. 8 % to 22. 1 % and water stabile aggregate content from 1. 3 % to 13. 6 %, in the 0 - 30 cm depth, as compared to the classical system. For the organic matter content and the wet aggregate stability, the statistical analysis of the data showed, increasing positive significance of minimum systems. While the soil fertility and the wet aggregate stability were initially low, the effect of conservation practices on the soil features resulted in a positive impact on the water permeability of the soil. Availability of soil moisture during the crop growth resulted in better plant water status. Subsequent release of conserved soil water regulated proper plant water status, soil structure, and lowered soil pene-trometer resistance. </p...|$|E
40|$|Side {{effects of}} {{herbicides}} and increasing prevalence of organic farming nduce {{the need of}} further developments in mechanical weed control. Mechanical weed control is mainly associated with cultivating tillage (e. g. tertiary tillage), but also primary and secondary tillage influence weeds. Cultivating tillage is performed in growing crops with harrows, hoes, brushes {{and a number of}} special tools for intra-row weed control. Inter-row cultivations have been used in many decades in row crops and perform in general well. To increase their capacity and accuracy, guidance systems are important to steer the hoes along the rows. The success of inter- and intra-row cultivation is highly influenced by selectivity factors. The control mechanisms of all cultivating tillage methods are burring in soil, uprooting,and tearing plants into pieces. Especially for whole crop and intra-row cultivators, successful weed control is highly influenced by appropriate adjustment of the intensity (aggressiveness) of cultivation according to the variations of soil resistance, crop and weed resistance to cultivation and the competitive interactions between crop and weeds. Site-specific weed management aims to identify the spatial and temporal variability of weeds and manage them correspondingly. New technologies for sensing crops and weeds in real-time and robotics allow a precise operation of mechanical tools, to improve efficacy of control and reduce operation costs. Hence in this chapter, implements for mechanical weeding are described together with their options for site-specific weed control strategies. Harrows and rotary hoes are used for whole crop treatment, but it is essential to find the right timing and intensity to obtain the best selectivity and yield response. Different implements attached to the same vehicle are combined together attempting more selective weed control,like the in-row cultivator, the <b>rotary</b> <b>harrow,</b> and the precision hoe. Lately, there are prototypes intending automatic adjustment of the aggressiveness for the springtine harrow and autonomous guidance for hoes, thus getting closer to a real-time site-specific weed management approach...|$|E
