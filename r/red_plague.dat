25|$|An {{estimate}} of the mortality rate for the modern bubonic plague, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, {{although it may be}} higher in underdeveloped regions. Symptoms of the disease include fever of , headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per cent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright <b>red.</b> Septicemic <b>plague</b> is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time {{for the development of the}} enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.|$|R
50|$|Bayside Shakedown: The Movie (Odoru Daisōsasen Za Mūbī Wangansho Shijōsaiaku No Mikkakan!) is a 1998 Japanese police drama / comedy film. The film {{is based}} on the hit TV series Bayside Shakedown which had just {{finished}} airing roughly {{a year and a half}} before. Like the TV series, the film satirizes the bureaucracy and <b>red</b> tape which <b>plague</b> the Japanese police force, as well as certain elements of Japanese society, while at the same time avoiding falling into the typical formula of car chases and gunbattles that define most police dramas. It was released on October 31, 1998.|$|R
50|$|<b>Red</b> <b>Plague</b> (Czerwona Zaraza) is a Polish poem, {{written in}} 1944 by Józef Szczepański, a World War II era poet, who {{died during the}} Warsaw Uprising. <b>Red</b> <b>plague</b> {{inspired}} Polish Oscar-winning film director, Andrzej Wajda to create the movie Kanał. The poem, which described the failed hopes of Warsaw insurgents that Red Army would save them, was banned in the People's Republic of Poland due to its anti-Soviet context; during the Joseph Stalin era the very possession of it was punishable by imprisonment.|$|E

30|$|Phosphorus {{has three}} allotropes, white P, black P, and red P [23]. White P is toxic and {{chemically}} unstable, {{and is not}} suitable for the application in LIBs. Black P has good thermodynamic stability and conductivity, but the complex preparation process limits its large-scale applications [24 – 26]. Among these three different allotropes, red P is the most promising candidate [27] {{for the next generation}} high-energy anodic materials because of its stability and abundance. However, <b>red</b> P is <b>plagued</b> by its poor electronic conductivity (10 −[*] 12  S m−[*] 1) and drastic volume change (300 %) during the lithiation-delithiation process when served as anodes for rechargeable LIBs [28, 29].|$|R
50|$|Garrosh Hellscream (voiced by Patrick Seitz) was {{a former}} warchief of the Horde faction. He {{is the son of}} the heroic warrior Grommash Hellscream. When the orc clans of Draenor united to form the first Horde in order to march through the Dark Portal to conquer Azeroth, Garrosh {{remained}} behind in Nagrand due to being infected with <b>red</b> pox, a <b>plague</b> that had begun to infect the orcs. During the events of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, the WarchiefThrall, founder of the renewed Horde, travelled to Nagrand, where he met Garrosh. Though he wasn't demonically influenced himself, Garrosh was haunted by his family's legacy: his father was the first orc to embrace corruption by drinking the blood of the pit lord Mannoroth. Garrosh lived in the shadow of his father's acts until he met Thrall, who explained to the younger Hellscream that Grommash ultimately gave his life to lift the demonic blood-curse, and freed his race from servitude to dark forces. Learning of his father's great deeds, Garrosh returned to Azeroth with Thrall and {{became a member of the}} Horde.|$|R
50|$|Care {{should be}} used for parts exposed to high {{humidity}} environments. When the silver layer is porous or contains cracks, the underlying copper undergoes rapid galvanic corrosion, flaking off the plating and exposing the copper itself; a process known as <b>red</b> <b>plague.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Red</b> <b>plague</b> is an {{accelerated}} corrosion of copper when plated with silver.

50|$|When {{the ambitious}} yet evil {{scientist}} Anders Raeborne (David Hewlett) used an extract from Lilith's blood {{in an attempt}} to become immortal, he became the evil Demonicus, a powerful monster who transmitted a <b>red</b> <b>plague</b> with his bite and tongue.

50|$|<b>Red</b> <b>plague</b> {{is caused}} by {{normally}} occurring electrode potential difference between the copper and silver, leading to galvanic corrosion occurring in pits or breaks in the silver plating. It develops {{in the presence of}} moisture and oxygen when the porosity of the silver layer allows them to come in contact with the copper-silver interface. It is an electrochemical corrosion—a copper-silver galvanic cell forms and the copper acts as sacrificial anode. In suitable conditions, the corrosion can proceed rather quickly and lead to total circuit failure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{publication}} of the newspaper began in March 1932, a year before Hitler's rise to power. An article published at that time brought an anti-semitic song in which Jews were described as golden pot-owning thieves of the exchange rate, traffickers and oppressors of the working people. In the lyrics, Hitler was described as the savior who would [...] "wake" [...] Germany up, breaking the chains that Jews imposed {{to the people and}} the country. During the Spanish Civil War, the newspaper featured a cover story blaming the Jewish people - described as [...] "carriers of the <b>red</b> <b>plague</b> bacillus" [...] - for the conflict.|$|E
5000|$|Szczepanski {{wrote it}} on August 29, 1944, {{just a few}} days before his death (he died on September 10). The author {{expressed}} his anger at the Red Army units, which were positioned on the eastern bank of the Vistula, but did not help the insurgents ("We are waiting for you, <b>red</b> <b>plague...</b> you will be salvation welcomed with revulsion... we are waiting for you, our eternal enemy... bloody murderer of so many of our brethren.... Your red, victorious army has been lying at the bright feet of burning Warsaw and is feeding its soul with bloody pain of a handful of madmen who are dying in the ruins.") ...|$|E
5000|$|Many of Szczepański's poems {{became popular}} in {{occupied}} Warsaw, particularly {{as he used}} them to chronicle the fights of the Batalion Parasol; some were made into songs. Many were however destroyed during the Uprising; less than 20 survive to this day. His poetry, particularly his poem <b>Red</b> <b>plague,</b> {{was also one of}} the things that inspired Polish Oscar-winning film director, Andrzej Wajda, to create the movie Kanał.

The loss is keenly felt due to a <b>red</b> <b>plague</b> killing local fish in large numbers. Porter harshly berates Sandy for {{allowing}} Flipper {{to jump into the}} holding pen of valuable fish waiting to go to market, [...] "What's wrong with you boy? How old are you, 12, almost in your teens? Or are you a child who doesn't have the sense to know what his next meal depends on?" [...] Reduced to tears, Sandy retreats to his bedroom as Porter's wife Martha (Kathleen Maguire) remonstrates that [...] "he's only a boy".|$|E
5000|$|The Han polymath Zhang Heng's (2nd century CE) [...] "Dongjing fu" [...] {{poem about}} the capital Luoyang contemporaneously {{describes}} fangxiang(shi) at the Nuo ritual.At {{the end of}} the year the great no takes place for the purpose of driving off all spectres. The fang-siang carry their spears, wu and hih hold their bundles of reed. Ten thousand lads with red heads and black clothes, with bows of peach wood and arrows of thorny jujube shoot at random all around. Showers of potsherds and pebbles come down like rain, infallibly killing strong spectres as well as the weak. Flaming torches run after these beings, so that a sparkling and streaming glare chases the <b>red</b> <b>plague</b> to all sides; thereupon they destroy them in the imperial moats and break down the suspension bridges (to prevent their return). In this way they attack ch‘i and mei, strike at wild and ferocious beings, cleave sinuous snakes, beat out the brains of fang-liang, imprison keng-fu in the clear and chilly waters, and drown nü-pah in the waters animated by gods. They cut asunder the khwei and the hü, as also the wang-siang; they mutilate the ye-chung, and exterminate the yiu-kwang [...] The eight spirits (cardinal points of the Universe) thereby quiver; how much more must this be the case with the ki, the yuh and the pih-fang. The land of Tu-shoh, affords protection by peach branches, the effects of which are enhanced by Yuh-lei and Shen-tu, who on the other side, with ropes of rush in their hands, by means of their sharp eyesight spy out the darkest corners, in order to catch the spectres which still remain after the chase. The houses in the capital thus being purged to their most secluded parts, and delivered from everything undesirable, the Yin and the Yang may unite harmoniously, and all beings and things thus be produced in due time.

40|$|The Lakshadweep (Laccadive) {{islands are}} {{situated}} in the Arabian Sea about 225 to 450 km from the southwest coast of India. These islands situated 1 to 2 meters {{above mean sea level}} has a very thin lens of fresh water floating over the seawater. Almost all fresh water sources are contaminated due to seawater intrusion. The drinking water wells contain excessive nitrate concentration originating from septic tanks, other human wastes and fertilizers used in garden. All drinking water sources show positive bacterial (faecal coliform) count exceeding the normal level. Increasing population pressure (2600 people / km 2) leading to the accumulation of more diseases in corals.

40|$|You {{taught me}} language, and my profit on ‘t Is I {{know how to}} curse. The <b>red</b> <b>plague</b> rid you For {{learning}} me your language!” (The Tempest, I. ii. 362 - 4). What does a home mean to you? Have you left it? How did you get there? Would you go back? Starting with the foundational travel narrative in Western literature, Homer’s The Odyssey, we’ll journey across time and the page through texts invested in home and the journey (there and back). We’ll also be asking why we write, or {{what it means to}} write. Shakespeare will take us from the Classics into the English Renaissance. In The Tempest we have the opportunity to explore drama for the stage that is both about the estranged home and the process of writing, or crafting art. Leaping ahead into American literature, we will read Frederick Douglass’ Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, {{as an example of the}} memoir and the power of the written word. Douglass asks where his home should be, as well as how he might get there. The memoir will lead us into the novel, and Lois-Ann Yamanaka’s Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers. Yamanaka offers up a novel about growing up and finding oneself, part of which involves finding oneself at home. We launch into the short story close to home, with Kristiana Kahakauwila’s This Is Paradise: Stories, a collection that asks all sorts of questions about home, the possibility of departure and return, as well as identity and knowing. Part of what is at stake in this class is a sampling of genre, kind, or type, and the way by which writers opt to craft narrative. We start with epic poetry, delve into the early modern stage, slip into memoir and rhetoric, wrestle with the novel, and close with the short story. This is a student-centered course. You must participate to learn. I emphasize participation, including listening, lecture, group discussion, small group discussion, and workshopping...|$|E
