40|$|To {{assess the}} time course and {{magnitude}} of change in left ventricular (LV) wall stress and ejection performance indices, 24 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis were prospectively evaluated. Each patient underwent resting radionuclide angiography (RNA), echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization (high fidelity pressure) before AVR, then RNA and echocardiogram at one week and six months after AVR. Patients were stratified by preoperative ejection fraction (EF) into <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> (< 50 %) and normal EF (≥ 50 %) groups. Pre-operatively, peak positive dp/dt was lower in the <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> group (1300 vs 1700 mmHg/sec, p= 0. 035), and wall stress was elevated similarly in both groups (p=NS).

40|$|Background Mortality {{in heart}} failure (HF) remains high but {{causes of death}} are incompletely defined. As HF is {{heterogeneous}} syndrome categorized according to ejection fraction (EF), the association between EF and causes of death is important, yet elusive. Method and Results Community subjects with HF were classified according to preserved (> 50 %) and <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> (< 50 %). Deaths were classified as coronary heart disease (CHD), other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular. Among 1063 persons with HF, 45 % had preserved EF with less cardiovascular risk factors and less coronary disease than those with <b>reduced</b> <b>EF.</b> At 5 years, survival was 45 % (95 % CI 43 %- 49 %) and 43 % of the deaths were non-cardiovascular.

40|$|AbstractHeart failure (HF) occurs {{across the}} entire range of left {{ventricular}} (LV) ejection fractions (EF), not just <b>reduced</b> <b>EF.</b> Nearly half or more patients presenting with HF have a preserved EF> 0. 50 (HFpEF). Diastolic dysfunction is apparent in all patients with HF, regardless of EF.

40|$|Systolic left {{ventricular}} function strongly influences {{the blood pressure}} waveform. Therefore, pressure-derived parameters might potentially be used as non-invasive, diagnostic markers of {{left ventricular}} impairment. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the performance of pressure-based parameters in combination with electrocardiography (ECG) for the detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction defined as severely reduced ejection fraction (EF). Two populations, each comprising patients with <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> and pressure-matched controls, were included for the main analysis (51 / 102 patients) and model testing (44 / 88 patients). Central pressure was derived from radial readings and used to compute blood flow. Subsequently, pulse wave analysis and wave intensity analysis were performed and the ratio of the two peaks of forward intensity (SDR) was calculated as a novel index of ventricular function. SDR was significantly decreased in the <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> group (2. 5 vs. 4. 4, P< 0. 001), as was central pulse pressure, augmentation index and ejection duration (ED), while the QRS-duration was prolonged. SDR and ED were independent predictors of ventricular impairment and when combined with QRS in a simple decision tree, a <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> could be detected with a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 80 %. The independent power of ED, SDR and QRS to predict <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> was furthermore confirmed in the test population. The detection or indication of reduced ejection fraction from pressure-derived parameters seems feasible. These parameters could help to improve the quality of cardiovascular risk stratification or might be used in screening strategies in the general population...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionHeart failure (HF) is {{associated}} with high morbidity and mortality. A significant component of HF-related adverse outcome occurs during hospitalization. ObjectiveTo assess features and in-hospital outcomes of patients hospitalized for a first episode of HF. MethodsWe prospectively recruited 799 consecutive patients hospitalized for a first episode of HF during 2000 in the Somme department (France). We evaluated in-hospital mortality in this cohort, identified factors predictive for hospital death, and compared the mortality in patients with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF). ResultsThe {{mean age of the}} study population was 75 ± 12 years. EF, assessed in 662 patients (83 %), was preserved (≥ 50 %) in 56 % of cases. During hospitalization, 64 deaths (8 %) were recorded. The major causes of in-hospital death were acute pulmonary oedema (50 %) and cardiogenic shock (22 %). Coronary artery disease, low systolic blood pressure on admission, increased heart rate on admission, renal failure, <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> (< 50 %) and older age were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Patients with preserved EF were older and comprised a greater proportion of women. In-hospital mortality of the <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> group was higher than that of the preserved EF group (8. 2 % versus 2. 7 %, p= 0. 002). On multivariable analysis, <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> was independently associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio 2. 32; 95 % confidence interval 1. 06 - 5. 11; p= 0. 03). In propensity-matched patients, in-hospital mortality was higher in the <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> group (7. 6 % versus 2. 2 % p= 0. 02).

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is scant {{evidence}} on the effect that chronic kidney disease (CKD) confers on clinically meaningful outcomes among patients with heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HF-PEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified a community-based cohort of patients with HF. Electronic medical record data were used to divide into HF-PEF and <b>reduced</b> left ventricular <b>EF</b> {{on the basis of}} quantitative and qualitative estimates. Level of CKD was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and by dipstick proteinuria. We followed patients for a median of 22. 1 months for outcomes of death and hospitalization (HF-specific and all-cause). Multivariable Cox regression estimated the adjusted relative-risk of outcomes by level of CKD, separately for HF-PEF and HF with <b>reduced</b> left ventricular <b>EF.</b> We identified 14 579 patients with HF-PEF and 9762 with HF with <b>reduced</b> left ventricular <b>EF.</b> When compared with patients with eGFR between 60 and 89 mL/min per 1. 73 m(2), lower eGFR was associated with an independent graded increased risk of death and hospitalization. For example, among patients with HF-PEF, the risk of death was nearly double for eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min per 1. 73 m(2) and 7 x higher for eGFR/min per 1. 73 m(2), with similar findings in those with HF with <b>reduced</b> left ventricular <b>EF.</b> CONCLUSIONS: CKD is common and an important independent predictor of death and hospitalization in adults with HF across the spectrum of left ventricular systolic function.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and {{the association}} between white matter integrity and executive function (EF) performance in postacute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In addition, we examined whether injury severity, as measured by loss of consciousness (LOC) versus alterations in consciousness (AOC), is related to white matter microstructural alterations and neuropsychological outcome. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty Iraq and Afghanistan War era veterans {{with a history of}} mTBI and 15 healthy veteran control participants. RESULTS: There were no significant overall group differences between control and mTBI participants on DTI measures. However, a subgroup of mTBI participants with EF decrements (n = 13) demonstrated significantly decreased fractional anisotropy of prefrontal white matter, corpus callosum, and cingulum bundle structures compared with mTBI participants without EF decrements (n = 17) and control participants. Participants having mTBI with LOC were more likely to evidence <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> performances and disrupted ventral prefrontal white matter integrity when compared with either mTBI participants without LOC or control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that altered white matter integrity contributes to <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> in subgroups of veterans with a history of mTBI and that LOC may be a risk factor for <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> as well as associated changes to ventral prefrontal white matter.

This study investigated whether using dose response concepts to re-evaluate the relationship between serum digoxin concentration and key mortality outcomes in {{patients with}} <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> in the Digitalis Investigation Group trial would help clarify efficacy and safety. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling and propensity score adjustment assessed the relationship between serum digoxin concentration (≥ 0. 5 [*]ng/mL) as a continuous variable and mortality outcomes. In patients treated with digoxin, a significant linear association was found between serum concentration and all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1. 25, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 14 - 1. 38, P < 0. 001 per 0. 5 [*]ng/mL increase in serum concentration]. Based on this relationship, a bidirectional association was found between digoxin therapy and all-cause mortality when compared with placebo. The lowest serum concentrations (0. 5 - 0. 7 [*]ng/mL) were associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 67 - 0. 89, P < 0. 001) while high serum concentrations (1. 6 - 2. 0 [*]ng/mL) were associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 58, P = 0. 001). Consistent with this finding, lower serum concentrations (0. 5 - 0. 7 [*]ng/mL) were associated with reduced death from worsening heart failure and a neutral effect on cardiovascular death not due to worsening heart failure.

We recently identified a circular RNA called MICRA which was associated with HF development after MI. Here, we tested whether MICRA was able to risk stratify MI patients. Methods: MICRA was assessed in whole blood samples collected at reperfusion in 472 patients with acute MI. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was evaluated by echocardiography at 4  months. Multivariable analyses with ordinal regression were conducted to determine the ability of MICRA to classify patients into 3 EF groups: <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> (≤ 40 %), mid-range EF (4149 %) and preserved EF (≥ 50 %).

Similarly, % predicted peak VO 2 was lower in patients with <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> (52. 9 % vs. 73. 1 %, p < 0. 001) and correlated with the variations in IVCa (r = 0. 7, p = 0. 001). Multivariate analysis of 2 -dimensional and Doppler variables in the presence of reduced LV EF revealed only IVCa and Aa as independent predictors of % predicted peak VO 2 (r 2 = 0. 612, p = 0. 02 for IVCa and p = 0. 009 for Aa). The overall performance of IVCa in the prediction of exercise capacity was good (area under the curve = 0. 86, p < 0. 001). ConclusionsAssessment of TD-derived IVC and atrial stretch velocities provide independent prediction of exercise capacity in patients with reduced LV EF. Assessment of LV pre-ejectional stretch and shortening mechanics at rest may be useful for determining the myocardial functional reserve of patients with <b>reduced</b> <b>EF...</b>|$|E

Methods and results: Results of the EMPHASIS-HF trial in patients (n = 2737) with HF and <b>reduced</b> <b>EF</b> with mild symptoms, randomized to eplerenone or placebo, were analysed {{with regard to}} the presence or occurrence of hypokalaemia (serum K+ < 4. 0 mmol/L) and the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF (primary endpoint). Median follow-up was 21 months. Baseline hypokalaemia and hypokalaemia during follow-up were common occurrences (19. 6...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of tissue Doppler is that diastolic and systolic function can be measured by the same tool. Before the advent of tissue Doppler, systolic function was usually assessed with Ejection fraction (EF), and diastolic function by mitral flow. This led {{to the concept of}} pure [...] "Diastolic heart failure". However, In hypertrophic left ventricles with small cavity size, the systolic function is <b>reduced</b> although <b>EF</b> is not,as the EF is dependent on the relative wall thickness. This has led to the concept of [...] "pure diastolic heart failure" [...] being discarded. The preferred term is now heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). This is common and is often seen in Hypertensive heart disease, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Aortic stenosis, and may comprise as much as 50% of the total heart failure population. The prognosis of HFPEF is the same as for heart failure with dilated hearts.|$|R
