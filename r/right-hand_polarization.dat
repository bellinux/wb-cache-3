In our approach, a polyphase filter is used to obtain the four 90 ° phase shift outputs to feed a square microstrip patch antenna.

40|$|Recent {{comparisons}} of magnetic field directions derived from maser Zeeman splitting with those derived from continuum source rotation measures have prompted new {{analysis of the}} propagation of the Zeeman split components, and the inferred field orientation. In order to do this, we first review differing electric field polarization conventions used in past studies. With these clearly and consistently defined, we then show that for a given Zeeman splitting spectrum, the magnetic field direction is fully determined and predictable on theoretical grounds: when a magnetic field is oriented away from the observer, the left-hand circular polarization is observed at higher frequency and the <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> at lower frequency. This is consistent with classical Lorentzian derivations. The consequent interpretation of recent measurements then raises {{the possibility of a}} reversal between the large-scale field (traced by rotation measures) and the small-scale field (traced by maser Zeeman splitting).

40|$|The linear {{theory of}} {{electromagnetic}} instabilities {{driven by an}} energetic ion beam streaming parallel to a magnetic field in a homogeneous Vlasov plasma is considered. Numerical solutions of the full dispersion equation are presented. At propagation parallel to the magnetic field, there are four distinct instabilities. A sufficiently energetic beam gives rise to two unstable modes with <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization,</b> one resonant with the beam, the other nonresonant. A beam with sufficiently large T (perpendicular to B) /T (parallel to B) {{gives rise to the}} left-hand ion cyclotron anisotropy instability at relatively small beam velocities, and a sufficiently hot beam drives unstable a left-hand beam resonant mode. The parametric dependences of the growth rates for the three high beam velocity instabilities are presented here. In addition, some properties at oblique propagation are examined. It is demonstrated that, as the beam drift velocity is increased, relative maxima in growth rates can arise at harmonics of the ion cyclotron resonance for both right and left elliptically polarized modes...|$|E
40|$|Polarization and {{direction}} of arrival of VLF emissions have been observed at Syowa Station in the Antarctic {{by a combination of}} a vertical antenna and a crossed loop antenna with their planes oriented in geomagnetic E-W and N-S directions.

But there seemed to be some seasonal variations in the ratio of <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> waves to left-hand ones. A pronounced example is that the emission at 25 kHz was linearly polarized in winter (July and August). The oscillographic patterns obtained with a direction finder seem to indicate that the emission at 12 kHz arrived simultaneously from various directions, and that the emission was almost elliptically polarized. But in a few cases, the emission seemed to come down roughly from a vertical direction along a geomagnetic field line, and to be circularly polarized...|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of 23 magnetic pulsation events observed by the AMPTE CCE spacecraft are studied. These events are selected {{on the basis}} of the field magnitude which oscillated at the second harmonic of a simultaneously present transverse oscillation. The events have a second harmonic period of 80 - 600 s (roughly the Pc 5 range), are observed in cluster in the dawn (0300 - 0800 magnetic local time, MLT) and dusk (1600 - 2100 MLT) sectors, and are localized near the magnetic equator. Although the azimuthal wave number estimated from an ion finite Larmor radius effect, is generally large (about 50), there is a marked difference between the events observed in the dawn and dusk sectors. In the dawn sector the waves have low frequencies (1 - 5 mHz), indicate left-hand polarization with respect to the ambient magnetic field, and propagate eastward with respect to the spacecraft. In the dusk sector the waves have high frequencies (5 - 15 mHz), indicate <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization,</b> and propagate westward. It is suggested that the waves are all westward propagating in the plasma rest frame and that local-time-dependent Doppler shift is the reason for the local time dependence of the wave properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Hall {{electromotive}} forces (HEMFs) on the linear stability of protostellar disks are examined. Earlier {{work on this}} topic focused on axial field and perturbation wavenumber geometry. Here we treat the problem more generally. Both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric cases are treated. Though seldom explicitly included in calculations, HEMFs appear to be important whenever Ohmic dissipation is. They allow for the appearance of electron whistler waves, and since these have <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization,</b> a helicity factor is also introduced into the stability problem. This factor {{is the product of}} the components of the angular velocity and magnetic field along the perturbation wavenumber, and it is destabilizing when negative. An important finding of our more general calculation is that unless the field and angular velocity are exactly aligned, it is always possible to find destabilizing wavenumbers. HEMFs can destabilize any differential rotation law, even those with angular velocity increasing outward. Regardless of the sign of the angular velocity gradient, the maximum growth rate is always given in magnitude by the local Oort A value of the disk, as in the standard magnetorotational instability. The role of HEMFs may prove crucial to understanding how turbulence is maintained in the "low state" of eruptive disk systems...|$|E
40|$|The Cassini Faraday {{rotation}} experiment {{improves the}} current {{understanding of the}} coronal magnetic field by making the first measurements of the magnetic field within two solar radii of the south pole and by allowing {{the separation of the}} changing electron density from the magnetic field during transient crossings of the line of sight. Simultaneous ranging data to Cassini also contributes to the growing body of empirical electron density models by providing electron density data at solar maximum at varying latitudes including over the poles. Faraday rotation data in the solar corona were collected in 2002 and 2003 using the Cassini spacecraft in cruise to Saturn. Although Cassini primarily transmits in <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization,</b> enough left-hand is produced to enable polarization measurements. We show that during solar conjunction Faraday rotation is measurable with Cassini. In the X- and Ka-bands both datasets currently show an asymmetric diurnal pattern in polarization not associated with the ionosphere. The Ka-band is much more sensitive to pointing accuracy and experienced periods of power drop outs which caused the left-circularly polarized signal to drop into the noise on occasion during the 2003 conjunction.

40|$|Evidence for {{two types}} of {{relatively}} large amplitude MHD waves upstream and downstream of quasi-parallel forward and reverse interplanetary shocks is presented. The first mode is an Alfven wave with frequencies (in the spacecraft frame) {{in the range of}} 0. 025 to 0. 07 Hz. This is a left-hand polarized mode and propagates within a few degrees of the ambient magnetic field. The second is a fast MHD mode with frequencies in the range of 0. 025 to 0. 17 Hz, <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> and propagating along the magnetic field. These waves are detected principally in association with quasi-parallel shock.

40|$|Elliptical {{polarization}} and mode splitting {{have been}} detected in the magnetic component of discrete, well defined Schumann resonance excitations. These ELF excitations, which are large electromagnetic transients of approximately 1 s duration, are called Q-bursts and typically occur every few minutes. They {{are believed to be}} the signature of the impulsive excitation of the earth-ionosphere cavity by ultra-large lightning currents. In this paper the magnetic polarization and spectral characteristics of four large Q-bursts are examined in detail using a new analysis technique. Two events display <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization</b> and two display left-hand polarization. The theoretical polarization properties of the central and side multiplets of the Schumann resonances are used to define a local orthogonal coordinate system in the measurement frame in which these components may be separated. Maximum entropy spectrums computed separately for what are identified to be the central and side multiplets in this coordinate system show distinctly different eigenfrequencies for the lowest mode near 7. 5 Hz. For the limited number of cases examined the magnitude of the line splitting detected using this technique is roughly 1. 4 - 1. 8 Hz, larger by nearly a factor of two than theoretical or observed values of the splitting previously reported. The frequencies of the side multiplets may lie either above or below the frequency of the central multiplet...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{records of}} VLF (very low frequencies) {{emissions}} {{have been carried}} out at two ground-based stations located at similar geomagnetic latitudes near L ~ 5. 5 and spaced in the longitude by ~ 400 km, Kannuslehto (KAN) in Finland and Lovozero (LOZ) in Russia, using quite similar VLF receivers with two calibrated orthogonal air-core loop antennas. We found that the general spectral properties of the VLF chorus emissions at these two stations were similar and typically have <b>right-hand</b> <b>polarization.</b> Contrary to VLF chorus, the short-period VLF emissions (periodic emissions, PE) in which separated spectral elements are repeated with the periodicity of 3 – 4 s were mostly left-hand polarized. Usually, these waves propagated in the north–south direction. We suppose that PEs are generated inside of the plasmasphere by the cyclotron instability under a quasi-linear relaxation of the energetic electron distribution function. However, sometimes PE occurred only at an individual station. We speculated that this could be due to the influence of the local inhomogeneities to the VLF waves during the propagation through the ionospheric trough to the ground. Unusual series of short-duration (10 – 100 s) bursts of VLF emissions, lasting several hours, were also found in the morning under very quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp ~ 0 – 1). Generally, these emissions were observed simultaneously at KAN and LOZ showing both right-hand and left-hand polarization, and different arrival directions provided the rather extended ionospheric exit area...|$|E

The properties of waves propagating at different angles (to the ambient magnetic field B_ 0) and β (the {{ratio of the}} plasma to magnetic pressures) values are investigated. It is shown that two linearly polarized waves, namely the fast and Alfvén modes in the low-β (β≪ 1) plasmas, the fast and slow modes in the β∼ 1 plasmas, and the Alfvén and slow modes in the high-β (β≫ 1) plasmas, become circularly polarized at the near-parallel (to B_ 0) propagation. The negative magnetic-helicity of the Alfvén mode occurs only at small or moderate angles in the low-β plasmas, and the ion cross-helicity of the slow mode is nearly {{the same as that}} of the Alfvén mode in the high-β plasmas.
