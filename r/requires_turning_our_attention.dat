In addition, advanced technology has quickly changed {{the structure of}} cities, followed by revolutionary changes are growing faster these days and this <b>requires</b> us to <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> into developing a symbiotic eco-city, which {{will make it possible}} for further sustainable development. In this regard, it grows much more important to manage a flood of information from various intelligent devices and systems for environmental maintenance. The structure and meaning of modern info-oriented cities have changed their focus from tangible materials and resources, or energy into intangible information and knowledge. Now it has become the most important on how to manage and utilize a vast amount of information in order to strengthen the competitiveness and improve the life quality. This study finds methods for an effective city management and planning, or visualization of information for ecology-friendly education in order to provide a comfortable city life and develop a cleaner city, by efficiently managing information on several ecology protection areas and their sauces of pollution in the centre of a city. The goal is to help city managers or planners to be better aware of environmental information related to their work...|$|R
