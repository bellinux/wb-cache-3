The point where the ray is reflected inside the right-angle prism is also changed as the angle of incident ray changed. In an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) measurement system, range of this point determines size of sample.

A model for the compression of ultrashort light pulses is presented for a set of prisms. The model shows how to obtain a good configuration in the laboratory depending on the prism material.

40|$|Displacement laser interferometers and grating interferometers are {{two main}} {{apparatus}} for the micron-nanometer displacement measurement over a long range. However, the laser interferometers, whose measuring scale {{is based on the}} wavelength, are very sensitive to the environment. On the contrast, the grating interferometers change the measuring scale from wavelength to grating period, which is much stable for the measurement results. But the resolution of grating interferometer is usually lower than that of laser interferometer. Therefore, further investigation is needed to improve the performance of grating interferometer. As we known, the optical subdivision is a main factor that affects the measurement resolution. In this paper, a grating interferometer with high optical subdivision is presented based on the Littrow configuration. We mainly use <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>prisms</b> accompanied with plane mirrors to make the measuring lights diffracted by the grating scale for many times. An optical subdivision factor of 1 / 24 can be obtained by this technique. A main difficulty of this technique is that the grating scale should be with high diffraction efficiency. Fortunately, the measuring light is incident on the grating scale at the Littrow angle, the grating scale can be designed with very high efficiency easily in this condition. Compared with traditional grating interferometers, this kind of grating interferometer can greatly increase the measuring resolution and accuracy, which could be widely used in nanometer-scale fabrications and measurements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the measurement and {{characterization of the}} Surface Plasmon Drag Effect (SPDE) in metallic structures and its application to the electrical detection of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). We demonstrate that SPPs absorbed in a metallic structure generate an electric current, which polarity depends on the propagation direction of the absorbed SPP, without the need of any applied voltage. We investigate the effect in gold and silver thin films of different thickness and on various metallic bilayers, which are deposited on <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>prisms</b> and hemispheres to allow coupling of light to SPP through the Kretschmann-Raether configuration. We then simultaneously measure the angular spectrum of the reflected light and the electric current generated by the effect. The accuracy of the experiment allow us {{to determine the effect}} efficiency and thus to quantitatively compare different samples. In an attempt to clarify the mechanism giving rise to the current generation, we compare our experiments with existing models of the Photon Drag Effect (PDE). This is a similar phenomenon mediated by photon absorption where the current is the result of momentum transfer from the photon to conduction electrons. We find that the model qualitatively predicts our results and thus SPDE can be interpreted as the result of quasimomentum transfer from SPPs to the electrons, but care must be taken for considering the prediction of the model quantitatively. In addiction, we discovered that the effect shows local efficiency enhancement and even change of the current polarity in the presence of films with defects. Those results suggest a different interpretation to previous literature results and overall deepen the understanding of the phenomenon. A clear comprehension of the mechanisms leading to current generation is crucial for designing future applications in sensing and photonic circuitry. Despite the low efficiency in the visible range, in fact, this effect can be attractive since it promises to have an ultrafast response, to retain its sensitivity at longer wavelengths and has the peculiar ability of sensing the propagation direction of the SPP.

40|$|The beam {{emerging}} from an optical fiber in general diverges quite rapidly {{within a short}} distance from the exit face. In applications requiring a fiber beam to be turned through 90 {degrees} within a region of space much smaller than the fiber can be bent, it is necessary not only to turn the exited beam through 90 {degrees}, but also to transform it from a diverging beam to one of convergence, particularly when the turned beam is to be received by a second fiber or is required to have a fluence in some plane nearly equal to that within the original fiber. To this end, fiber optic devices for turning an exit fiber through 90 {degrees} in a small region of space were designed on the basis of simple geometric optics. One design involves a combination of a spherical lens and a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>prism.</b> Another design utilizes a half-sphere lens with its diametrical face at 45 {degrees} to the path of the exit fiber beam.

40|$|High {{accuracy}} {{angle measurement}} at the sub-{mu}rad level requires extremely high instrument stability. In {{order to reach}} sub-{mu}rad stability (0. 1 arc second or less) over long time periods, {{it is necessary to}} maintain the test object and almost all of the optical components in the measuring instrument in very steady positions. However, mechanical force relaxation, thermal expansion, and asymmetric structures produce angular and linear displacements in the system resulting in angular measurement error. A Long-Trace-Profiler (LTP) -based stable equipment is used to test precision angular stability with sub-{mu}rad resolution. Long term stability over 15 hours has been measured on different kind of mechanical structures. Temperature monitoring during the tests is extremely important. Some test results showing the effects of thermal variations are presented, which indicate that temperature stability on the order of 0. 1 C is absolutely necessary for repeatable sub-{mu}rad measurements. The optical method, using optics with an even number of reflecting surfaces (for example, a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>prism,</b> pentaprism, or rhomboid prism) to reduce the influence of existing angular displacement, is introduced and the comparison measurement is presented.

The outcome of the first phase of this program was the selection of broadband polarimetric differential interferometry (BPDI) for further prototype instrumentation development. This approach is based on the measurement of the optical path difference (OPD) between two orthogonally polarized light beams in a single-crystal sapphire disk. The objective of this program is to bring the BPDI sensor technology, which has already been demonstrated in the laboratory, to a level where the sensor can be deployed in the harsh industrial environments and will become commercially viable. Research efforts were focused on analyzing and testing factors that impact performance degradation of the initially designed sensor prototype, including sensing element movement within the sensing probe and optical signal quality degradation.

50|$|Optical {{wedges and}} {{reflections}} from uncoated optical glass surfaces {{are used to}} attenuate high power laser beams. About 4% is reflected from the air/glass interface and several wedges {{can be used to}} greatly attenuate the beam to levels that can be attenuated with ND filters. The angle of the wedge is typically selected so that the second reflection from the surface does not hit the active area of the CCD, and that no interference fringes are visible. The farther the CCD is from the wedge, the smaller the angle required. Wedges have the disadvantage of both translating and bending the beam direction — paths will no longer lie on convenient rectangular coordinates. Rather than using a wedge, an optical-quality thick glass plate tilted to the beam can also work — actually, this is the same as a wedge with a 0° angle. The thick glass will translate the beam but it will not change the angle of the output beam. The glass must be thick enough so that the beam does not overlap with itself to produce interference fringes, and if possible that the secondary reflection does not illuminate the active area of the CCD. The Fresnel reflection of a beam from a glass plate is different for the s- and p-polarizations (s is parallel {{to the surface of the}} glass, and p is perpendicular to s) and changes as a function of angle of incidence - keep this in mind if you expect that the two polarizations have different beam profiles. To prevent distortion of the beam profile, the glass should be of optical quality — surface flatness of λ/10 (λ=633 nm) and scratch-dig of 40-20 or better. A half-wave plate followed by a polarizing beam splitter form a variable attenuator and this combination is often used in optical systems. The variable attenuator made in this fashion is not recommended for attenuation for beam profiling applications because: (1) the beam profile in the two orthogonal polarizations may be different, (2) the polarization beam cube may have a low optical damage threshold value, and (3) the beam can be distorded in cube polarizers at very high attenuation. Inexpensive cube polarizers are formed by cementing two <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>prisms</b> together. The glue does not stand up well to high powers — the intensity should be kept under 500 mW/mm2. Single-element polarizers are recommended for high powers.|$|R

40|$|Planar, {{integrated}} microscale sensors utilizing prism-coupler type angular interrogation sensing technique {{have been}} demonstrated. The main {{structure of the}} sensor consists of an optical prism coupled to a built-in waveguide to introduce Fraunhofer diffraction when light ray comes into the prism from the waveguide. The Fraunhofer diffraction creates spectrum of consecutive rays over the sensing edge of the prism such {{that there is no}} need for the bulky scanning mechanisms typically used in other macro scale sensing systems. Two types of sensors are presented: (1) total internal reflection based critical point detection (CPD) sensor, and (2) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based resonance point detection (RPD) sensor. The CPD sensor is fabricated by a simple, two-mask process which creates a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>prism</b> with three sides with lengths of 1, 0. 86, and 1. 33 mm, respectively in the prototype design and a waveguide with a cross sectional area of 4 ~ 0. 25 um 2. The 0. 25 um-thick core and the 2. 5 um-thick cladding layers of the waveguide are made of silicon nitride and silicon dioxide, respectively. The CPD sensing technique measures the shift of the critical point of the total reflection as the results of change of refractive index due to biofouling. Optical simulations are used to validate the working principle and the calculated biofouling sensitivity is comparable to the other optical sensing methods. A baseline measurement has been conducted to verify the operation of the sensor with an error of less than ± 0. 002 R. I. U. During a 9 -hour biofouling measurement using milk as the media, a change in the refractive index as much as 0. 0089 is recorded as the result of biofouling. The RPD sensing technique employs surface plasmon resonance as its sensing mechanism by measuring the shift of the resonance point with respect to the change of the incident angle. The design and fabrication process is similar to the fundamental structure of CPD sensors with an additional deposition of a thin metal layer on the sensing edge of the prism. The theoretical sensitivity is calculated as 90 deg RIU - 1, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art optical sensors at 127 deg RIU - 1. The refractive index measurement for selected liquids agrees with the values in the literature with an error range of less than ± 0. 002 R. I. U. Furthermore, the refractive index change of biofouling formation is measured to be 0. 0078 for a 9 -hour experiment using milk as the testing media...|$|E
