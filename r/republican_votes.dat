5|$|Begin the phased {{redeployment}} of U.S. {{forces in}} 2007 and withdraw {{most of them}} by 2008, leaving a small follow-on force for security and policing actions. The plan named as The Biden-Brownback Resolution passed on the Senate floor 75–23 on September 25, 2007, including 26 <b>Republican</b> <b>votes.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of <b>Republican</b> <b>votes),</b> but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some <b>Republican</b> <b>votes,</b> but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
5000|$|At around 2 a.m. EST on January 1, 2013, the Senate {{passed the}} bill, {{by a margin}} of 89-8. [...] 49 Democrats (and Democratic-caucusing Independents) and 40 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> in favor while 3 Democrats and 5 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> against.|$|R
5000|$|The Senate {{then added}} an {{amendment}} to the House's amendment. The House accepted {{the final version of the}} bill on a 338-52 vote on May 18, with 43 Representatives not voting. All 224 Democrats casting votes, as well as 114 <b>Republicans,</b> <b>voted</b> yes. Fifty-two <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> no.|$|R
50|$|Haynsworth was {{defeated}} by a 55 to 45 vote on November 21, 1969. 19 Democrats and 26 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> for Haynsworth while 38 Democrats and 17 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> against the nomination. Haynsworth was the first Supreme Court nominee since John J. Parker (1930) to be defeated by the Senate.|$|R
25|$|Bunning was {{the only}} senator to miss the Senate's {{historic}} Christmas Eve 2009 vote {{on the health care}} reform bill; he cited family commitments as his reason for missing the vote. The bill passed without any <b>Republican</b> <b>votes,</b> 60–39.|$|E
25|$|Mannix conceded the {{election}} on 6 November 2002 after Kulongoski secured a decisive {{lead in the}} vote count. The Libertarian candidate Tom Cox claimed that {{he was responsible for}} Kulongoski's victory as his exit polls suggested he took twice as many <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> as Democratic votes.|$|E
25|$|Appointed to Clinton's cabinet as Treasury Secretary, Bentsen helped win crucial <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> to {{pass the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Bentsen also was pivotal in winning passage of the 1994 crime bill which {{temporarily}} banned assault rifles.|$|E
50|$|The bill, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, {{passed the}} House with {{a vote of}} 266-167, with just over two-thirds of <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> against the bill, and all Democrats and the {{remaining}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> for passage, with one not voting. The bill passed the Senate with a vote of 64-35, with 35 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> against. It was signed by the President on November 2, 2015. The Treasury had estimated that extraordinary measures used to fund the government beyond October 1 would likely be exhausted no later than November 3.|$|R
50|$|There are 400,310 {{registered}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> for 28 delegates.|$|R
50|$|The {{bill had}} the support of both the House and the Senate Democratic {{leadership}} and President Barack Obama. Only 28 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> in favor of the bill in the House with 199 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> against the bill. The bill passed in the House primarily due to support from the Democrats.|$|R
25|$|He was {{nominated}} {{to run again}} for re-election {{to the senate in}} 1936, but turned down the nomination after Governor Paul V. McNutt arranged for the convention to nominate him to run for Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, on a ticket with M. Clifford Townsend. McNutt was considered to be significantly more conservative than Townsend, and party leaders believed Schricker would help draw more <b>Republican</b> <b>votes.</b> Townsend and Schricker won the election and took office in January 1937.|$|E
25|$|In the Presidential primary {{elections}} of February 5, 2008, Sen. Clinton won 61.2% of the Bronx's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8% for Barack Obama and 1.0% {{for the other}} four candidates combined (John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson and Joe Biden). On the same day, John McCain won 54.4% of the borough's 5,643 <b>Republican</b> <b>votes,</b> Mitt Romney 20.8%, Mike Huckabee 8.2%, Ron Paul 7.4%, Rudy Giuliani 5.6%, and the other candidates (Fred Thompson, Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes) 3.6% between them.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Schultz was {{the only}} Senate <b>Republican</b> to <b>vote</b> against the Wisconsin budget repair bill which sparked the 2011 Wisconsin protests. Several Assembly <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> against the bill as well.|$|R
50|$|On April 8, 1970, the United States Senate {{refused to}} confirm Carswell's {{nomination}} {{to serve on}} the Supreme Court. The vote was 51 to 45, with 17 Democrats and 28 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> for Carswell, and 38 Democrats and 13 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> against him. Nixon accused Democrats of having an anti-Southern bias as a result.|$|R
50|$|The United States Senate advised and {{consented to}} {{ratification}} of the first treaty on March 16, 1978 and to the second treaty on April 18 by identical 68 to 32 margins. On both votes, 52 Democrats and 16 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> in favor of advising and consenting to ratification, while 10 Democrats and 22 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> against.|$|R
25|$|McCall {{was chosen}} by the party in 1914 as its nominee for Governor of Massachusetts, as a unifying force between the more {{progressive}} and conservative wings of the party. Running against the popular Democratic incumbent David I. Walsh on a progressive platform, McCall was narrowly defeated, with the <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> split due {{to the presence of}} a Progressive Party candidate on the ballot. McCall was nominated again in 1915, with the Republicans deliberately courting the Progressive vote by calling for a state constitutional convention. In a rematch with Walsh, he was this time victorious. He served three consecutive terms, with future President Calvin Coolidge as his lieutenant governor. In each election, Coolidge won more votes than McCall did, and the Boston Transcript credited at least one of his victories to Coolidge's drawing power.|$|E
25|$|He won the Republican {{primary and}} then the general election. Some Oregon {{newspapers}} considered him a contender for President of the Senate, {{but he was never}} a serious candidate for the position. He took his seat in the Oregon Senate on January 13, 1913 and served through the 1913 regular session, which ended on March 3. Since Oregon state senators serve a four-year term, Thompson did not have to run for re-election prior to the opening of the 1915 legislative session. However, once the November 1914 general election was over, he announced that he would actively seek the President of the Senate position. Just {{a few days after the}} election, Thompson had 11 of the 16 votes he needed to be elected Senate President. By mid-December, he had enough pledged votes to ensure his election. When the Oregon Senate elected its president in January 1915, Thompson was the only candidate nominated for the position. He received 25 out of 28 <b>Republican</b> <b>votes.</b> In addition, both Democratic senators voted for Thompson. Two Republicans voted for Senator W. D. Wood and Thompson joined them to honor Wood.|$|E
25|$|While Haughey had {{identified}} {{the problem with}} the economy, his actions made the problem worse. He increased public spending, which soon became out of control, and led to increases in borrowing and taxation at an unacceptable level. By 1981 Haughey was still reasonably popular and decided to call a general election. However, the timing of the election was thwarted twice by external events, in particular the hunger strikes of IRA volunteers for political status. The Anti H-Block Committee announced that they would field abstentionist candidates which many predicted correctly would take <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> away from Fianna Fáil. This coincinded with the Stardust Disaster, where a fire destroyed a night club in Haughey's constituency and claimed the lives of 48 young people; these caused Haughey to delay the Ard Fheis and the election. The poll was eventually held in June, much later than Haughey wanted. In the hope of winning an overall Dáil majority Haughey's campaign took a populist line with regard to taxation, spending and Northern Ireland. The campaign was enhanced and hyped up by a live debate on RTÉ between Haughey and the Fine Gael leader Garret FitzGerald over the major issues. On the day of the vote Fianna Fáil won 45.5%, failing to secure a majority in the 166-seat Dáil. A Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition came to power under FitzGerald and Haughey went into opposition.|$|E
50|$|On September 29, the Finance Committee {{rejected}} two {{amendments to}} add a public plan to Baucus' proposal. Senator Jay Rockefeller's amendment was rejected 15 to 8, with five Democrats (Baucus, Kent Conrad, Blanche Lincoln, Tom Carper, Bill Nelson) and all <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> no. Senator Chuck Schumer's amendment was defeated 13 to 10, with three Democrats (Baucus, Conrad, Lincoln) and all <b>Republicans</b> <b>voting</b> no.|$|R
25|$|On January 28, 2009, the House {{passed the}} bill by a 244–188 vote. All but 11 Democrats {{voted for the}} bill, and 177 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> against it (one <b>Republican</b> did not <b>vote).</b>|$|R
50|$|Gordon Allen Pross - Ran in the 2004 Republican Senate {{primary and}} {{received}} 1.59% of the <b>Republican</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{vote in the}} House was 144 to 44, with 35 not voting. The House {{vote was}} almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats {{supporting}} the bill and only 3 Republicans voting against it, some because they thought the amendment did {{not go far enough}} in its protections. The House of Representatives passed the amendment with 143 Republican and 1 Conservative <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> of [...] "Yea"; 39 Democrat, 3 Republican, 1 Independent Republican and 1 Conservative votes of [...] "Nay"; 26 Republican, 8 Democrat and 1 Independent Republican not voting. The final vote in the Senate was 39 to 13, with 14 not voting. The Senate passed the amendment with a vote of 39 <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> of [...] "Yea", 8 Democrat and 5 <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> of [...] "Nay"; 13 Republican and 1 Democrat not voting. Some Radical Republicans, such as Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, abstained from voting because the amendment did not prohibit literacy tests and poll taxes. Following congressional approval the proposed amendment was then sent by Secretary of State William Henry Seward to the states for ratification or rejection.|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower made {{defeating}} the amendment a high priority. However to secure enough <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> {{he had to}} abandon American support for the UN human rights initiative. [...] This episode {{proved to be the}} last hurrah for the isolationist Republicans, as the younger conservatives increasingly turned to an internationalism based on aggressive anti-communism, typified by Senator Barry Goldwater.|$|E
500|$|In late 1941, Willkie {{fought for}} {{the repeal of the}} Neutrality Act. In September, Lindbergh accused American Jews of [...] "agitating for war"; Willkie responded that the aviator's speech was [...] "the most un-American made in my time". Willkie lobbied Republican congressmen to repeal the act. The measure passed Congress with the aid of <b>Republican</b> <b>votes,</b> though most of that party voted against it. Roosevelt invited Willkie to {{dedicate}} Mount Rushmore, but because of other commitments, Willkie could not. Roosevelt also sought to have Willkie join his administration, which the Republican was reluctant to do, wishing to preserve independence of word and action.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "voter referees" [...] {{plan was}} part of a House {{amendment}} to the original bill to substitute Representative Robert Kastenmeier's [...] "enrollment officers" [...] plan. After several amendments, the House of Representatives approved the bill on March 24, 1960 by a vote of 311-109. 179 Democrats and 132 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> Aye. 93 Democrats, 15 Republicans, and 1 Independent Democrat voted Nay. 2 Democrats and 1 <b>Republican</b> <b>voted</b> present.|$|R
5000|$|Reagan's veto was {{overridden}} by Congress (by the Senate 78 to 21, the House by 313 to 83) on October 2. In the House vote, {{taken on}} September 29, 1986, 232 Democrats and 81 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> {{to override the}} President's veto while 4 Democrats and 79 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> to sustain the President's veto. [...] In the Senate vote, all 47 Democrats were joined by 31 Republicans to override the President's veto while 21 <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> to sustain the President's veto. This override {{marked the first time}} in the twentieth century that a president had a foreign policy veto overridden. [...] Apartheid opponents in America and South Africa applauded the vote, while critics argued that it would be either ineffectual or lead to more violence.|$|R
50|$|At the 1999 Australian {{republic}} referendum, many direct-election <b>republicans</b> <b>voted</b> NO and ensured {{the defeat}} of the bi-partisan appointment model.|$|R
500|$|In {{the general}} election, Breathitt {{challenged}} Republican Louie B. Nunn. Still stinging from his primary defeat, Happy Chandler endorsed Nunn, which hurt Breathitt with {{some members of}} his own party. During the campaign, Nunn attacked an executive order issued by Governor Combs that desegregated public accommodations in Kentucky as [...] "rule by executive decree". Appearing on television with a copy of the executive order, Nunn proclaimed that [...] "my first act will be to abolish this." [...] Nunn's proclamation won him the support of some conservative Democrats, but cost him <b>Republican</b> <b>votes,</b> especially in Louisville. The New Republic charged that Nunn ran [...] "the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky." [...] Breathitt won the election by a margin of just over 13,000 votes.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2012 presidential election, Wayne County cast 15,732 Democratic {{votes for}} Barack Obama and Joe Biden, 17,248 <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, 2,812 Conservative votes for Romney/Ryan, and 903 Working Families Party votes for Obama/Biden.

2500|$|As {{the results}} were coming in on Wednesday morning, it {{appeared}} that Chamberlain would win, but Hampton had taken a very narrow lead by Thursday. Hampton claimed victory with slightly more than an 1100-vote margin statewide. Chamberlain and the Republicans disputed the victory, based on widespread fraud and intimidation by Democrats. In Aiken County, where the Hamburg Massacre had occurred, <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> dropped to less than 100, but [...] "Democratic votes quadrupled." [...] The total vote in Edgefield exceeded the total voting age population by more than 2,000 and <b>Republican</b> <b>votes</b> were suppressed.

50|$|In Delaware, 27,412 of the 102, 455 {{registered}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>voted</b> in the election, {{resulting in}} a 26.76 percent turn-out rate.|$|R

Haynsworth was the first Supreme Court nominee to be defeated by the Senate since the rejection of Judge John J. Parker (also of the Fourth Circuit) in 1930. Nixon eventually nominated Harry Blackmun, who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|R
