40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Its primary focus is an impact of ASD {{diagnosis}} on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and secondary it also introduces {{the basic principles}} of intervention, which are broadly used in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with ASD. Literature review part of this thesis defines current approach of ASD. It also describes the impact of impairments in communication, social interaction and imagination on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with ASD. Important principles of intervention in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with this diagnosis, which are individualization, structuralization, visualization and motivation, are presented there as well. The second part of this thesis presents a proposal for qualitative research that aims to point out differences between how mothers and fathers accept the diagnosis, perceive the impact on family relationships and use the principles of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with ASD. Proposed research should provide hypotheses which would serve as a foundation for future research...|$|R

2500|$|Another possibility, favoured by Robert Schulmann of the Einstein Papers Project, is that [...] "Lieserl" [...] {{was adopted}} by Marić's close friend, Helene Savić, and was raised by her and lived under the name [...] "Zorka Savić" [...] until the 1990s. Savić did in fact <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> {{by the name of}} Zorka, who was blind from {{childhood}} and died in the 1990s.

2500|$|The {{theme of}} the book, at least as {{perceived}} from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States. [...] A well known instance of this occurred during the 1996 presidential election when, during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Republican Party nominee Bob Dole said: [...] "... with all due respect, I am here to tell you, {{it does not take}} a village to <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> It takes a family to raise a child." [...] Criticism of Clinton's notion would continue to be made by American conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Andrea Tantaros, and Jonah Goldberg through the next two decades.|$|E
2500|$|The Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) {{believes}} that mental disability {{is not a}} reason to deny sterilization. [...] The opinion of ACOG is that [...] "the physician must consult with the patient’s family, agents, and other caregivers" [...] if sterilization is desired for a mentally limited patient. [...] In 2003, Douglas Diekema wrote in Volume 9 of the journal Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews that [...] "involuntary sterilization ought not be performed on mentally retarded persons who retain the capacity for reproductive decision-making, the ability to <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> or the capacity to provide valid consent to marriage." [...] The Journal of Medical Ethics claimed, in a 1999 article, that doctors are regularly confronted with request to sterilize mentally limited people who cannot give consent for themselves. The article recommend that sterilization should only occur {{when there is a}} [...] "situation of necessity" [...] and the [...] "benefits of sterilization outweigh the drawbacks." [...] The American Journal of Bioethics published an article, in 2010, that concluded the interventions used in the Ashley treatment may benefit future patients. [...] These interventions, {{at the request of the}} parents and guidance from the physicians, included a hysterectomy and surgical removal of the breast buds of the mentally and physically disabled child.|$|E

2500|$|Journalist Robert Slatzer (who later {{claimed to}} have been {{secretly}} married to Marilyn Monroe) claimed that a few weeks before Vélez's death, he interviewed her at her home and she confided in him that she was pregnant with Gary Cooper's child (by that time, Cooper was married to socialite Veronica [...] "Rocky" [...] Balfe). [...] According to Slatzer, Vélez said that Cooper refused to acknowledge the child, believing that Harald Ramond was the father. After Vélez died, Slatzer said he asked Cooper about the situation and Cooper confirmed that it was possible he might have been the father. Slatzer further claimed that he also interviewed Clara Bow (who had also dated Cooper in the 1920s), who revealed that shortly before Vélez's death, Cooper called her and screamed {{that he was going to}} kill Harald Ramond for impregnating Vélez. Slazter claimed that Bow told him that she never believed Vélez's baby was fathered by Ramond, and that she was convinced that Vélez had attempted to get Ramond to marry her to protect Cooper's reputation. Biographer Michelle Vogel speculated that if Cooper was the father, his rejection of Vélez and their child coupled with the idea of having to <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> alone may have sent Vélez [...] "over the edge".|$|E
2500|$|When the {{families}} finally meet for the eventual “pamamanhikan” at the palatial Fuentebella residence, what starts as a civilized encounter between two families escalates into a hilarious rich-versus-poor mano-a-mano where Tracy's grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) insulted the Polotan's family, {{a scenario that}} turns the mansion into a madhouse of outlandish proportions which resulted in Rock and Tracy's separation. Rock got depressed and did not leave his room for three days. [...] He was confronted by his mother Rose, saying that life must go on. Rose thinks her son is still young for fatherhood, so she is {{not in favor of}} the marriage. Nick thinks the family would be in shame if Tracy will <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with no father, so he wants the wedding to push through as soon as possible. Elaine, who also got pregnant at a young age does not want her daughter to experience a forced marriage and get trapped in a loveless marriage as {{what had happened to her}} and her husband, Nick. Elaine suggested that it would be better if Tracey would just go to the USA and give birth there, but before Tracy's departure, Rock was able to sneak into Tracy's room, and they elope. The two then sent an MMS to their families stating that they got married in the City hall. The two parties become so depressed because of Rock and Tracey's decision. Elaine seems to be disappointed with Nick. She thinks that Nick is not a good father to Tracy so their daughter grew up to be imperfect person. She decides to leave, but on her way out of the estate, Nick stops her and professes his undying love, stating that it would be best if they will try to start again. On the other hand, Rose and Pol also renew their love. Meanwhile, Brent (Coleta), Rock's best friend who is a closeted gay and is secretly in love with Rock, professes his love when they were drunk but the two remain best friends. In the end, the two families are able to accept the fate of Rock and Tracy who become parents at 19. The movie ends with the cast singing [...] "Pag-Ibig", and [...] "I Do Bidoo Bidoo".|$|E
