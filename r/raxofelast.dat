40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>raxofelast,</b> a lipid peroxidation inhibitor, in an experimental model of burn wounds. C 57 BL/ 6 male mice of 25 - 30 g were immersed in 80 degrees C water for 10 seconds to achieve a partial-thickness scald burn. Animals received intraperitoneally either <b>raxofelast</b> (20 mg/kg/day for 14 days in 100 mu L) or its vehicle alone (100 mu L/day for 14 days). On day 14, burn areas were used for measuring conjugated dienes, reduced glutathione levels, histological damage, neoangiogenesis by immunohistochemistry and expression (Western blot) of the specific endothelial marker CD 31 as well as quantification of microvessel density, VEGF wound content, endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and NOS) expression and wound nitrite content. <b>Raxofelast</b> decreased tissue conjugated dienes (vehicle 6. 1 +/- 1. 4 Delta ABS/mg protein; <b>raxofelast</b> 3. 7 +/- 0. 8 AABS/mg protein), prevented tissue glutathione consumption (vehicle 3. 2 +/- 0. 9 mu mol/g protein; <b>raxofelast</b> 6. 7 +/- 1. 8 mu mol/g protein), increased epithelial proliferation, extracellular matrix maturation, and augmented neoangiogenesis {{as suggested by the}} marked increase in microvessel density and by the robust expression of the specific endothelial marker CD 31 (vehicle 9. 4 +/- 1. 1 integrated intensity; <b>raxofelast</b> 14. 8 +/- 1. 8 integrated intensity). Furthermore, <b>raxofelast</b> enhanced VEGF wound content (vehicle 1. 4 +/- 0. 4 pg/mg protein; <b>raxofelast</b> 2. 4 +/- 0. 6 pg/mg protein), caused a marked expression of eNOS (vehicle 16. 1 +/- 3 integrated intensity; <b>raxofelast</b> 26. 2 +/- 4 integrated intensity) and NOS (vehicle 9. 1 +/- 1. 8 integrated intensity; <b>raxofelast</b> 16. 2 +/- 3. 5 integrated intensity) and increased wound nitrite content. Lipid peroxidation inhibition by <b>raxofelast</b> may be an effective therapeutic approach to improve clinical outcomes after thermal injury...|$|E
40|$|Peroxynitrite is {{a strong}} oxidant that results from {{reaction}} between NO and superoxide. It has been recently proposed that peroxynitrite plays a pathogenetic role in inflammatory processes. Here we have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of <b>raxofelast,</b> a new hydrophilic vitamin E-like antioxidant agent, in rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. In vivo treatment with <b>raxofelast</b> (5, 10, 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 intraperitoneally 5 [*]min before carrageenan) prevented in a dose dependent manner carrageenan-induced pleural exudation and polymorphonuclear migration in rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. Lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as histological organ injury were significantly reduced by <b>raxofelast.</b> Immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine, a footprint of peroxynitrite, revealed a positive staining in lungs from carrageenan-treated rats. No positive nitrotyrosine staining {{was found in the}} lungs of the carrageenan-treated rats, which received <b>raxofelast</b> (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) treatment. Furthermore, in vivo <b>raxofelast</b> (5, 10, 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) treatment significantly reduced peroxynitrite formation as measured by the oxidation of the fluorescent dihydrorhodamine 123, prevented the appearance of DNA damage, the decrease in mitochondrial respiration and partially restored the cellular level of NAD+ in ex vivo macrophages harvested from the pleural cavity of rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that <b>raxofelast,</b> a new hydrophilic vitamin E-like antioxidant agent, exerts multiple protective effects in carrageenan-induced acute inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Increased lipid peroxidation, {{enhanced}} nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) activation and augmented tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production {{have been}} implicated in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. We investigated whether lipid peroxidation inhibition might reduce NF-kappaB activation and the inflammatory response in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 230 - 250 g body weight received administration of cerulein (80 mug/kg s. c. for each of four injections at hourly intervals). A control group received four s. c. injections of 0. 9 % saline at hourly intervals. Animals were randomized to receive either <b>raxofelast,</b> an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation (20 mg/kg i. p. administered with the first cerulein injection) or its vehicle (1 ml/kg of a 10 % DMSO/NaCl solution). All these rats were sacrificed 2 h after the last injection of either cerulein or its vehicle. <b>Raxofelast</b> administration (20 mg/kg i. p. with the first cerulein) significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, an index of lipid peroxidation (CER+DMSO= 3. 075 +/- 0. 54 mumol/g; CER+raxofelast= 0. 693 +/- 0. 18 mumol/g; p < 0. 001), decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (CER+DMSO= 22. 2 +/- 3. 54 mU/g; CER+raxofelast= 9. 07 +/- 2. 05 mU/g; p < 0. 01), increased glutathione levels (GSH) (CER+DMSO= 5. 21 +/- 1. 79 mumol/g; CER+raxofelast= 15. 71 +/- 2. 14 mumol/g; p < 0. 001), and reduced acinar cell damage evaluated by means of histology and serum levels of both amylase (CER+DMSO= 4063 +/- 707. 9 U/l; CER+raxofelast= 1198 +/- 214. 4 U/l; p < 0. 001), and lipase (CER+DMSO= 1654 +/- 330 U/l; CER+raxofelast= 386 +/- 118. 2 U/l; p < 0. 001), Furthermore, <b>raxofelast</b> reduced pancreatic NF-κB activation and the TNF-α mRNA levels and tissue content of mature protein in the pancreas. Indeed, lipid peroxidation inhibition might be considered a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the severe damage in acute pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|Impaired {{wound healing}} is a {{well-documented}} phenom-enon in experimental and clinical diabetes. Experimen-tal {{evidence suggests that}} a defect in vascular endo-thelial growth factor (VEGF) regulation might be asso-ciated with wound-healing disorders. We studied the involvement of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of altered VEGF expression in diabetes-related healing deficit by using an incisional skin-wound model pro-duced {{on the back of}} female diabetic C 57 BL/KsJ db 1 / db 1 mice and their normal (db 1 / 1 m) littermates. Ani-mals were then randomized to the following treatment: <b>raxofelast</b> (15 mg z kg– 1 z day– 1 i. p.), an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, or its vehicle (DMSO/NaCl 0. 9 %, 1 : 1 vol: vol). The animals were killed on different days (3, 6, and 12 days after skin injury), and the wounded skin tissue...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidative}} {{modification of}} low density lipoprotein (LDL) {{is thought to}} be an important factor in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Antioxidants have been shown to protect LDL from oxidation and to inhibit atherosclerosis development in animals. Potent synthetic antioxidants are currently being tested, but they are not necessarily safe for human use. We here characterize the antioxidant activity of IRFI 005, the active metabolite of <b>Raxofelast</b> (IRFI 0016) that is a novel synthetic analog of vitamin E under clinical development, and demonstrate that it prevents oxidative modification of LDL. IFI 005 inhibited the oxidative modification of LDL, measured through the generation of MDA, electrophoretic mobility and apo B 100 fluorescence. During the oxidation process IRFI 005 was consumed with the formation of the benzoquinone oxidation product. The powerful antioxidant activity of IRFI 005 is at least in part mediated by a chain breaking mechanism as it is an efficient peroxyl radical scavenger with a rate constant k((IRFI 005 + LOO degrees)) of 1. 8 x 10 (6) M(- 1) s(- 1). 4. IRFI 005 substantially preserved LDL-associated antioxidants, alpha-tocopherol and carotenoids, and when co-incubated with physiologic levels of ascorbate provoked a synergistic inhibition of LDL oxidation. Also the co-incubation of IRFI 005 with Trolox caused a synergistic effect, and a lag phase {{in the formation of the}} trolox-benzoquinone oxidation product. A synergistic inhibition of lipid peroxidation was also demonstrated by co-incubating IRFI 005 and alpha-tocopherol incorporated in linoleic acid micelles. These data strongly suggest that IRFI 005 can operate by a recycling mechanism similar to the vitamin E/ascorbate system. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E
