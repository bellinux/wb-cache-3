5|$|The {{key players}} {{that formed the}} first eleven of 1953–54 were: Ray King (goalkeeper); Reg Potts and Stan Turner (full-backs); Tommy Cheadle, Albert Leake, Roy Sproson (half-backs); Colin Askey, John Cunliffe, Ken Griffiths, Basil Hayward, and Albert Mullard (forwards); Derek Tomkinson (reserve forward). Their {{achievements}} came as a team, without any outstanding stars, which caused The Sentinel to <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> the whole team were stars.|$|E

Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town so upset. When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity {{is the most important thing}} in the world, as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth. Ethnically identifying {{as a member of the}} indigenous Aymara people, in keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.|$|E

A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing.

Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of timber continued onto the mainland, prompting one observer to <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> no usable trees were left standing between {{the mouths of}} the Waccasassa and Suwannee rivers. In Williston, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 people lost their lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000.|$|E
5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only found at the {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E

5|$|For {{his great}} {{services}} at Hohenfriedberg, Frederick {{gave him the}} captaincy of Tatiau, which carried with it a salary of 500 thalers a year. Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in {{time to take a}} decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any way that he thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the next great war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le Mérite.|$|E
5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a throwback to the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, {{largely due to}} the mainstream success of hip-hop artists such as Kanye West. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation in the first week alone. Industry observers <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> West's victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip-hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists.|$|E

5|$|While {{the swift}} {{transfer}} of power following Domitian's death had prevented a civil war from erupting, Nerva's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable, and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority. Upon his accession, he had ordered a halt to treason trials, {{but at the same}} time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue. This measure led to , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies, leading the consul Fronto to famously <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> Domitian's tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva's anarchy. Early in 97, a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed, but once again Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death, much to the disapproval of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E
