40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discovery in the world of marketing and communications in recent decades, is the importance of the subjective experience that a consumer has with a brand, product, service or organization. What has become clear in recent years is that the connection a consumer has with a service provider (and vice versa), is not only a connection from the conscious mind. Also factors that consumers perceive unconsciously, can {{have a major impact on}} the feeling that a consumer has about a brand, a product or an organization. And what is also clear now is that reason and emotion are not always parallel. Early 90 s Fiske (1991) introduced his <b>Relational</b> <b>Models</b> Theory. This theory assumes that people primarily use four elementary models to establish and evaluate relationships. By now there are strong indications that the <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> used by a customer are an important factor in the customer experience (eg Aggarwal, 2004; Battacharya & Sen, 2003; McGraw & Tetlock, 2005; Kaltcheva & Parasuraman, 2009). While it is broadly accepted that these models are of fundamental importance, there is little research on the impact of these models on customer experience and customer behavior. The thesis Mastering Meaningful Customer Connections describes the results of a research project that was conducted from 2010 - 2013 among customers of six Dutch service providers in banking, insurance, utilities and social welfare. The purpose of the research project was to discover what the customer experience of these organisations was, what role <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> played in customer experience and whether it was possible to influence these <b>relational</b> <b>models.</b> The research project showed that <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> have an important influence on <b>relational</b> <b>models.</b> The research project has provided answers to the following questions: - Which <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> are used by customers and what is the influence of these models on customer experience? - What is the influence of digitisation in customer communication on <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> and customer experience? - What is the influence of personalisation in customer communication on <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> and customer experience? And finally, - Is it possible to influence <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> (and customer experience) by using specific words and images that are associated with <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> (<b>relational</b> framing) ...|$|R

40|$|Statistical <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> combine {{aspects of}} first-order logic and {{probabilistic}} graphical models, {{enabling them to}} model complex logical and probabilistic interactions between large numbers of objects. This level of expressivity comes {{at the cost of}} increased complexity of inference, motivating a new line of research in lifted probabilistic inference. By exploiting symmetries of the relational structure in the model, and reasoning about groups of objects as a whole, lifted algorithms dramatically improve the run time of inference and learning. The thesis has five main contributions. First, we propose a new method for logical inference, calledfirst-order knowledge compilation. We show that by compiling <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> into a new circuit language, hard inference problems become tractable to solve. Furthermore, we present an algorithm that compiles <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> into our circuit language. Second, we show how to use first-order knowledge compilation for statistical <b>relational</b> <b>models,</b> leading to a new state-of-the-art lifted probabilistic inference algorithm. Third, we develop a formal framework for exact lifted inference, including a definition in terms of its complexity w. r. t. the number of objects in the world. From this follows a first completeness result, showing that the two-variable class of statistical <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> always supports lifted inference. Fourth, we present an algorithm for approximate lifted inference by performing exact lifted inference in a relaxed, approximate <b>model.</b> Statistical <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> are receiving a lot of attention today because of their expressive power for learning. Fifth, we propose to harness the full power of relational representations for that task, by using lifted parameter learning. The techniques presented in this thesis are evaluated empirically on statistical <b>relational</b> <b>models</b> of thousands of interacting objects and millions of random variables. nrpages: xx + 264 status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|E. F. Codd {{mentioned}} nulls as {{a method}} of representing missing data in the <b>relational</b> <b>model</b> in a 1975 paper in the FDT Bulletin of ACM-SIGMOD. Codd's paper that is most commonly cited in relation with the semantics of Null (as adopted in SQL) is his 1979 paper in the ACM Transactions on Database Systems, in which he also introduced his Relational Model/Tasmania, although much of the other proposals from the latter paper have remained obscure. Section 2.3 of his 1979 paper details the semantics of Null propagation in arithmetic operations as well as comparisons employing a ternary (three-valued) logic when comparing to nulls; it also details the treatment of Nulls on other set operations (the latter issue still controversial today). In database theory circles, the original proposal of Codd (1975, 1979) is now referred to as [...] "Codd tables". Codd later reinforced his requirement that all RDBMSs support Null to indicate missing data in a 1985 two-part article published in ComputerWorld magazine.|$|E
500|$|The ISO SQL {{implementation}} of Null {{is the subject}} of criticism, debate and calls for change. [...] In The <b>Relational</b> <b>Model</b> for Database Management: Version 2, Codd suggested that the SQL {{implementation of}} Null was flawed and should be replaced by two distinct Null-type markers. [...] The markers he proposed were to stand for [...] "Missing but Applicable" [...] and [...] "Missing but Inapplicable", known as A-values and I-values, respectively. [...] Codd's recommendation, if accepted, would have required the implementation of a four-valued logic in SQL. [...] Others have suggested adding additional Null-type markers to Codd's recommendation to indicate even more reasons that a data value might be [...] "Missing", increasing the complexity of SQL's logic system. [...] At various times, proposals have also been put forth to implement multiple user-defined Null markers in SQL. [...] Because of the complexity of the Null-handling and logic systems required to support multiple Null markers, none of these proposals have gained widespread acceptance.|$|E
