5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or <b>reverse</b> <b>bucket</b> bong) {{is another}} method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
50|$|A pump-jet {{works by}} having an intake (usually {{at the bottom}} of the hull) that allows water to pass {{underneath}} the vessel into the engines. Water enters the pump through this inlet. The pump can be of a centrifugal design for high speeds, or an axial flow pump for low to medium speeds. The water pressure inside the inlet is increased by the pump and forced backwards through a nozzle. With the use of a <b>reversing</b> <b>bucket,</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust can also be achieved for faring backwards, quickly and without the need to change gear or adjust engine thrust. The <b>reversing</b> <b>bucket</b> can also be used to help slow the ship down when braking. This feature is the main reason pump jets are so maneuverable.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had suffered}} a hydraulic failure while en route, and preparation was made for what {{was expected to be}} a routine landing, after the crew followed the checklist for hydraulic failure. The plane touched down normally, but when the engines' thrust levers were moved to the engines' reverse position, the <b>reverser</b> <b>buckets</b> for the engines on the left failed to deploy correctly. The buckets must be closed, to direct the engine thrust to a forward direction.|$|R
50|$|The target thrust {{reverser}} uses {{a pair of}} hydraulically-operated 'bucket' type doors to reverse the hot gas stream. For forward thrust, these doors form the propelling nozzle of the engine. In the original implementation of this system on the Boeing 707, and still common today, two <b>reverser</b> <b>buckets</b> were hinged so when deployed they block the rearward flow of the exhaust and redirect it with a forward component. This type of reverser is visible {{at the rear of}} the engine during deployment.|$|R
50|$|The nozzle also {{provides}} the steering of the pump-jets. Plates, similar to rudders, can {{be attached to}} the nozzle in order to redirect the water flow port and starboard. In a way, this is similar to the principles of air thrust vectoring, a technique which has long been used in launch vehicles (rockets and missiles) then later in military jet-powered aircraft. This provides pumpjet-powered ships with superior agility at sea. Another advantage is that when faring backwards by using the <b>reversing</b> <b>bucket,</b> steering is not inverted, as opposed to propeller-powered ships.|$|R
2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In emergency descents it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the <b>reverser</b> <b>buckets.</b> At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce hydroplaning and give [...] very short landing runs on wet or slippery runways while preserving wheel brake efficiency and keeping wheel brake temperatures low. Brakes were fitted with the Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid system.|$|R
5000|$|... “On {{entering}} I beheld a full-robed clergyman officiating {{at one end}} of a billiard-table, {{which served}} for his reading desk, whilst a large and attentive crowd sat around the other end, some on rude benches which were fixed along the walls, others perched upon gin cases, <b>buckets</b> <b>reversed,</b> or any other make-shift that came to hand. The congregation behaved with suitable decorum, but I confess it was not easy to keep the mind from wandering to the incongruity of the surroundings[...].When the parson was praying or the people singing, it was not particularly edifying to be interrupted by the lively chaff and occasional bursts of blasphemy, which we could plainly hear through the canvas party-walls, which separated us from the adjoining bar and its half tipsy occupants.” ...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of babies are born with {{perinatal}} risk factors that may impair later development. These children are often assessed at 2 years to help predict outcome and direct support services. Executive function is an important predictor of academic achievement and behavior, but there are limited assessments of executive function in 2 -year-olds and few have been tested in at-risk populations. Therefore, we developed a battery of four age-appropriate tasks to assess executive function in 2 -year-olds. At 24 months' corrected age 368 children completed tasks assessing attention, inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility. Scores on different tasks were weakly correlated, suggesting that they measured separate aspects of executive function, with combined scores for this cohort approximating a normal distribution. Significantly more boys (67 %) than girls (57 %) were unable to inhibit their behavior on the Snack Delay Task and girls (M = 3. 24, SD = 2. 4) had higher mean scores than boys (M = 2. 7, SD = 2. 7) on the Ducks and <b>Buckets</b> <b>Reverse</b> Categorization Task of working memory. Performance was significantly affected by family socioeconomic status. Mean scores were lower on all four individual tasks and on the global score of overall performance in children from a low household income ($ 70, 001). Maternal education was only associated with scores on the working memory task and the global score; and a measure of neighborhood deprivation was only associated with scores on the two inhibitory tasks and the global score. Our findings confirm the feasibility of assessing executive function in 2 -year-olds, {{and its ability to}} discriminate effects of socioeconomic status, a common confounder in child development research. Further development and standardization of this test battery comparing at-risk children with a normative population would provide a much-needed measure of executive function in early childhood...|$|R
