30|$|The term ‘tramp {{shipping}} optimisation’ {{refers to}} the use of OR to maximise the revenue or minimise the cost of a tramp shipping problem, subject to the limited shipping resources. One such tramp shipping problem exists when there are some ships and some cargoes and it is required to find out the cargo mix assigned to each ship voyage which maximises total gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity and cargo time window (lay can). Name this problem area ‘optimisation of ship voyage’. To give more details on this area, consider the following facts. Unlike ‘optimisation in liner shipping’, both ports of call and port calling sequence are here assumed optional. Charter party, signed by the ship owner and the charterer, usually specifies terms and clauses to be followed by both parties. Non-demise voyage charter parties are assumed here. Terms generally include the following items: calling ports, calling sequence, cargo freight, cargo time window (lay can), allowable cargo handling time (lay days), dispatch count if actual days are less than lay days, and demurrage count if more. Loading and discharging lay days may be considered in reversible or irreversible manner. If <b>reversible,</b> <b>lay</b> <b>days</b> are specified for loading and discharging collectively. If irreversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging separately. The gross terms of voyage charter party are here assumed unless otherwise specified. Before cargoes are being fixed by the ship owner, ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ helps in proposing a voyage plan suggesting an optimal cargo mix for each ship. This mix maximises the sum of voyage gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity, cargo lay can, and other voyage charter party terms. In the cargo mix selection, the random nature of sea transport demand has to be considered.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, Sir Humphrey Gilbert {{became the}} test vessel for the Coast Guard's <b>lay</b> <b>day</b> crewing system. Under the <b>lay</b> <b>day</b> system, each ship has two crews which rotate on a 28-day interval. While {{on board the}} ship, the crew perform 12-hour work shifts, seven days a week. At {{the end of the}} 28-day interval, the crew rotates off the ship for a four-week break. The trials proved a success and the system was adopted fleet-wide.|$|R
50|$|Demurrage is a {{fixed sum}} per day or per hour that the {{charterer}} agrees {{to pay for}} any time that the vessel is detained for loading or discharging over the time contractually allowed—usually described as <b>lay</b> <b>days.</b> Sometimes {{the number of days}} the vessel may be kept on demurrage at the agreed rate is fixed by the charter-party. If no demurrage is provided for by the charter-party, and the vessel is not loading or discharging beyond the <b>lay</b> <b>days,</b> the shipowner can claim damages for the loss suffered by the detention of the ship.|$|R

5000|$|The Figawi {{originated}} in 1972 as an informal race between friends Bob Luby, Joe Horan, and Bob Horan that quickly organized into an annual event. [...] The 1978 {{addition of a}} <b>lay</b> <b>day</b> and race back to Hyannis turned the race into a three-day event.

50|$|The rate of {{demurrage}} (if any) {{is generally}} accepted as {{the measure of the}} damages for detention, but is not necessarily the true measure. When the claim is for detention and not demurrage the actual loss is recoverable, which may be more or may be less than the agreed {{rate of demurrage}}. The contract usually doesn't count Sundays and holidays as lay days—but unless expressly stipulated, this exception does not apply after the <b>lay</b> <b>days</b> have expired.|$|R

50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as <b>lay</b> <b>days,</b> for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the <b>lay</b> <b>days.</b> There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|R

40|$|Octopus digueti Perrier and Rochebrune, 1894 was reared {{through its}} life cycle at 25 °C {{in a closed}} {{seawater}} system using artificial sea water. Two field-collected females produced 231 hatchlings: 193 hatchlings were groupcultured while 24 were isolated at hatching and grown individually to allow precise analyses of growth in length and weight over the life cycle. All octopuses were fed primarily live shrimps. Maturing adults fed {{at a rate of}} 4. 7 % of body weight per day and had a gross growth efficiency of 48 %. Growth in weight was exponential for the first 72 days and described best by the equation: WW(g) =. 0405 e• 0646 t. The mean growth rate over this period was 6. 4 % increase in body weight per day (%/d), with no significant difference between male and female growth. From 72 to 143 days, growth was logarithmic and described best by the equation: WW(g) = (6. 78 x 1 O- 6) t 3. 13. Females grew slightly faster than males over this growth phase. During the exponential growth phase, mantle length increased at a mean rate of 2. 1 % per day, declining to 1. 1 % per day over the logarithmic phase. No attempt was made to describe mathematically the period of declining growth rate beyond day 143. The primary causes of early mortality in group culture were escapes and cannibalism. Survival was good despite high culture density: 73 % survival to date of first egg <b>laying</b> (<b>day</b> 111). Survival was better among the isolated growth-study octopuses: 88 % to the date of first egg <b>laying</b> (<b>day</b> 130). Mean life span was 199 days in group-reared octopuses and 221 days in the growth-study octopuses. There {{was no significant difference between}} male and female life span. Progeny of the group culture were reared at similar stocking densities and fed predominantly fresh dead shrimp and crab meat. This diet resulted in cannibalism, with only 6 % survival to first egg <b>laying</b> on <b>day</b> 128. Fecundity in this group was lower. Octopus digueti is a good candidate for laboratory culture and biological experimentation because of its small size, rapid growth, short life span, and good survival in group culture...|$|R

The hen <b>day</b> <b>lay</b> of Haco black by year interaction were low varied significantly (P 1,L 2, and L 3, {{were significantly lower}} than that at 49 - 56 weeks. The mean hen <b>day</b> <b>lay</b> due to effects ofinteraction of Shavers brown at 56 - 60 and 69 - 73 weeks by pen L 1, L 2, and L 3, were significantly higherthan that at 49 - 56 weeks.

Also, the Americans gave their best crew members a holiday and sailed against the Chinese with a less experienced crew. The following day several of the China Team members arrived at the compound with bald heads. Reportedly they bet one another that if they beat the Americans, they would shave their heads.|$|R

The Ava court believed that Htaw Lay was also involved in the rebellion. But according to Htaw Lay family tradition, Htaw Lay was not involved in the rebellion; he and his family fled to British territory only because they feared the indiscriminate wrath of the king's forces. At any rate, Htaw Lay and his extended family, along with about 2,000 other refugees, fled Lower Burma and settled at Moulmein (Mawlamyaing) on the Tenasserim coast (modern Mon State, south of the Salween and Taninthayi Region) that Ava had just ceded a year earlier.|$|R
