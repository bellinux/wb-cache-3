I wanted to run out through the long pasture grass, wetting my legs with the dew of it, and to climb the rail fence, and keep on through the timber and up and up over the divide so as to get a look around. Oh, I had all kinds of hankerings--to follow up the canyon beds and slosh around from pool to pool, making friends with the water-dogs and the speckly trout; to peep on the sly and watch the squirrels and rabbits and small furry things and see what they was doing and learn the secrets of their ways. Seemed to me, if I had time, I could crawl among the flowers, and, if I was good and quiet, catch them whispering with themselves, telling all kinds of wise things that mere humans never know.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{horror of}} World War II {{affected}} her health and emotional stability; in her fifties, she became ill, despite an adherence to health food.

In 1977, she moved to Cincinnati, {{under the care of}} her nephew Malcolm Dubin, and died in 1981. It was a sad ending for an exceptional life, but, as Pamfiloff writes, [...] "Obviously, the legacy of her dream has filtered on down through the decades. It was a man's world. Designers were men. The owners of companies were men. The staff was men. The salesmen were men. It was all men.

40|$|Fairness demands {{confession}} {{of a certain}} chronology in my preparing this review. I read the work under discussion and then, before writing about it, began reading The Use and Abuse of Australian History (2000) by Graeme Davison. Lies Across America suffers by comparison to the masterly Australian work. My yellow-pad notes document, however, that before reading Davison I had already recorded my disappointments with James W. Loewen 2 ÃÜ 7 s work. To give it its due, the book is entertaining and thought-provoking. Where Loewen finds fault, there generally is fault, and the accumulation of such faults in perceptible patterns gives pause. It is appropriate for self-conscious historians to critique the monumental history affixed to the American landscape. The author 2 ÃÜ 7 s critique fails, though, in three ways. First, it chooses easy targets and peppers them redundantly, like a waterfowler who not only shoots sitting ducks but also exceeds the bag limit. How many times {{do we need to}} hear about the mythic excesses of the Daughters of Confederate Veterans? Second, the work offers no perceptive explanations of how perverse versions of history made their way into our historic sites. Calling them 2 ÃÜ 2 lies 2 ÃÜ 2 is cheap. Third, the author sets unrealistic expectations and then violates them himself. He demands a history that is impartial and timeless. Usually, however, after smashing the mythology of a monument, he goes on to insist on substituting his own preferred mythology. Come home to the Plains for an example: Loewen excoriates the Nebraska State Historical Society for not pronouncing Willa Cather a lesbian <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on Highway 281. Nebraskans instead emphasize her love of the Great Plains landscape and her compelling female characters. To demand that the mythic Cather serve the narrative needs of urban gays instead of the filiopietism of rural Nebraskans is rank colonialism. Elsewhere on the Plains Loewen treats the naming of Devil 2 ÃÜ 7 s Lake without finding any historic site to focus on there, takes the usual easy shot at the Confederate Room of the Oklahoma Historical Society, and takes on two obscure and thoughtlessly bigoted historical markers in Gardner, Kansas, and Brookings, South Dakota. The Great Plains section of the book is dull. This in a land that contains the Pike Pawnee Village obelisk, the Wrong-Side Up monument, and of course the infamous Sand Creek battle-or-massacre marker. Lies Across America is a book for the 1980 s, a monument itself to American disillusionment. In the twenty-first century it rings tinny...|$|E
