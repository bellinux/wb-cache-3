Their magnetic properties were studied by VSM, investigating the evolution of these properties with firing and measurement temperature, {{and in particular the}} effects of fibre alignment. It has been predicted that aligned ferrite fibres will demonstrate an enhanced magnetisation along the axis of alignment with respect to perpendicular to the axis, and this has been demonstrated here For the first time. The optimum firing temperature was 1000 degrees C, at which point they still had submicron grains. In BaM <b>random</b> <b>fibres</b> M-s= 63. 8 emu g(- 1) and H-c= 428. 1 kA m(- 1) and in SrM <b>random</b> <b>fibres</b> M-s= 63. 3 emu g(- 1) and H-c= 452. 8 kA m(- 1), high values for polycrystalline materials. Fibres aligned parallel to the applied field had saturation magnetisation (M-s) values equal to those of the <b>random</b> <b>fibres,</b> whilst fibres aligned perpendicular to the field had All, values 62 % and 75 % lower, for BaM and SrM, respectively. There was no change in coercivity (H-c) between random or aligned fibres of any orientation, and fibres aligned 45 degrees and parallel to H appeared identical. Therefore, properties along the axis of alignment were superior when compared to measurements perpendicular to the axis of alignment, giving a directionality to the magnetisation in an otherwise randomly oriented ferrite material.

40|$|Injuries to {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) have {{traumatic}} consequences such as irreparable disability due to the inability of the CNS to regenerate injured nerve fibres. The aim of the work presented here was to develop a scaffold which potentially provides guidance to axons in the injured spinal cord thus facilitating signal transduction. A poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA, PLA:PGA ratio of 75 : 25) flat sheet membrane scaffold was created using phase inversion with N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) as the solvent and water as the non-solvent for immersion precipitation. PLGA flat sheet membranes were exposed to surface treatments including aminolysis, peptide immobilisation and ozonation in order to achieve higher cell attachment of PC 12 cells, a cell line which was cloned from a solid pheochromocytoma tumour of white rats, and used as a tool for measurement of regeneration. Cell attachment studies revealed no significant difference in cell attachment between modified and not-modified PLGA flat sheet membranes. However, the absence of foetal calf serum (FCS) resulted in fivefold higher cell attachment compared to medium supplemented with 10 % FCS. A second scaffold was produced by electrospinning 10 % (w/w) PLGA in a chloroform:methanol (CHCl 3 :MeOH) mixture in ratio of 3 : 1 resulting in a nanofibrous scaffold. Optimum settings for electrospinning were found to be 3 ml/h feeding rate, 15 kV applied voltage and 11 cm collector-to-needle distance. Random and aligned PLGA nanofibres were produced, with a fibre diameter of 530 ± 140 nm. PC 12 cells attached and differentiated to the nanofibrous scaffold. When exposed to NGF these cells stopped dividing and extended neurites. On <b>random</b> <b>fibres,</b> neurite orientation was random, whereas on aligned fibres 63 % of neurites grew with the fibre orientation ± 15 ��ᵒ. After 7 days of exposure to NGF, cells had 1 - 4 neurites on <b>random</b> <b>fibres,</b> reaching a maximum length of 188 μm, whereas on aligned fibres, cells had 1 - 2 neurites, reaching a maximum length of 400 μm. PLGA nanofibres were also investigated as a delivery vehicle for bioactive molecules. For this, poly-L-lysine (PLL) was incorporated into electrospun PLGA nanofibres via emulsion electrospinning. PLGA-PLL nanofibres were significantly larger than PLGA nanofibres having a diameter of 830 ± 190 nm. In order to visualise the incorporation of PLL, FITC-PLL was electrospun und the resulting nanofibres fluoresced greed. Attachment of PC 12 s to PLGA-PLL nanofibres was not significantly different compared to PLGA nanofibres. Aligned PLGA-PLL nanofibres were shown to promote neurite outgrowth of PC 12 s with resulting neurites of up to twice the length compared to aligned PLGA nanofibres. The results suggest that PLGA nanofibres strongly influences neurite organisation, which is potentially useful for future therapeutic approaches. The work in this thesis has shown that electrospun PLGA nanofibre mats have the potential to be used as scaffolds for spinal cord repair addressing topographical guidance and delivery of bioactive molecules to the site of injury...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} random lasers {{exploiting}} multiple scattering of photons in an amplifying disordered medium {{in order to}} generate coherent light without a traditional laser resonator has attracted {{a great deal of}} attention in recent years. This research area lies at the interface of the fundamental theory of disordered systems and laser science. The idea was originally proposed in the context of astrophysics in the 1960 s by V. S. Letokhov, who studied scattering with "negative absorption" of the interstellar molecular clouds. Research on random lasers has since developed into a mature experimental and theoretical field. A simple design of such lasers would be promising for potential applications. However, in traditional random lasers the properties of the output radiation are typically characterized by complex features in the spatial, spectral and time domains, making them less attractive than standard laser systems in terms of practical applications. Recently, an interesting and novel type of one-dimensional random laser that operates in a conventional telecommunication fibre without any pre-designed resonator mirrors-random distributed feedback fibre laser-was demonstrated. The positive feedback required for laser generation in <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers is provided by the Rayleigh scattering from the inhomogeneities of the refractive index that are naturally present in silica glass. In the proposed laser concept, the randomly backscattered light is amplified through the Raman effect, providing distributed gain over distances up to 100 km. Although an effective reflection due to the Rayleigh scattering is extremely small (~ 0. 1 %), the lasing threshold may be exceeded when a sufficiently large distributed Raman gain is provided. Such a <b>random</b> distributed feedback <b>fibre</b> laser has a number of interesting and attractive features. The fibre waveguide geometry provides transverse confinement, and effectively one-dimensional random distributed feedback leads to the generation of a stationary near-Gaussian beam with a narrow spectrum. A <b>random</b> distributed feedback <b>fibre</b> laser has efficiency and performance that are comparable to and even exceed those of similar conventional fibre lasers. The key features of the generated radiation of <b>random</b> distributed feedback <b>fibre</b> lasers include: a stationary narrow-band continuous modeless spectrum that is free of mode competition, nonlinear power broadening, and an output beam with a Gaussian profile in the fundamental transverse mode (generated both in single mode and multi-mode fibres). This review presents the current status of research in the field of <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers and shows their potential and perspectives. We start with an introductory overview of conventional distributed feedback lasers and traditional random lasers to set the stage for discussion of <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers. We then present a theoretical analysis and experimental studies of various <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> laser configurations, including widely tunable, multi-wavelength, narrow-band generation, and <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers operating in different spectral bands in the 1 - 1. 6 μm range. Then we discuss existing and future applications of <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers, including telecommunication and distributed long reach sensor systems. A theoretical description of random lasers is very challenging and is strongly linked with the theory of disordered systems and kinetic theory. We outline two key models governing the generation of <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers: the average power balance model and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation based model. Recently invented <b>random</b> distributed feedback <b>fibre</b> lasers represent a new and exciting field of research that brings together such diverse areas of science as laser physics, the theory of disordered systems, fibre optics and nonlinear science. Stable random generation in optical fibre opens up new possibilities for research on wave transport and localization in disordered media.

It {{is a special}} class of high performance fibre reinforced cementitious composite (HPFRCC) that has higher deflection capacity than that of regular fibre reinforced concrete (FRC). Current DFRCCs are limited to cement-rich matrix system. This paper reports the development of geopolymer-based DFRCC where the cement binder in DFRCC is replaced by fly ash-based geopolymer binder and alkaline liquids (sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate) are used to activate the fly ash. In this study, three types of fibres are considered namely steel and two types of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres having different diameter, length and elastic modulus. The fibres used {{in the development of}} both cement-based and geopolymer-based DFRCCs are limited to single fibre type. The effects of two different sand sizes (1. 18 mm and 0. 6 mm) and sand/binder ratios of 0. 5 and 0. 75 on deflection-hardening and multiple-cracking behaviour of both types of DFRCC are also evaluated. Results reveal that deflection-hardening and multiple-cracking behaviour can be achieved in geopolymer-based DFRCC similar to that of cement-based system. For a given sand size, fibre type and sand content, comparable ultimate flexural strength and the deflection at peak load are observed in both cement and geopolymer-based composites.

In this project, two MCL-PHAs, poly(3 -hydroxyoctanoate) (P(3 HO) homopolymer and poly(3 -hydroxynonanoate-co- 3 -hydroxyheptanoate) P(3 HN-co- 3 HHP) were produced from Pseudomonas mendocina CH 50 using sodium octanoate and sodium nonanoate respectively as the carbon source and the growth profiles were monitored for 48 h. The polymers were characterised to confirm the chemical structure of the polymers. Different types of scaffolds were fabricated like plain films, <b>random</b> <b>fibres</b> and aligned fibres, using different ratios of P(3 HO) and P(3 HN-co- 3 HHP) which were 100 : 0 (P(3 HO)), 20 : 80 (P(3 HO) :P(3 HN-co- 3 HHP), 50 : 50 (P(3 HO) :P(3 HN-co- 3 HHP), 80 : 20 (P(3 HO) :P(3 HN-co- 3 HHP) and 0 : 100 P(3 HN-co- 3 HHP). The mechanical and thermal properties of the films were analysed along with the wettability of all the scaffolds. In vitro cytocompatibility studies were also conducted on all the different scaffolds (films, random and aligned fibres) by growing human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) on them. The cells were found to be viable and healthy with comparable beating rates and calcium transients to that measured on gelatin which was used as the positive control. The cell alignment quantification on the aligned fibres indicated around 50 % of the cells were aligned in one direction. Porous 5 wt% 2 D scaffolds and porous 20 wt% 3 D structure were fabricated using P(3 HO) and different concentrations of the porogen, sucrose and NaCl respectively, to obtain pores in the size range of 250 - 300 μm which exhibited decreased hydrophobicity compared to the neat scaffolds.

40|$|Summary Tissue {{engineering}} and regenerative medicine strategies until now have mostly relied on static culture using chemical stimulation to induce cell differentiation. However, these strategies neglect the dynamic {{environment in which}} cells reside in the body where they are surrounded by a chemically and physically well-defined threedimensional (3 D) topography. Not only does this environment control cellular differentiation, but its structure also determines the mechanical function of that tissue. Alongside physical cues, external mechanical forces play {{an essential role in}} the homeostasis of many tissues, particularly bone. In order to develop tissue engineered constructs that are suitable for implantation, it may be important to incorporate these essential cues into pre-culture methods and in order to do this, {{a better understanding of the}} cellular responses is required. The main aim of this research was to understand how physical and mechanical cues affect cell behaviour, differentiation and matrix production, with particular emphasis on osteogenesis and collagen organisation. In order to achieve this, electrospun scaffolds were fabricated with controllable fibre orientation for studies involving fibroblast matrix organisation, and the affect on the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. Short bouts of tensile loading were conducted using a previously established bioreactor model for conditioning collagen-producing cells. A simple rocking platform method for subjecting cells to fluid-flow was also investigated for its potential to enhance osteogenesis and collagen organisation. This system was further used to study the role of the primary cilium for the mechanotransduction of bone cells. The overall goal was to understand how to manipulate cell differentiation and matrix production in order to develop a more suitable construct with correct tissue structure in a rapid manner. Monitoring of the major structural matrix protein collagen was achieved using the minimally-invasive technique of second harmonic generation, which was optimised. Electrospun scaffolds with a random architecture caused cells to deposit matrix in a similar random manner, however highly aligned scaffolds caused deposited collagen to orientate in the fibre direction giving superior tensile properties. Further to this, <b>random</b> <b>fibres</b> appeared to be more favourable for the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells than highly aligned substrates. 9 Short bouts of tensile stimulation of collagen producing cells on 3 D substrates caused an increase in collagen deposition. Another stimulation method, a simple rocking platform, created oscillatory fluid shear stress (FSS) suitable for stimulation of osteogenic cells and enhanced collagen organisation. Further to this, human dermal fibroblasts could be induced to form a mineralised matrix when cultured in osteogenic media, which was further enhanced with FSS. It was also demonstrated that this simple rocking system could be used to test a wide variety of loading parameters. Finally, rocking was used to examine the role of the primary cilium in the load-induced mineral deposition response of bone cells. When mature bone cells were subjected to FSS, primary cilia shortened in length and removal of primary cilia resulted in loss of the load-induced matrix response suggesting that primary cilia are mechanosensors in bone cells...|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{composite}} design in energy absorbing components requires a failure criterion that can predict the energy involved in its fracture under different modes of loading. Present mixed mode criteria are mainly empirical or semi-empirical, and are only {{suitable for a}} small range of composite types. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a mechanistic failure criterion that is applicable to a wide range of polymer composites. An energy based mechanistic failure criterion is proposed to characterize the toughness of unidirectional (UD) and randomly oriented short <b>fibre</b> composites (<b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> composites). In UD and random composites, the criterion predicts the energy absorbed in the material during fracture based only on the constituents and interfacial properties. In UD composites, the criterion accounts for the resin fracture energy, hackle formation, interfacial debonding and effects of the plastic zone size. In <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> composite the criterion also includes the effect of fibre orientation and fibre pull-out energy. The pull-out energy was calculated with the help of a finite element model. Several experiments were performed to determine the failure mechanisms that influence the energy absorbed in the fracture of the polymer composite materials. Mixed mode loading was applied to the composite specimens using a compact tension shear (CTS) fixture. The comparison of the criterion predictions and experimental data shows a very good match.

A novel, cost effective, method of revealing developing unreliability in advanced composite pressure vessels is presented...|$|R

Abstract: This paper {{contrasts}} {{the loss}} tangent, durability of reinforcement and the lap shear strengths of 33 {{percent by weight}} <b>random</b> glass <b>fibre</b> reinforced low density polyethylene matrix composite [LDPE/GF (33 %) ] with 33 percent by weight <b>random</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> reinforced low density polyethylene matrix composite [LDPE/CF (33 %) ] bonded using microwave irradiation. Fixed (2. 45 GHz) and variable (2 – 18 GHz) frequency microwave (VFM) facilities are used to bond the two composites. With a given power level, the composites were exposed to various exposure times to microwave irradiation. The primer or coupling agent used for joining the glass-fibre-reinforced composite was 5 -minute two-part adhesive, Araldite. No filler was used in joining the carbon-fibre-reinforced composite...|$|R

This paper presents the effect of aging in Arenga Pinnata fibre reinforced epoxy composites.

The composites were than undergone accelerated aging process with aged conditions of 30 days, 67 days and 135 days respectively in according to ASTM F 1980 prior series of Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) evaluation.

The final version is available from SAGE via [URL] <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> oscillatory behaviour induced by turbulence in the diffuser of an industrial spun-bonding rig is measured experimentally. The turbulent air flow is firstly characterised by constant temperature hot-wire anemometry: averaged flow quantities, such as the mean velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy, as well as time dependent quantities, such as the integral time and the energy spectrum, are measured. The influence of the turbulent flow on the dynamics of a nylon filament of diameter 200 μm and a spun-bonding fibre of diameter 18 μm is then investigated by extracting the transverse displacement from images acquired by a digital camera.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} improve the testing and design of {{filament}} wound composite structures a model to predict the accumulation of fibre breakages has been developed {{that takes into account}} all physical phenomena controlling fibre failure, including the stochastic nature of fibre strength, stress transfer between fibres due to the shear of the matrix, interfacial debonding and viscosity of the matrix. In this, the first of three papers, the damage processes leading up to failure are discussed and quantified in terms of fibre breaks for the case of elastic monotonically tensile loading. It is clearly shown that the failure of a unidirectional composite structure results from the formation of <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> breaks which at high loads coalesce into clusters of broken fibres. A critical damage state is found...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the effective elastic properties in the framework of domain decomposition. The field of <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> composites, for which the network of heterogeneities is complex and leads to several numerical shortcomings, is considered. 2 D representative volume elements (RVEs) of the composite are generated and some elastic properties are estimated {{with the help of the}} double-scale homogenization. Such methodology is reliable but turns out to be potentially inefficient due to the required size of RVEs. Two adaptations of domain decomposition methods in the framework of double-scale homogenization are proposed to drastically reduce the calculation costs: a Schur complement method, and a mixed Schur complement and FETI- 1 method. Several numerical tests are performed which highlight reliability and efficiency of the first one in the present context...|$|R
40|$|Functionality {{of natural}} fibre-reinforced {{composites}} continually attracts attention {{and offers a}} unique possibility. We fabricated several types of unidirectional and <b>random</b> bamboo <b>fibre</b> green composites, and examined their damping properties {{as a function of}} bamboo fibre content, fibre length, and fibre morphology. The loss factors of the bamboo fibre green composites decreased with increasing bamboo fibre content. However, the loss factors gradually decreased in the composites reinforced with fibre content higher than 40 mass%. The loss factors of <b>random</b> short <b>fibre</b> (10 mm) reinforced green composites were higher than those of unidirectional ones. It can be seen that the damping factor of bamboo fibre green composites depended on fibre length and fibre content, and that vibration damping properties of the bamboo green composites were better than those of glass fibre reinforced plastics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{strength}} of unidirectional elastic fibre composites {{is shown to}} depend on the loading rate as the viscoelastic nature of the matrix results in a fall in breaking load as the rate is reduced. The simulation of the accumulation of fibre breaks leading to failure, takes into account all physical phenomena involved fibre failure, including the stochastic nature of fibre strength, stress transfer through the matrix between reinforcements, interfacial debonding and the viscoelastic nature of the matrix. The kinetics of composite failure are seen to involve the initial formation of <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> breaks which at higher loads coalesce into clusters of broken fibres. The rate at which this occurs depends on the viscoelastic properties of the matrix. These results have been shown to closely mirror the behaviour of carbon fibre composite pressure vessels...|$|R
40|$|A {{sheet of}} paper is {{modelled}} as a two-dimensional network of cellulose fibres. The fibres {{are assumed to be}} either cylindrical or band-shaped. Both well-ordered fibrous structures and fibrous structures in which a <b>random</b> arrangement of <b>fibres</b> is assumed are studied. The equations for creeping flow through such structures are solved, and the calculated permeabilities are compared with measured values. Flow through such paper structures as pulp sheets and handsheets of unbeaten sulphate pulp is found to be adequately described by a structural model that assumes cellulose fibres to be band-shaped when a fibre aspect ratio of 3. 5 (well-ordered structure) or 5 (<b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> distribution) is used. These values of the fibre aspect ratio compare favourably with the values used when gas diffusion through the same sheets is modelled. For newsprint sheets the measured permeability is found to be lower than that predicted by the models when physically realistic values for the aspect ratio are taken. It is also found that for all the pulp and paper grades investigated (a total of 19) the measured permeabilities and effective diffusivities correlate with each other.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the expected degree of contact between fibres in isotropic near-planar <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> networks. The statistics of fibre contact in two-dimensional fibre networks are considered and the expressions derived are developed {{to allow the}} fractional contact area in structures formed by the superposition of two-dimensional structures to be derived. These expressions allow the fractional contact area to be {{expressed in terms of}} the network porosity only. For thin networks, the fractional contact area may be expressed in terms of network porosity and the expected coverage of the network. Theory permitting the determination of the expected area of one contact and hence the expected number of contacts per fibre is presented also. Good agreement is found between the expressions derived for the fractional contact area and data from the literature. C © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers 1...|$|R

Lloyd's {{model of}} pore {{structure}} in <b>random</b> <b>fibre</b> networks {{to a large}} class of stochastic fibre networks containing the random model as a special case. The key to the generalization is the substitution ofa family of gamma distributions for the negative xponential family used for intercrossing distances on fibres. This allows closed expressions to be obtained for the variance and mean of the equivalent pore size distributions in a planar array of line elements representing fibres. The analytical details have been made available in a Mathematica notebook, via the World Wide Web.
