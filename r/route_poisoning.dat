50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>poisoning</b> is {{a method}} to prevent a router from sending packets through a route that has become invalid within {{computer}} networks. Distance-vector routing protocols in computer networks use <b>route</b> <b>poisoning</b> to indicate to other routers that a route is no longer reachable {{and should not be}} considered from their routing tables. Unlike the split horizon with poison reverse, <b>route</b> <b>poisoning</b> provides for sending updates with unreachable hop counts immediately to all the nodes in the network.|$|E
50|$|Some distance-vector routing protocols, such as RIP, use {{a maximum}} hop count to {{determine}} how many routers the traffic must go through to reach the destination. Each route has a hop count number assigned to it which is incremented as the routing information is passed from router to router. A route is considered unreachable if the hop count exceeds the maximum allowed. <b>Route</b> <b>poisoning</b> is a method of quickly forgetting outdated routing information from other router's routing tables by changing its hop count to be unreachable (higher than the maximum number of hops allowed) and sending a routing update. In the case of RIP, the maximum hop count is 15, so to perform <b>route</b> <b>poisoning</b> on a route its hop count is changed to 16, deeming it unreachable, and a routing update is sent.|$|E
50|$|Newer distance-vector routing {{protocols}} (BGP, EIGRP, DSDV, Babel) have built-in loop prevention: they use algorithms that assure that routing loops can never happen, not even transiently. Older {{routing protocols}} (RIP) do not implement the newest forms of loop prevention and only implement mitigations such as split horizon, <b>route</b> <b>poisoning,</b> holddown timer, Trigger Update and Define maximum hops.|$|E
50|$|Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which {{are known}} to carry Lyme disease) are a {{potential}} hazard. The trail passes through black bear habitat, although problems with bears are rare. More likely are problem encounters with domestic dogs. Skunks, raccoons, and porcupines are common and active after dark. Poisonous snakes are considered extinct along the <b>route.</b> <b>Poison</b> ivy is uncommon on the MSGT {{and it does not}} thrive on Mount Monadnock at all. Some water sources along the trail flow through inhabited areas or swamps and may be contaminated.|$|R
50|$|In mice, the {{molecule}} is lethal at 2.5 mg/kg of body mass (oral <b>route)</b> and <b>poisoning</b> {{is indicated by}} an increase in serum creatine phosphokinase activity. Polymerization via the ene reaction abolishes toxicity.|$|R
50|$|In 1891, Jaja {{was granted}} {{permission}} {{to return to}} Opobo, but died en <b>route,</b> allegedly <b>poisoned</b> {{with a cup of}} tea. Following his exile and death, the power of the Opobo state rapidly declined.|$|R
50|$|If these updates are lost, some nodes in {{the network}} would not be {{informed}} that a route is invalid, so they could attempt to send packets over the bad route and cause a problem known as a routing loop. Therefore <b>route</b> <b>poisoning</b> is {{used in conjunction with}} holddowns to keep update messages from falsely reinstating the validity of a bad route. This prevents routing loops, improving the overall efficiency of the network.|$|E
50|$|With <b>route</b> <b>poisoning,</b> when {{a router}} detects {{that one of}} its {{connected}} routes has failed, the router will poison the route by assigning an infinite metric to it and advertising it to neighbors. When a router advertises a poisoned route to its neighbors, its neighbors break the rule of split horizon and send back to the originator the same poisoned route, called a poison reverse.In order to give the router enough time to propagate the poisoned route and to ensure that no routing loops occur while propagation occurs, the routers implement a hold-down mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} distance-vector routing {{protocols}} which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support. A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance and the route is considered unreachable. RIP implements the split horizon, <b>route</b> <b>poisoning</b> and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.|$|E

40|$|A node in Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) solely {{depends on}} {{neighbor}} nodes for its connectivity {{to the outer}} networks. It is completely different with fixed network connection where a central infrastructure is providing connectivity to the outside network for all mobile nodes there. This kind of situation makes MANET easier to build rather than fixed network with certain infrastructure. However, this nature of MANET makes it very vulnerable to various attacks, especially by nodes within the MANET that is called malicious nodes. This paper provides a preliminary result for MANET security enhancement based on AODV-UI routing protocol. In this work we implement an algorithm to detect and remove malicious nodes in AODV-UI routing protocol. We evaluate our work in different scenarios by varying the number of nodes, the number of malicious node, the sending rate of the node in concern, {{and the type of}} the attack i. e. <b>route</b> <b>poisoning,</b> black hole, packet spoofing.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the pattern and outcome of acute cholinesterase inhibitors substances (CIS) poisoning cases, in a cohort from a regional tertiary care hospital. Methods: cases admitted in the Toxicology Clinic of “Sf. Spiridon” Emergency Clinic Hospital Iasi, Romania between 1983 and 2013 were studied. Results: a total number of 606 patients were included. The reason for exposures was intentional in 70 % of cases and the commonest <b>route</b> of <b>poisoning</b> was oral in 92. 2 %. The highest percent of cases was females (56. 4), the age group 20 - 29 (25. 4 %) and the majority (66. 7 %) coming from rural areas, 28. 2 % being agricultural workers. 36. 6 % of cases were severe clinical forms. Overall mortality rates were 3. 8 %, more than half of the death patients (65. 2 %) had concomitant alcohol intake. It was a significant statistical association between decrease level of serum cholinesterase on admittance and severe forms (p 0. 000) and between survival and deaths groups (p 0. 000). The pattern of poisoning described by our retrospective study suggests that CIS poisoning are mainly preventable.

40|$|Objective: Poisoning {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and mostly treatable {{problems}} in emergency departments. In this study we aimed to analyze demographic properties of poisoning cases who applied to our hospital. Materials and Methods: Poisoning cases who applied to the Emergency Department from 1 April 2010 to 1 December 2011 were included. Parameters like sex, marital status, age, <b>route</b> of <b>poisoning,</b> duration of hospital stay, and final status of the patient have been recorded descriptively. Data is summarized with frequency, percentage and graphics. In addition, categorical data are analyzed by cross tables and chi-square test. Results: In this study period, 0. 38 % of the emergency department applications were poisoning cases. In the present study, 58. 9 % (n= 106) of the patients were women and 41. 1 % (n= 74) were men. The most common poisoning type was drug poisoning with 47 % (n= 85) and carbon monoxide poisoning with 22. 2 % (n= 40). Suicidal poisoning was the first cause of the exposures. There were significant differences between the ages of suicidal poisoning causes (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Background: Poisoning is a {{major public}} health problem worldwide, with {{thousands}} of deaths occurring every year, mainly in the developing countries. India, holding 70 % of agricultural land, accounts for one third of pesticide poisoning cases in the third world, the farm workers being the worst affected. Most of the poisonings occur due to deliberate self-ingestion of the poison. Organo-phosphorus (OP) compounds occupy the greatest burden of poisoning related morbidity and mortality. The present study was aimed to know the profile of various poisoning cases admitted to emergency department in district hospital, Chamarajanagar, Karnataka, India. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the profile of poisoning cases reported to district hospital, Chamarajanagar and to assess their pattern and outcome. Methods: A record based retrospective study for the year 2012 i. e. from 1 st January 2012 to 31 st December 2012 was conducted in district hospital, Chamarajanagar, Karnataka, India and the data regarding age, gender, residence, time elapsed after intake, type of <b>poison,</b> manner and <b>route</b> of <b>poisoning,</b> duration of hospitalization and outcome were collected in a pre-structured proforma. The data was analyzed using standard statistical methods. Results: In present study, rural hindu males were among the highest reported cases, with maximum number of cases reported during the month of March and during the 12 : 01 to 18 : 00 hours of the day. Irritant poisons accounts to the highest incidence (68 %) among poisoning in present study. Pesticides, organophosphorus compound in particular form the major type of poisons among irritants followed by snake bite, rat poison and honey bee bite (sting).

40|$|Background: This study {{sought to}} characterise acute {{poisoning}} cases seen in three health districts of Botswana. Method: A retrospective review of patients’ records was conducted and included patients treated from January 2004 to December 2005. Data on the demographic status of the patients, information about the poisonous agent(s) involved, and the circumstances and outcomes of the poisoning incidents were recorded on a pre-tested data collection form. Results: A total of 590 cases of acute poisoning {{were included in the}} analysis. The most affected age category was that of children aged less than six years, who constituted 33. 4 % of the cases. Most incidents were recorded in the urban district of Gaborone. Seventy-eight percent (78 %) of the incidents were accidental, with the remainder being intentional. The poisonous agents involved were pharmaceuticals (26. 6 %), natural toxins (25. 6 %), household products (14. 6 %), foods (14. 4 %), alcohol (6. 9 %), traditional medicines (4. 7 %), unspecified agents (3. 2 %), and agrochemicals (2. 7 %). The most common <b>route</b> of <b>poison</b> exposure was by oral (82. 2 %), followed by dermal contact (16. 5 %), while the inhalation of gases occurred in 1. 2 % of cases. An incidence rate of 4. 7 / 1000, a case fatality rate of 3. 8 / 100, and 1. 5 % of deaths were recorded over the two-year period.
