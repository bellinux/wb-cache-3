40|$|A {{chemical}} amplifier based radical detector {{was used}} to make measurements of radical (ROx = HO 2 + HO + RO + RO 2) concentrations at a rural site {{in the summer of}} 1992, as part of the Southern Ontario Oxidant Study (SONTOS). The average maximum daytime radical concentration was around 7 pptv, with the maximum value recorded being 23 pptv. There was no distinguishable radical signal on any of the cloudy days, whereas there was a clear diurnal variation, maximizing in the mid afternoon on sunny days. The highest radical signals were observed on days of the highest ozone, which were days that showed photochemical ozone production. The local ozone production was calculated from the radical and NO concentrations but, {{even in the absence of}} loss terms, was insufficient to explain the ozone increase at the site. This indicates that part of the measured ozone increase is due to ozone production elsewhere followed by transport to the site. Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) decomposition appears to provide about 30 % of the radicals measured at the site so that the contribution of PAN as a <b>radical</b> <b>reservoir</b> needs to be considered. Fluctuations in the measured parameters prevented the meaningful determination of radical concentrations from the photostationary state at the low levels encountered...|$|E
40|$|A small-molecular model {{reaction}} {{was designed to}} probe the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process. In this reaction, alkoxyamine releases radicals that react in situ with dithioester through the RAFT process, generating new radicals through the fragmentation of the intermediate radical. The new radicals can be trapped by free 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl-piperidinyl-N-oxyl radicals (TEMPO) from homolysis of alkoxyamine. The overall reaction is the crossover of the leaving groups between alkoxyamine and dithioester. The advantage of this model as a probe of the RAFT process {{is that it does}} not involve polymerization-related elementary reactions such as initiation, propagation, and chain length dependent termination. The kinetics of the model reaction were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography, and then fitted by Monte Carlo simulation to estimate rate coefficients. The obtained rate coefficients of addition for various dithioesters fell into a narrow range of 107108 Lmol 1 s 1, whereas the rate coefficient of fragmentation was model-dependent. It was also found that a significant fraction of the dithioester was consumed by an unspecified additional mechanism. A tentative explanation is proposed in which the intermediate radical undergoes a secondary RAFT reaction with dithioesters, forming a secondary intermediate that serves as a <b>radical</b> <b>reservoir...</b>|$|E
40|$|Immobilizing a protein, that {{is fully}} {{compatible}} with the patient, {{on the surface of}} a biomedical device should make it possible to avoid adverse responses such as inflammation, rejection, or excessive fibrosis. A surface that strongly binds and does not denature the compatible protein is required. Hydrophilic surfaces do not induce denaturation of immobilized protein but exhibit a low binding affinity for protein. Here, we describe an energetic ion-assisted plasma process that can make any surface hydrophilic {{and at the same time}} enable it to covalently immobilize functional biological molecules. We show that the modification creates free radicals that migrate to the surface from a reservoir beneath. When they reach the surface, the radicals form covalent bonds with biomolecules. The kinetics and number densities of protein molecules in solution and free radicals in the reservoir control the time required to form a full protein monolayer that is covalently bound. The shelf life of the covalent binding capability is governed by the initial density of free radicals and the depth of the reservoir. We show that the high reactivity of the radicals renders the binding universal across all biological macromolecules. Because the free <b>radical</b> <b>reservoir</b> can be created on any solid material, this approach can be used in medical applications ranging from cardiovascular stents to heart-lung machines...|$|E
40|$|The Nitrogen, Aerosol Composition, and Halogens on a Tall Tower (NACHTT) field {{experiment}} {{took place during}} late winter, 2011, at a site 33 [*]km north of Denver, Colorado. The study included fixed-height measurements of aerosols, soluble trace gases, and volatile organic compounds near surface level, as well as vertically resolved measurements of nitrogen oxides, aerosol composition, soluble gas-phase acids, and halogen species from 3 to 270 [*]m above ground level. There were 1928 individual profiles during the three-week campaign to characterize trace gas and aerosol distributions in {{the lower levels of}} the boundary layer. Nitrate and ammonium dominated the ionic composition of aerosols and originated primarily from local or regional sources. Sulfate and organic matter were also significant and were associated primarily with longer-range transport to the region. Aerosol chloride was associated primarily with supermicron size fractions and was always present in excess of gas-phase chlorine compounds. The nighttime <b>radical</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> nitryl chloride, ClNO 2, and nitrous acid, HONO, were both consistently present in nighttime urban air. Nitryl chloride was especially pronounced in plumes from large point sources sampled aloft at night. Nitrous acid was typically most concentrated near the ground surface and was the dominant contributor (80 %) to diurnally averaged primary OH radical production in near-surface air. Large observed mixing ratios of light alkanes, both in near-surface air and aloft, were attributable to local emissions from oil and gas activities...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the CLAES experiment is to measure the altitude profiles of temperature and {{of a series of}} minor and trace species important to stratospheric ozone layer photochemistry and radiative structure. Ways in which the species to be measured by CLAES are distributed among the broad categories of source, <b>radical,</b> and <b>reservoir</b> species involved in ozone production and loss are illustrated. CLAES requires high spectral resolution and high radiometric sensitivity to isolate and accurately measure weak emissions from trace species such as HCl and NO against intense backgrounds from abundant emitters such as CO 2, H 2 O, and O 3. Spectroscopy is performed by tilt scanning one of the four solid etalons between 0 and 23 deg in conjunction with {{one or more of the}} nine selectable discrete interference filters...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{three-dimensional}} chemistry and transport model (CTM), developed under the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI), to carry out two simulations of {{the composition of the}} stratosphere under changing halogen loading for 1995 through 2030. The two simulations differ only in that one uses meteorological fields from a general circulation model while the other uses meteorological fields from a data assimilation system. A single year's winds and temperatures are repeated for each 36 -year simulation. We compare results from these two simulations with an extensive collection of data from satellite and ground-based measurements for 1993 - 2000. Comparisons of simulated fields with observations of <b>radical</b> and <b>reservoir</b> species for some of the major ozone-destroying compounds are of similar quality for both simulations. Differences in the upper stratosphere, caused by transport of total reactive nitrogen and methane, impact the balance among the ozone loss processes and the sensitivity of the two simulations to the change in composition...|$|R
40|$|The EOS-Aura {{atmospheric}} chemistry mission {{is scheduled for}} launch in June 2004. Aura is the third of the large EOS observatories. The spacecraft carries an international instrument payload that has a planned six year lifetime. The Aura mission will collect data to help answer stratospheric and tropospheric {{atmospheric chemistry}} questions. The mission has the following four major objectives: 1) Track the ozone layer to determine if it is recovering as predicted. The four Aura instruments, HIRDLS, OMI, MLS, and TES will measure ozone, key source, <b>radical,</b> <b>reservoir,</b> tracer gases, and aerosols. Aura's unique design allows for major ozone controlling gases to be measured within the same air mass within a few minutes. The OMI instrument will continue the trends fiom NASA's TOMS series. 2) Track tropospheric pollutant sources and measure tropospheric ozone precursors. Major pollution sources include urban, industrial and biomass burning regions. Tropospheric trace gases will be measured, using TES and OMI, at an average spatial resolution of about approximately 15 km with near global coverage. 3) Measure key upper tropospheric atmospheric constituents that influence climate. The Aura instruments will monitor O 3, H 2 O, CO, cirrus ice, and aerosols. EOS-Aura will fly in a sun-synchronous polar orbit about 15 minutes behind Aqua and make near coincident and synergistic measurements with the EOS- Aqua, Cloudsat, OCO, PARASOL and Calipso missions.

40|$|Acyl peroxy nitrates (APNs, {{also known}} as PANs) are formed from the {{oxidation}} of aldehydes and other oxygenated VOC (oVOC) {{in the presence of}} NO 2. There are both anthropogenic and biogenic oVOC precursors to APNs, but a detailed evaluation of this chemistry against observations has proven elusive. Here we describe measurements of PAN, PPN, and MPAN along with the majority of chemicals that participate in their production and loss, including OH, HO 2, numerous oVOC, and NO 2. Observations were made during the Biosphere Effects on AeRosols and Photochemistry Experiment (BEARPEX 2007) in the outflow of the Sacramento urban plume. These observations are used to evaluate a detailed chemical model of APN ratios and concentrations. We find that the ratios of APNs are nearly independent of the loss mechanisms and thus an especially good test of our understanding of their sources. We show that oxidation of methylvinyl ketone, methacrolein, methyl glyoxal, biacetyl and acetaldehyde are all significant sources of the PAN+peroxy acetyl (PA) <b>radical</b> <b>reservoir,</b> accounting for 26 %, 2 %, 7 %, 20 %, and 45 %, of the production rate on average during the campaign, respectively. At high temperatures, when upwind isoprene emissions are highest, oxidation of non-acetaldehyde PA radical sources contributes over 60 % to the total PA production rate, with methylvinyl ketone being the most important of the isoprene-derived sources. An analysis of absolute APN concentrations reveals a missing APN sink that can be resolved by increasing the PA+∑RO 2 rate constant by a factor of 3...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{importance}} of HONO as a <b>radical</b> <b>reservoir,</b> consistent and accurate measurements of its concentration are needed. As part of SHARP (Study of Houston Atmospheric Radical Precursors), time series of HONO were obtained by six different measurement techniques {{on the roof of the}} Moody Tower at the University of Houston. Techniques used were long path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), stripping coil-visible absorption photometry (SC-AP), long path absorption photometry (LOPAP®), mist chamber/ion chromatography (MC-IC), quantum cascade-tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectroscopy (QC-TILDAS), and ion drift-chemical ionization mass spectrometry (ID-CIMS). Various combinations of techniques were in operation from 15 April through 31 May 2009. All instruments recorded a similar diurnal pattern of HONO concentrations with higher median and mean values during the night than during the day. Highest values were observed in the final 2 weeks of the campaign. Inlets for the MC-IC, SC-AP, and QC-TILDAS were collocated and agreed most closely with each other based on several measures. Largest differences between pairs of measurements were evident during the day for concentrations ~ 100 parts per trillion (ppt). Above ~ 200 ppt, concentrations from the SC-AP, MC-IC, and QC-TILDAS converged to within about 20 %, with slightly larger discrepancies when DOAS was considered. During the first 2 weeks, HONO measured by ID-CIMS agreed with these techniques, but ID-CIMS reported higher values during the afternoon and evening of the final 4 weeks, possibly from interference from unknown sources. A number of factors, including building related sources, likely affected measured concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{nitrogen}} (NOy) {{plays an}} important role in stratospheric ozone chemistry. Its constitutents NO and NO 2 both catalyze ozone detruction and limit other catalytic ozone depletion cycles as they transform the involved <b>radicals</b> into <b>reservoir</b> species, e. g. chlorine nitrate and nitric acid. While the partitioning within the NOy family may change rapidly, its chemical lifetime is long compared to the time scale of atmospheric transport processes. This also holds for nitrous oxide (N 2 O), whose photochemical destruciton in the middle stratosphere in the tropics is the principle source of NOy. Therefore, a compact anticorrelation is anticipated and frequently found for the two tracers. However, deviations from this corelation can occur due to processes that redistribute the abundance of reactive nitrogen within the stratosphere, e. g. by particle formation, sedimentation and reevaporation. As such processes alter the balance between ozone destructing radicals, they can have substantial in fluence on stratospheric ozone chemistry...|$|R

IGOS links satellite and ground based systems for global environmental observations. The strategy of this project is to develop a consensus of user requirements including the scientific (SPARC, IGAC, WCRP) and the applications community (WMO, UNEP) and to develop a long-term international plan for ozone and atmospheric chemistry measurements. The major components of the observing system include operational and research (meeting certain criteria) satellite platforms planned by the space faring nations which are integrated with a well supported and sustained ground, aircraft, and balloon measurements program for directed observations as well satellite validation. Highly integrated and continuous measurements of ozone, validation, and reanalysis efforts are essential to meet the international scientific and applications goals. In order to understand ozone trends, climate change, and air quality, it is essential to conduct long term measurements of certain other atmospheric species.

40|$|The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) {{measures}} microwave emission from ozone and chlorine monoxide, a major ozone destroying radical. Right after UARS was launched, MLS {{began to}} measure large concentrations of chlorine monoxide {{over the south}} pole. These dramatic images clearly showed {{the extent of the}} south polar ozone destruction and confirmed the connection between man-made chlorine and the formation to the Antarctic ozone hole. Why is so much chlorine monoxide found over the Antarctic? UARS measurements have confirmed that CFCs enter the stratosphere in the tropics. As they rise above the ozone layer, ultraviolet molecules release chlorine, which then can react with methane to form hydrogen chloride. Chlorine can also react with ozone forming the radical chlorine monoxide. Chlorine monoxide then combines with the radical nitrogen dioxide to form stable chlorine nitrate. Chlorine nitrate and hydrogen chloride are called reservoir gases for the chlorine <b>radical.</b> These <b>reservoir</b> gases usually contain more than ninety percent of the chlorine in the lower stratosphere.

40|$|A {{steady state}} model, {{constrained}} {{by a number}} of measured quantities, was used to derive peroxy radical levels for the conditions of the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) campaign. The analysis is made using data collected aboard the NCAR/NSF C- 130 aircraft from February through May 2000 at latitudes from 40 ° to 85 °N, and at altitudes from the surface to 7. 6 km. HO 2 + RO 2 radical concentrations were measured during the experiment, which are compared with model results over the domain of the study showing good agreement on the average. Average measurement/model ratios are 1. 04 (σ = 0. 73) and 0. 96 (σ = 0. 52) for the MLB and HLB, respectively. Budgets of total peroxy radical levels as well as of individual free radical members were constructed, which reveal interesting differences compared to studies at lower latitudes. The midlatitude part of the study region is a significant net source of ozone, while the high latitudes constitute a small net sink leading to the hypothesis that transport from the middle latitudes can explain the observed increase in ozone in the high latitudes. <b>Radical</b> <b>reservoir</b> species concentrations are modeled and compared with the observations. For most conditions, the model does a good job of reproducing the formaldehyde observations, but the peroxide observations are significantly less than steady state for this study.

40|$|Coenzyme B 12 is a biologically active form {{of vitamin}} B 12 {{and used in}} Nature as a <b>radical</b> <b>reservoir</b> to {{catalyze}} chemically challenging transformations. The loading of B 12 -enzymes with the correct cofactor form is critically important for their function and is gated by chaperones that use the chemical energy of GTP hydrolysis to ensure the fidelity of the process. Two highly similar coenzyme B 12 -dependent enzymes that catalyze carbon skeleton rearrangements, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) and isobutyryl-CoA mutase (ICM), are widely distributed in bacteria. MCM catalyzes the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA while ICM catalyzes the reversible interconversion of isobutyryl-CoA and n-butyryl-CoA. Curiously, a variant, IcmF, is found in > 80 bacterial species. Although IcmF was misannotated as an MCM variant in the database, I have demonstrated by expressing four bacterial IcmFs {{that it is an}} active ICM, fused to its chaperone. This discovery expands the known distribution of ICM activity well beyond the genus Streptomyces where it is involved in polyketide biosynthesis. Subsequently we have discovered that IcmF catalyzes a novel coenzyme B 12 -dependent 1, 2 -rearrangement of isovaleryl-CoA and pivalyl-CoA (2, 2 -dimethylpropionyl-CoA). Biochemical experiments demonstrate that in an IcmF in which the base specificity loop motif, NKxD is modified to NKxE, catalyzes the hydrolysis of both GTP and ATP. IcmF is susceptible to rapid inactivation during turnover and GTP confers protection, but only during utilization of isovaleryl-CoA as substrate. I have characterized the mutase and GTPase activities in intact and truncated versions of IcmF lacking the B 12 - or the substrate-binding domains to investigate interactions between the domains. I have demonstrated that adenosyltransferase (ATR), which synthesizes coenzyme B 12, also transfers the cofactor to IcmF. To gain insights into the metabolic role of IcmF, we have disrupted the icmF gene in Myxococcus xanthus in collaboration with Dr. Montserrat Elias-Arnanz (Universidad de Murcia, Spain) and in Ralstonia eutropha H 16 in collaboration with Dr. Antony Sinskey (MIT) and currently are testing the resulting phenotypes under different growth conditions...|$|E
40|$|Nighttime HO x {{chemistry}} {{was investigated}} in two ground-based field campaigns (PRIDE-PRD 2006 and CAREBEIJING 2006) in summer 2006 in China by comparison of measured and modeled concentration data of OH and HO 2. The measurement sites were located in a rural environment in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) under urban influence and in a suburban area close to Beijing, respectively. In both locations, significant nighttime concentrations of radicals were observed under conditions with high total OH reactivities of about 40 – 50 s − 1 in PRD and 25 s − 1 near Beijing. For OH, the nocturnal concentrations were {{within the range of}} (0. 5 – 3) × 10 6 cm − 3, implying a significant nighttime oxidation rate of pollutants on the order of several ppb per hour. The measured nighttime concentration of HO 2 was about (0. 2 – 5) × 10 8 cm − 3, containing a significant, model-estimated contribution from RO 2 as an interference. A chemical box model based on an established chemical mechanism is capable of reproducing the measured nighttime values of the measured peroxy radicals and $k_{	ext{OH}}$, but underestimates in both field campaigns the observed OH by about 1 order of magnitude. Sensitivity studies with the box model demonstrate that the OH discrepancy between measured and modeled nighttime OH can be resolved, if an additional RO x production process (about 1 ppb h − 1) and additional recycling (RO 2 → HO 2 → OH) with an efficiency equivalent to 1 ppb NO is assumed. The additional recycling mechanism was also needed to reproduce the OH observations at the same locations during daytime for conditions with NO mixing ratios below 1 ppb. This could be an indication that the same missing process operates at day and night. In principle, the required primary RO x source can be explained by ozonolysis of terpenoids, which react faster with ozone than with OH in the nighttime atmosphere. However, the amount of these highly reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) would require a strong local source, {{for which there is no}} direct evidence. A more likely explanation for an additional RO x source is the vertical downward transport of <b>radical</b> <b>reservoir</b> species in the stable nocturnal boundary layer. Using a simplified one-dimensional two-box model, it can be shown that ground-based NO emissions could generate a large vertical gradient causing a downward flux of peroxy acetic nitrate (PAN) and peroxymethacryloyl nitrate (MPAN). The downward transport and the following thermal decomposition of these compounds can produce up to 0. 3 ppb h − 1 radicals in the atmospheric layer near the ground. Although this rate is not sufficient to explain the complete OH discrepancy, it indicates the potentially important role of vertical transport in the lower nighttime atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} {{distributions of}} the important highly reactive stratospheric species, ClO and HO 2, have been inferred from Spacelab 3 (May 1985) Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) measurements of more detectable <b>radical</b> and <b>reservoir</b> species. A simple steady state algebraic expression for ClO, utilizing the observed ClONO 2 /NO 2 abundance ratio, approximates the ClO results of a time-dependent photochemical model at sunset (30 deg N). Balloon measurements of ClO and comparisons of time-dependent photochemical model calculations of ClONO 2 and HCl with the corresponding ATMOS profiles suggest that the actual ClO values are less than the time-dependent model profiles for ClO at sunset and sunrise (47 deg S). Errors in the current model simulation of the partitioning among the principal free chlorine species (HCl, ClONO 2, and ClO) are indicated. The accuracy of the time-dependent model calculations of HO 2 {{is suggested by the}} agreement between model results and ATMOS observations for HO 2 NO 2 and balloon measurements of HO 2.

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) off-line chemical transport model (CTM) to investigate long-term changes in stratospheric NO 2. The basic model was integrated from 1977 to 2001 using ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forcasts) ERA- 40 reanalyses. Additional model runs were performed which assimilated HALOE observations of long-lived tracers to constrain the model trace gas distributions. Assimilation of a single long-lived species (CH 4) improves not only the distribution of all other long-lived species, via tracer-tracer correlations, but also shorter lived <b>radical</b> and <b>reservoir</b> species. Assimilation of the long-lived species corrects for errors in the model, due to horizontal transport from the ERA- 40 reanalyses, and allows a more direct test of the model's chemistry. The basic model significantly underestimates the observed column NO 2 from mid-latitude ground-based sites in the mid-late 1990 s. The mean underestimate is ~ 26 % for summertime values between 1992 and 1998. Moreover, as the model agreement is better in the early 1990 s, it underestimates the increasing trend throughout the decade. However, when the model assimilates HALOE CH 4 data both comparisons are greatly improved. The mean model-observation difference reduces to 8 % for summertime values and the trend improves. This indicates that given realistic wind fields to constrain the tracer transport, the model chemistry and aerosol schemes are able to reproduce the observed trends in NO 2. Implications of this for using analysed wind fields to determine dynamical ozone trends are discussed. Ozone trends derived directly from transport models forced by analysed winds are likely subject to similar errors...|$|R

The uncertainty ranges in calculated N 2 O and CH 4 global lifetimes computed using the SPARC estimated uncertainties are reduced by nearly {{a factor of}} two compared with uncertainties from Sander et al. [2011]. Uncertainties in CH 4 loss due to reaction with OH and O(1 D) have relatively small impacts on present day global total ozone (± 0. 2 - 0. 3 %). Uncertainty in the Cl + CH 4 reaction affects the amount of chlorine in <b>radical</b> vs. <b>reservoir</b> forms and has a modest impact on present day SH polar ozone (~± 6 %), and on the rate of past ozone decline and future recovery. Uncertainty in the total rate coefficient for the O(1 D) + N 2 O reaction results in a substantial range in present day stratospheric odd nitrogen (± 20 - 25 %) and global total ozone (± 1. 5 - 2. 5 %). Uncertainty in the O(1 D) + N 2 O reaction branching ratio for the O 2 + N 2 and 2 *NO product channels results in moderate impacts on odd nitrogen (± 10 %) and global ozone (± 1 %),with uncertainty in N 2 O photolysis resulting in relatively small impacts (± 5 % in odd nitrogen, ± 0. 5 % in global ozone).

Aura's four instruments work synergistically and are dedicated to answering these questions. Aura's instruments observe from the ultraviolet to the microwave region and view in the nadir and limb. This capability allows measurements of all the critical source, <b>radical,</b> and <b>reservoir</b> gases in the stratosphere to be observed globally on a daily basis. Aura will also continue the TOMS global ozone trend record. Observations in the troposphere will be conducted with the best spatial resolution and coverage ever achieved from space.

High vertical resolution measurements will {{be made in the}} vicinity of the tropopause to better define the interactions of the UT/LS and particularly determine the amount downward transport of ozone and upward transport. of water vapor where both contribute to climate forcing. Aura will also measure aerosols in the stratosphere and troposphere where they play a role in ozone chemistry, air quality and climate. Aura data will be used by several environmental agencies for their decision support systems.

We find that a standard gas-phase chemical mechanism overestimates the observed HO 2 and H 2 O 2 concentrations. Computation of HO x and HO y gas-phase chemical budgets {{on the basis of the}} aircraft observations also indicates a large missing sink for both. We hypothesize that this could reflect HO 2 uptake by aerosols, favored by low temperatures and relatively high aerosol loadings, through a mechanism that does not produce H 2 O 2. We implemented such an uptake of HO 2 by aerosol in the model using a standard reactive uptake coefficient parameterization with γ(HO 2) values ranging from 0. 02 at 275 K to 0. 5 at 220 K. This successfully reproduces the concentrations and vertical distributions of the different HO x species and HO y reservoirs. HO 2 uptake by aerosol is then a major HO x and HO y sink, decreasing mean OH and HO 2 concentrations in the Arctic troposphere by 32 % and 31 % respectively. Better rate and product data for HO 2 uptake by aerosol are needed to understand this role of aerosols in limiting the oxidizing power of the Arctic atmosphere...|$|R

This paper is {{an overview of the}} studies carried out in the Aliakmon, the Upper Acheloos, the Portaikos, and the Pinios basins, where the regional hydrological cycle was evaluated on river basin spatial scale to assess regional impacts and variability. The impacts of climate change on the water resources are presented in a synthetic quantitative way, in order to draw general conclusions concerning the trends of the hydrological indicators. A good agreement was observed between the different climatic experiments, and the trends on the selected hydrological indicators demonstrate an increase in temperature and PET, reduction in the mean annual precipitation and runoff, and a shifting of the snowmelt period towards the winter, while the snowpack storage was proved to be a con-trolling factor. It is accentuated that relatively small decreases in the mean annual precipitation cause dramatic increase of reservoir risk levels of annual firm water supply and energy production. As a result, <b>radical</b> increases of <b>reservoir</b> storage volume are required to maintain firm water and energy yields at tolerable risk levels.

40|$|The {{solid and}} liquid {{particles}} which constitute polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are of manifold importance to the meteorology of the stratosphere. The heterogeneous reactions which take place on and within these particles release halogens from relatively inert reservoir species into forms which can destroy ozone in the polar spring. In addition, solid PSC particles are instrumental in the physical removal of nitrogen oxides (denitrification) and water (dehydration) of regions of the polar stratosphere. Denitrification, in particular, allows extended ozone destruction by slowing the conversion of chlorine <b>radicals</b> back into <b>reservoir</b> species. We review {{the historical development of}} PSC studies, with particular emphasis on results from the last decade, encompassing developments in observations, in laboratory experiments, and in theoretical treatments. The technical challenge of measuring sufficient of the parameters describing any given polar stratospheric cloud, to allow its microphysics to be understood, has driven forward balloon-borne, aircraft, and satellite instrumentation. The technical challenge of finding suitable laboratory proxies for PSCs, in order to observe the microphysics under controlled conditions, has resulted {{in a wide variety of}} experimental designs, some of which maximise the probability of observing phase change, others of which mimic the surface-volume ratios of PSCs more closely. The challenge to theory presented by PSCs has resulted in improvements in the thermodynamics of concentrated inorganic solutions of volatile compounds, and a new general theory of freezing of water ice from concentrated aqueous solutions. Of the major processes involving PSCs, heterogeneous reaction probabilities for ternary HNO 3 /H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O solutions, and heterogeneous freezing to produce nitric acid hydrates, are the least well understood...|$|R
