5|$|The <b>RAN</b> {{planned to}} acquire 14 Grumman S-2E Tracker anti-submarine aircraft, and modernise Melbourne {{to operate the}} aircraft. The {{acquisition}} of 18 Douglas A-4 Skyhawk fighter-bombers was also suggested, but these were dropped from the initial plan. A separate proposal to order 10 A-4G Skyhawks, {{a variant of the}} Skyhawk designed specifically for the <b>RAN</b> and optimised for air defence, was approved in 1965. Both aircraft types entered <b>RAN</b> service in 1968, with the Trackers operated by 816 Squadron <b>RAN</b> and 851 Squadron <b>RAN,</b> and the Skyhawks by 805 Squadron <b>RAN</b> and 724 Squadron <b>RAN.</b> The aircraft did not fly from Melbourne until the conclusion of her refit in 1969. In 1969, the <b>RAN</b> purchased another ten A-4G Skyhawks, instead of the proposed seventh and eighth Oberon-class submarines. Melbourne operated a standard air group of four Skyhawks, six Trackers, and ten Wessex helicopters until 1972, when the Wessexes were replaced with ten Westland Sea King anti-submarine warfare helicopters and the number of Skyhawks doubled. Although replaced by the Sea King, up to three Wessex helicopters could be carried as search-and-rescue aircraft.|$|E
