5|$|The {{athletics}} venue suffered with drainage problems, {{and from}} the 1970s {{it was no longer}} used for competitions. This forced Minerva IS to hold many of its trainings at Stovner stadion in Oslo and Jessheim stadion in Ullensaker. In 1976, Minerva IS took initiative to lay all-weather <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> but the proposal was rejected by the municipality. In 1990, Skedsmo Municipal Council initially voted to allocate NOK2 million for all-weather <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> but the funding was reallocated to fix a leaking roof on Skedsmo Church. No further grants were issued for the stadium.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, the Vanderbilt Athletic Association {{was formed}} by {{president}} W. M. Baskerville. Most Vanderbilt students were members. Early sports played at the school were baseball, cycling and track and field. For twenty five years, Dudley {{was president of the}} organization. Dudley added a <b>running</b> <b>track</b> to the Old Gym in 1895.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre <b>running</b> <b>track</b> with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre <b>running</b> <b>track</b> and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E

50|$|The school {{boasts a}} large outdoor greenspace which {{consists}} of five soccer fields, two baseball fields, a football field and two <b>running</b> <b>tracks.</b> The <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> consist of one paved, 5-lane track that encircles the football field, and a backed dirt trail that hugs the outside perimeter of the school property for endurance running. All of which (minus half of a soccer field) are currently out of bounds to the students during the school day.|$|R
5|$|The <b>running</b> <b>track</b> was renovated in 2003, and {{received}} a new surface layer and paint job. In 2005, the club house was completed by the women's football club. In 2006, the gravel ice rink received an artificial ice machine to secure stable ice conditions throughout the winter.|$|E
5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped <b>running</b> <b>track</b> and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather <b>running</b> <b>track</b> of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the <b>running</b> <b>track</b> surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2006, the Nike Malvern Sports Complex {{was opened}} in the Malvern neighbourhood. Nike Canada donated $500,000 to build the complex, which {{includes}} a basketball court, a practice soccer pitch, and a <b>running</b> <b>track.</b> The track was constructed from 50,000 used running shoes. The complex {{was built on the}} grounds of the St. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy and is open to the public. Olympic hurdler Perdita Felicien was on hand at the opening to encourage youth to participate in sports.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipal}} Complexo Desportivo (Sports Complex), {{located on}} {{the western edge of}} the city in Santo Onofre, features a rugby field and a <b>running</b> <b>track.</b> The field is home to Caldas Rugby Clube and can be used for association football (soccer). In 2008 the municipality added five tennis courts (two of which are covered) in an adjacent facility. The municipal pools are located nearby.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} is a sport which {{includes}} athletic contests established on {{the skills of}} running, jumping, and throwing. The name {{is derived from the}} sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval <b>running</b> <b>track</b> enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.|$|E
5|$|All four of {{the common}} jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run {{alongside}} the central 60m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central <b>running</b> <b>track.</b> Shot put (or weight throw) is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area {{is similar to the}} outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.|$|E

5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second <b>running</b> <b>track</b> going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Juventus {{returned}} {{to play in}} the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a <b>running</b> <b>track</b> and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.|$|E

Continuing east, NY104 crosses the Genesee River gorge on the Veterans Memorial Bridge. On the opposite bank, it loses the name West Ridge Road and becomes a limited-access highway known as the Keeler Street Expressway.|$|E

5|$|The stadium {{opened on}} 6 June 1920 and was {{originally}} named Lillestrøm kommunale idrettsplass ("Lillestrøm Municipal Sports Place"). Lillestrøm SK {{was the main}} football tenant from the opening until 1951, when they opened Åråsen Stadion. The original athletics stadium opened in 1953, located {{at the same place}} as the current athletics stadium. Minerva arranged the first tournament on 16 June 1954. Subsequently, a velodrome was installed outside the <b>running</b> <b>track.</b> A municipal grant of 5,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) allowed a steeplechase obstacle to be installed in 1959. A cage for discus throw and hammer throw was installed on the current artificial turf pitch in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Both Omar's {{father and}} uncle were killed {{following}} a mortar attack on Bakaara Market, where they worked. Omar {{was in the}} eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold produce to provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel <b>running</b> <b>track,</b> pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|E
5|$|Kingstonian F.C. {{remained}} at Richmond Road {{for most of}} the 20th Century, it thus being referred to as the club's 'traditional home'. The club's record home attendance of 8,960 was attained there in 1955 in a match against Bishop Auckland F.C. The maintenance of the site increasingly became more than the club's income could support and parts of the site were sold off for redevelopment; the 'Kingstonian petrol station' occupying much of the Richmond Road frontage since 1956, and the former <b>running</b> <b>track</b> and reserve pitch redeveloped for housing in the 1970s. The club eventually sold the site and moved out of Richmond Road in 1988. The stadium was demolished after 1989 and the remainder of the site redeveloped for housing.|$|E

5|$|The Empire Stadium (later to {{be known}} as Wembley Stadium) was chosen as the main venue, ahead of the White City Stadium, which had assumed that role during the 1908 Summer Olympics. This was due to the Empire Stadium's ability to hold a greater number of events, {{reducing}} the need for additional venues to be found. A new approach road was required to connect the stadium to the nearby Wembley Park tube station, so it was agreed that Wembley Stadium Ltd. would cover the costs in return for a share of the proceeds for the events held there. Motorcycle and greyhound races usually held at the Empire Stadium were highly profitable events, which meant that a cinder <b>running</b> <b>track</b> was not laid down until two weeks before the opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League {{played their}} home games at Downing Stadium for two seasons, {{starting}} in 1974. In 1975, the team signed Pelé, officially recorded by FIFA as the world's greatest soccer player, to a $4.5million contract, drawing a capacity crowd of 22,500 {{to watch him}} lead the team to a 2–0 victory. The playing pitch and facilities at Downing Stadium were in dreadful condition though and as the team's popularity grew they too left for Yankee Stadium, and then Giants Stadium. The stadium was demolished in 2002 {{to make way for}} the $45million, 4,754-seat Icahn Stadium, which includes an Olympic-standard 400-meter <b>running</b> <b>track</b> and, as part of Pele's and the Cosmos' legacy, includes a FIFA-approved floodlit soccer stadium that hosts matches between the 48 youth teams of a Manhattan soccer club.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{rebuilding}} of the venue took place {{ahead of the}} 1962 season, when the wooden stands were torn and replaced with concrete stands on both long sides. On the south side, a wave-shaped roof was built; originally designed to be self-supporting, the contractor, Reinertsen, did not trust their own calculations and made a last-minute decision to install support columns. The new stands were taken into use on 3 May 1962. Floodlighting was installed in 1968 to allow UEFA club tournament matches {{to be held at}} the venue. An all-weather <b>running</b> <b>track</b> was subsequently also laid. On 1 December 1988, Lerkendal Station opened, allowing train passengers a short walk to the stadium. In 1994, the first pitch with Desso GrassMaster was laid.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{ground-level}} island platforms serving four tracks. A siding between the <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> is located {{to the west}} of the station for services terminating and reversing at Kiyose.|$|R
50|$|A siding {{exists between}} the <b>running</b> <b>tracks</b> west of the station for use by trains {{terminating}} at Hōya. Stabling tracks also exist north of the line {{to the west of}} the station.|$|R
