500|$|Null (or NULL) is {{a special}} marker used in Structured Query Language to {{indicate}} that a data value {{does not exist in}} the database. [...] Introduced by the creator of the relational database model, E. F. Codd, SQL Null serves to fulfil the requirement that all true relational database management systems (RDBMS) support a representation of [...] "missing information and inapplicable information". [...] Codd also introduced the use of the lowercase Greek omega (Ï‰) symbol to represent Null in database theory. [...] In SQL, NULL is a <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b> used to identify this marker.|$|E
500|$|If the {{developer}} creates {{a copy of}} an object using the <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b> clone, the Zend engine will check whether a __clone (...) method has been defined. If not, it will call a default __clone (...) which will copy the object's properties. If a __clone (...) method is defined, {{then it will be}} responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value [...] of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.|$|E

5000|$|In general <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> and {{keywords}} {{need not}} coincide, {{but in most}} modern languages keywords are a subset of <b>reserved</b> <b>words,</b> as this makes parsing easier, since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers. In some languages, like C or Python, <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> and keywords coincide, while in other languages, like Java, all keywords are <b>reserved</b> <b>words,</b> but some <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> are not keywords - these are [...] "reserved for future use". In yet other languages, such as the older languages ALGOL, FORTRAN and PL/I, there are keywords but no <b>reserved</b> <b>words,</b> with keywords being distinguished from identifiers by other means. This makes parsing more difficult with look-ahead parsers necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Definition of <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> in a {{language}} raises problems. The language {{may be difficult for}} new users to learn because of a long list of <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> to memorize which can't be used as identifiers. It may be difficult to extend the language because addition of <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, [...] "overloading" [...] of existing <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> with new meanings can be confusing. Porting programs can be problematic because a <b>word</b> not <b>reserved</b> by one system/compiler might be reserved by another.|$|R
5000|$|At any turn {{a player}} is {{expected}} to have one or more [...] "reserve words" [...] in mind which could be formed from the exact word-stem in play. If the letters in play were [...] "MICAB", for example, valid <b>reserve</b> <b>words</b> would include [...] "AMICABLE" [...] and [...] "AMICABILITY". However, a player can opt to bluff on their turn - that is, they can add a letter to the word-stem without actually having a <b>reserve</b> <b>word</b> in mind. Bluffing is almost always done as a last resort, though some players may use bluffs strategically to force their opponents into untenable positions. If a player feels their opponent has played a bluff and has no <b>reserve</b> <b>word</b> in mind, they may lodge a challenge at any time before the next turn is played. The recipient of the challenge must then provide a valid <b>reserve</b> <b>word</b> which contains the word-stem in play. If they are able to do so, the challenged player wins the game. If they can not provide a <b>reserve</b> <b>word,</b> the challenger wins the game.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{computer}} language, a <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b> (also {{known as a}} reserved identifier) {{is a word that}} cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label - it is [...] "reserved from use".

5000|$|While modern {{languages}} generally use <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> {{rather than}} stropping to distinguish keywords from identifiers - e.g., making [...] reserved - they also frequently reserve a syntactic class of identifiers as keywords, yielding representations {{which can be}} interpreted as a stropping regime, but instead have the semantics of <b>reserved</b> <b>words.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{second major}} example {{is in many}} {{implementations}} of Structured Query Language. In those languages <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> {{can be used as}} column, table, or variable names by lexically delimiting them. The exact mechanism varies by implementation; MySQL, for example, allows <b>reserved</b> <b>words</b> to be used in other contexts by enclosing them in backticks.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b> is {{one that}} [...] "looks like" [...] a normal word, but {{is not allowed to}} be used as a normal word. Formally this means that it {{satisfies}} the usual lexical syntax (syntax of words) of identifiers - for example, being a sequence of letters - but cannot be used where identifiers are used.

50|$|Most of the {{recently}} reserved words begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter, because identifiers of that form were previously reserved by the C standard for use only by implementations. Since existing program source code {{should not have been}} using these identifiers, it would not be affected when C implementations started supporting these extensions to the programming language. Some standard headers do define more convenient synonyms for underscored identifiers. The language previously included a <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b> called , but this was seldom implemented, and has now been removed as a <b>reserved</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Making {{keywords}} {{be reserved}} words makes lexing easier, as {{a string of}} characters will unambiguously be either a keyword or an identifier, without depending on context; thus keywords are usually a subset of reserved words. However, reserved words need not be keywords - for example, in Java, [...] is a <b>reserved</b> <b>word,</b> but has no meaning and {{does not appear in}} any production rules in the grammar. This is usually done for forward compatibility, so a <b>reserved</b> <b>word</b> may become a keyword in a future version without breaking existing programs.|$|E

E.g. by quoting them or by prefixing them by a special character. As a consequence, keywords are not <b>reserved</b> <b>words,</b> and thus the same word {{can be used for}} as a normal identifier. However, one stropping regime was to not strope the keywords, and instead have them simply be <b>reserved</b> <b>words.</b>|$|R
