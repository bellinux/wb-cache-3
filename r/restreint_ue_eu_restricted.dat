40|$|This paper {{analyses}} intra-industry {{trade in}} the new member States {{and its impact on}} the convergence process. The paper investigates the development of intra-industry trade (IIT) of the NMS with major partners between 2000 - 2007. IIT is separated into horizontal and vertical components on the basis of differences in unit values. We have found that although inter-industry trade still accounts for almost 50 % of the EU- 10 countries’ trade, its share has been declining to the benefit of IIT shares (except for Malta). IIT accelerated in the post-accession period. In 2007, Slovenia and the Czech Republic recorded the highest IIT indices. Intra-industry trade of the EU- 10 + 2 has been dominated by vertical-IIT, usually by low-quality VIIT. However, in almost all NMS, the share of high-quality vertical-IIT, as well as of horizontal-IIT in total trade increased. Thus, the pattern of NMS’ trade specialization has improved. Growing shares of IIT, in that of HIIT, reflect increasing similarities between EU- 10 and the EU- 15 and the convergence process of the NMS vis-à-vis EU- 15 countries. In the automotive sector, the IIT indices were – generally – higher than in total trade, meaning deeper specialization. This phenomenon can be largely attributed to the high FDI penetration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the economic evaluation of the impact on the MERCOSUR countries of the outcomes of three simultaneous negotiations: the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the free trade agreement with the European Union (EU) and the multilateral negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO). A quantitative evaluation has been done implementing different simulations with a multi country CGE Model, which include the four MERCOSUR partners. The paper concludes that the welfare impact on the MERCOSUR of these negotiations would be rather small and positive, except in the FTAA scenario where negative results are found for Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. When the negotiations do not include the agricultural sector, the results become negative in most scenarios. The most significant effects of the negotiations would be an increase in trade and a reorientation in favor of the new partners, with detriment for intra- MERCOSUR trade. The difference between the trade effects in a full or a restricted agreement is remarkable for Argentina and Uruguay. In all scenarios MERCOSUR would increase its specialization on agriculture and food, especially in the case of full liberalization between MERCOSUR and the <b>EU.</b> <b>Restricted</b> agreements would neither avoid production decline in some industries nor improve traditional agricultural products and food industries so much as a non-restricted agreement.

40|$|Abstract: Chromium {{conversion}} coatings {{are used}} as decorative finishes and to improve the corrosion protection and strengthen the wear resistance of metallic surfaces. Chromium electroplating frequently {{involves the use of}} hexavalent chromium (Cr). To reduce environmental impacts, several <b>EU</b> directives <b>restricted</b> its use to threshold values of 0. 1 % Cr(VI) by weight per homogenous material in vehicles, and 1000 mg kg- 1 of Cr(VI) in electronic and electrical equipment. In a view of these demands the aim of our work was to develop a selective and quantitative analytical procedure for determination of Cr(VI) in corrosion protection coatings. The results have proven that for efficient extraction of Cr(VI), 2 % NaOH + 3 % Na 2 CO 3 with addition of MgCl 2 as extraction solution and ultrasonic extraction at 70 °C for 30 min should be applied. Several consecutive extractions are necessary to quantitatively extract Cr(VI) from corrosion prevention coatings.
