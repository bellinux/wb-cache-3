40|$|The SHARAD (shallow radar) {{sounding}} radar on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detects subsurface {{reflections in}} the eastern and western parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medusae Fossae Formation (<b>MFF).</b> <b>The</b> radar waves penetrate up to 580 m <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> and detect clear subsurface interfaces in two locations: west MFF between 150 and 155 ◦ E and east MFF between 209 and 213 ◦ E. Analysis of SHARAD radargrams suggests that <b>the</b> real part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permittivity is ∼ 3. 0, which falls within <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> permittivity values inferred from MARSIS data for thicker parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF.</b> <b>The</b> SHARAD data cannot uniquely determine <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> material, but <b>the</b> low permittivity implies that the upper few hundred meters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> material has a high porosity. One possibility is that <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> is comprised <b>of</b> low-density welded or interlocked pyroclastic deposits that are capable <b>of</b> sustaining <b>the</b> steep-sided yardangs and ridges seen in imagery. The SHARAD surface echo power across <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> is low relative to typical martian plains, and completely disappears in parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east <b>MFF</b> that correspond to the radar-dark Stealth region. These areas are extremely rough at centimeter to meter scales, and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> echo power is most likely due {{to a combination of}} surface roughness and a low near-surface permittivity that reduces the echo strength from any locally flat regions. There is also no radar evidence for internal layering in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SHARAD data for <b>the</b> <b>MFF,</b> despite <b>the</b> fact that tens-of-meters scale layering is apparent in infrared and visible wavelength images of nearby areas. These interfaces may not be detected in SHARAD data if their permittivity contrasts are low, or if the layers are discontinuous. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> closely spaced internal radar reflectors suggests that <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> is not an equatorial analog to the current martian polar deposits, which show clear evidence of multiple internal layers in SHARAD dat...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] geologic origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) has remained a mystery despite three decades of research. To better constrain its formation, an in-depth analysis of observations made in the literature was combined with a new survey of over 700 Mars Orbiter Camera narrow-angle images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> to identify morphologic characteristics and material properties that define this formation as a whole. While previous work has identified clear agreement on some characteristics, our analysis identifies yardangs, collapse features, and layering as pervasive features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF.</b> Whereas collapse features and layering may implicate several different physical and chemical processes, yardangs provide vital information on material properties that inform about mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> lithology. Aspect ratios of megayardangs range from 3 : 1 to 50 : 1, and slope analyses reveal heights of up to 200 m with cliffs that are almost vertical. Other yardangs show lower aspect ratios and topographic profiles. These characteristics coupled to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> serrated margins, suggest that MFF lithology must be of weakly to heavily indurated material that lends itself to jointing. The characteristics and properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> are inconsistent with those of terrestrial pyroclastic fall deposits or loess, but are in common with large terrestrial ignimbrites, a hypothesis that explains all key observations with a single mechanism. Yardang fields developed in regionally extensive ignimbrite sheets in the central Andes display morphologic characteristics that correlate with degree <b>of</b> induration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host lithology and suggest an origin by pyroclastic flow for <b>the</b> <b>MFF...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is {{an enigmatic}} group of terrain {{features}} which dominate {{a quarter of}} equatorial Mars (extending - 5, 500 km east-west). <b>The</b> <b>MFF</b> is characterised by a discontinuous, highly eroded appearance and is inferred to comprise fine grained and friable materials. This long-standing interpretation is based on observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevalent aeolian erosional features (yardangs), This thesis aims to improve constraint <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> materials ori gins and the processes at work during and since their emplacement. The project uses a multi-scale, geomorphological approach, and uses the latest very high resolution (25 cm/pixel), and new medium resolution (6 - 12 m/pixel), high spatial coverage data and attempts to use surface characteristics to constrain <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation. This thesis describes surveys of outlying MFF materials (to infer <b>the</b> palaeo-extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF),</b> and a survey of textural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcrop materials and <b>the</b> quantitative analysis <b>of</b> yardangs. Following on from this, an evaluation of existing facies mapping (to improve understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation and evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF)</b> is discussed. A survey, and detailed study in one location, of sinuous ridge features (to evalu ate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> volatiles and fluvial transport in <b>the</b> <b>MFF)</b> is also included. The key results include a larger pre-erosional spatial extent for the formation than previously thought, wherein outliers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> are found on the Tharsis volcanic region and a hitherto unmapped uppermost "draping" unit is present. <b>The</b> existing definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geological members is found to require refinement. Furthermore, volatile content within <b>the</b> <b>MFF</b> is judged to be heterogeneous, and {{not limited to the}} oldest stratigraphic units. The evidence collated in this work is consistent with the hypothesis that the Medusae Fossae Formation is an ignimbrite deposit, comprised largely of dry (at least today), low density materials. but some MFF regions had much higher volatile content than others in the past.
