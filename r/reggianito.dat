40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the growth, {{survival}} and peptidolytic activity of Lactobacillus plantarum I 91 in a hard-cheese model {{consisting of a}} sterile extract of <b>Reggianito</b> cheese. To assess {{the influence of the}} primary starter and initial proteolysis level on these parameters, we prepared the extracts with cheeses that were produced using two different starter strains of Lactobacillus helveticus (Lh 138 or Lh 209) at three ripening times: 3, 90 and 180 days. The experimental extracts were inoculated with Lb. plantarum I 91; the control extracts were not inoculated, and the blank extracts were heat-treated to inactivate enzymes and were not inoculated. All extracts were incubated at 34 ºC for 21 days, and then the pH, microbiological counts and proteolysis profiles were determined. The basal proteolysis profiles in the extracts of young cheeses made with either strain tested were similar, but many differences between the proteolysis profiles of the extracts of the Lh 138 and Lh 209 cheeses were found when riper cheeses were used. The pH values in the blank and control extracts did not change, and no microbial growth was detected. In contrast, the pH value in experimental extracts decreased, and this decrease was more pronounced in extracts obtained from either of the young cheeses and from the Lh 209 cheese at any stage of ripening. Lb. plantarum I 91 grew up to 8 log during the first days of incubation in all of the extracts, but then the number of viable cells decreased, the extent of which depended on the starter strain and the age of the cheese used for the extract. The decrease in the counts of Lb. plantarum I 91 was observed mainly in the extracts in which the pH had diminished the most. In addition, the extracts that best supported the viability of Lb. plantarum I 91 during incubation had the highest free amino acids content. The effect of Lb. plantarum I 91 on the proteolysis profile of the extracts was marginal. Significant changes in the content of free amino acids suggested that the catabolism of free amino acids by Lb. plantarum I 91 prevailed in a weakly proteolysed medium, whereas the release of amino acids due to peptidolysis overcame their catabolism in a medium with high levels of free amino acids. Lb. plantarum I 91 was able to use energy sources other than lactose to support its growth because equivalent numbers of cells were observed in extracts containing residual amounts of lactose and in lactose-depleted extracts. The contribution of Lb. plantarum I 91 to hard-cooked cheese peptidolysis was negligible compared to that of the starter strain; however, its ability to transform amino acids is a promising feature of this strain.
