This enables the reduction of the maximum stress (Mises stress) to be less than the fatigue strength.

30|$|For an {{axial piston}} pump, the valve plate {{is the main}} {{component}} affecting the noise generation, especially the transition regions between the outlet and inlet ports. In many industrial applications, the pressure relief grooves are machined in the transition regions to smooth the piston chamber pressure. It is desirable to find the optimum type of pressure <b>relief</b> <b>groove</b> of those that can be manufactured. The effects {{of different types of}} cross-sectional grooves on the piston chamber pressure were investigated, and the results showed that a steeply sloping triangular cross-sectional groove was the optimal design to reduce the pressure overshoot in the piston chamber [6]. Three different types of slot geometries were compared considering their effects on the pressure transient in the piston chamber, and the results indicated that the quadratic varying slot geometry had no clear advantages compared with the constant and linearly varying slot geometries [7]. In addition to the type of pressure <b>relief</b> <b>groove,</b> the groove volume, slope and angular extent of the pressure <b>relief</b> <b>groove</b> also have great effects on the pressure ripple [8]. The optimal match between the pre-compression angle and cylinder-kidney angle was determined based on a parametric analysis at one particular operating pressure level to maximize the outlet flow rate and minimize the pressure ripple [9]. The valve plate parameters were found to affect the volumetric efficiency, fluid-borne noise sources, structure-borne noise sources and control characteristics of an axial piston pump [10, 11], and a multi-objective optimization method using genetic algorithm was proposed to optimize the parameters of valve plate [12 – 14]. The valve plate’s effect on the volumetric efficiency and pressure pulsations of an asymmetric axial piston pump was investigated [15], and the valve plate was designed for a dual-acting axial piston pump [16].|$|E

The specimen is {{used to assess the}} strength of a thin adhesive layer, as usually occurs in structural bonded joints. Hence, this configuration overcomes the problems related to the differences in chemical and mechanical properties which could occur in bulk adhesive tests. The aim is to verify experimentally the reduction of the stress concentrations at the interface given by the presence of the grooves, observed in a previous numerical work of the authors. Finite element analyses show that the groove geometry adopted here, although slightly simplified with respectto the optimum shape previously proposed, produces a strong reduction of the edge effects. This work performs an indirect assessment by comparing tensile strength of bonded specimens with and without <b>relief</b> <b>grooves.</b> A two-level factorial experimental campaign is performed, according to Design of Experiment criteria. The variables are: presence of the grooves, adherends material, and adhesive thickness. The response of the tests is the maximum tensileload carried by the specimen which is found to depend strongly on the adherends’ materials. In the case of steel joints, the <b>relief</b> <b>grooves</b> near the adherend-adhesive interface lead to higher loads regardless of the adhesive thickness.

40|$|Noise is a {{well-known}} challenge in hydraulic systems and hydrostatic pumps {{are one of the}} largest noise contributors in a hydraulic system. The existing noise reduction features, such as pressure <b>relief</b> <b>groove</b> and pre-compression filter volume, are more or less dependent on the working condition. It is essential to know the amount of free air when designing a quiet pump; however, it is not evident how much free air the oil contains. The free air content is different if the suction port is boost pressured or self-priming. The amount of free air in a well-designed system can be as low as 0. 5 % while in others up to 10 %.

The model includes the main important phenomena involved in the pump operation {{and it has been}} validated on the basis of experimental data. In this research, an original optimization process has been applied to such a hybrid model {{in order to reduce the}} pump vibration level, i. e. the acceleration of the external casing.

The different methodologies are compared in terms of time efficiency and accuracy in the solution.

It is referred to the metal casing in which a number of gears are sealed. Pivot pin fitted in lever of gearbox which is used for engaging the gears in gearbox.

40|$|There are {{two main}} design issues in digital {{prototyping}} of swash plate type axial piston machines. First, {{the design of the}} rotating group with its lubricating interfaces is critical to the operation of the swash plate type axial machine. Swash plate type axial piston machines have three main lubricating interfaces - the Piston/Cylinder, the Cylinder block/Valve plate, and the Slipper/Swash plate interface. These lubricating interfaces fulfill simultaneously a bearing and sealing function. The three interfaces represent the most critical design issue within the design process of the swash plate type axial piston machine because these interfaces determine the performance and reliability of the machine and are the main source of energy dissipation. Ivantysynova and her research group (2001, 2002, 2005, 2010, and 2012) have developed fully coupled fluid structure interaction models based on non-isothermal flow through the lubricating gap for the three lubricating interfaces of swash plate type axial piston machines. The models consider the macro and micro motion of movable parts such as the piston, slipper, and cylinder block as well as the deformation of solid bodies due to pressure and temperature for all three interfaces. These models were developed separately for each interface. However, viscous friction forces generated in one interface are transferred to other interfaces, i. e. the friction force generated between piston and cylinder will load the cylinder block and therefore must be considered when calculating the cylinder block valve plate interface. Also, the friction force generated in the gap between the slipper and swash plate will act on the piston/slipper assembly and therefore must be considered when balancing forces acting on the piston. ^ The second design issue involves the valve plate design in the swash plate type axial piston machine. The valve plate is a non-rotating component in the axial piston machine that is located adjacent to the cylinder block. The valve plate connects the pump ports to the individual cylinder chambers. Proper valve plate design is essential for the high performance axial piston machine because the valve plate regulates the displacement chamber pressure profile in the axial piston machine. The pressure profile in the displacement chamber is important in regards to the axial piston machine operation because the pressure profile has a very significant influence on the resulting fluid film of each of the three interfaces, on moments acting on the swash plate, and flow ripple in the low/high pressure ports. The pressure in the displacement chamber transforms to the primary force acting on the piston/cylinder, cylinder block/valve plate, and slipper/swash plate interface. Because of the time dependent change of pressure in each cylinder chamber the resulting forces and moments are pulsating. In addition, the force acting on the slipper/swash plate transforms to the moments acting on the swash plate, which influence the controllability of the swash plate angle. The pulsating forces and moments acting on the swash plate not only have an influence on the controllability of the swash plate angle, but also represent one of the main sources of noise generated in the axial piston machine. The moment acting on the swash plate oscillates the swash plate and the end case simultaneously, which in the end results in audible noise. This noise source {{is often referred to as}} structure-borne noise (SBN). The other noise source, fluid-borne noise (FBN), is also related to the valve plate because FBN results mainly from flow ripple in the low/high pressure port. Flow ripple in the low/high pressure port is affected by the number of pistons of the axial piston machine, but it also has a strong relationship with the displacement chamber pressure. Therefore, the valve plate design significantly influences both SBN and FBN. And for this reason, much valve plate design research has been conducted in order to reduce noise in the axial piston machine. There are two types of valve plate noise reduction techniques: passive and active noise reduction technique. Of these two noise reduction techniques, the passive noise reduction technique has the advantage that it does not require any additional power source or system. However, this technique has the disadvantage that it is not effective for a wide range of operating conditions. <b>Relief</b> <b>groove,</b> pre-compression filter volume (PCFV), and cross port are examples of passive noise reduction techniques. In order to study these phenomena more accurately, Seeniraj and Ivantysynova developed a simulation tool, VpOptim, for valve plate simulation and optimization. VpOptim can be used for valve plate optimization by implementing relief grooves and the PCFV in the valve plate. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis is concerned with analytical, numerical and experimental studies {{of the effect of}} cold rolling on the fatigue behaviour of threaded drillstring connections. A comprehensive literature study is made of the various effects on the fatigue behaviour of residual stresses introduced by mechanical deformation of notched components. Some of the effects studied are cyclic hardening behaviour after prestraining, cyclic creep, fatigue initiation in prestrained materials, short cracks and crack growth models including crack closure. Residual stresses were introduced in the surface of a smooth pipe by a rolling device to simulate a cold rolling process and verify the calculated residual stresses by measurements. Strain hardening and contact algorithm of the two bodies were incorporated in the FE analyses. Two significant errors were found in the commercial software package for residual stress evaluation, Restan v. 3. 3. 2 a also called SINT, when using the Schajer method. The Schajer algorithm is the only hole-drilling algorithm without theoretical shortcomings, and is recommended when measuring large residual stress gradients in the depth directions. Using the Schajer method solved by in-house Matlab-routines good agreement between measured residual stress gradients and residual stress gradients from FE analyses was found. Full scale fatigue tests were performed on pipes cut used drillstrings with notches of similar geometry as threads used in drillstring connections. The simulated threads consisted of four full depth helix notches with runouts at the surface. The pipe threads were cold rolled and fatigue tested in a full-scale four-point rotating bending fatigue testing rig. The test results showed that cold rolling had an effect on the crack initiating period. A major part of the fatigue life was with cracks observed at the notch root, but due to the increased fatigue crack propagation resistance the final fracture initiated at pits inside the pipe. Therefor, an optimisation of the roll geometry and rolling parameters was not possible. However, a significant fatigue life improvement was achieved. Based on experiments, a roller with similar profile as the thread root is recommended. A rolling force of maximum 20 KN is recommended to minimise the possibility of damaging the thread profile. Shallow cracks were observed typically when 5 % of the fatigue life had expired. Re-rolling after 50 % of expected improved fatigue life, when also short cracks were observed in the notch roots further increased the fatigue improvements. Pretensioned small steel specimens with a notch were used to simulate cold rolled threats. The specimens were fatigue tested in tension with minimum load close to zero. Pretensioning increased the fatigue life form approximately 50 000 cycles to an infinite number of cycles. In these test non-propagating cracks of typically 0. 4 mm length were found. The benefit from pretensioning gradually disappeared with increasing mean stress. FE analyses indicated that an almost instant relaxation of residual stresses to a level with no monotonic strain hardening from preloading would take place when cycled to moderate mean stress. Cycled at low mean stress, an instant relaxation of the surface layer was found in analysis. All observations from notched pretensioned fatigue specimens were in good agreement with the available literature. However, preloading was found to be strain rate dependent in tests where a pretension load held for 2 minutes gave a longer fatigue life than a sinusoidal loading-unloading cycle performed over a one minute interval. Strain hardening was found not contributing to the fatigue life improvement, whereas the polishing effect from improved surface quality after cold rolling increased the fatigue initiation period. However, residual stress and subsequent early crack closure was the dominating effect at moderate cyclic mean loads. The material data required to perform FE fatigue simulation studies of a full threaded cold rolled coupling incorporating make-up torque, include cyclic stress strain behaviour at various amplitudes and mean stress caused by various degrees of prestraining. Such data are not readily available today, and are only possible to obtain in carefully planned and executed experiments. Also, 3 D FE model required for cold rolling analysis is extremely CPU time consuming. Consequently, cold rolling simulations could not be successfully implemented in this work. One of the main conclusions from this work is that drillstring connections will respond differently to thread rolling at the pin or box. A significant improvement in the fatigue life of box threads from residual stresses is expected mainly from increased resistance to crack propagation. However, the compressive residual stress is sensitive to overloading in compression, and the improvement from residual stress depends strongly on the mean stress (or R-ratio). At values of R of approximately 0. 6 or higher the beneficial of rolling therefore tends to disappear. At the critical locations of the pin, which are the last engaged thread or the stress <b>relief</b> <b>groove,</b> the effect of residual stresses introduced by rolling is therefore likely to be severely reduced by the high mean stress imposed during make-up of the connection. However, a beneficial effect of rolling is expected to remain due to improved surface condition and due to a possible effect of strain hardening. The net results of these factors on the fatigue performance of actual drillstrings can only be determined in full scale rotating bending tests. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The potential is used to determine the associated 3 -D stress-strain relationship in the form of hereditary viscoelastic integrals.

The valve plate utilizing damping holes show excellent performance in avoiding air-release and cavitation. This study aims to reduce the noise emitted from an axial piston pump using a novel valve plate utilizing damping holes. A dynamic pump model is developed, in which the fluid properties are carefully modeled to capture the phenomena of air release and cavitation. The causes of different noise sources are investigated using the model. A comprehensive parametric analysis is conducted to enhance {{the understanding of the}} effects of the valve plate parameters on the noise sources. A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization method is proposed to optimize the parameters of valve plate. The amplitudes of the swash plate moment and flow rates in the inlet and outlet ports are defined as the objective functions. The pressure overshoot and undershoot in the piston chamber are limited by properly constraining the highest and lowest pressure values. A comparison of the various noise sources between the original and optimized designs over a wide range of pressure levels shows that the noise sources are reduced at high pressures. The results of the sound pressure level measurements show that the optimized valve plate reduces the noise level by 1.6  dB(A) at the rated working condition. The proposed method is effective in reducing the noise of axial piston pumps and contributes to the development of quieter axial piston machines.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of {{cavitation}} processes occurring in a gear pump with an external involute gear during the transportation of Newtonian fluids, determining the conditions for their appearance and studying the effect on their intensity of pump operating conditions in order to select the rational operating parameters of the equipment and improve the efficiency of the pump. For research purposes, an experimental booth designed for the study of hydraulic machines has been developed to measure the instantaneous values of pressure in the suction and inlet lines, as well as to conduct high-speed video recording of processes that occur 22 when using hydromachines. The video camera used in the study allows you to make up to 10, 000 frames per second, which made it possible to examine in detail the processes that occur during the pump operation. There was developed and created a physical model of a gear pump, and fluid flows in its internal channels were visualized, which allowed confirming the occurrence of cavitation in the trapped volume of a gear pump. The process is considered in detail and the places where cavitation phenomena appear in cavities of a gear pump are determined. As a result of rheological research, the rheological characteristics of the working fluid, HDZ 46 oils were obtained, it was determined that oils used as working fluids in the range of temperatures under consideration (+ 17 ?C [...] . + 50 ?C) behave like Newtonian fluids. A study was made of pressure pulsations in the pump lines, taking into account which a mathematical model was proposed for determining the velocity distribution along the pipeline section and the magnitude of the shear stresses. It was found that the velocities and shear stress in the flow that occurs under pressure that changes harmonically have a complicated form and varies over time. This should be taken into account in determining the hydraulic losses in the system. In the study of pressure pulsations, it was found that when changing the pressure in the suction line, the form of pressure pulsations in the injection line changes. Thus, at overpressure in the suction line pits appear in the ripple curve in comparison with the case when the pressure in the suction line is equal to the atmospheric pressure. And when pressure is reduced in the suction line to negative values, the curve of the pulsations of pressure is close to the pollen, with the gradual increase in pressure to the maximum value. The impact of the pump operating parameters on the intensity of cavitation phenomena that arise in the trapped volume during the operation was investigated. It was revealed that with increasing pressure in the suction chamber, the intensity of cavitation decreases. The intensity of the cavitation increases with the increase in the speed of gears and when the temperature of the working fluid increases, that is, when it decreases its viscosity. These studies allow you to develop recommendations for choosing pump parameters. The efficiency of the application of <b>relief</b> <b>grooves</b> was studied with the aim of reducing the intensity of cavitation phenomena. It has been found that existing grooves reduce the intensity of cavitation phenomena in the closed volume and suction chamber, but do not completely eliminate them. Based on the data of the visualization of the pump operation, a new shape of <b>relief</b> <b>grooves</b> is proposed, which enable to reduce the intensity of cavitation phenomena and provide, in comparison with the studied grooves, fewer leakages of the working fluid, increasing the efficiency of the pump. The method of influence on the intensity of cavitation phenomena by the influence of a magnetic field on a fluid pumped by a pump is proposed, in the case where the fluid is electrically conductive. Due to the action of the Lorentz forces, the extinction of vortices and cavitation phenomena occurs. ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????, ???????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????????? ???????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ???????? ??????? ?? ?? ????????????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ? ????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????. ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ? ??? ?????????? ???????, ??? ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ???????????? ??????. ???????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ????? ????????? ????????????? ??????? ? ???????? ???????????? ??????. ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ??????, ? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ? ???????? ??????????? ??????????. ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????. ?? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????...|$|R
40|$|In many {{positive}} displacement machines for high pressure hydraulic applications, the transitions of the displacement chamber {{from the inlet}} and outlet ports is realized through appropriate grooves. These grooves limit undesirable effects due to fluid compressibility such as: the instantaneous pressure peaks or localized cavitation inside the displacement chamber and the increment of port flow fluctuations. These effects result in instabilities and noise emission in these machines. Since the reduction of abovementioned effects is often achieved by a groove design that introduces a certain crossflow between the outlet and the inlet ports, volumetric efficiency is another important parameter {{to be considered in}} the design of such grooves. Typical examples of these grooves are those machined on the valve plate of axial piston machines (often referred as “silencing grooves” or “relief grooves”) or those present on the lateral bushings of external gear machines. The design of these grooves is often performed by the pump or motor manufacturers through empirical or simplified numerical procedures; and a well-established design procedure is not existing. This research presents an effort in formulating and establishing a design procedure to automatically determine the optimal designs of the grooves present on the lateral bushings of the external gear machine units. The optimization of the porting grooves is carried out in two steps, in the first step, optimal area of the connections in meshing region that connects the TSV to the porting grooves is determined; in the second step, a groove morphology is realized which can trace similar area of the connections obtained from step one. The proposed procedure has the important feature of not assuming a certain geometric morphology of the grooves. The proposed procedure does not assume a certain geometric morphology of the grooves, and it solves the multi-objective optimization problem of finding the best designs to simultaneously: 1) minimize flow fluctuations,; 2) minimize internal pressure peaks,; 3) minimize localized cavitation onset and; 4) maximize volumetric efficiency. This design procedure is implemented to optimize the <b>relief</b> <b>grooves</b> of one of the commercial external gear pump and comparisons of important pump performance features have been made.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for fabricating gratings on flat substrates, and then reproducing the groove pattern on a curved (concave or convex) substrate and a corresponding grating device. First, surface <b>relief</b> diffraction grating <b>grooves</b> are formed on flat substrates. For example, they may be fabricated using photolithography and reactive ion etching, maskless lithography, holography, or mechanical ruling. Then, an imprint of the grating is made on a deformable substrate, such as plastic, polymer, or other materials using thermoforming, hot or cold embossing, or other methods. Interim stamps using electroforming, or other methods, may be produced for the imprinting process or if the same polarity of the grating image is required. The imprinted, deformable substrate is then attached to a curved, rigid substrate using epoxy or other suitable adhesives. The imprinted surface is facing away from the curved rigid substrate. As an alternative fabrication method, after grating is imprinted on the deformable substrate as described above, the grating may be coated with thin conformal conductive layer (for example, using vacuum deposition of gold). Then the membrane may be mounted over an opening in a pressured vessel {{in a manner of}} a membrane on a drum, grating side out. The pressure inside of the vessel may be changed with respect to the ambient pressure to produce concave or convex membrane surface. The shape of the opening may control the type of the surface curvature (for example, a circular opening would create spherical surface, oval opening would create toroidal surface, etc.). After that, well-known electroforming methods may be used to create a replica of the grating on the concave or convex membrane. For example, the pressure vessel assembly may be submerged into an electro-forming solution and negative electric potential applied to the metal coated membrane using an insulated wire. Positive electric potential may be then applied to a nickel or other metal plate submerged into the same solution. Metal ions would transfer from the plate through the solution into the membrane, producing high fidelity metal replica of the grating on the membrane. In one variation, an adhesive may be deposited on the deformable substrate, and then cured without touching the rigid, curved substrate. Edges of the deformable substrate may be attached to the rigid substrate to ensure uniform deformation of the deformable substrate. The assembly may be performed in vacuum, and then taken out to atmospheric pressure conditions to ensure that no air is trapped between the deformable and rigid substrates. Alternatively, a rigid surface with complementary curvature to the rigid substrate may be used to ensure uniform adhesion of the deformable substrate to the rigid substrate. Liquid may be applied {{to the surface of the}} deformable substrate to uniformly distribute pressure across its surface during the curing or hardening of the adhesive, or the film may be pressed into the surface using a deformable object or surface. After the attachment is complete, the grooves may be coated with reflective or dielectric layers to improve diffraction efficiency...|$|R
