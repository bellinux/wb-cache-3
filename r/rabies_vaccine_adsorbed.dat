40|$|These {{recommendations}} of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) update the previous recommendations on human rabies prevention (CDC. Human rabies prevention [...] -United States, 1999 : {{recommendations of}} the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR 1999; 48 [No. RR- 1]) and reflect the status of rabies and antirabies biologics in the United States. This statement 1) provides updated information on human and animal rabies epidemiology; 2) summarizes the evidence regarding the effectiveness/efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of rabies biologics; 3) presents new information on the cost-effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis; 4) presents recommendations for rabies postexposure and pre-exposure prophylaxis; and 5) presents information regarding treatment considerations for human rabies patients. These recommendations involve no substantial changes to the recommended approach for rabies postexposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis. ACIP recommends that prophylaxis {{for the prevention of}} rabies in humans exposed to rabies virus should include prompt and thorough wound cleansing followed by passive rabies immunization with human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccination with a cell culture rabies vaccine. For persons who have never been vaccinated against rabies, postexposure antirabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody (HRIG) and vaccine (human diploid cell vaccine [HDCV] or purified chick embryo cell vaccine [PCECV]). Persons who have ever previously received complete vaccination regimens (pre-exposure or postexposure) with a cell culture vaccine or persons who have been vaccinated with other types of vaccines and have previously had a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer should receive only 2 doses of vaccine: one on day 0 (as soon as the exposure is recognized and administration of vaccine can be arranged) and the second on day 3. HRIG is administered only once (i. e., at the beginning of antirabies prophylaxis) to previously unvaccinated persons to provide immediate, passive, rabies virus neutralizing antibody coverage until the patient responds to HDCV or PCECV by actively producing antibodies. A regimen of 5 1 -mL doses of HDCV or PCECV should be administered intramuscularly to previously unvaccinated persons. The first dose of the 5 -dose course should be administered as soon as possible after exposure (day 0). Additional doses should then be administered on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after the first vaccination. Rabies pre-exposure vaccination should include three 1. 0 -mL injections of HDCV or PCECV administered intramuscularly (one injection per day on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28). Modifications were made to the language of the guidelines to clarify the recommendations and better specify the situations in which rabies post- and pre-exposure prophylaxis should be administered. No new rabies biologics are presented, and no changes were made to the vaccination schedules. However, <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>adsorbed</b> (RVA, Bioport Corporation) is no longer available for rabies postexposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis, and intradermal pre-exposure prophylaxis is no longer recommended because it is not available in the United States.

40|$|Potency {{testing of}} most human and {{veterinary}} <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccines</b> requires vaccination of mice {{followed by a}} challenge test using an intracerebral injection of live rabies virus. The National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM), the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), and their international partners organized an international workshop to review the availability and validation status of alternative methods that might reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals for <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> potency testing, and to identify priority research and development efforts necessary to further advance alternative methods. Workshop participants agreed that <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> potency testing using the mouse challenge test should use general anesthesia for intracerebral virus injections, and that humane endpoints should be used routinely {{as the basis for}} euthanizing animals to minimize pain and distress. Workshop participants recommended that a near term priority should be to replace the mouse challenge with a test validated to ensure potency, such as the mouse antibody serum neutralization test (SNT) for adjuvanted veterinary <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccines</b> for which an international collaborative study was recently completed. The workshop recommended that an in vitro antigen quantification test should be a high priority for product-specific validation of non-adjuvanted human and veterinary <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Finally, workshop participants recommended greater international cooperation to expedite development, validation, regulatory acceptance, and implementation of alternative test methods for <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccine</b> potency testing.

The postexposure use of vaccine was evaluated in 301 individuals, 97 of whom had been bitten by proven rabid animals. None of the individuals contracted rabies during the observation period. After several years of field trials with both pre- and postexposure vaccines, the evidence indicates that the PHKC <b>rabies</b> <b>vaccines</b> are effective and safe for human use. Rabies is a terrifying illness ending invariably in death. Fortunately, a prophylactic nervous tissue vaccine was introduced by Louis Pasteur.
