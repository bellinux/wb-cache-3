40|$|In {{light of}} use by airline unions of partial-strike tactics, such as concerted <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> <b>bid</b> for {{overtime}} work and so-called "CHAOS" tactics involving unannounced <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> fly after passengers have been ticketed and {{are ready to}} board, the authors examine whether the Railway Labor Act (RLA) should be interpreted to permit employers to discipline employees for engaging in such tactics, or whether these are a protected form of economic pressure. Although in many respects bargaining duties and economic weapons under the RLA are read consonant with precedents under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (which governs all industries other than rail and air transport), {{there are a few}} decisions suggesting that during the period when self-help may be resorted to, employees can engage in partial strike activities as long as they violate no court order but are subject to permanent replacement in limited circumstances. These decisions, the authors submit, fail to take account of Supreme Court decsions since the 1930 s that some economic pressures by unions, such as slowdowns and sit-ins, may not violate the labor laws but nor are they protected by those laws so as to immunize partial strikers from employer discipline. These decisions are not based on unique features of the NLRA. Rather, they give recognition to the background assumptions of Congress that employers may act to protect their property interests {{as long as they do}} not run afoul of NLRA or RLA protections and that employees who engage in partial-strike activities are subject to employer discipline even where not strictly necessary to maintain operations. Moreover, these tactics skew the bargaining process by giving employees an essentially risk-free gambit to pressure their economic position through planned disruption of carrier operations. ...|$|R

Key words: auction, concession, National Park Service, right of first refusal. Soggy hamburgers, dirty bathrooms, cold showers, and poor postcard selection have been only a few of the complaints raised against National Park concessioners. Visitors have voiced such annoyance with poor conces-sion service for decades. The Park Service re-cently changed the method to award the largest revenue-generating concession contracts in hopes of increasing the level of service. This work compares two auctions used to allocate concession rights to determine which leads to contracts with higher service included. Since its creation in 1916, the National Park Service has been attempting to balance its dual objectives of promoting the use and con-serving the sites under its charge. Currently, the Park Service administrates over 83 million acres of land. These lands comprise 379 sites in 49 states (none in Delaware), the District of Columbia, and many U.

40|$|This case-study investigates {{whether it}} is valid {{to argue that the}} museological {{practices}} of the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), as manifested in the exhibition The Peranakan Legacy (1999 – 2006) and in the subsequent Peranakan museum (2008 to present), are limited to projecting officially endorsed storylines, or whether the museum has been able to portray multiple stories about the Peranakan community and their material culture. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s theoretical framework, the study considers the genesis and context of the ACM within the social structures in which it operates. This approach allows for consideration of the generative reproduction of Singapore’s colonial structures, such as the prevailing doxa on race, manifested in the organising principle of the ACM’s Empress Place Museum with its racially defined galleries addressing Chinese, Malay/Islamic and Indian ancestral cultures. Analysing the ACM as a field in which the curatorial team (informed by their habitus) in combination with various forms of capital are at play, exposes the relationships between macro structures (state policy and economic drivers) and the micro operations (day-to-day decisions of the curatorial team at work on Peranakan exhibitions). Through this analysis the study argues that the Peranakans’ <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> support Singapore’s <b>bid</b> <b>to</b> join the Malay Federation resulted in their political and cultural marginalization. However, the Peranakan community’s legacy, consisting of unique, internationally prized material artefacts, presented ACM museum professionals with a compelling case to promote the community in this state-run museum. The study asserts that through these ACM exhibitions ACM museum professionals effectively repositioned the once disgraced Peranakan community in multiple ways: tentatively as an invaluable aspect of Singapore national cultural capital, as a galvanising symbol to encourage greater harmony between Singapore’s distinct racial groups and confidently as the source of a depoliticized collection of aesthetic artefacts within a newly defined canon of Southeast Asian art...|$|R

40|$|Unilateral <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license {{intellectual}} property rights are almost never antitrust violations, as is true of most unilateral <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal. Concerted <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal are treated more harshly under the antitrust laws because they can facilitate collusion or, {{in the case of}} technology, keep superior products or processes off the market. In its en banc Princo decision a divided Federal Circuit debated whether Congress had protected concerted <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license from claims of patent misuse. The majority rejected the dissent’s argument that Congress had no such intent and then went on to hold that an alleged concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license was not misuse. This conclusion is troublesome because in its Independent Ink decision the Supreme Court virtually equated the scope of antitrust liability with the scope of misuse as defined by § 271 (d). Broad legality for concerted <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license patents, and unused patents in particular, has serious implications for competition and innovation. A concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license a factory or other productive asset can facilitate collusion by denying resources to rivals unless they can find alternative sources of supply. A concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license an unused patent can go much further. Not only does it deny rivals that particular technology but it also prevents them from developing any technology independently that would infringe one or more of that patent’s claims. Of course, not every concerted <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> license should be unlawful per se. In antitrust, they are appropriately covered by the ancillary restraints doctrine. Naked agreements not to license are unlawful per se, while <b>refusals</b> reasonably necessary <b>to</b> further joint research or production would be unlawful only if market power and anticompetitive effects were proven. By contrast, reading § 271 (d) of the Patent Act to authorize all concerted <b>refusals</b> is likely <b>to</b> harm both competition and the incentive to innovate...|$|R

40|$|The Master of law {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of the EU and Finnish competition law. The thesis evaluates whether <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> supply constitutes abuse of dominant position under the EU and Finnish competition law regimes. The notion of freedom to contract is also noted when evaluating the research question. Moreover, particular attention is given for objective justifications for the general prohibition of <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> supply. Objective justifications mean that a dominant company may be exempted from the general prohibition of <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> supply {{in accordance with the}} competition law. The Master of law thesis gives a general view of how dominance is evaluated under the EU and Finnish competition laws. Moreover, abuse of dominance is analysed through the selected case-law examples under both legal systems. Without dominance no abuse can exist under competition law. In depth analysis is given for evaluating the <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> supply through relevant case-law under the EU and Finnish competition laws. Evaluation is focused on giving examples when <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> supply has been found prohibited as abuse of dominant position and which similarities exist between the European Union and Finnish competition laws regarding <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> supply. Attention is also made for exemptions to the general prohibition of <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> supply by dominant companies.

Someone wishing to develop a digital alternative to the analog technology licensed in the Sony/Philips package would have to invent around the Lagadec patent claims even though the technology claimed in that patent is not in use."
