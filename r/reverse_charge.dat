Other than {{the length of}} the number, the {{differences}} between a 13 number and a 1300 number is that the shorter number has a higher fee for the owner of the number: there should be no difference in cost to the caller. A call to an 1800 is free when dialled from a landline. It depends on the individual mobile plan as how these numbers are charged: many plans now do not charge for 1800 but 1300 may still be charged at a high rate, or outside included calls.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>charging</b> can be {{prevented}} by a diode connected in reverse-parallel across the capacitor terminals; as a result, the current keeps flowing until the diode and the coil's resistance dissipate the field energy as heat. While this is a simple and frequently utilized solution, it requires an additional expensive high-power diode and a well-designed coil with enough thermal mass and heat dissipation capability {{in order to prevent}} component failure.|$|R

50|$|Telstra ran a <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> service called HomeLink {{during the}} 1990s and 2000s.

50|$|Unlike {{the credit}} card industry, digital gold {{currency}} issuers generally do not have services to dispute or <b>reverse</b> <b>charges.</b> So, <b>reversing</b> transactions, even {{in case of a}} legitimate error, unauthorized use, or failure of a vendor to supply goods is difficult, if not impossible. This means that using digital gold currency is more akin to a cash transaction, while PayPal transfers, for example, could be considered more similar to credit card transactions.|$|R

If he receives more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and cooperation between players is forbidden.

50|$|A {{collect call}} service {{operates}} under 800 Reverse (operated by Reverse Corp Ltd), in the Republic of Ireland. It offers <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> calls from any fixed line phone, pay phone and most mobile phones (even if the prepaid credit has run out), to most fixed land line and mobile phones in the Republic of Ireland. The company charges 2.99 euros {{to connect the}} call, including the first 60 seconds of the call and 0.593 euros for every subsequent minute.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} for collecting VAT when {{the place of}} supply {{is not in the}} same member state as the supplier is similar to that used for Intra-Community Acquisitions of goods, i.e. zero-rating by the supplier and <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> by the recipient of the services (if a taxable person). But if the recipient of the services is not a taxable person (i.e. a final consumer), the supplier must generally charge VAT at the rate applicable in its own member state.|$|E
50|$|These {{components}} form a {{basic tariff}} system but, as telecommunication advances, tariff structures become increasingly more complex. Usually {{there is the}} option of calling collect (in the UK known as <b>reversing</b> <b>charges),</b> where responsibility for charges normally paid by the caller is accepted by the recipient. Tariffs also depend on the bandwidth provided. For example, dial-up modem connections are charged at normal telephone costs, but connections such as DSL are usually charged using a completely different accounting system due to their always on nature.|$|R

30|$|Coagulant dose {{also appears}} to be a {{significant}} factor in the removal of color. An increase in coagulant dose tremendously improves color removal regardless of coagulant. Coagulant dose changes the zeta potential. An increase in coagulant dose will increase the zeta potential, thereby <b>reversing</b> the <b>charge</b> of the coagulant. In many cases, the increase will <b>reverse</b> the <b>charge</b> of the coagulant to become positive. With the dye molecule having become positive, the solution becomes stable. It is also possible that the zeta potential during the process is closer to zero improving the removal of color (Kim et al. 2004 a).|$|R
