50|$|The 2-1/2 story wood {{frame house}} was built in 1881 by Winand Toussaint, a Belgian {{immigrant}} {{who worked in the}} furniture business, and may have been the designer of the house. It is an architecturally eclectic work, with elements of Second Empire (the mansard <b>roof),</b> <b>Stick</b> style, and Gothic Revival. The house has a cupola, and perhaps most distinctively, the house's corners are chamfered, with the main entrance at one of the angled ends.|$|E

He puts his hand to a door, and grey globules descend from the <b>roof</b> and <b>stick</b> all over him, preventing him from moving. Flowers says they respond to anti-social behavior as well.|$|R
50|$|The Childs House is set well {{back from}} Meadowcroft Road, on the {{southern}} edge of Skilling's development. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a mansard <b>roof</b> and <b>Stick</b> style decoration in projecting gable sections. The walls are polychrome brick (mainly red and black), and windows are set in segmented-arch openings with sawtooth brickwork. The main facade is symmetrically arranged, with a central projecting pavilion topped by a gable with a trefoil and a pointed-arch window. The entrance is set in a segmented-arch opening in the pavilion, sheltered by a single-story porch.|$|R

50|$|The House at 156 Mason Terrace in Brookline, Massachusetts, {{is one of}} {{the most}} elaborately {{decorated}} houses on Corey Hill. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built c. 1888-90, and has classic Queen Anne and Stick style details, including a turret with polygonal <b>roof,</b> porch with <b>Stick</b> decorations, and the variety of gables and projecting sections that typify Queen Anne styling. The house was built on land owned by Thomas Griggs, and was in 1890 sold to James Dunbar, a judge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{just made}} a big {{platform}} of sticks and mud out there where it was deep {{enough for me to}} be sure that the water could not freeze clear to the bottom, even in the coldest weather," [...] replied Paddy, in a matter-of-fact tone. [...] "I built it up until it was above water. Then I built the walls and <b>roof</b> of <b>sticks</b> and mud, just as you see them there. Inside I have a fine big room with a comfortable bed of shredded wood. I have two openings in the floor with a long passage leading from each down through the foundations and opening at the bottom of the pond. Of course, these are filled with water. Some houses have only one passage, but I like two. These are the only entrances to my house.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{landslide}} {{there was}} total silence. George Williams, who {{was trapped in}} the wreckage, remembered that [...] "In that silence you couldn't hear a bird or a child." [...] Pantglas County Secondary School was on the northern fringe of the affected area. Investigating the damage to it immediately after the slide, its acting headmaster found [...] "The Girls' Entrance was approximately two-thirds to three-quarters full of rubble and waste material ... I climbed onto the rubble in the doorway ... when I looked {{directly in front of}} me ... I saw that the houses in Moy Road had vanished in a mass of tip-waste material and that the Junior School gable-ends, or part of the <b>roof,</b> were <b>sticking</b> up out of this morass. I looked down to my right and I saw that the Moy Road houses had gone" ...|$|R
50|$|This {{house is}} located on a broad lot {{at the corner of}} Central Street and Rangeley Road. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, and has {{irregular}} Queen Anne massing and an asymmetrical facade that has a projecting gable section with decorative shingles. The projection is supported by shingled brackets and arches framing a double sash window. A porch, partially enclosed, extends across the front. The <b>roof</b> gables have <b>Stick</b> style woodwork, and the Central Street facade features a floral brick panel between the floors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{smallest}} Land Rover {{available at}} the time was a Series IIA 88 inch (2235 mm) wheelbase, which was too heavy. Land Rover began work on a lightweight version to fit the specifiactions in 1965. A new modification to the basic Series IIA was devised by making many body components easily detachable and removing many non-essential items. The result was the Land Rover Half-Ton, known widely as the Lightweight or Airportable. In practice, to reduce weight sufficiently for the helicopters of the day to lift them in combat conditions, the tilt (<b>roof)</b> and <b>sticks,</b> the upper parts of the body, the doors and windscreen were removed, to be refitted later. The most significant change, however, was a reduction in width by 4 inch (100 mm), by redesigning the standard Series IIA axles and fitting shorter half-shafts, which meant it would fit on a standard pallet.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{verandah}} there was a round table. On it a paraffin lamp without a globe shed a hard glare on the three inner sides. The fourth side was open, and faced the river. Between the rough supports of the high-pitched roof hung torn rattan screens. There was no ceiling, and the harsh brilliance of the lamp was toned above into a soft half- light that lost itself in the obscurity amongst the rafters. The front wall was cut in two by the doorway of a central passage closed by a red curtain. The women's room opened into that passage, which led to the back courtyard and to the cooking shed. In one of the side walls there was a doorway. Half obliterated words--"Office: Lingard and Co."--were still legible on the dusty door, which {{looked as if it had}} not been opened for a very long time. Close to the other side wall stood a bent- wood rocking-chair, and by the table and about the verandah four wooden armchairs straggled forlornly, as if ashamed of their shabby surroundings. A heap of common mats lay in one corner, with an old hammock slung diagonally above. In the other corner, his head wrapped in a piece of red calico, huddled into a shapeless heap, slept a Malay, one of Almayer's domestic slaves--"my own people," [...] he used to call them. A numerous and representative assembly of moths were holding high revels round the lamp to the spirited music of swarming mosquitoes. Under the palm-leaf thatch lizards raced on the beams calling softly. A monkey, chained to one of the verandah supports--retired for the night under the eaves--peered and grinned at Almayer, as it swung to one of the bamboo <b>roof</b> <b>sticks</b> and caused a shower of dust and bits of dried leaves to settle on the shabby table. The floor was uneven, with many withered plants and dried earth scattered about. A general air of squalid neglect pervaded the place. Great red stains on the floor and walls testified to frequent and indiscriminate betel-nut chewing. The light breeze from the river swayed gently the tattered blinds, sending from the woods opposite a faint and sickly perfume as of decaying flowers.|$|R
25|$|On the exterior, Frank Lloyd Wright traded the dual-pitched, cross-gable <b>roof</b> in the <b>Stick</b> {{style for}} a more {{distinctive}} dual-pitched hip roof with deep eaves and thick wood fascia boards. The form and style of the roof exemplified Wright's Japanese influence, and has been likened {{to the design of}} Asian pagodas. The unique design was furthered by a tierred surface of cedar shingles created by furring strips under every fifth row. Three dormers – one each on the east, south, and west façades – were likewise faced in shingles and were topped by the same flared, double-pitched roofs.|$|R
50|$|The houses {{built in}} the {{district}} reflect the architectural styles popular {{in the last three}} decades of the 20th century. There are six Second Empire houses, typified by their mansard roofs, that were all built before 1870. The Soden House at 5 Park Place is one of the finest examples of Queen Anne architecture in the district; it was built in 1890, and has the characteristic asymmetrical massing of the style, including a tower with a bellcast <b>roof.</b> The only <b>Stick</b> style house is the Leavitt House at 91 Washington Park; built in 1870, it has the applied exterior decorative woodwork of that style. The most recently built house in the district is the Goodridge House at 27-29 Washington Park, a Colonial/Craftsman duplex built in 1914.|$|R

Huts {{made out}} of mud with pointy <b>stick</b> <b>roofs</b> all around us.And in a hut sitting on a dirt floor was a woman with skin as black as the ink thatfilled the inkwell in my school desk. A shadow come to life … But then suddenlythere was a man. An African man. A black man who looked to be carved frommelting chocolate… A monkey man {{sweating}} a smell of mothballs. Blacker thanwhen you smudge your face with sooty cork. His lips were brown, not pink likethey should be, and they bulged with air like bicycle tires. His hair was whooly asa black shorn sheep. His nose, squashed flat, had two nostrils big as train tunnels.And he was looking down at me … He could have swallowed me up, this big n***er man.|$|R
40|$|Heidnische Kaffernfamilie in Etembeni. " ("Heathen Kaffir {{family in}} Etembeni. "). The picture shows {{a group of}} eight people of African origin, one man sitting on {{a chair in the}} middle of the group, one man {{standing}} on the left, two women sitting close to the man sitting, another woman standing next to him. There are also two girls standing on the right and probably a woman, the face partly covered with white paint. Behind them a wooden fence and a hut, the <b>roof</b> made of <b>sticks</b> and grass. To the left another small building made of wooden sticks, probably a small barn for the animals.

60|$|The beaver's {{house is}} {{generally}} {{the last thing}} attended to. He likes to build this when the nights grow cold enough to freeze his mortar soon after it is laid. Two or three tunnels are dug {{from the bottom of}} the beaver pond up through the bank, coming to the surface together at the point where the center of the house is to be. Around this he lays solid foundations of log and stone in a circle from six to fifteen feet in diameter, according to the number of beavers to occupy the house. On these foundations he rears a thick mass of sticks and grass, which are held together by plenty of mud. The top is <b>roofed</b> by stout <b>sticks</b> arranged as in an Indian wigwam, and the whole domed over with grass, stones, sticks, and mud. Once this is solidly frozen, the beaver sleeps in peace; his house is burglar proof.|$|R
50|$|The Sylvester Dresser House is a {{historic}} house at 29 Summer Street in Southbridge, Massachusetts. It was built between 1865 and 1870 for Sylvester Dresser, a leading businessman in Southbridge {{during the second half}} of the 19th century. Dresser began his career as a schoolteacher, but operated a variety of businesses between the 1840s and 1860s. He was notable for making the first shipment (a load of bricks) when the railroad arrived in Southbridge in 1866. His house is a 2.5 brick structure in a strong Italianate form, but with some Gothic Revival details. The blocky form with three bays, with the rounded arch entry and heavy balcony, are typical Italianate features, but the steeply pitched <b>roof</b> lines and <b>Stick</b> style decorative elements are more distinctly Gothic. The choice of brick as a building material is somewhat unusual, but not unexpected given that Dresser owned brickyards at the time of its construction.|$|R
50|$|The cottage has an {{asymmetrical}} T {{shape with}} irregular massing. It is predominantly plank-framed, {{and has a}} variety of porches and belvideres; its most prominent feature is the tower at its northwest corner, which is 46 ft high. Each of the tower's three levels has a porch with Stick-style balustrade, and the tower is topped by an open gabled <b>roof</b> with more <b>Stick</b> decoration. The central portion of the main facade is recessed from the tower, with a porch on the second floor above a first floor with a truncated overhanging roof line. The left (south) side of the main facade has a projecting gable section with porches above and below, and a small turret-topped side projection immediately behind it. The tower was destroyed during the New England Hurricane of 1938, and rebuilt in the 1980s. The exterior decorations include numerous wood carvings, including depictions of lion heads, doves, dragons, and falcons.|$|R
50|$|The Martin L. Kelsey House stands {{just north}} of {{downtown}} Burlington, {{on the west side}} of Elmwood between Pearl and Grant Streets in a mixed residential-commercial area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof on the main block providing a full third floor. Ells of decreasing size and height extend to the rear of the house, which is set on a small parcel now surrounded by parking lots. The exterior has a large number of decorative elements borrowing from a variety of architectural styles. The mansard roof has a flared lower section, and is crowned by a band of wooden squares with recessed panels. Its dormers have steeply pitched gabled <b>roofs,</b> with elaborate <b>Stick</b> style decoration, and whose windows are framed by Italianate moulding. A large gabled section projects on the left side also with Stick decoration and a finial at the top of the ridge. The main facade is three bays wide, with bands of paneled woodwork below the groundfloor windows and between the first and second-floor windows. An entrance is in the right bay, with an Italianate porch featuring a valance of square panels similar to those that crown the roof. A second porch with similar styling extends along the left side to the projecting section.|$|R
