50|$|To handle some {{frequently}} encountered special moves, e {{can be used}} next to m and c {{to indicate}} en-passant capture, i.e. capture of the piece that just made an move with i & n modifier, by moving to the square where the n implies {{it could have been}} blocked. (This makes the full description of the FIDE pawn fmWfceFifmnD.) An O with a <b>range</b> <b>specifier</b> is used to indicate castling with the furthest piece in that direction in the initial setup, the range indicating the number of squares the king moves (orthodox castling: ismO2). XBetza overloads some modifiers, by giving them an alternative meaning where the original meaning makes no sense. E.g. i in a continuation leg ('iso') indicates the length must be the same as the previous riding leg, useful for indicating rifle captures (caibR).|$|E
50|$|A {{proposed}} extension by David Howe uses sequencing {{operators to}} describe multi-leg moves as sequences of legs described {{with the original}} Betza system. It distinguishes between the case where the move must continue {{in the same direction}} and where it can alter direction arbitrarily, indicated by a single hypen or a double one, respectively. A + sign can be used as alternative to concatenation, to enhance readability, while use of parentheses serves the same purpose. The range indicator gets the character of exponentiation w.r.t. the - operator (i.e. repeated continuation in the same direction), which can also be applied to a parenthesized expression that already describes a sequence of moves. The convention is introduced that a leading zero on a <b>range</b> <b>specifier</b> means exactly that number of steps, rather than maximally, and an asterisk * as exponent indicates an arbitrarily large number of steps.|$|E
50|$|Betza 2.0 treats <b>range</b> <b>specifiers</b> as exponentiation in {{the same}} way as Bex, e.g. (cQ-mQ)4 for the Ultima long leaper that can make upto 4 captures along a {{straight}} line if it can find empty squares between the pieces it jumps over (and then captures). A quirky feature is that it allows modifiers on the range itself, to overrule the defaults of the chaining operator that is spread around by this exponentiation. E.g. Nrf7 would mean N-rfN-rfN-..., a repeated knight step that deflects right-forward, i.e. a move of the circular slider qN. A geometric e modifier can force a continuation slider leg to be of equal length as a previous slider leg, which makes it possible to specify rifle captures by sliders as forth-and-back moving (e.g. cR-ebR). Betza 2.0 also has an explosion modifier x that would make shrapnell ejected in all directions continue the specified move to cause side effects on a specified surroundings (leaving the moving piece behind).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Fugue, a modular static checker for languages that compile to the Common Language Runtime. Fugue {{allows the}} rules for using an interface to be recorded as declarative specifications and provides a range of annotations that allow a developer to specify interface rule with varying precision. At the simplest end of the <b>range,</b> a <b>specifier</b> can mark those methods that allocate and release resources. A specifier can also limit {{the order in which}} an object's methods may be called to the transitions of a finite state machine. At the most complex end of the <b>range,</b> a <b>specifier</b> can give a method a plug-in pre- and postconditon, which is arbitrary code that examines an object's current state and a static approximation of the method's actuals, decides whether the call is legal and returns the object's state after the call. We used these features to specify rules for using ado. net, a library for accessing relational databases, and found several errors in an internal Microsoft Research web site, which extensively uses this librar...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The glucosinolate-myrosinase {{system is}} an {{activated}} chemical defense system found in plants of the Brassicales order. Glucosinolates are stored separately from their hydrolytic enzymes, the myrosinases, in plant tissues. Upon tissue damage, e. g. by herbivory, glucosinolates and myrosinases get mixed and glucosinolates are broken {{down to an}} array of biologically active compounds of which isothiocyanates are toxic to a wide <b>range</b> of organisms. <b>Specifier</b> proteins occur in some, but not all glucosinolate-containing plants and promote the formation of biologically active non-isothiocyanate products upon myrosinase-catalyzed glucosinolate breakdown. Results Based on a phytochemical screening among representatives of the Brassicales order, we selected candidate species for identification of specifier protein cDNAs. We identified ten specifier proteins {{from a range of}} species of the Brassicaceae and assigned each of them to one of the three specifier protein types (NSP, nitrile-specifier protein, ESP, epithiospecifier protein, TFP, thiocyanate-forming protein) after heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Together with nine known specifier proteins and three putative specifier proteins found in databases, we subjected the newly identified specifier proteins to phylogenetic analyses. Specifier proteins formed three major clusters, named AtNSP 5 -cluster, AtNSP 1 -cluster, and ESP/TFP cluster. Within the ESP/TFP cluster, specifier proteins grouped according to the Brassicaceae lineage they were identified from. Non-synonymous vs. synonymous substitution rate ratios suggested purifying selection to act on specifier protein genes. Conclusions Among specifier proteins, NSPs represent the ancestral activity. The data support a monophyletic origin of ESPs from NSPs. The split between NSPs and ESPs/TFPs happened before the radiation of the core Brassicaceae. Future analyses have to show if TFP activity evolved from ESPs at least twice independently in different Brassicaceae lineages as suggested by the phylogeny. The ability to form non-isothiocyanate products by specifier protein activity may provide plants with a selective advantage. The evolution of specifier proteins in the Brassicaceae demonstrates the plasticity of secondary metabolism within an activated plant defense system. </p...|$|R
