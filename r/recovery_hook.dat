5000|$|A snatch strap {{is used by}} {{attaching}} one end to a rated recovery point on the bogged vehicle (e.g. a <b>recovery</b> <b>hook</b> or loop on the chassis). A second vehicle is required to do the recovery. The snatch strap is {{laid out on the}} ground in the direction the bogged vehicle is to be recovered (either forwards or backwards), with an [...] "S" [...] bend in the middle approximately 1m in length. The recovery vehicle is backed up so that the snatch strap can be attached to a second rated recovery point on the rear of the recovery vehicle. The recovery vehicle then drives off, and the strap begins to stretch, building up potential energy, until the force keeping the vehicle bogged is overcome, at which point the bogged vehicle is pulled forward (or [...] "snatched", hence the name).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Analysis of {{the state}} of stress and strain of the wire ropes is {{fundamental}} in assessing mechanical strength; a comparison between different analytical formulations utilized to estimate the state of stress in the inner and external wires of a rope is presented in this paper. In particular, different approaches are used to design a model for axial force and bending moment. For this purpose, a rope used in a helicopter rescue hoist, subjected to swinging of the <b>recovery</b> <b>hook,</b> present in anomalous working conditions, is considered. The analytical results have been compared with experimental data obtained on the rope (modulus of elasticity, fatigue tests of the wire, rope bending fatigue tests) with the aim of making a critical comparison of the methods analysed and to allow a reliability fatigue life prediction for the component...|$|E
50|$|The Trailhawk adds dark-colored alloy wheels, the Uconnect 8.4A {{touch screen}} radio with 9-1-1 {{emergency}} assistance, roadside assistance, {{and support for}} apps. It comes in 4x4 model only, is Trail Rated®, and {{is a far more}} off-road capable model. Trailhawk is the only trim to include <b>recovery</b> <b>hooks</b> for towing a stuck vehicle and a mechanical rear locker.|$|R
5000|$|... 4WD Expeditions {{come with}} {{standard}} dual front frame-mounted closed-loop <b>recovery</b> <b>hooks</b> and available off-road under body protection. Steel plates are placed over vital areas with a composite shield for the fuel tank. Expedition 4x4s are tested alongside the F-150 and Super Duty trucks at Fords California and Arizona proving grounds. Expedition is put {{through the same}} durability tests and evaluations to meet the same durability standards as its pickup truck brethren.|$|R
50|$|For the 2011 model year, the Suburban {{will add}} three new {{exterior}} colors to the lineup: Mocha Steel Metallic, Green Steel Metallic, and Ice Blue Metallic. The trims will also get an updated modification, with the rear audio system, Bluetooth, floor console/storage area, wood grain interior, luggage rack rails, body-color exterior door handle/mirror caps and premium-cloth front bucket seats now standard on the 1LS trim, and chrome <b>recovery</b> <b>hooks,</b> two-speed transfer case, and 20-inch chrome wheels standard on its 1LS 4WD models. In addition, the trailering package will feature the trailer brake controller {{as a standard}} on all trims.|$|R
50|$|The H3 {{featured}} a two-speed, electronically controlled {{full-time four-wheel drive}} system that made it for both on-road and off-road driving. Electronic locking front and rear differentials were optional. Like the Hummer H2, the H3 can ford 27 in of water (tested in depths up to 34 in) at a speed of 5 mph and 20 in of water at a speed of 20 mph. Standard ground clearance with the 31 inch tires measured at 9.7 in while the approach, departure, and breakover angles are measured at 37.4°, 34.7°, and 22.1° respectively, allowing the H3 to scale a 16 in vertical wall and negotiate grades of 60% and side slopes of 40%. Front and rear <b>recovery</b> <b>hooks</b> were standard, with an optional trailer hitch and wiring harness. The optional Adventure or Off Road package included 33 inch tires which increased its capabilities.|$|R
2500|$|After reentry, a small, drogue {{parachute}} (H) was deployed at [...] for stabilizing the spacecraft's descent. The main parachute (I) was deployed at [...] {{starting with a}} narrow opening that opened fully {{in a few seconds}} to lessen the strain on the lines. Just before hitting the water, the landing bag inflated from behind the heat shield to reduce the force of impact (J). Upon landing the parachutes were released. An antenna (K) was raised and sent out signals that could be traced by ships and helicopters. Further, a green marker dye was spread around the spacecraft to make its location more visible from the air. Frogmen brought in by helicopters inflated a collar around the craft to keep it upright in the water. The <b>recovery</b> helicopter <b>hooked</b> onto the spacecraft and the astronaut blew the escape hatch to exit the capsule. He was then hoisted aboard the helicopter that finally brought both him and the spacecraft to the ship.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During normal operation, {{the ends}} of {{helicopter}} rescue hoist ropes, to which a hook is attached, can be subject to bending stress caused by vibrations. This happens {{in the event of}} partial or total <b>recovery</b> of the <b>hook</b> into its lodging without a spring-loaded blocking system. The swinging of the rope end consequently causes bending of the rope near the terminal, with resultant fatigue stress that can lead quickly to breakage or damage of the rope. A series of alternating bending fatigue tests using a constant load, similar to those known as BoS (bending over sheave) tests, were carried out. These simulate the effective working conditions of a rescue hoist. This paper describes modifications to test machinery, the test method and the data obtained; statistical analysis of this data enabled us to make a rope life prediction which was then experimentally confirmed by run-outs on test ropes...|$|R
50|$|Leaving {{aside the}} {{swimming}} astronaut, Lewis completed {{his approach to}} the sinking spacecraft, as both he and Reinhard were intent on spacecraft recovery. This action was a conditioned reflex based on past training experience. While training off the Virginia beaches the helicopter pilots had noted that the astronauts seemed at home in and to enjoy the water. So Reinhard quickly cut the high-frequency antenna {{as soon as the}} helicopter reached Liberty Bell 7. Throwing aside the antenna cutting device, Reinhard picked up the shepherd's <b>hook</b> <b>recovery</b> pole and carefully threaded the crook through the recovery loop on top of the spacecraft. By this time Lewis had lowered the helicopter to assist Reinhard in his task to a point that the chopper's three wheels were in the water. The capsule sank out of sight, but the pickup pole tangled as the attached cable went taut, indicating to the helicopter pilots that they had made their catch.|$|R
50|$|The Holmes Wrecker Recovery Vehicle (1142) {{issued in}} May 1967 was {{also based on}} the Ford H Series tractor unit, and {{featured}} twin boom die-cast <b>recovery</b> cranes with <b>hooks</b> attached to cotton lines that could be extended by winding a pair of spare wheels attached {{to the sides of}} the vehicle, and also included were two model mechanics previously seen with the 'Express Services' truck. The American LaFrance Aerial Rescue Truck (1143) was added to the Major range in October 1968 and was a highly detailed model of a tiller/ladder truck (or hook and ladder) from the United States of America. It featured an extendable ladder on a rotating base complete with plastic ladder extensions and model firemen and has recently been re-issued by the modern Corgi company in a number of authentic liveries. The Carrimore Car Transporter Mark IV using the recently introduced Scammell cab was also released in April 1969 and a gift set (GS48) featuring the new transporter and six cars; MGC GT (345), Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1967 (339), Sunbeam Imp Monte Carlo 1967 (340), Mini Cooper S Magnifique (334), Morris Mini Minor (226) and The Saint's Volvo P1800 (258) soon followed. By October 1970 the Carrimore Car Transporter Mark V (1146) had grown to three decks and Gift Set 20 again featured the transporter complete with six cars now fitted with Whizzwheels; Lancia Fulvia Zagato (372), Marcos 3 Litre (377), MGC GT (378), Ford Capri 3 Litre (311), The Saint's Volvo P1800 (201) and Pontiac Firebird (343). The colour schemes applied to some cars in the Car Transporter Gift Sets were unique to models included in these sets, such as the MGC GT (345) finished in orange, and today are particularly collectable. The Scammell Handyman Ferrymasters Truck (1147) issued in December 1969, proved to be the last new application for the Scammell cab and was finished in the authentic yellow and white livery of the Ferrymasters haulage company.|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} of autonomous operation of ship-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in extreme sea conditions would greatly extend {{the usefulness of}} these aircraft for both military and civilian maritime purposes. Maritime operations are often associated with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) procedures, even though the advantages of conventional fixed-wing aircraft over VTOL aircraft in terms of flight speed, range and endurance are well known. In this work, current methods of shipboard recovery are analysed and {{the problems associated with}} recovery in adverse weather conditions are identified. Based on this analysis, a novel recovery method is proposed. This method, named Cable <b>Hook</b> <b>Recovery,</b> is intended to recover small to medium-size fixed-wing UAVs on frigate-size vessels. It is expected to have greater operational capabilities than the Recovery Net technique, which is currently the most widely employed method of recovery for similar class of UAVs, potentially providing safe recovery even in very rough sea and allowing the choice of approach directions. The recovery method is supported by the development of a UAV controller that realises the most demanding stage of recovery, the final approach. The controller provides both flight control and guidance strategy that allow fully autonomous recovery of a fixed-wing UAV. The development process involves extensive use of specially tailored Evolutionary Algorithms and represents the major contribution of this work. The Evolutionary Design algorithm developed in this work combines the power of Evolutionary Strategies and Genetic Programming, enabling automatic evolution of both the structure and parameters of the controller. The controller is evolved using a fully coupled nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom UAV model, making linearisation and trimming of the model unnecessary. The developed algorithm is applied to both flight control and guidance problems with several variations, from optimisation of a routine PID controller to automatic control laws synthesis where no a priori data available. It is demonstrated that Evolutionary Design is capable of not only optimising, but also solving automatically the real-world problems, producing human-competitive solutions. The designed UAV controller has been tested comprehensively for both performance and robustness in a nonlinear simulation environment and has been found to allow the aircraft to be recovered in the presence of both large external disturbances and uncertainty in the simulation models...|$|R
