500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{considered}} the Jim and Dwight scenes {{to be one}} of the only highlights of the episode, especially due to them being the core element to the series. She criticized Robert's role in the episode and series, calling his character [...] "a tool ... I mean that in both senses", and also wrote that he was too much of an inconsistent character. She concluded that while the episode was not [...] "terrible", it was a mediocre conclusion to the Florida storyline and wrote that [...] "I've got a suspicion that the best part of Season 8 is behind us". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, writing that the only drawback for the episode was the Scranton subplot, because it [...] "turned <b>really</b> <b>old,</b> really fast", although he did compliment Lieberstein's performance in the episode.|$|E

That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was <b>really</b> <b>old</b> school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three-and-a-half or four months before I even got in front of the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|Honeychile Rider is one {{of three}} women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape. This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow {{different}} to the norm, although Black points out that this gives Bond an opportunity to help and save both Rider and the others. Other female characters in the Bond series have flaws, and Rider has a broken nose—the result of the rape she suffered. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett, in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels, consider that Rider is [...] "not archetypically feminine", but is [...] "constructed according to the formula 'equal but yet subordinate'." [...] Rider is described in the book as having buttocks like a boy, which brought a response from Fleming's friend Noël Coward that [...] "I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile's bottom was like a boy's.

500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, <b>really</b> <b>old</b> technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E

Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an [...] "amazing" [...] job animating the setpiece. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. [...] "It just adds another element", Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, [...] "People's clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it's windy. And {{you have to make sure}} the snow is consistent because [...] It's like a character. If it's a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it's snowing too hard in the next scene...

500|$|Sheen came to {{international}} attention in 2006 for {{his portrayal of}} Tony Blair in The Queen. The film focused on the differing reactions of the British Royal Family and the newly appointed Prime Minister {{following the death of}} Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997; it was Sheen's third collaboration with director Stephen Frears and his second with screenwriter Peter Morgan. He enjoyed reprising his role because Blair, at this point in his career, had [...] "a weight to him that he didn't have before". When asked to discuss his personal opinion of Blair, Sheen admitted that the more time he spent working on the character, the [...] "less opinion" [...] he has of the politician: [...] "Now when I watch him on TV or hear his voice, it's sort of like a cross between a family member, a friend and seeing a <b>really</b> <b>old</b> embarrassing video of yourself." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised [...] "a sensational performance, alert and nuanced" [...] while Empire spoke of an [...] "uncanny, insightful performance". Sheen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His second film appearance of 2006 was a supporting role in Blood Diamond as an unscrupulous diamond dealer. Also in 2006, Sheen starred as the troubled English comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four's [...] In preparation for the role, he lost two and a half stone (approx. 35lbs), studied archival footage and read Williams' published diaries. Sheen has said he is [...] "fascinated by finding the private side of the public face". The Times found his performance [...] "mesmerising" [...] while The Observer described it as [...] "a characterisation for which the description tour-de-force is, frankly, pretty faint praise". He won a RTS Award for Best Actor, and received his second BAFTA nomination of 2006, for Best Television Actor. Sheen starred in two other BBC television productions in 2006, playing H. G. Wells in [...] and Nero in [...]|$|E
2500|$|Many {{questioned}} whether {{the time was right}} for a tribute to a group that had just disbanded four years ago, with its former members still active in the music industry. Buendia had mixed feelings about the tribute album, saying that [...] "It’s too early to be taking part in it and I don’t see myself being part of it kasi (because) I’m still doing something here...To be part of it is like acknowledging na tapos na ako (that I am finished); isa na lang akong trophy na itatago na (I'm just a trophy to be shelved).

2500|$|One picture bride {{summarizes}} {{the feelings of}} many of the brides subsequent to meeting their husbands, she writes [...] "I came to Hawaii and was so surprised and very disappointed, because my husband sent his twenty-five-year-old handsome-looking picture...He came to the pier, but I see he's <b>really</b> <b>old,</b> old-looking. He was forty-five years more old than I am. My heart stuck." [...] On average, the grooms were ten to fifteen years older than their brides. The age of their husbands were not the only shock for the women, they were also taken aback by their living conditions. Many women expected to live in houses like ones in the photos the men sent them, but instead found plantation quarters that were crude, isolated, and racially segregated. One of the reasons that the grooms and go-betweens were not altogether truthful with the future brides was because they believed that the women would not come if they knew the reality of the man and his conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Adele later {{collaborated with}} famed {{musician}} and producer Dan Wilson to write [...] "Someone like You" [...] {{which was one}} of the final songs composed for the album. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar. The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: [...] "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was <b>really</b> <b>old</b> school." [...] During an interview with Billboard, Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible. He added [...] "We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always knew what she wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan." [...] The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West Hollywood, California with Wilson playing piano. Philip Allen engineered in the studio. The mixing was done by Tom Elmhirst and Dan Parry while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.|$|E
2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was <b>really</b> <b>old</b> school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long. It's not about me changing the world; it's just about fun music - pure and simple. Music is so powerful. It's powerful enough on a personal level, without me trying to change the world." ...|$|E
