25|$|Once {{translated}} by a ribosome, each polypeptide folds into its characteristic three-dimensional structure from a <b>random</b> <b>coil.</b> Since the fold is maintained by {{a network of}} interactions between amino acids in the polypeptide, the native state of the protein chain {{is determined by the}} amino acid sequence (Anfinsen's dogma).|$|E
25|$|Each protein {{exists as}} an {{unfolded}} polypeptide or <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> when translated from {{a sequence of}} mRNA into a linear chain of amino acids. This polypeptide lacks any developed three-dimensional structure (the left hand side of the neighboring figure). Amino acids {{interact with each other}} to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure, the folded protein (the right hand side of the figure) known as the native state. The resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence (Anfinsen's dogma).|$|E

40|$|Using a {{single-stranded}} region tracing system, single-molecule DNA synthesis {{reactions were}} directly observed in microflow channels. The direct single-molecule observations of DNA synthesis were labeled with a fusion protein {{consisting of the}} ssDNA-binding domain of a 70 -kDa subunit of replication protein A and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (RPA-YFP). Our method was suitable for measurement of DNA synthesis reaction rates with control of the ssλDNA form as stretched ssλDNA (+flow) and <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> ssλDNA (−flow) via buffer flow. Sequentially captured photographs demonstrated that the synthesized region of an ssλDNA molecule monotonously increased with the reaction time. The DNA synthesis reaction rate of <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> ssλDNA (−flow) was nearly {{the same as that}} measured in a previous ensemble molecule experiment (52 vs. 50 bases/s). This suggested that the <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> form of DNA (−flow) reflected the DNA form in the bulk experiment in the case of DNA synthesis reactions. In addition, the DNA synthesis reaction rate of stretched ssλDNA (+flow) was approximately 75 % higher than that of <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> ssλDNA (−flow) (91 vs. 52 bases/s). The DNA synthesis reaction rate of the Klenow fragment (3 ’- 5 ’exo–) was promoted by DNA stretching with buffer flow...|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} increase in accuracy (to nearly ~80%) was made by exploiting multiple sequence alignment; knowing the full distribution of amino acids that occur at a position (and in its vicinity, typically ~7 residues on either side) throughout evolution provides a much better picture of the structural tendencies near that position. For illustration, a given protein might have a glycine at a given position, which by itself might suggest a <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> there. However, multiple sequence alignment might reveal that helix-favoring amino acids occur at that position (and nearby positions) in 95% of homologous proteins spanning nearly a billion years of evolution. Moreover, by examining the average hydrophobicity at that and nearby positions, the same alignment might also suggest a pattern of residue solvent accessibility consistent with an α-helix. Taken together, these factors {{would suggest that the}} glycine of the original protein adopts α-helical structure, rather than <b>random</b> <b>coil.</b> Several types of methods are used to combine all the available data to form a 3-state prediction, including neural networks, hidden Markov models and support vector machines. Modern prediction methods also provide a confidence score for their predictions at every position.|$|E
25|$|Early {{methods of}} secondary-structure {{prediction}} were restricted to predicting the three predominate states: helix, sheet, or <b>random</b> <b>coil.</b> These methods {{were based on}} the helix- or sheet-forming propensities of individual amino acids, sometimes coupled with rules for estimating the free energy of forming secondary structure elements. Such methods were typically ~60% accurate in predicting which of the three states (helix/sheet/coil) a residue adopts. The first widely used technique to predict protein secondary structure from the amino acid sequence was the Chou–Fasman method.|$|E
25|$|In general, this {{phenomenon}} will be exhibited in absorption bands of any optically active molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by most biological molecules, {{because of the}} dextrorotary (e.g. some sugars) and levorotary (e.g. some amino acids) molecules they contain. Noteworthy as well is that a secondary structure will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the alpha helix, beta sheet and <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> regions of proteins and the double helix of nucleic acids have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.|$|E

25|$|Nucleic acid {{thermodynamics}} is {{the study}} of how temperature affects the nucleic acid structure of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature at which half of the DNA strands are in the <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> or single-stranded (ssDNA) state. Tm depends on the length of the DNA molecule and its specific nucleotide sequence. DNA, when in a state where its two strands are dissociated (i.e., the dsDNA molecule exists as two independent strands), is referred to as having been denatured by the high temperature.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} lower-resolution methods for {{assigning}} general helical structure. The NMR chemical shifts (in particular of the Cα, Cβ and C′) and residual dipolar couplings are often characteristic of helices. The far-UV (170–250nm) circular dichroism spectrum of helices is also idiosyncratic, exhibiting a pronounced double minimum at around 208 and 222nm. Infrared spectroscopy is rarely used, since the α-helical spectrum {{resembles that of}} a <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> (although these might be discerned by, e.g., hydrogen-deuterium exchange). Finally, cryo electron microscopy is now capable of discerning individual α-helices within a protein, although their assignment to residues is still an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{theoretical}} physics, {{the method}} of MD gained popularity in materials science and since the 1970s also in biochemistry and biophysics. MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of proteins and other macromolecules based on experimental constraints from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. In physics, MD is {{used to examine the}} dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion-subplantation, and also to examine the physical properties of nanotechnological devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and structural biology, the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in ligand docking. In principle MD can be used for ab initio prediction of protein structure by simulating folding of the polypeptide chain from <b>random</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

30|$|After {{investigating}} {{the structure of}} PEM films composed of one polyanion the effects of changing the polyanion during film construction was analyzed. When CS was adsorbed onto a (PLL-PGA) 5 -PLL film {{an effect on the}} secondary structure was observed (Fig.  5). With each deposited bilayer of (PLL-CS) the content of conformation B decreases, and consequently the number of polypeptide chains in <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> conformations increases. After an addition of 5 bilayers (PLL-CS) onto a (PLL-PGA) 5 basis approximately 25  % of the polypeptide chains are in conformation A and 75  % in conformation B. The intensity of the IMβS structure does not decrease while the signal for <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> conformation rises (as judged from difference spectra after PE adsorption), this suggests that a bizonal film structure results due to the change in the polyanion from PGA to CS during PEM assembly. The first zone (in proximity to the substrate surface) is predominantly composed of intermolecular β structure while the second zone (towards the film–buffer interface) is characterized by chains in <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> conformation.|$|R

25|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (C12H25NaO4S; mW: 288.38) (only used in {{denaturing}} protein gels) is {{a strong}} detergent agent used to denature native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which {{is referred to as}} reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100°C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit weight. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge {{along the length of the}} polypeptide.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{secondary}} structures are alpha helices and beta sheets. Other helices, {{such as the}} 310 helix and π helix, are calculated to have energetically favorable hydrogen-bonding patterns but are rarely observed in natural proteins except {{at the ends of}} α helices due to unfavorable backbone packing {{in the center of the}} helix. Other extended structures such as the polyproline helix and alpha sheet are rare in native state proteins but are often hypothesized as important protein folding intermediates. Tight turns and loose, flexible loops link the more [...] "regular" [...] secondary structure elements. The <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> is not a true secondary structure, but is the class of conformations that indicate an absence of regular secondary structure.|$|E
50|$|Below their melting temperatures, most {{thermoplastic}} polymers (polyethylene, nylon, etc.) have amorphous {{regions in}} which the chains approximate <b>random</b> <b>coils,</b> alternating with regions that are crystalline. The amorphous regions contribute elasticity and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity.|$|R
5000|$|ALDH3A1 is a {{homodimer}} {{consisting of}} alpha helices (43.8%), beta sheets (4.2%), p-loop turns (28.2%) and <b>random</b> <b>coils</b> (23.8%). [...] The catalytic residue-Cys244—is located on an active site {{that contains a}} Rossman fold that binds the enzyme's cofactor, NAD(P)+.|$|R
30|$|The cell {{biological}} investigations on mixed multilayers further {{reveal that}} the PEM film conformation is not sensed as a property of a homogeneous 3 D-volume phase by the cells, since a difference in cell density was observed on PGA compared to CS terminated films. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} (PLL-PGA)n–(PLL-CS)x multilayers display a bizonal structure with distinct polypeptide conformations. When the number of CS bilayers x increases the superficial, <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> zones covers the tightly packed underlying (PLL-PGA)n. Consequently, both the content of conformation B in the film volume and the conformation of the surface exposed layers affect the cell response. When the top layers of the mixed multilayers with similar content of conformation B are composed of <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> chains, their inherent mechanical softness negatively interferes with cell spreading and proliferation.|$|R
2500|$|In dilute solution, the {{properties}} of the polymer are characterized by the interaction between the solvent and the polymer. In a good solvent, the polymer appears swollen and occupies a large volume. In this scenario, intermolecular forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular interactions. In a bad solvent or poor solvent, intramolecular forces dominate and the chain contracts. In the theta solvent, or the state of the polymer solution where the value of the second virial coefficient becomes 0, the intermolecular polymer-solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular monomer-monomer attraction. Under the theta condition (also called the Flory condition), the polymer behaves like an ideal <b>random</b> <b>coil.</b> [...] The transition between the states is known as a coil-globule transition.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{structure}} {{refers to}} highly regular local sub-structures {{on the actual}} polypeptide backbone chain. Two main types of secondary structure, the α-helix and the β-strand or β-sheets, were suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers. These secondary structures are defined by patterns of hydrogen bonds between the main-chain peptide groups. They have a regular geometry, being constrained to specific values of the dihedral angles ψ and φ on the Ramachandran plot. Both the α-helix and the β-sheet represent a way of saturating all the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the peptide backbone. Some parts of the protein are ordered but do not form any regular structures. They {{should not be confused}} with <b>random</b> <b>coil,</b> an unfolded polypeptide chain lacking any fixed three-dimensional structure. Several sequential secondary structures may form a [...] "supersecondary unit".|$|E
2500|$|The alpha sheet {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a possible intermediate state in the conformational change {{in the formation of}} amyloid fibrils by peptides and proteins such as amyloid beta, poly-glutamine repeats, lysozyme, prion proteins, and transthyretin repeats, all of which are associated with protein misfolding disease. For example, amyloid beta is a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, and polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein are associated with Huntington's disease. These proteins undergo a conformational change from largely <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> or alpha helix structures to the highly ordered beta sheet structures found in amyloid fibrils. Most beta sheets in known proteins are [...] "twisted" [...] about 15° for optimal hydrogen bonding and steric packing; however, some evidence from electron crystallography suggests that at least some amyloid fibrils contain [...] "flat" [...] sheets with only 1-2.5° of twist. An alpha-sheet amyloid intermediate is suggested to explain some anomalous features of the amyloid fibrillization process, such as the evident amino acid sequence dependence of amyloidogenesis despite the belief that the amyloid fold is mainly stabilized by the protein backbone.|$|E

50|$|The {{application}} of secondary chemical shifts to characterize protein flexibility {{is based on}} an assumption that the proximity of chemical shifts to <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> values is a manifestation of increased protein mobility, while significant differences from <b>random</b> <b>coil</b> values are an indication of a relatively rigid structure.|$|E

30|$|Inspired by the {{composition}} of the native extracellular matrix, biomimetic polyelectrolyte multilayers were assembled from polypeptides and the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate (CS). To investigate whether peptide conformation imposes an effect on the cell biological functions of osteoblasts, the secondary structure was analyzed by in situ infra-red and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Multilayers composed of polypeptides and CS reveal a predominantly <b>random</b> <b>coiled</b> conformation and impede osteoblast spreading. On the contrary, polypeptide chains in assemblies of poly-l-lysine and poly-l-glutamic acid (PGA) primarily adopt an intermolecular β sheet structure and reveal an increased area of spread, which consequently supports the proliferation of osteoblasts. When CS is replaced by PGA in mixed multilayers, we observe a structural rearrangement from <b>random</b> <b>coils</b> to β sheets with a concomitant improved cell response. We conclude that polypeptide conformation in biomimetic multilayer assemblies affects osteoblast response by altering the stiffness of the multilayer.|$|R
