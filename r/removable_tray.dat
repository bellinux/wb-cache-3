50|$|Hives {{also use}} queen excluders between the brood-box and honey supers {{to keep the}} queen from laying eggs in cells next to those {{containing}} honey intended for consumption. Also, with the advent in the 20th century of mite pests, hive floors are often replaced for part of (or the whole) year with a wire mesh and <b>removable</b> <b>tray.</b>|$|E
50|$|On a Chorkor oven, {{the fish}} is spread on <b>removable</b> <b>trays,</b> several of which are stacked {{on top of the}} oven. The {{advantages}} are larger capacity, reduced fuelwood consumption, and better product quality. A disadvantage is its higher initial cost because of the need for sawn planks, wire mesh and skilled carpenters. Also, it is less suitable for smoking fish of different size.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the second}} day of the flight, the LDEF was grappled by the [...] "Canadarm" [...] Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm and {{successfully}} released into orbit. Its 57 experiments, mounted in 86 <b>removable</b> <b>trays,</b> were contributed by 200 researchers from eight countries. Retrieval of the passive LDEF was initially scheduled for 1985, but schedule delays and the Challenger disaster of 1986 postponed the retrieval until January 12, 1990, when Columbia retrieved the LDEF during STS-32.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{consisted}} of an external 2U rack unit which housed the audio processing hardware, based on Motorola 563xx family DSPs, 24 inputs and 24 outputs via TDIF digital ports and four IDE hard disk drives (two internal and two with <b>removable</b> <b>trays).</b> Synchronization {{for the basic}} unit was via MIDI in/out/thru via MIDI Timecode and an optional Timecode Sync board provided video sync, and LTC in/out. An I/O board provided additional balanced analogue and AES3 connections (2 in, 4 out). Each unit could record and play 32 tracks of 24bit 48 kHz audio or 16 tracks of 24/96.|$|R
5000|$|Ice cube trays are {{designed}} to be filled with water, then placed in a freezer until the water freezes into ice, producing ice cubes. Trays are often flexible, so the frozen cubes can be easily removed by flexing the tray. [...] "Twist" [...] ice trays have a simple spring-loaded mechanism with a lever that is used to turn the tray upside down and flex at the same time such that the cubes drop are collected in a <b>removable</b> <b>tray</b> below and return the ice cube tray to its upright position without removing it from the freezer, which can save time and reduces accidents and mess, though the tray has to be removed to be collected and the ice cube tray still has to be removed to be refilled. An alternative system is an aluminium tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes, freeing them from the tray. A motorized version of this is found in most automatic ice-making freezers.|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{provided}} for indoor agriculture using {{at least one}} growth chamber illuminated by laser light. In an example embodiment of the agriculture system, a growth chamber is provided having one or more walls defining an interior portion of the growth chamber. The agriculture system may include a <b>removable</b> <b>tray</b> disposed within the interior portion of the growth chamber. The agriculture system also includes a light source, which may be disposed outside the growth chamber. The one or more walls may include at least one aperture. The light source is configured to illuminate at least {{a part of the}} interior portion of the growth chamber. In embodiments in which the light source is disposed outside the growth chamber, the light source is configured to transmit the laser light to the interior portion of the growth chamber via the at least one aperture...|$|E
50|$|Finer {{particle}} sizes (>40 µm) {{are able}} to be separated with the gyratory separator than with a trommel screen. The size of the gyratory screen separator can be adjusted through <b>removable</b> <b>trays,</b> whereas the trommel screen is usually fixed. Gyratory separators can also separate dry and wet materials like trommel screens. However, {{it is common for}} the gyratory separators to separate either dry or wet materials only. This is because there are different parameters for the gyratory screen to have the best separation efficiency. Therefore, two separators would be required for the separation of dry and wet materials, while one trommel screen {{would be able to do}} the same job.|$|R
5000|$|For 2.5″ bays, actual {{dimensions}} are 2.75″ wide by 0.197 to 0.750″ high and 3.955" [...] deep (69.85 mm × 5 to 19.05 mm × 100.45 mm). However most laptops have drive bays {{smaller than the}} 15 mm specification. 2.5" [...] hard drives may range from 7 mm to 15 mm in height, there are two sizes {{that appear to be}} prominent. 9.51 mm size drives are predominantly used by laptop manufacturers, however at present 2.5" [...] Velociraptor and some higher capacity drives (above 1 TB), are 15 mm in height. The greater height of the 15 mm drives allow more platters and therefore greater data capacities. Many laptop drive bays are designed to be <b>removable</b> <b>trays</b> in which the drives are mounted, to ease removal and replacement.|$|R
50|$|Small {{portable}} toolboxes {{are sometimes}} called hand boxes or portable tool storage. Most portable toolboxes have one handle {{on top and}} a lid that opens on a hinge. Many have a <b>removable</b> tote <b>tray</b> that sits on a flange inside {{the lip of the}} box, with a single larger compartment below. The tote tray helps organize smaller parts and accessories. Portable toolboxes sometimes use slide out trays or cantilever trays in lieu of the <b>removable</b> tote <b>tray.</b> Metal toolboxes (typically steel) weigh more than plastic ones. A plastic toolbox laden with tools can weigh the same as a comparable steel box does when empty. Metal boxes are also subject to rusting and their sharp edges can mark the surfaces of things they are banged against. Metal is, however, known for being stronger than plastic, so one should balance its disadvantages against the need to withstand abuse and support the weight of many tools.|$|R
50|$|Recliners with casters {{are also}} {{designed}} for a medical setting such as {{for use in a}} nursing home or hospital. Medical recliners often have accessory hooks and an optional <b>removable</b> arm and <b>tray</b> table.|$|R
50|$|The {{plastic and}} metal coffee {{capsules}} typically {{are used in}} a non-removable receptacle on the brewing device. The capsules have an outer ring or rim that stays dry during use, allowing for removal and disposal after use without getting the user's hands wet or sticky. Handling of a used moist coffee pod is not necessary if the brewing device has a <b>removable</b> filter <b>tray.</b> This tray is removed after brewing and inverted to eject the used coffee pod.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the use of}} a <b>removable</b> acrylic resin <b>tray</b> handle that can be easily attached to custom impression trays to produce an improved peripheral sealing zone. This device can be indicated to develop functional impressions for complete dentures using the patient-conducted muscular motion technique. In upper trays, the handle is fixed in the midline with acrylic resin, while in lower trays the centrally positioned handle is removed before border molding. This removable handle allows patient’s suction and free tongue movements. Final impression is carried out in two stages: peripheral sealing (low fusion compound) and recording of the main supporting region of the denture (zinc oxide and eugenol paste). All border records are obtained from the patient’s own movements (handle suction and tongue motion). The removable handle is simple to use, is reusable, can be adapted to any individual acrylic resin trays and allows accurate registration of the peripheral sealing zone (border tissues). Key Words: complete dentures, functional final impressions, <b>removable</b> anterior <b>tray</b> handle...|$|R

5000|$|The {{product has}} a {{clamshell}} design which simultaneously heats {{the top and}} bottom surfaces of the food, eliminating the need to flip it. Each heating surface is grooved to reduce contact area, and covered in a non-stick coating. The lower heating surface is angled to allow melted fat and other fluids to drain through the grooves into a <b>removable</b> drip <b>tray,</b> which clearly shows the amount removed from the food. This arrangement has been marketed as a way to [...] "knock out the fat", suggesting a healthier way to cook.|$|R

40|$|Maxillary midline {{diastema}} is {{a common}} esthetic problem requiring treatment. This case presentation shows the treatment of a patient with a minor midline diastema using <b>removable</b> clear <b>trays</b> and elastics. A 20 -year-old female patient, whose chief complaint was a small diastema between upper central incisors, had a symmetric face and competent lips. Intraoral examination showed class 1 buccal segments relationship with normal overjet and overbite. For the closure of midline diastema, an upper clear tray was fabricated and it was sectioned at the mesial third of each central incisor to create separate left and right trays with attachments for the elastic wear. Two months later, maxillary midline diastema was totally closed and a bonded maxillary 3 - 3 retainer was placed for retention. The esthetic problem was resolved. Clear appliance is aesthetic, and sufficient to close maxillary midline diastema...|$|R
50|$|The modular {{nature and}} {{expandability}} to 16 units connected to one PC was also somewhat unusual. Initially launched as a 4 track 16bit, 48 kHz system and using inexpensive IDE drives (the first units shipped with 2 x 120MB drives), {{advances in the}} efficiency of the DSP code extended this first to 8 tracks with 24bit recording and then {{with the addition of a}} second DSP board, to 12 tracks and also added the world's first configurable DSP based digital mixer. Huge systems could be configured as just 8 units coupled together formed a 96 track system with sample accurate synchronisation and could be controlled from one editing screen. The unit also had <b>removable</b> drive <b>trays</b> fitted as it had become cost efficient to simply put drives on the shelf as they cost far less per hour of audio than master tape.|$|R
