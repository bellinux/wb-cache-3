50|$|The {{undulate}} ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>undulata)</b> is {{a species of}} ray and cartilaginous fish found in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic from southern Ireland and England to the Gulf of Guinea. It is found in areas with mud or sand, and may occur as deep as 200 m, though it prefers shallower depths. It is considered endangered due to overfishing.|$|E
40|$|Egg {{capsules}} of Rajidae species vary in size, {{shape and}} adornments. These differences {{can be used}} as a taxonomic tool to differentiate species. Furthermore, since egg capsule external morphology is adapted to the environment where they are laid, it can be used make inferences on egg-laying grounds. In the present study, oviducal glands and egg capsules of seven species of skates (Leucoraja naevus, Raja brachyura, Raja montagui, Raja microocellata, Raja miraletus, Raja clavata and <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata)</b> are described and compared, and a taxonomic key developed. The resulting taxonomic key constitute a useful tool to identify skate species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, to improve our knowledge of egg laying habitatsproviding useful information for conservation and management...|$|E
40|$|Aspects of the {{population}} dynamics of the undulate ray, <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata</b> (Chondrichthyes: Rajidae), {{one of the more}} abundant elasmobranch fish captured along the Portuguese south coast (Algarve), were studied for the first time. Some traditional elasmobranch vertebral enhancing techniques were compared and the most precise for this species determined to be the cedar wood oil immersion and the alizarin red S stain. The sample consisted of 14 age-classes, with age-classes 3 to 8 being the most represented. Evidence of an annual deposition pattern of a pair of bands (one opaque and one translucent) was found by marginal increment analyses. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated and no differences found between males and females (all data: L-inf= 110. 22 cm, K= 0. 11 y(- 1) and t(0) =- 1. 58 y) ...|$|E
40|$|In Portugal, elasmobranch {{landings}} {{have decreased}} substantially in recent years. In this work, elasmobranch catches in experimental hake near bottom semi pelagic longlines (1997 and 1998) {{were compared with}} those of experimental trammel nets (2000). In the hake semi pelagic longline fishery, 7 elasmobranch species represented 33. 4 % (2185 specimens) of the total fish captures. The most abundant species were Galeus melastomus (63. 3 %), Etmopterus pusillus (21. 7 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (14. 2 %). Most of these elasmobranchs (68. 3 % in total) were discarded. In the trammel net fishery, 16 different elasmobranch species represented 4. 3 % (597 specimens) of total fish catches and the most important species were <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata</b> (43. 6 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (10. 2 %). The majority of the elasmobranchs caught with this gear had commercial value, and only 5. 4 % were discarded. In both fisheries, intra-specific catch rates varied with depth. Length frequency distributions for the only species with relatively high catches in both fisheries, the small-spotted catshark, showed that in general, trammel nets catch large...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} undulate ray, <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata,</b> {{one of the most}} important elasmobranch fishes captured along the Portuguese south coast (Algarve), was studied. Cedar wood oil immersion and alizarin red S techniques were used to enhance vertebral growth bands and estimate age. The parameters of the Von Bertalanffy growth function were estimated and no differences between males and fema les were found. The estimated parameters for all data were: Linf = 110. 22, K = 0. 11 and t 0 =- 1. 58. Evidence of an annual deposition pattern of a pair of bands (one opaque and one hyaline) was found by marginal increment analyses. The total mortality rate for age classes fully recruited to a trammel net fishery was estimated to be 0. 469. Natural mortality rate varied between 0. 200 and 0. 219 and fishing mortality rate varied between 0. 250 and 0. 269, depending on the method used to estimate natural mortality. The parameters estimated in this study will be useful for evaluating the state of the stock and assessing risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{maturity}} of the undulate ray, <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata,</b> {{one of the}} most important by-catch elasmobranch species captured in south Portugal, was studied for the first time. Females ranged in total length (TL) from 19. 4 to 88. 2 cm and males from 23. 0 to 83. 2 cm. The gonadosomatic index for females was higher during the winter, meaning that this species reproduces during this season. Females matured at significantly larger sizes and older ages than males, with 50 % of the females mature at 76. 2 cm TL at an age of 8. 98 years while 50 % maturity for males was achieved at 73. 6 cm TL and 7. 66 years. Females were mature at 86. 3 % of the maximum observed size and 69. 1 % of the maximum observed age while males matured at 88. 5 % of the maximum observed size and 63. 8 % of the maximum observed age, making this a very late maturing species, with important consequences in terms of fisheries management and conservation.

40|$|Under {{the scope}} of an {{ecosystem}} approach to fisheries, the understanding of trophic interactions {{is important for the}} assessment and consequently the proposal of suitable management measures. <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata,</b> like other rajids, is an important demersal predator in the Portuguese coastal community for which the biological and ecological information is still scarce. The ontogenetic dietary shift was investigated. Major length groups were defined through cluster analysis of the mean abundance of prey items. Prey diversity and feeding strategy were evaluated by length group. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to test the influence of the factors sex, season and maturity on the diet of this species. It was concluded that R. undulata has a dietary ontogenetic shift within the definition of three major length groups (MLGs) : 200 - 550 mm; 550 - 750 mm and 750 - 1000 mm. Diet varied from small and semi-pelagic to large and benthic prey. The feeding strategy of the species also changed from a generalised to a specialised diet. The decapod Polybius henslowi was the main prey item, especially for larger predators. Differences were found between sexes, maturity stages and seasons in each MLG...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the reproductive strategy of the undulate ray <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata</b> in Portuguese mainland waters. The species was found mostly between 30 and 40 m deep on sandy bottoms. Egg-laying sites were observed in the north, centre and south-west regions, mainly at depths below 30 m. The peak of the reproductive season occurred from December to May. Asynchrony between reproductively active females and males appeared to occur, although most adult males were capable of reproducing throughout the year. The estimated length at 50 % maturity was 862 cm (87 years) and 768 cm (76 years) total length for females and males, respectively. The maximum potential fecundity was estimated to be 698 follicles per female per reproductive season, which are released in 47 batches of 15 follicles. The life-history and demographic parameters of R. undulata {{are similar to those of}} other skate species, while the potential rate of population increase (049) is above the published values for other elasmobranch species. With these new findings, this study makes an important contribution to the understanding of the life history of R. undulata, and {{provides a}} first evaluation of the productivity and susceptibility of the species to exploitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on age estimation, with {{reproductive}} information {{contributing to the}} {{better understanding of the}} growth and the biology of <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata.</b> In the age and growth study, two calcified structures were used: caudal thorns and central vertebra. Results of readings showed that {{there were no significant differences}} in age estimates between the two structures. Both von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth models were fitted to size-at-age data by sex and geographical area. No significant differences were found between sexes for the two models but significant differences were found between geographical areas (P = 0. 05). The Gompertz growth function was selected as the best model to describe R. undulata growth because it presented the best fit and the most reasonable biological estimates. Reproductive analysis indicates one annual breeding season for R. undulata. The differences found in the estimates of length at first maturity between geographical areas (TL 50 % = 838 mm in Peniche and 762 mm in Algarve for females and TL 50 % = 781 mm in Peniche and 736 mm in Algarve for males), together with the regional differences found between growth parameters estimates (P = 0. 05), may reflect the existence of different local populations of R. undulata on the Portuguese continental shelf...|$|E
40|$|The 2 m {{beam trawl}} and 1. 5 m push net {{were used to}} sample the small epibenthic fish {{assemblage}} during September on the east and south coasts of England. Fishing stations were distributed along the entire coast within four depth bands to 20 m. A total of 104 species were caught between 1973 and 1995, and these included infrequent Lusitanean species such as the big-scale sand-smelt (Atherina boyeri), and the undulate ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>undulata),</b> and infrequent boreal species such as the Norway haddock (Sebastes viviparus). Fifty-four taxa were selected as representative of the small, demersal inshore fish community that would be most vulnerable to capture by the two sampling gears, and were used in subsequent analyses of community structure. The north-east coast assemblage was the least diverse (H*= 1. 58) and least even (J*= 0. 47). It also supported the least number of species (55), and the variation in catch of the only dominant genus, Pomatoschistus spp., was partly responsible for large year-to-year variations in diversity and in the total population abundance of selected demersal species. On the east and south-east coasts, both diversity (H*= 1. 78 and 1. 93) and evenness (J*= 0. 50 and 0. 51) were greater than in the north, {{as a result of}} large...|$|E
40|$|An {{undulate}} ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>undulata)</b> tagging survey {{was carried out}} {{from the end of}} 2011 to mid- 2014 in the Bay of Biscay with the partnership of the fishing industry. It demonstrates that the {{undulate ray}} can be found all along the French coast from the Loire estuary to the Spanish boarder, forming several isolated units, the more important being likely in {{the central part of the}} Bay of Biscay (Pertuis Charentais – Gironde area). Even in this latter limited area, the population is structured in sub-units with a low exchange rate between them. This population structure allowed to estimate abundance by mark-recapture in the Gironde estuary, using a Petersen estimate. The conditions that must be respected for such closed population abundance estimate are analysed. The conclusions are that as long i) long-line catch of rays longer than 65 cm are used to the be sure to have an equal capture probability and no recruitment effect, ii) recaptures are within 4. 5 month from the tagging date in winter to neglect tag losses and iii) number of tagged rays is corrected for emigration and mortality, an abundance estimate can be provided. The biomass of undulate rays longer than 65 cm in the inner Gironde estuary can thus be estimated to range from 51 to 70 t in the 2013 - 2014 winter (95 % confidence interval is 30 - 124 t). This first trial allows to have some guidelines for future mark-recapture estimates of the abundance of a species for which the use of other methods may be difficult...|$|E
40|$|Egg-capsules of the {{following}} four Raja-species have been known with certainty for many years from {{the shores of the}} Netherlands: Raja clavata Linnaeus, Raja montagui Fowler (Raja maculata Montagu), Raja radiata Donovan, and Raja batis Linnaeus. It is therefore of interest to note that from 1931 to 1935 and in 1936 egg-capsules diverging strongly from the well-known species, have been found on the beach between Wassenaar and Noordwijk (in the province of South-Holland). These capsules appeared to belong to {{the following}} five species: Raja brachyura Lafont, Raja naevus Müller and Henle, <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata</b> Lacépède, Raja microcellata Montagu, and Raja marginata Lacépède. The determinations have been made with Clark's (1922) paper, with the exception of Raja radiata Donovan, as this species is not mentioned by him. After studying and comparing the material of the collections of the Museum of Natural History at Leiden, several private collections, and my own, the following list of the species, occurring on the shore of the Netherlands, could be compiled: 1. Raja clavata Linnaeus. Egg-capsules are known from nearly the whole shore. Very common. 2. Raja montagui Fowler. Egg-capsules known from the shore of the province of South-Holland and the isle of Ameland. Rather common. 3. Raja radiata Donovan. Egg-capsules chiefly known from {{the northern part of the}} shore, south as far as Oostvoorne (South-Holland). Rather rare, capsules have been found single or in small groups.

40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009). The aims of this work were: 1) identify sharks and skates species using DNA barcode; 2) compare species of different provenance; 3) use DNA barcode for misidentified species. Using DNA barcode 15 species of sharks (Alopias vulpinus, Centrophorus granulosus, Cetorhinus maximus, Dalatias licha, Etmopterus spinax, Galeorhinus galeus, Galeus melastomus, Heptranchias perlo, Hexanchus griseus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus, Oxynotus centrina, Scyliorhinus canicula Squalus acanthias, Squalus blainville), 1 species of chimaera (Chimaera monstrosa) and 21 species of rays/skayes (Dasyatis centroura, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dasyatis sp., Dipturus nidarosiensis, Dipturus oxyrinchus, Leucoraja circularis, Leucoraja melitensis, Myliobatis aquila, Pteromylaeus bovinus, Pteroplatytrygon violacea, Raja asterias, Raja brachyura, Raja clavata, Raja miraletus, Raja montagui, Raja radula, Raja polystigma, <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata,</b> Rostroraja alba, Torpedo marmorata, Torpedo nobiliana, Torpedo torpedo) was identified...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of sensitive fish {{species such as}} skates (Rajidae) is essential for implementation of conservation measures. With insufficient survey data available for these species in Portuguese Continental waters, this study shows that fishery-dependent data associated with fishers' knowledge {{can be used to}} identify potential Essential Fish Habitats (EFH) for seven skate species. Sites with similar geomorphology were associated with the occurrence of juveniles and/or adults of the same group of species. For example, sites deeper than 100 m with soft sediment include predominantly adults of Raja clavata, and are the habitat for egg deposition of this species. <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata</b> and R. microocellata are the more coastal species, preferring sand or gravel habitats, while coastal areas with rocks and sand seabed are potential nursery areas for R. brachyura, R. montagui and R. clavata. The main output of this study is the identification of preferential fishing sites enclosing potential EFH for some species, associated with egg-laying and nursery grounds. The location of these areas will be considered for future seasonal closures, and studies will be conducted to evaluate the biological and socio-economic impacts of such measures. As in the past, fishermen will collaborate in the process of evaluating those impacts, since they have practical and applied knowledge that is extremely valuable for evaluating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} such closures. In conclusion, this study is a first contribution to the understanding and identification of EFH for skate species, associated with nursery and egg deposition sites, with direct application to management...|$|E
40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata</b> and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Biologia Marinha, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2010 Skate populations tend to {{be highly}} {{vulnerable}} to exploitation {{as a result of}} the main life history characteristics (slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity). The cuckoo ray, Leucoraja naevus, one of the skate species landed in Portugal, is mainly a by-catch species from the artisanal mixed-fishery, and for this reason it is very difficult to acquire information about its basic biology. The two main goals of the present work were to estimate the length at first maturity, fecundity and reproductive cycle of the species Leucoraja naevus and to compare the microscopic structure and chemical nature of the secretions produced by the oviducal gland of the species Leucoraja naevus with other skate species taking into account their reproductive strategy. Although the species has been studied in other NE Atlantic geographic areas, namely Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and North Sea, this study is the first to provide information on the reproductive biology of Leucoraja naevus in Southern European waters. Length at first maturity was estimated at 57 cm and 55 cm TL for males and females, respectively. Active females were observed in every months of the year suggesting that reproduction may occur year round, with a reproductive peak during winter months between January and April. Females release follicles in batches of 5. However, it was not possible to determine the number of reproductive episodes realized by a female during a 1 -year period. Leucoraja naevus, Raja brachyura, Raja miraletus, <b>Raja</b> <b>undulata,</b> Raja microocellata and Raja montagui, have similar microscopic structure divided in four zones: club, papillary, baffle and terminal. However, differences were found between Leucoraja naevus and the remaining species in the chemical nature of the secretions produced in the papillary zone, that seems to have a higher content of sulphated acid mucins, and in the terminal zone that, like in Raja microocellata, lacks serous gland tubules. The differences found are related with the reproductive strategy displayed by each species, namely with the capsule and spawning habitats characteristics. Sperm was found in all species as laterally aligned bundles in the deep recessed tubules of the baffle zone, adjacent to the muscle layer, suggesting short-term sperm storage. These results provide essential information on the reproductive biology not only about the species Leucoraja naevus but also about other by-catch species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, constitute an important tool for a proper management plan...|$|E
