50|$|In Peru chifle {{is typical}} of the Piura Region. It {{consists}} of fried slices or strips of either <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> plantains seasoned with salt to taste. In the region of Piura, chifle is traditionally fried in wood-burning stoves with wood of the algorrobo blanco (a species of mesquite tree), which gives chifle a special aroma and taste. Depending on the type of plantain (<b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> <b>green)</b> the flavor can be sweet or savory. Sometimes it is served with cancha serrana (pan-roasted :maize) or shredded cecina (pork jerky).|$|E
50|$|They feed on tiny grass seeds, {{which they}} collect {{from the ground}} or, more often, {{directly}} from grass panicles. They hang on the stems and harvest the <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> seeds, sometimes while hanging upside down. Small insects such as termites, aphids, and gnats are taken during the breeding season.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} the bananas and plantains produced in the humid tropics are wasted due to rapid spoilage. The use of acid-producing, anaerobic fermentation may be a safe and economical way to preserve the fruit in both large- and small-scale applications. The abilities of five commonly used, acid-producing bacteria to ferment media containing <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> <b>green</b> bananas were examined. Three homofermentative bacteria, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis, typically reduced the pH of a puree of ripe bananas from 4. 8 to about 3. 5 to 3. 6 in 7 days at 37 °C. Action on green bananas was similar, but the drop in pH was less pronounced. Very little gas evolved. Lactobacillus fermentum (formerly Lactobacillus fermenti) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides showed active gas evolution and a significant drop in pH. About twice as much gas evolved from ripe banana medium as from green bananas. The fermented purees were spongy, soft solids floating in a clear liquor. The color was medium to light creamy brown, and the odor was pleasant. Fermented products stored at room temperature retained good appearance and aroma throughout a 1 -month storage test...|$|E

5000|$|The berries {{are a good}} food, as {{they can}} be {{harvested}} en masse and stored. Once stored and dried, the berries can be ground into a coarse meal. The berries can be eaten <b>ripe</b> (when red) <b>or</b> <b>green</b> for a slightly sour taste. They are good eaten alone, or used as a thickener or sweetener in other dishes. [...] Fresh berries and branch tips can be soaked in water to make a cider. Native Americans used Manzanita leaves as toothbrushes.|$|R
50|$|The {{red-billed quelea}} is {{regarded}} as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1½ billion individuals. The species is specialised on feeding on seeds of annual grass species, which may be <b>ripe,</b> <b>or</b> still <b>green,</b> but have not germinated yet. Since the availability of these seeds varies with time and space, occurring in particular weeks after the local off-set of rains, queleas migrate as a strategy to ensure year-round food availability. The consumption of a lot of food with a high energy content is needed for the queleas to gain enough fat to allow migration to new feeding areas. When breeding, it selects areas with thorny or spiny vegetation below 1000 m elevation, such as Acacia, and lowveld. While foraging for food, they may fly 50 - 65 km each day and return to the roosting or nesting site in the evening. Small groups of red-billed queleas often mix with different weaver birds (Ploceus) and bishops (Euplectes), and in western Africa they may join the Sudan golden sparrow and various estrildids. Red-billed quelea may also roosts together with weavers, estrildids and barn swallows. Their life expectancy is two to three years in the wild, but one captive bird lived for eighteen years.|$|R

50|$|Harvesting {{is carried}} out {{manually}} over multiple successive pickings combined with sorting of the grapes. The grape-pickers are ordered to pick only those clusters or part-clusters which are either fully <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> have heightened sugar content brought about by noble rot.

50|$|Propagation is by seeds sown {{as soon as}} <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> {{they can}} be stored dry in {{airtight}} containers in a cool place {{for up to a}} year and then sown. Plants can be divided in the early spring, with a sharp spade or even an axe, chopping right through the middle. Softwood and hardwood cuttings are easy to root.|$|R
5000|$|The ripe {{fruit is}} eaten cooked or raw. Usually the <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> raw fruits are sliced, sun-dried and preserved.

25|$|To {{ensure that}} Passover {{did not start}} before spring, the {{tradition}} in ancient Israel held that {{the first day of}} Nisan would not start until the barley was ripe, being the test for the onset of spring. If the barley was not <b>ripe,</b> <b>or</b> various other phenomena indicated that spring was not yet imminent, an intercalary month (Adar II) would be added. However, since at least the 4th century, the date has been fixed mathematically.|$|R

50|$|The fruit are {{considered}} toxic, and force-feeding of either <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> unripe fruit {{has led to}} deaths in cattle. Free-ranging cattle apparently avoid feeding on the fruit.

Solasonine is the major glycoalkaloid in its foliage, stems, fruit and seeds, besides minor alkaloids which include solamargine, solanine and solasodine.|$|R
5000|$|For example, a Bayesian would {{model the}} color of a car as a {{probability}} distribution over (red, green, blue), assigning one number to each color.

25|$|Like other finches, the Gouldian finch is a seed eater. During the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian finches feed mostly on <b>ripe</b> <b>or</b> half-ripe grass seeds of sorghum. During the dry season, they forage {{on the ground}} for fallen seed. During the wet season, spinifex grass seed (Triodia sp.) is an important component of their diet. So far Gouldians have been recorded as consuming six different species of grass seed, but during crop analysis, researchers have yet to find evidence of insect consumption.|$|R
