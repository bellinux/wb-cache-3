40|$|The article {{studies the}} social aspects which {{can occur in}} the sector of road {{transport}}. The road transport is a sector with a fast progression and flexibility; however {{it does not have}} quite set up social conditions for workers in this domain. The social aspects exist in any kind of transport. There are many examples of strikes, including <b>railmen,</b> airline pilots, sailors, etc. Seriousness of this problem depends on many factors (financial situation in the sector, government social policy and help, severity of regulations, unemployment, structure in the sector (concentration of companies), competitive and work conditions. It is hard to say if social aspects in road transport are worse than in other kinds of transport, nevertheless the number of workers connected with road transport calls appeal for analysis of this problem {{from the point of view}} of social policy. In the Czech Republic there were in the last ten years the important changes of mobility in passenger and freight transport. The mentioned changes concerns all the relevant transport fields and first of all road and railway transport. The development of individual passenger transportation and the preference of road transport within goods transportation remain also nowadays. The enlargement of European Union influenced significantly the changes of modal split in transportation work and the Czech Republic became a member state. The alone integration of the Czech Republic into European structures we must evaluate definite positive, but in the field of transportation this step brings a lot of connected problems. Článek pojednává o sociálních aspektech objevujících se v sektoru silniční dopravy. Silniční přeprava nemá jako odvětví s rychlou progresí a flexibilitou, tak jak se rozvíjí jednotlivé prvky národního hospodářství, zcela upraveny sociální podmínky pro pracovníky v tomto oboru...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The research replicates {{a study of the}} activities and power of workplace union representatives already completed in the coal industry. The objectives of the study on the railway are as follows: 1. Firstly, to test further the methodology for the comparative analysis of workplace power developed in the coal study. 2. Using this methodology to identify the range and amount of power of Local Departmental Committee representatives (managers and 'shop stewards') over workplace activity. 3. To compare their activities and power with that of local NUM representatives in the coal industry. 4. To compare the activities and power of the NUR Local Departmental Committee (LDC) representatives with those of ASLEF LDC representatives. 5. To identify the structural, economic and attitudinal factors related to their activities and their power in order to explore further the relationships identified in the coal industry study. Main Topics : Variables The data consists of a set of secondary variables created from a number of primary data sets:- (1) Measures of power derived from a decision analysis. (2) Measures of size, performance, industrial action from background data collected for each location. (3) A questionnaire on attitudes to work, union and the LDC., etc., sent to a sample of ordinary <b>railmen</b> (i. e. not LDC representatives). (4) Questionnaires sent to all LDC representatives on their role, relationships, attitudes, etc. (5) A questionnaire handed to a spokesman representative from each LDC concerning role, relationships, attitudes, etc. (6) A questionnaire handed to management chairman of LDCs concerning role, relationships, attitudes, etc (7) An interview schedule administered to the management chairman and LDC spokesman about their involvement and influence in decision making.
