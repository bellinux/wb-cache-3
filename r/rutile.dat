5|$|Common {{titanium}} alloys {{are made by}} reduction. For example, cuprotitanium (<b>rutile</b> with copper added is reduced), ferrocarbon titanium (ilmenite reduced with coke in an electric furnace), and manganotitanium (<b>rutile</b> with manganese or manganese oxides) are reduced.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and <b>rutile.</b> All {{of these are}} white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see <b>rutile).</b> They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.|$|E
5|$|Collected from coastal waters, zircon-bearing sand is {{purified}} by spiral concentrators {{to remove}} lighter materials, {{which are then}} returned to the water because they are natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and <b>rutile</b> are removed.|$|E
5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, <b>rutile,</b> and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only <b>rutile</b> and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including <b>rutile,</b> calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. <b>Rutile</b> electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with <b>rutile,</b> provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|The heavy mineral sands ore {{deposits}} of the titanium ores ilmenite and <b>rutile</b> yield {{most of the}} mined zirconium, and therefore also most of the hafnium.|$|E
5|$|A more {{recently}} developed batch production method, the FFC Cambridge process, consumes titanium dioxide powder (a refined form of <b>rutile)</b> as feedstock and produces titanium metal, either powder or sponge. The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and takes less time. If mixed oxide powders are used, {{the product is}} an alloy.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1920s, Victor Moritz Goldschmidt {{and later}} Linus Pauling {{developed}} rules for eliminating chemically unlikely structures and {{for determining the}} relative sizes of atoms. These rules led {{to the structure of}} brookite (1928) and an understanding of the relative stability of the <b>rutile,</b> brookite and anatase forms of titanium dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{matter in}} oil shale {{contains}} fine-grained silicate and carbonate minerals such as calcite, dolomite, siderite, quartz, <b>rutile,</b> orthoclase, albite, anorthite, muscovite, amphipole, marcasite, limonite, gypsum, nahcolite, dawsonite and alum. Some oil-shale deposits also contain metals such as vanadium, zinc, copper, uranium among others.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium is a {{by-product}} of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and <b>rutile,</b> as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne, the price for unwrought zirconium metal decreased from $39,900 to $22,700 per ton. Zirconium metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive.|$|E
5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and <b>rutile,</b> and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein {{produced}} a similar substance, {{but could not}} identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in <b>rutile</b> from Boinik (German name of Bajmócska) village of Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia). Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.|$|E
5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, <b>rutile,</b> sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|More than 20 other {{minerals}} have higher dispersion (that is difference in refractive index for {{blue and red}} light) than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, strontium titanate 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic <b>rutile</b> 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of <b>rutile</b> or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally <b>rutile</b> and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{industries}} manufacturing items; coir, handlooms, and handicrafts employ {{around one}} million people. Kerala supplies 60% {{of the total}} global produce of white coir fibre. India's first coir factory {{was set up in}} Alleppey in 1859–60. The Central Coir Research Institute was established there in 1959. As per the 2006–2007 census by SIDBI, there are 1,468,104 micro, small and medium enterprises in Kerala employing 3,031,272 people. The KSIDC has promoted more than 650 medium and large manufacturing firms in Kerala, creating employment for 72,500 people. A mining sector of 0.3% of GSDP involves extraction of ilmenite, kaolin, bauxite, silica, quartz, <b>rutile,</b> zircon, and sillimanite. Other major sectors are tourism, manufacturing, home gardens, animal husbandry and business process outsourcing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rutile</b> is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} mineral sand. <b>Rutile</b> found in primary rock cannot be extracted hence the deposits containing <b>rutile</b> sand can be mined meaning a reduced availability to the high concentration ore. Crude titanium dioxide (in the form of <b>rutile</b> or synthetic <b>rutile)</b> is purified via converting to titanium tetrachloride in the chloride process. In this process, the crude ore (containing at least 70% TiO2) is reduced with carbon, oxidized with chlorine to give titanium tetrachloride; i.e., carbothermal chlorination. This titanium tetrachloride is distilled, and re-oxidized in a pure oxygen flame or plasma at 1500–2000K to give pure titanium dioxide while also regenerating chlorine. Aluminium chloride is often added to the process as a <b>rutile</b> promotor; the product is mostly anatase in its absence. The preferred raw material for the chloride process is natural <b>rutile</b> because of its high titanium dioxide content.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} method {{depends on the}} feedstock. The most common method {{for the production of}} titanium dioxide utilizes the mineral ilmenite. Ilmenite is mixed with sulfuric acid. This reacts to remove the iron oxide group in the ilmenite. The by-product iron(II) sulfate is crystallized and filtered-off to yield only the titanium salt in the digestion solution. This product is called synthetic <b>rutile.</b> This is further processed in a similar way to <b>rutile</b> to give the titanium dioxide product. Synthetic <b>rutile</b> and titanium slags are made especially for titanium dioxide production. The use of ilminite ore usually only produces pigment grade titanium dioxide. Another method for the production of synthetic <b>rutile</b> from ilmenite utilizes the Becher Process.|$|E
25|$|The oxides are commercially {{important}} ores of titanium. The {{metal can}} also be mined from other minerals such as ilmenite or leucoxene ores, {{or one of the}} purest forms, <b>rutile</b> beach sand. Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from <b>rutile</b> impurities present in them.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} {{success of}} synthetic <b>rutile</b> was also {{hampered by the}} material's inescapable yellow tint, which producers {{were never able to}} remedy. However, synthetic <b>rutile</b> in a range of different colors, including blues and reds, were produced using various metal oxide dopants. These and the near-white stones were extremely popular if unreal stones. Synthetic <b>rutile</b> is also fairly soft (hardness ~6) and brittle, and therefore wears poorly. It is synthesized via a modification of the Verneuil process, which uses a third oxygen pipe to create a tricone burner; this is necessary to produce a single crystal, due to the much higher oxygen losses involved in the oxidation of titanium. The technique was invented by Charles H. Moore, Jr. at the South Amboy, New Jersey-based National Lead Company (later NL Industries). National Lead and Union Carbide were the primary producers of synthetic <b>rutile,</b> and peak annual production reached 750,000 carats (150nbsp&kg). Some of the many commercial names applied to synthetic <b>rutile</b> include: Astryl, Diamothyst, Gava or Java Gem, Meredith, Miridis, Rainbow Diamond, Rainbow Magic Diamond, Rutania, Titangem, Titania, and Ultamite.|$|E
25|$|Other {{minerals}} {{found in}} the Welkom vicinity include calcite, iridium, isoferroplatinum, muscovite, pyrophylite, <b>rutile</b> and uranite.|$|E
25|$|Both anatase and <b>rutile</b> TiO2 can intercalate cations, {{acting as}} anode {{material}} in Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries.|$|E
25|$|Improvements used include color alteration, {{improving}} transparency by dissolving <b>rutile</b> inclusions, {{healing of}} fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.|$|E
25|$|Bonthe District {{has one of}} the world's largest {{deposits}} of titanium ore (<b>rutile)</b> in the world. Sierra <b>Rutile</b> Limited, owned by a consortium of US and European investors, began commercial mining operations in Bonthe in early 1979. Due to poor mining policy, the region has little to show for this huge economic potential. There are no good roads, water supply or electricity. Bonthe District continues to suffer from one of the worst environmental degradation episodes in living memory.|$|E
25|$|The first {{heating process}} during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates {{impurities}} inside the fractures. Although {{this can be}} done at temperatures up to 1400°C (2500°F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900°C (1600°F) since the <b>rutile</b> silk is still intact.|$|E
25|$|Generally, as zircon is {{the most}} {{valuable}} component and a critical ore component, high-zircon sands are the most valuable. Thereafter, <b>rutile,</b> leucoxene and then ilmenite {{in terms of value}} given to the ore. As a generality, typically the valuable components of the THM concentrate rarely exceed 30%.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{crystals}} of garnet {{are still}} used as gemstones. The gemstone varieties occur {{in shades of}} green, red, yellow, and orange. In the US it {{is known as the}} birthstone for January. It is the state mineral of Connecticut, New York's gemstone, and star garnet (garnet with <b>rutile</b> asterisms) is the state gemstone of Idaho.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of grown diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic zirconia arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in lasers and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier synthetics, such as synthetic strontium titanate, synthetic <b>rutile,</b> YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) and GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet).|$|E
25|$|National Lead {{was also}} where {{research}} into the synthesis of another titanium compound—strontium titanate (SrTiO3, pure tausonite)—was conducted. Research was done during the late 1940s and early 1950s by Leon Merker and Langtry E. Lynd, who also used a tricone modification of the Verneuil process. Upon its commercial introduction in 1955, strontium titanate quickly replaced synthetic <b>rutile</b> as the most popular diamond simulant. This was due not only to strontium titanate's novelty, but to its superior optics: its RI (2.41) {{is very close to}} that of diamond, while its dispersion (0.19), although also very high, was a significant improvement over synthetic rutile's psychedelic display. Dopants were also used to give synthetic titanate a variety of colors, including yellow, orange to red, blue, and black. The material is also isotropic like diamond, meaning there is no distracting doubling of facets as seen in synthetic <b>rutile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The source rocks {{which provide}} the heavy mineral sands {{determine}} {{the composition of}} the economic minerals. The source of zircon, monazite, <b>rutile,</b> sometimes tungsten, and some ilmenite is usually granite. The source of ilmenite, garnet, sapphire and diamond is ultramafic and mafic rocks, such as kimberlite or basalt. Garnet is also sourced commonly from metamorphic rocks, such as amphibolite schists. Precious metals are sourced from ore deposits hosted within metamorphic rocks.|$|E
25|$|Rose quartz {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a pale pink to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese, in the massive material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic <b>rutile</b> needles which produces an asterism in transmitted light. Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the massive quartz.|$|E
25|$|Indian Rare Earths Limited, a Government of India {{undertaking}} {{under the}} Department of Atomic Energy which incorporated on 18 August 1950, has four production plants: Minerals Divisions at Chavara and Manavalakurichi and an OSCOM and Rare Earths Division at Aluva. IREL is {{a pioneer in}} the mining and separation of heavy minerals (such as ilmenite, <b>rutile,</b> zircon, sillimanite, garnet and monazite) from sand. IREL also conducts research and development in mining and minerals.|$|E
25|$|As one example, Pauling {{considered}} the three mineral forms of titanium dioxide, {{each with a}} coordination number of 6 for the Ti4+ cations. The most stable (and most abundant) form is <b>rutile,</b> in which the coordination octahedra are arranged so that each one shares only two edges (and no faces) with adjoining octahedra. The other two, less stable, forms are brookite and anatase, in which each octahedron shares three and four edges respectively with adjoining octahedra.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, 750,000 {{tons per}} year of Ilmenite is being {{exported}} by QMM to Canada, with a potential for this to grow to 2 million {{tons per year}}. (In addition, 25,000 tons per year of Zircon and 15,000 tons per year of <b>Rutile</b> is also being produced {{as part of their}} Ilmenite mining—see below). The estimated life of this mine is 40 years. Almost $1 billion was spent developing this mine, including a new harbor at Port Ehoala.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} diamond simulants are high-leaded glass (i.e., rhinestones) and cubic {{zirconia}} (CZ), both artificial materials. A {{number of other}} artificial materials, such as strontium titanate and synthetic <b>rutile</b> have been developed since the mid-1950s, but these {{are no longer in}} common use. Introduced {{at the end of the}} 20th century, the lab-grown product moissanite has gained popularity as an alternative to diamond. The high price of gem-grade diamonds, as well as significant ethical concerns of the diamond trade, have created a large demand for diamond simulants.|$|E
