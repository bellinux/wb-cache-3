40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and analyze the case of a recent social {{mobilization}} which involved a Mapuche community in the southern <b>region</b> of Argentina, <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>Patagonia.</b> An “ancestral recovery of land” was claimed to be the objective of the action. Several conflicts emerged due to the fact that the land in conflict is part of the Nahuel Huapi National Park, which implied a straightforward questioning of the National State rights over territory. Apart from that, the recovery process was strongly rejected by local residents. This brought about a new conflict that required the local government's mediation. </span...|$|R
