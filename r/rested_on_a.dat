5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
5|$|The ships' main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets. The fore turret in each ship, except , {{was designed by}} Eads while the aft turret was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors. Unlike the latter, which rested its entire weight on a central spindle {{that had to be}} elevated in order for the turret to rotate, Eads' design better distributed its weight because it <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of ball bearings underneath {{the outer edge of the}} turret. The structure of the Eads turret extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated. The guns in the Eads turret were mounted on a steam-powered platform that moved up and down, so that the guns could be reloaded below deck, safe from enemy interference.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E

25|$|During the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), {{scholars}} and philosophers adapted {{the notion of}} ganying into different fields. For Han cosmologists, ganying was important in both human-cosmos and state-cosmos correspondences. During the Han era, Henderson (1984: 37) says both imperial ideology and political criticism <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> world view shaped by correlative cosmology, which facilitated the wide dissemination of correlative modes of thinking {{among members of the}} politically-engaged Han elite.|$|E
25|$|During the 1848 revolution, a new Reich {{coat of arms}} {{was adopted}} by the National Assembly that convened in St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt. The black double-headed eagle was retained, but without the four symbols of the emperor: the sword, the {{imperial}} orb, the sceptre and the crown. The eagle <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> golden shield; above was a five-pointed golden star. On both sides the shield was flanked by three flags with the colours black-red-gold. The emblem, however, never gained general acceptance.|$|E

25|$|Counter-insurgency {{operations}} are common during war, occupation and armed rebellions. Counter-insurgency may be armed suppression of a rebellion, coupled with tactics such as divide and rule designed to fracture {{the links between}} the insurgency and the population in which the insurgents move. Because {{it may be difficult}} or impossible to distinguish between an insurgent, a supporter of an insurgency who is a non-combatant, and entirely uninvolved members of the population, counter-insurgency operations have often <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> confused, relativistic, or otherwise situational distinction between insurgents and non-combatants.|$|E
25|$|The box-trail {{carriage}} revolved on a turntable {{that sat}} on a ball race on the firing platform and was capable of 360° traverse. The end of the carriage rested on rollers which <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> metal track or rail. For transport the K 39 broke down into three loads, the barrel, the carriage and the firing platform with the turntable. Each of these was carried on a trailer with pneumatic tires. Emplacing the gun took six to eight hours, mainly to dig in and anchor the firing platform.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of Kalantaka {{is found in}} Agamic texts. The right foot should be <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lotus-pedestal (padma-pitha) and the left leg lifted to kick Yama, just touching his chest. The leg positions are reversed in some textual descriptions. Sometimes, Shiva is depicted as rising from the linga that Markandeya is worshipping and his right leg is buried in the linga while the left one raised to strike Yama. Shiva, depicted red in anger, should have a third eye on the forehead, a jatamukuta (a crown of matted hair), lateral tusks and four or eight arms.|$|E

25|$|These new court {{decisions}} <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> series of documents {{recovered from the}} National Archives showing {{that the government had}} altered, suppressed, and withheld important and relevant information from the Supreme Court, including the Final Report by General DeWitt justifying the internment program. The Army had destroyed documents in an effort to hide alterations that had been made to the report to reduce their racist content. The coram nobis cases vacated the convictions of Korematsu and Hirabayashi (Yasui died before his case was heard, rendering it moot), and are regarded as part of the impetus to gain passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.|$|E
25|$|After Buckingham {{retired in}} 1676, Lady Charlotte Fitzroy, Charles II's daughter, moved in {{when she married}} Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield. The Crown {{authorised}} extensive rebuilding that included adding a storey, giving it three main floors, an attic and basement. This structure can be seen today as the rear section of Number 10. (See Plan of the Premises Granted to the Earl and Countess of Lichfield in 1677) The likely reason that repair was required is that the house had settled in the swampy ground near the Thames, causing structural damage. Like Downing Street, it <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shallow foundation, a design error that caused problems until 1960 when the modern Number 10 was rebuilt on deep pilings.|$|E
25|$|The {{pillars of}} the 3x3 bay gate were sunk {{directly}} into the ground, rather than their being supported on base stones; similar sunken pillars may be found at Ise Jingū. The central pillar of the 3x3 bay pagoda <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> base stone a metre below the podium on which it stood, as in the later examples at Hōryū-ji and Hōrin-ji. The base stones, uniquely carved with lotus petals, of the kondō reveal a 3x2 bay central core or moya and unusually narrow side bays. The base stones of the 8x4 bay lecture hall include holes bored for swing doors. The precinct itself extended 22 bays east to west, some eighty-four metres between the outer walls.|$|E

25|$|For the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Cathy Freeman {{walked across}} a {{circular}} {{pool of water}} and ignited the cauldron through the water, surrounding herself within a ring of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp {{to the top of}} the stadium. When it was discovered what the problem was, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued up the ramp, where it finally <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tall silver pedestal.|$|E
25|$|Specialists in Europe's Early Modern {{witchcraft}} beliefs {{view the}} pagan witch-cult theory as pseudohistorical; {{there is an}} academic consensus among experts that those accused and executed as witches during the period were not members of any witch religion, whether pre-Christian or Satanic in nature. Critics highlight that the theory <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> highly selective use of the evidence from the trials, thereby heavily misrepresenting the events and the actions of both the accused and their accusers. Further, {{they point out that}} it relied on the erroneous assumption that the claims made by accused witches were truthful and not distorted by coercion and torture. They also note that despite claims that the witch-cult was a pre-Christian survival, {{there is no evidence of}} such a pagan witch-cult throughout the intervening Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Every temple <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> masonry base {{called the}} crepidoma, {{generally}} of three steps, {{of which the}} upper one which carried the columns was the stylobate. Masonry walls were employed for temples from about 600 BC onwards. Masonry of all types was used for ancient Greek buildings, including rubble, but the finest ashlar masonry was usually employed for temple walls, in regular courses and large sizes to minimise the joints. The blocks were rough hewn and hauled from quarries to be cut and bedded very precisely, with mortar hardly ever being used. Blocks, particularly those of columns {{and parts of the}} building bearing loads were sometimes fixed in place or reinforced with iron clamps, dowels and rods of wood, bronze or iron fixed in lead to minimise corrosion.|$|E

25|$|Karl Wilhelm Naundorff's story <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} {{complicated}} intrigues. According to him, Barras determined {{to save the}} dauphin in order to please Joséphine de Beauharnais, the future empress, having conceived {{the idea of using}} the dauphin's existence as a means of dominating the comte de Provence {{in the event of a}} restoration. The dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent, to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution, replaced the wooden figure with a deaf mute, who was presently exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate. The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the dead child, but the dauphin who left the prison in the coffin, to be retrieved by friends before it reached the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Like the harpsichord, the virginals has {{its origins}} in the medieval psaltery to which a {{keyboard}} was applied, probably in the 15th century. The first mention of the word is in Paulus Paulirinus of Prague's (1413–1471) Tractatus de musica of around 1460 where he writes: The virginal is an instrument {{in the shape of}} a clavichord, having metal strings which give it the timbre of a clavicembalo. It has 32 courses of strings set in motion by striking the fingers on projecting keys, giving a dulcet tone in both whole and half steps. It is called a virginal because, like a virgin, it sounds with a gentle and undisturbed voice. The OED records its first mention in English in 1530, when King Henry VIII purchased five instruments so named. Small early virginals were played either in the lap, or more commonly, <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> table, but nearly all later examples were provided with their own stands.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016 {{part of a}} {{pedestrian}} footbridge connecting areas of Ryarsh divided by the motorway was brought down - initially suspected {{to be the result}} of an impact by a digger from nearby works to widen the southbound bridge at junction 4 being carried on a low-loader that was moving along the hard shoulder. In the incident, the southern section of the bridge - which <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plinth south of the motorway and the cantilevered northern section - was dislodged and fell onto the carriageway below, landing on the trailer of a passing HGV and being narrowly avoided by a motorcyclist who suffered broken ribs taking avoiding action. Both carriageways of the motorway were closed to enable the removal of the broken section. The motorway reopened with the Highways Agency having declared that the northern part of the bridge was structurally intact. However this section of the motorway was again closed on the weekend of 3 and 4 September 2016 for the demolition and clearance of the northern bridge element.|$|E
