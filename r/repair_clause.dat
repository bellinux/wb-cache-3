5000|$|January 17: Iraq {{agrees to}} talks {{concerning}} a U.N. plan {{to allow for}} the Iraqi sale of $1 billion of oil for 90 days for a 180-day trial period. Under U.N. Resolution 986, proceeds from the sale would be used for humanitarian purposes. In the past, Iraq has opposed clauses 6 and 8b contained in Resolution 986. Clause 6 stipulates that oil exports under this plan must pass through the [...] Iraq-Turkey pipeline, which currently is unusable because of sludge build-ups and pumping station damage. By most estimates, the line would take a minimum of three months to <b>repair.</b> <b>Clause</b> 8b states that part of the proceeds from the sales would be disbursed under U.N. supervision to Kurdish provinces in northern Iraq. Negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations are scheduled to begin February 6, 1996. (FT, PON, DJ) ...|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{the visible}} spare parts used to repair a complex product in order to restore its {{original}} appearance has been for years an issue of vivid discussions in the European Union. Generally, it is a dispute involving large motor car manufactures (owners of exclusive rights to the registered industrial designs) and independent (not related to motor car concerns) spare part producers, in which the former demand protection, arguing that the exclusive rights granted to them constitute compensation for their outlays, while the latter claim that such protection should be abolished because the spare-parts-market has been monopolised, thus making them incapable of competing legally with manufacturers of original spare parts. The Polish legislator has resolved the dispute {{in a similar way}} as some other EU member states, i. e. by incorporating a <b>repair</b> <b>clause</b> in the Act on industrial property and excluded protection of the manufactured good as an element of a complex one used to restore its original appearance. The paper refers to the discussion that has been still going on within the EU, and which had influenced the decision o f the Polish legislator. The author presents different concepts and solutions proposed in recent years and the current standpoint of the deciding bodies in the EU. The <b>repair</b> <b>clause</b> in Polish legislation is not subject of those considerations...|$|E
40|$|Geotechnical {{uncertainty}} may be {{the most}} difficult risk to manage in construction. In design-build (DB), where the project’s price is fixed before design and in many cases the subsurface investigation is complete, the risk profile is fundamentally changed and the owner must address it. This paper assesses the potential of DB as a tool for addressing geotechnical uncertainty in public transportation projects by comparatively evaluating three successful approaches. The first case study involves the use of a geotechnical baseline report as a subsurface condition risk allocation tool. The second uses unit price pay items inside the larger lump sum contract to share the geotechnical risk with the design-builder. Finally, a “nested DB” landslide <b>repair</b> <b>clause</b> inside a design-bid-build interstate highway contract successfully addressed the post-award potential landslide risk. The paper concludes that each of the contractual management approaches provided an effective means for addressing geotechnical uncertainty in DB public transportation projects...|$|E
40|$|This lecture was {{delivered}} on 17 March 2010. Alan Schwartz, Sterling Professor of Law; Professor of Management, Yale UniversityThis Lecture argues {{that much of}} the contract law in the cases (the US, the UK and Canada) and in the codes (Europe and Latin America) is unnecessary. To say that a law is unnecessary is to say that it does not perform a useful social function. The argument below thus sets out the functions that contract laws today are thought to serve, and then shows that many of those functions either should not be performed at all or should be performed by institutions other than courts. Also, the unnecessary functions increase transaction costs because parties must contract away from or otherwise adjust to them. It is helpful at the outset to set out the argument’s domain. First, the argument applies to sophisticated parties, who usually are firms. Firms have enough at stake, and possess or can get sufficient expertise, to create written contracts. For these same reasons, firms often litigate over deals that do not work out. As a consequence, contract law primarily regulates transactions between firms. Second, the argument applies to the law that courts enforce. The common law is judge made. European Civil Codes are written on high levels of abstraction, and so much of the living law in Europe also is judge made. It also is helpful to set out the norm that governs the argument. Western law is formally committed to the norm of freedom of contract; parties can make their own deals. An immediate implication of this commitment is that parties should be free to alter or reject parts of the state supplied contract law that do not advance the parties’ interests. Western contract law follows this implication, at least in its formal statement. Thus, almost every provision of the US Uniform Commercial Code can be varied by agreement of the parties, and few sections of Civil Codes are explicitly made mandatory. It is customary to refer to rules parties can vary or avoid as defaults. A contract law is largely composed of defaults. An apparent, but controversial, implication of the ubiquity of defaults holds that defaults should reflect majoritarian party preferences. If parties can vary or reject laws they dislike, then supplying parties with laws they dislike cannot advance any social goal. This simple point raises the question what do parties like. Firms contract to maximize gains from trade. As a simple example, if sellers have a comparative advantage at repairing defective machines, then the privately negotiated contract will require the seller to repair. But if defects sometimes are the result of buyer misuse, then the repair obligation will be carefully qualified. Parties in this circumstance will reject or alter a state supplied warranty that is not carefully qualified. This analysis leads to the syllogism that governs this Lecture: (i) A contract law should implement the preferences over rules that firms typically have; (ii) Firms prefer rules that maximize their expected surplus from trade: that is, firms prefer efficient rules; (iii) Therefore, a contract law should contain only efficient rules. Few contract law rules, it is argued below, can satisfy an efficiency test. Before reaching the argument, it will be helpful to illustrate the institutional limitation noted above. Monopoly power is inefficient. This justifies the antitrust laws, which attempt to deter or curb monopoly power. Suppose then that a firm, arguably possessing monopoly power, qualifies its obligation to repair defective machines. Should a court strike the qualification if a buyer sues to obtain broader protection? This Lecture argues not. If the source of the seller’s market power remains, the seller probably will supply buyers with <b>repair</b> <b>clauses,</b> or substitute other clauses, that buyers prefer less. Eliminating monopoly power is useful; judicial regulation of a monopolist’s contracts is not...|$|R
40|$|UK {{commercial}} property lease structures {{have come under}} considerable scrutiny {{during the past decade}} since the property crash of the early 1990 s. In particular, tenants complained that the system was unfair and that it has blocked business change. Government is committed, through its 2001 election manifesto, to promote flexibility and choice in the {{commercial property}} lettings market and a new voluntary Commercial Leases Code of Practice was launched in April 2002. This paper investigates whether occupiers are being offered the leases they require or whether there is a mismatch between occupier requirements and actual leases in the market. It draws together the substantial data now available on the actual terms of leases in the UK and surveys of corporate occupiers' attitude to their occupation requirements. Although the data indicated that UK leases have become shorter and more diverse since 1990, this is still not sufficient to meet the current requirements of many corporate occupiers. It is clear that the inability to manage entry and exit strategies is a major concern to occupiers. Lease length is the primary concern of tenants and a number of respondents comment on the mismatch between lease length in the UK and business planning horizons. The right to break and other problems with alienation clauses also pose serious difficulties for occupiers, thus reinforcing the mismatch. Other issues include <b>repairing</b> and insuring <b>clauses</b> and the type of review clause. There are differences in opinion between types of occupier. In particular, international corporate occupiers are significantly more concerned about the length of lease and the incidence of break clauses than national occupiers and private-sector tenants are significantly more concerned about leasing in general than public-sector occupiers. Proposed solutions by tenants are predictable and include shorter leases, more frequent breaks and relaxation of restrictions concerning alienation and other clauses. A significant number specify that they would pay more for shorter leases and other improved terms. Short leases would make many of the other terms more acceptable and this is why they are the main concern of corporate occupiers. Overall, the evidence suggests that there continues to be a gap between occupiers' lease requirements and those currently offered by the market. There are underlying structural factors that act as an inertial force on landlords and inhibit the changes which occupiers appear to want. Nevertheless, the findings raise future research questions concerning whether UK lease structures are a constraining factor on UK competitiveness...|$|R
