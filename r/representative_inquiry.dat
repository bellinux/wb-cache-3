The {{purpose of this study is}} to show both the coexistence and potential contradictory nature of these two approaches on selected current issues of social and legal {{protection of children}} (boundary of criminal liability, institutional or protective care and replacement care of parentless children). While mapping the expert discourse is based on scientific knowledge of the issue, mapping the public opinion uses data of a <b>representative</b> <b>inquiry</b> aimed at the study of opinions of the Czech population in 2015 (n = 1. 050).

A connection between calcium-deficient nutrition and other unhealthy lifestyles such as lack of exercise, smoking (> 10 cigarettes/day) and regular alcohol intake (several glasses/day) has been shown by multivariate analysis. Therefore one has to suspect, that every third to fourth woman having several risk factors is at risk at entry in menopause.

However, when there is no union present the right is inappropriate because employers have the authority to deal with employees on an individual basis and the right to the presence of another employee interferes with that. The NLRB further explained that a representative protects the interests not just of the individual employee, but of the entire collective bargaining unit. As a result, giving employees in non-unionized workplaces is like requiring the employer to deal with the equivalent of a union representative which is not intended by the NLRA.

The results of the survey and round table discussions reveal widespread stakeholder acknowledgement of the significant progress undertaken in Australian coastal and climate change policy since late 2008, catalysed by the House of <b>Representatives</b> <b>Inquiry</b> into climate change impacts in coastal areas (Australian Government 2010), and extended by the ongoing release of data associated with the First Pass National Assessment of climate change impacts to coastal Australia (Department of Climate Change 2009).

The audit of local adaptation planning practice show that some local government areas are well underway towards progressing holistic climate change adaptation strategies spanning multiple sectors of local responsibility, but others have neither engaged, nor anticipate engaging in, adaptation planning activities. Of those areas that have commenced adaptation planning, most strategies and commitments will require additional resourcing and external expertise to implement in the future...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} inquiries into genetic engineering, especially concerning {{environmental release}} of GMOs, in Australia and New Zealand. It {{argues that the}} inquiries form integral sites of GM regimes of governance. Following Michel Foucault-governance refers to those techniques, mechanisms, strategies, practices and interventions that serve or strive to regulate, discipline and control certain 'problem populations' primarily for purposes of maintaining order. Sites of governance though extend beyond state power to include technoscientific networks, regulatory agencies, state ministries, the media, policy networks, and many agencies of civil society. Society thus becomes 'governable' through the interventions and rationale of a policy field-or the exertion of a plural configuration of strategic interests. In the case of biotechnology, a 'community' of bio-elites has traditionally been able to configure governance to their interests. Part of that configuring has been to adopt the conventional approach to governance of relying increasingly on technical knowledge in and around a nexus of regulation and control. Here, truth and rationality become predicated upon the articulation of certain bodies of organised knowledge {{more to do with}} the imperatives of governance for industrial society than of impartial scientific inquiry. The textual narrative of bioscience-which offers bio-utopian deterministic, benign and utilitarian outcomes-has assumed policy dominance as that truth and rationality. Certain inquiries in Australia and New Zealand-specifically Australia's 1992 House of <b>Representatives</b> <b>Inquiry</b> into Genetic Manipulation and New Zealand's Royal Commission on Genetic Modification-we argue, represent a key part of that textualising terrain for GM governance. They have tended to reinforce and legitimise modernist policy narratives of science and GM, and disempower other contesting ways of knowledge concerning GM, especially environmentalist ones. In this way these inquires, which can be seen as processes to gain public trust, in marginalising public input, have instead heightened mistrust in the governance of genetic engineering.

500|$|The Court {{held that}} in this case the NLRB's {{interpretation}} of Section 7 was permissible because union representation at employer inquiries constitutes [...] "concerted activity for mutual aid or protection" [...] under the statute. While a particular inquiry might only have implications for one worker, each employee has an interest in the outcome as it establishes rules they will have to follow in the future. The Court further pointed out that having a representative present will help the employee who may be too [...] "fearful or inarticulate" [...] to accurately participate in the investigation as well as the employer by eliciting facts and helping find other sources for the investigation. The Court also pointed out that requiring a union <b>representative</b> at <b>inquiries</b> was consistent with actual labor practice as something already found in many workplaces.

40|$|Australia {{has seen}} {{significant}} growth in international education since the de-regulation {{of the late}} 1980 &# 8217;s, and has also yielded significant benefits since that time. Beyond the fee revenue upon which institutions have become increasingly reliant, international students have made {{a significant contribution to}} our academic environment and local community. Many opportunities have been created, and many lives have been changed. Many lasting friendships,and significant international ties have been forged in the process. To a large extent this growth, along with its many benefits, has been taken for granted. Reinvestment in and positive reform of international education is now required if Australia is to remain a preferred destination for international students. Although the Commonwealth Government bears overall responsibility for Australia&# 8217;s higher education system, responsibilities in support of international education also extend to State and Local Governments. Universities themselves have a prudential interest in ensuring the sustainability of Australian International Education. Responsibilities in doing so extend beyond aggressive (and sometimes questionable) marketing practices and recruitment strategies, to include a broad range of quality, equity and welfare concerns. Australia remains among the most popular international education destinations for good reasons. International students on the whole offer positive evaluations of their experience of living and studying in Australia. We have the opportunity to continue be a leader internationally in providing a safe, welcoming and vibrant academic culture for many of the world&# 8217;s aspiring leaders in government, industry and research. However, this can only be achieved through genuine investment in quality, and through ensuring flexibility, affordability, opportunity and a genuine approach to resources andsupport for international postgraduate students. This submission outlines some of the key issues from the perspective of international postgraduate students. The following sections address the attractiveness of Australia as a destination for study, the interests and needs of international postgraduate students and outlines opportunities for positive reform.

How intense are these worries {{in the general}} population?Methods: An <b>inquiry</b> <b>representative</b> of the German population (N= 2473, age> 14 years) was performed. The total score of the “Questionnaire for Assessing Subjective Physical Well-Being“ (FEW) and the screening scale of the “Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress“ (TICS) were correlated with the four above mentioned items addressing worries (range 1 - 4). Results: Worries about one’s {{financial situation}} were scored highest (mean= 2. 04, SD= 0. 92), followed by worries about one’s health (mean= 1. 94; SD= 0. 87), one’s family (mean= 1. 85; SD= 0. 86) and worries about one’s job (mean= 1. 69; SD= 0. 92).

In the following submission to the House of <b>Representatives</b> <b>Inquiry</b> into the role of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system and its operation, this Project Team seeks to establish a case for: 1. Funding to enable TAFE to continue as: a) an equity pathway to social inclusion, employment, and to university, particularly in regional areas. b) an integral complement to the University education sector to deliver on the ambitious objectives of the Federal Government’s widening participation agenda, as a mechanism to deliver the skills, knowledge and workforce needed now, and in the future, in the Australian economy. 2. Increased resources for separate and joint sector development a) Publicly funded TAFEs need funding to be restored and increased to enable them to maintain the high quality education they provide and to maintain their successful work in supporting communities, regions and disadvantaged individuals to gain skills, training and employment. b) Universities need increased funding to increase staffing levels and therefore free up teaching staff to spend the necessary time to develop relationships with and provide support to students. This is important for the achieving the goals of the widening participation agenda of increasing access without increasing attrition at the same time. c) TAFEs and Universities need funding to do the work required to further develop and formalise diploma-degree pathways so that disadvantaged individuals can exit into employment at the diploma level or be supported in an efficient and seamless way to undertake further study. 3. Active use of localised and nuanced partnership approaches by education institutions. This includes: • Cross teaching by TAFEs and Universities in courses that can be articulated, such as professional practice diplomas and degrees • Programs negotiated and designed according to the needs of students in each location. TAFEs and Universities need resources in order to do this work • Focus on regional centres where there is a particular opportunity for government to make an impact on TAFE pathways to employment and/or further education • Workforce development in regional areas due to new industries is a particular area of need 4. Recognise and capitalise on the complementary and symbiotic nature of each sector’s skills, strengths and capacities. The submission responds to the second, third and fifth points of the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry and is based on the research work carried out by the Project Team in 2012 / 13. We provide evidence of Gordon TAFE in Geelong working as an equity mechanism in the particular case of the welfare/ community services diploma to social work degree pathway. The project team considers that there is a strong case for additional resourcing of TAFE to enable it to continue what it does well. TAFE is the key training and education sectorthe ‘education and social hub’that can successfully attract, retain, and graduate people who may not otherwise access education due to one or more combinations of: 1. having a low SES current or past background; 2. living in regional areas; 3. receiving interrupted primary and secondary education; 4. having disabilities; 5. being sole parents; 6. being from refugee backgrounds; 7. having English as an additional language/culture; 8. retrenchment from employment in dying industries; 9. short, medium and long term unemployment; 10. past and/or current caring roles; 11. marriage/relationship breakdowns; 12. domestic violence; 13. gender, class, age, race/ethnicity and dis/ability discriminations; and 14. socialised expectations and fears. The recommendations in this submission are based on research findings about important similarities and differences between Gordon TAFE welfare and Deakin University social work students in Geelong, and their respective institutional organisations and contexts. The two institutions employ a repertoire of diverse administrative, teaching, learning and support approaches to meet different mission goals, requirements and needs. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The strongest {{arguments}} for renationalisation {{have come from}} the government itself, according to John Quiggin THE problem of the ownership of Telstra {{has been one of the}} few issues to remain near the top of the Howard government‘s agenda throughout its six years in office, and looks set to remain there for years to come. Paradoxically, in the process of arguing for the privatisation of Telstra, the Howard government has provided some of the sharpest formulations of the case for renationalisation of Telstra’s core telecommunications business. The first element of the case for renationalisation is the observation that Telstra’s ownership structure, with the government owning a bare majority of shares and the rest in private hands, is untenable. As Peter Costello observed three years ago: “Telstra should all be either privately owned, or if people really think that nationalisation and government ownership is necessary they ought to have the courage of their convictions and nationalise it. ” The second element is the observation that Telstra’s corporate structure, combining the basic role of a common carrier for Australian telecommunications with a wide range of peripheral ventures, is unsatisfactory. On the one hand, the potential for cross-subsidies creates problems for Telstra’s own corporate governance. On the other, the fact that a monopoly provider of essential services is also a leading user of those services for the provision of internet and entertainment content makes effective regulation almost impossible. The government has now established a House of <b>Representatives</b> <b>inquiry</b> into Telstra’s structure. Even if motivated in part by a desire to embarrass Labor, this inquiry should provide a valuable forum. The third point in the case for renationalisation is that the core components of Telstra are worth more in public ownership than in private ownership. The government has accepted that, at the current share price, the proceeds from a sale of Telstra would not justify the loss of its earnings. Conversely, the cost of repurchasing shares in Telstra would be more than offset by the benefits of the associated earnings. All of this raises the questions: how much is Telstra worth in public ownership and why is there a difference between this value and the value attributed to Telstra by the stockmarket? The first question may be answered by estimating the likely growth of Telstra’s earnings and calculating the amount of debt those earnings could service. The relevant figure is Telstra’s post-tax earnings, including interest and the value of dividend imputation credits. For the past couple of years, the combined value of post-tax earnings and imputation credits has been about 40 cents a share, enough to service $ 6. 70 of debt at an interest rate of 6 per cent. Thus, on the very conservative assumption that Telstra’s profits will remain stable in nominal terms, the government ought to be looking for a share price of at least $ 6. 70. On the more reasonable, but still conservative, assumption of stable real profits, the value of shares in public ownership is about $ 10. This is close to the share price prevailing early in 2000, when some elements of Telstra, such as the dot com activities, were valued by markets at considerably more than their value in public ownership. I suggested at the time that the government should sell off these activities “while the new-economy bubble lasts” (“Foot in each camp untenable for Telstra”, Australian Financial Review, 30 March 2000). Had that advice been taken, the Australian public would have gained billions of dollars and restored full ownership of Telstra into the bargain. Fluctuations in sharemarkets are one reason why the value of an asset such as Telstra in public ownership differs from its market value. In addition, these very fluctuations mean that holders of equity demand a higher rate of return than do investors in government bonds, reducing the market value. In addition, the fact that Telstra is a regulated monopoly creates externality costs that are internalised when the government is the owner as well as the regulator. The widely held view that this situation involves a conflict of interest gets things precisely back to front. Governments exist to resolve conflicts of interest like this. Against this, private ownership tends to produce greater responsiveness to market trends and, less reliably, improved operational efficiency. For most firms, these advantages outweigh the problems with sharemarkets, so that the firm is worth more in private than in public ownership. As the data shows, however, the reverse is true for Telstra. The government has gathered all the pieces of the case for renationalisation. It remains to put them together and draw the logical conclusion.

40|$|Increasing the {{cultural}} and linguistic diversity of the teaching workforce in Australia was a key recommendation of the House of <b>Representatives</b> Standing Committee <b>Inquiry</b> into Teacher Education in their report, Top of the Class (written by L. Hartsuyker). The report reflects findings from national and international research that support the need to increase {{the diversity of the}} teaching profession as a means to improve student outcomes, particularly given the increasingly diverse make-up of student populations. The Hartsuyker Report also notes, as a "national concern", the relatively low enrolment of World English-speaking (WES) students in Australian teacher education courses and calls for targeted funding by the federal government for further research into why this is the case (as discussed by J. Han and M. Singh in 2007). This paper seeks to add to current research on the attraction and retention of WES students into Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes in Australia. It does so by relating some of the key findings from a case study of three WES Education Assistants, originally from Malaysia, who retrained to become teachers through an ITE programme at an Australian university. Significantly, {{as a result of a}} partnership developed between a school and a university, they entered the programme through an alternative access course, were awarded Recognition of Prior Learning for their work experience, and were able to remain in their community while studying externally. They were also provided ongoing mentoring support by the teaching staff and myself as programme co-ordinator. This paper aims to add to current research in this field by identifying the key driving and restraining forces that impacted on their ability to become teachers via an Australian ITE programme...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The Howard government’s {{family law}} reforms {{presented}} a {{unique set of}} power relations that Non-Government Community Service Organisations (NGCSOs) had to negotiate in the policy process. How NGCSOs negotiated networks of power through their participation in this reform process offered a fruitful area of enquiry for the study of political influence in policy development. A governmentality approach framed the conceptualisation of power and power relations and the strategies and tactics used by NGCSOs to negotiate the policy process and influence government decision-making. The analysis of NGCSO participation was based on data collected from policy submissions and public hearing evidence given to a House of <b>Representatives</b> Standing Committee <b>Inquiry</b> into custodial arrangements following family separation. In addition, questionnaires and interviews with government officials and NGCSOs involved in the reform process provided further insights into the negotiation of power relations. A key factor in the participation of NGCSOs was the need to work within a system of gender politics that governed the policy-making process to favour the ideological and political objectives sought by the Howard government. The analysis of policy participation in this context found that political influence correlated with the ability to accurately assess the political environment and apply this knowledge to influence government officials. The NGCSOs able to apply their understanding of the policy environment to create supportive and sympathetic political relations were also found to have exerted higher levels of political influence that helped them achieve policy gains. A set of identifiable skills relating to the assessment and management of the gendered political environment by the NGCSOs that more successfully negotiated power relations was framed as demonstrating political acumen. This thesis offers a conceptualisation of political acumen that, through the skills it entails, provides an innovative framework for the analysis of interest group policy participation and political influence...|$|R
30|$|Philosophy {{of science}} is full of {{investigations}} and discussions on scientific practice. In the last century, the positivists, including logical positivists and logical empirists, {{have been the most}} influential, followed by post-postivists or wholists and more recently by scientific realists, critical rationalists and pragmatists [13, 23, 24]. Eventually, as Chalmers claims “[…] there is no general account of science and scientific method to be had that applies to all sciences at all historical stages in their development” [23]. This conclusion is especially {{due to the fact that}} besides the different scientific methodologies to approach scientific inquiries, different aims are also pursued. For example, even though new experimentalists contributed a lot to experimental reasoning in the last century, the naturalist account, which is paramount to physical and biological sciences, cannot be transferred to other sciences, as experimental manipulation is irrelevant for disciplines like social or historical sciences. 1 In short, for epistemic considerations, scientific practice can be defined on two levels: firstly, regarding scientific methodology; and secondly, regarding scientific aims. Scientific methods can be referred to as positivist (also logical empiricist) approaches relying on empirical evidence or wholist approaches, which are rather theory-laden [13]. Concerning the aims of science, again two main conceptions can be distinguished: The one position sees the “construction of comprehensive accounts of the natural world” [13] as the main goal of scientific <b>inquiry.</b> <b>Representatives</b> of the other position claim that “the work {{of science is}} the discovery of the truth about the natural world” [13] – although being skeptical about the possibilities of reaching this aim. Hence, the former aims at knowledge extension while the latter aims at finding truth by scientific inquiry. Thus, the choice of methodology does not imply a certain aim. But theory and methodology choice differs even within scientific disciplines, as different paradigms may be pursued. This is especially due to the social impact on science, e.g., values and personal preferences [25, 26].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{understanding}} {{of the values of}} nurses is especially important, since nurses constitute 80 % of workforce in the healthcare system in Lithuania. In addition to that, nursing {{is one of the major}} constituents of healthcare. The aim of this study was to determine what values predominate in the cohort of Baby Boomer nurses, and to evaluate the relation of these values with quality of life using M. Rokeach's terminal and instrumental values scale. M. Rokeach distinguished terminal values (such as world peace, wisdom, and happiness), which are preferred end-states of existence, and instrumental values (such as responsibility and cooperation), which are preferred modes of conduct. Methods We performed a <b>representative</b> anonymous questionnaire-based <b>inquiry</b> of nurses working in regional hospitals of Lithuania. The nurses who participated in the study were distributed into four work cohorts: the Veterans, the Baby Boomers, the Generation Xers, and the Generation Nexters. The majority of the nurses belonged to the Baby Boomers and the Generation Xers cohorts. Since in Lithuania, like in the whole Europe, the representatives of the Baby Boomers generation are predominating among working people, we selected this cohort (N = 387) for the analysis. The survey data was processed using the SPSS statistical software package Results The main values in life were family security, tranquility, and a sense of accomplishment. However, such values as true friendship, equality, and pleasurable and leisured life were seen as rather insignificant. The most important instrumental values were honesty, skillfulness, and responsibility. Our study showed a statistically significant (albeit weak) correlation between the QOL and terminal values such as the sense of accomplishment, tranquility, equality, and pleasure, as well as the instrumental value – obedience. We detected a statistically significant relationship between good QOL and satisfaction with oneself, relationships with the surrounding people, and friends' support. Conclusion The findings of our study showed that, although Lithuania was under a totalitarian regime for 50 years, both the terminal and the instrumental values of the Baby Boomers generation are very similar to those of the same generation in other countries. </p...|$|R
