50|$|Automatic {{scrubbing}} only cleans {{the interior}} of the tank. It is not capable of cleaning the exterior of the tank, and it does not {{do a good job of}} washing around the cover seals. While it is possible to just clean the interior and call it good enough, it does not provide the maximum sanitation of manually washing down the exterior of the tank following or during the automatic wash process. Also, some components that contact the milk such as the drain valve cannot be properly cleaned automatically without disassembling the valve and <b>retaining</b> <b>washer</b> and directly scrubbing in soapy water.|$|E
40|$|Steers (379 +/- 10 kg) with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal cannulas {{were used}} in a 5 x 5 Latin square {{digestion}} trial to quantify and evaluate the relationship between intestinal protein supply and intestinal starch disappearance. Treatments were infusions of 0, 50, 100, 150, or 200 g/d of casein along with 1, 042 g/d of raw cornstarch. Abomasal infusions were accomplished by passing tubing and a pliable <b>retaining</b> <b>washer</b> through the reticular-omasal orifice into the abomasum. Steers were fed a 93 % corn silage, 7 % supplement diet that contained 12 % crude protein at 1. 65 % body weight in 12 equal portions/d. Periods lasted 17 d (12 d for adaptation, 2 d of collections, and 3 d of rest). The quantity and percentage of organic matter and protein disappearance from the small intestine increased linearly (P < 0. 03) with infused casein. Greater quantities of starch disappeared with increased casein infusion (P < 0. 01). The infusion of 200 g/d of casein increased small intestinal starch disappearance by 226 g/d over the control. Casein infusion {{did not affect the}} quantity or percent of organic matter, starch, or protein disappearance in the large intestine. Treatments did not change ruminal ammonia N, ruminal pH, or plasma glucose concentrations. Starch disappearance from the small intestine was increased with greater protein flow to the duodenum of steers...|$|E
40|$|Saddle clamp {{modified}} to prevent parts from falling off when installed or removed. Allows easy access for tightening or loosening bolts, and retains alignment with tube mounted in it when opened. All parts are held captive - bolts by <b>retaining</b> <b>washers,</b> floating nuts by pressing and swaging, and upper clamp band by tether. Upper and lower bolt flanges offset {{from each other}} to ensure access...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle nuts, <b>retaining</b> <b>washers,</b> locking washers, serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|R
