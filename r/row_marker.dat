5000|$|According to {{the custom}} of Friends, graves in the {{earliest}} period were not marked. Records were kept by <b>row.</b> Later, <b>markers</b> were used and some bear dates earlier than the formal establishment of the Meeting. In 1870, a wall of native sandstone was erected around the graveyard. Names in the graveyard include those of the early settlers in the area such as [...] "Lamb", [...] "Lappencott", [...] "Shreve", [...] "Gaskill" [...] and 'Newbold", a^ ™any others important to the heritage of Mount Holly and Pemberton, Naw Jersey. It is still in use as a meeting house and the burial ground is still receiving requests for interment.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Jenkins resumed racing. On July 20, 1951, his car skidded on {{a puddle}} of water and struck a <b>row</b> of course <b>markers</b> at a speed of nearly 200 mph. The {{radiator}} was punctured by the accident and Jenkins had to halt his overheating vehicle. He had stopped three minutes short of breaking a new one-hour speed record and {{at the age of}} 68, he {{decided it was time to}} retire.|$|R
5000|$|When a route split onto two city streets, each one-way for the {{specific}} direction of travel, the northbound or eastbound markers are unchanged. Southbound or westbound, however, the letter [...] "V" [...] is inserted for the second digit of the third <b>row.</b> The <b>markers</b> are numbered in reverse sequence, so that the numbers match at the southern or western point of split and may be longer or shorter if a different distance is needed for the other direction. For example, both NY 5 and NY 30 in Amsterdam are split: NY 5 is on Main Street westbound and the Amsterdam Arterial, eastbound; NY 30 is on Market Street southbound and Church Street, northbound. Both the southbound and westbound segments of both routes, maintained by NYSDOT, carry the [...] "V" [...] designation.|$|R

50|$|Approximately 175 graves {{have been}} {{identified}} at the cemetery, of which 125 are in the western half, in an apparently random pattern. In contrast, the 50 graves to the east are primarily Civil War veterans, buried in two long <b>rows</b> with government-issued <b>markers,</b> the only aspect of the cemetery indicating any planning. Among the other graves, only 25 have markers identifying the deceased. Some are surrounded by iron fences or stone walls, while others are indicated by small cobblestone coping or are just depressions in the ground.|$|R
40|$|ArrayTV is a GC {{correction}} algorithm for microarray data {{designed to}} mitigate the appearance of waves. This work is inspired by a method for mitigating waves in sequencing data [1]. We find the genomic window for computing GC that best captures the dependence of signal intensity on GC content for each array using a score similar to the total variance (TV) statistic defined in [1]. The correction each probe receives is the mean signal intensity of all probes sharing the same local GC. We center windows at the starting position of each probe. 1 Adjusting copy number estimates for GC waves Importing data. The wave correction methods in ArrayTV handle simple matrices with <b>rows</b> indexing <b>markers</b> and columns indexing samples, {{as well as more}} complex data structures commonly used to process Affymetrix and Illumina platforms made available in the oligoClasses package. In this vignette, we illustrate our approach with a single female lymphoblastoid cell line sample assayed on the Agilent 1 M, Affymetrix 2. 7 M, and NimbleGen 2. 1 M platforms (available in full fro...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the concept}} of Artistic Anatomy, there’s the Anatomical Drawing. This is {{considered}} throughout the design that is faithful to the body or any specific part of it. In this case it’s {{a part of the}} human body: the face. The face is an essential element of the human body for identification. The human being know the other squarely across his face, notably through the elements contained in there. This act of recognizing and know dictate the other’s facial elements, is the principal characteristic of composite sketch, hence it’s more right definition be: dictate’s portrait and drawn. Typically nowadays, this type of work is essentially directs to the field of forensics, like a means of research but not like an evidence. With the evolution of technology and working methods, the composite sketch has evolved in its design since the <b>row</b> <b>markers</b> to the digital drawing that is currently used. With this, not only the work of portraiture became easier as well as the testimony of the respondent. Will be visible the approach of the real model depending of the various methods used. Will be disposed examples of varied situations, so that it is noticeable the constraints of a composite sketch interview. Each one can last 1, 2 or even 8 hours of interview, according to the expert's composite sketch of the Judicial Police in Lisbon, the constraints of being a witness, victim, child and the type of crime, leads this process. The Anatomy Art is constantly aggregate to this subject in so far as is important to know the skull, their muscles and how each is comprised in each phenotype. Here the reference of the artists: Karen T. Taylor and Stephen Mancusi will be important, is where will demonstrate through their work as seen in other countries. After completing this part of the work, at some point, in parallel with the internship at Judicial Police in Lisbon, there was a closeness with profile cases in the media, such as the “Telheiras’s Violator " and "Maddie’s case", which will be described and illustrated. This being a theme inserted in criminal area, it is pertinent to address other methods of human identification and how it has developed over the ages, addressing names like: Cesare Lombroso, Alphonse Bertillon and Francis Galto...|$|R
40|$|The biplot {{display is}} a graph of <b>row</b> and column <b>markers</b> {{obtained}} from data that forms a two-way table. The markers are {{calculated from the}} singular value decomposition of the data matrix. The biplot display may be used with many multivariate methods to display relationships between variables and objects. It is commonly used in ecological applications to plot relationships between species and sites. This paper describes a set of Excel macros {{that may be used}} to draw a biplot display based on results from principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, canonical discriminant analysis, metric multidimensional scaling, redundancy analysis, canonical correlation analysis or canonical correspondence analysis. The macros allow for a variety of transformations of the data prior to the singular value decomposition and scaling of the markers following the decomposition. 1...|$|R
30|$|Contrast-enhanced chest CT was {{available}} for review in all patients. The procedures were performed with patients in a prone, supine, oblique, or lateral decubitus position to provide the shortest distance between the lesion and pleural surface. The actual biopsy route was determined after obtaining a short spiral scan of the region of interest with a <b>row</b> of radiopaque <b>markers</b> on the chest with the patient’s holding his/her breath after inspiration or expiration. In all patients, the biopsy was performed using non-coaxial technique using an automated biopsy gun with an 18 -gauge cutting needle (Bard Magnum, Covington, GA, USA) with a penetration depth of 15 or 17  mm. After puncturing the skin, the patient was instructed to hold his/her breath and the pleural puncture was subsequently made. The position of the needle tip was confirmed by obtaining limited CT images around the lesion at 5 -mm thickness.|$|R
