40|$|ABSTRACT A Series of Distractions Lisa Sookraj 	"A Series of Distractions" is a novella that {{examines}} the fragmentary {{nature of the}} sentence, the story, the photograph and life itself. Montréal writer Gail Scott refers to works created in the middle space, the in between. This is where my writing exists, between genres and between situational states in characters’ lives [stuck between <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> (youth) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> place (well-adjusted adults) ]. To illustrate the disjointed way thoughts tend to connect under pressure, the prose is interspersed with shorter lines that appear like poetry on the page. 	 	The narrative follows Julie Watt, a struggling young photographer in Montréal, and focuses on her shifting relationships (to herself, her work and her boyfriend Felix). Julie seeks progress in place of redundancy, but while clinging to stasis. As such, the writing often examines moments of ‘unplot’ – the minute events of daily life accompanied by the inner associations of the protagonist. The writing conveys 'the real' in a charged way, revealing the complexity of situations which seem simple on the surface. A quote from Susan Sontag is fitting: "Photographed images {{do not seem to}} be statements about the world so much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality. " 	The notion of time and the speeds at which it moves in differing stages of our lives and psychologies is integral to the story, at the heart of which lies uncertainty and anxiety. Theories on photography (from Sontag and Roland Barthes) offer insight as to how Julie views the various aspects of her life, and often, how the author perceives prose. ...|$|R

However, the Article ultimately contends that such systems are particularly vulnerable in jurisdictions with small populations insofar as moneyed interest groups from outside the jurisdiction can easily overwhelm, for example, even the multiplied donations of the citizens of largely rural states or jurisdictions [...] .. Drawing from the recent jurisprudence and recent data and dynamics in the political realm, this Article analyzes both the legal and real politick aspects of the new landscape of public financing. While not all public financing systems follow the Arizona matching funds model, most advocates of public financing considered it to be the most politically viable form of public financing, precisely because it protects the public fisc by keeping initial funding allotments low enough so as not to needlessly spend taxpayer funds on low-dollar races, noncompetitive contests, or both, while simultaneously assuring candidates considering opting in to public financing (and thus foregoing significant private funds) that they would, in an expensive or highly competitive race, actually be able to counter speech with speech. This Article asserts the combination of three factors: (1) challenging federal and state economies; (2) Citizens United 2 ̆ 7 s opening of new financial spigots; and (3) the Free Enterprise decision arguably spells the doom of public financing as we have known it. The Arizona model might be justified in a judicial public-financing context by the additional compelling interests present in that circumstance. Far from a mere hypothetical, this argument has direct applicability to North Carolina, which had a matching-funds system in place prior to Free Enterprise, the constitutionality of which had been, prior to Free Enterprise, upheld by the Fourth Circuit...|$|R

On the more promising side, this Article asserts that systems that operate based on offering funding as a multiple for small-donor donations offer one potential solution to the dilemma. However, the Article ultimately contends that such systems are particularly vulnerable in jurisdictions with small populations insofar as moneyed interest groups from outside the jurisdiction can easily overwhelm, for example, even the multiplied donations of the citizens of largely rural states or jurisdictions. Part I situates public campaign financing in the historical and democratic tradition of the public square, and more pointedly, the facilitated public square. In positioning public financing within this “pre-history” of campaign finance, the Article asserts that the “affirmatives” represented by the early kinds of forum creation and speech fostering and facilitation were entirely consistent with the potential role of public financing in more modern deliberative democracy and republican governance. Having so positioned public financing, the Article then, in a purposefully brief but contextualizing fashion, considers the evolution of the ancient public square through, for example, extended public debates, the likes of which twenty-first century voters would scarcely recognize. The Article transitions from those early “affirmatives” in fostering the public’s political discourse to a consideration of the early legal and political theories of public financing as having been, in large measure, continuations and extensions of the public square. Building on the theories of public financing, Part II considers the extent to which those theories have been realized or thwarted by the legal and logistical aspects of America’s experiments with public financing. This analysis begins with the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act’s authorization of publicly financed presidential party nominating conventions, primary elections, and general elections. 23 Next, the Article examines the systems adopted in states and smaller jurisdictions that have embraced public financing. The Article divides these state systems into three categories. In the first category are the systems that—less effectively but less controversially— track the Federal Election Campaign Act’s (FECA or the Act) presidential public-financing scheme. The second category consists of the systems that, prior to Free Enterprise, were generally effective at achieving their ends but are now unconstitutional. With respect to the second category, the Article analyzes the Court’s decision in Free Enterprise, and the room, if any, the decision leaves for variations of the matching funds struck down by the Court. The third category is comprised of systems and proposals that seek to forge an alternative to the fixed-sum/Presidential model or the matching-funds/Free Enterprise model. The most prominent, and in some idiosyncratic jurisdictions, successful alternatives involve smalldonor matching funds. The best-known iteration of such an alternative exists in the (idiosyncratic to be sure) jurisdiction of New York City. With these categories and the legal context in mind, Part III examines anecdotal and empirical evidence pertaining to modern political campaigns, both in terms of the now pragmatically moribund presidential public financing system and in terms of the dynamics specific to the post-Citizens United era. The Article asserts that, for all the attention paid to presidential contests, public financing is most important at the federal legislative level and in state races for legislative, executive, and judicial offices alike. Finally, the Article asserts that the less populated the jurisdiction but the more important the office— for example, a U. S. Senate race in North Dakota (population: 699, 628) with the Senate majority possibly hanging in the balance— the more vulnerable the people’s interests are to being thwarted in precisely the manner described at the outset of this Article, in which the fiscal cliff legislation provided the vehicle to pass on $ 500 million in unnecessary Medicare costs to the taxpayers...|$|R
