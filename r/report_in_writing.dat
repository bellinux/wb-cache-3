These persons are then interviewed during a limited time frame decided by the Executive Committee of the World Values Survey using the uniformly structured questionnaires.

During the field work, the agency has to <b>report</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> according to a specific check-list.

50|$|Though Lieutenant Ransom {{felt the}} ramming was deliberate, Commander Bigelow thought {{it must have}} been an {{accident}} so he then moved his ship alongside the Buffalo and asked if the crew of the steamer needed any assistance. The crew answered to the negative so Bigelow let the ship go but he followed it into Chicago for repairs. While it is not certain that the ramming was intentional or not, Bigelow endeavored to find evidence that it was. The commander then filed a lawsuit against Mr. Walbridge on the account that his ship was either neglectfully manned {{at the time of the}} incident or was indeed trying to sink the Michigan. The crew of the merchant ship Republic witnessed the Buffalo swerve off course to ram the gunboat and the ship's captain submitted his <b>report</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing,</b> however, because all the gathered evidence was circumstantial, the case never went to trial. USS Michigan was put out of action for two months for repairs which cost $1,674 to complete. Over the course of the next few weeks after refitting, the Michigan captured several timber pirates with the assistance of Agent Willard and a Marine Corps detachment.

40|$|Can music be {{experienced}} without it being heard audibly? Musicians and listeners talk about feeling the music or musicâ€™s feel {{but what are}} these feelings? One way to isolate {{this part of the}} musical experience is to consider: what musical parameters can be detected and perceived if musical pieces only where delivered via localized tactile input to one hand? This essay focuses on tactile perception of recorded music, when it can only be physically felt. An experiment with experienced musician subjects where asked to <b>report</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> on experiences of musical pieces being delivered only tactically to their hand. Results show that multiple musical parameters such as pulse, dynamics and expression are indeed possible to extract and perceive.

The reasons for these difficulties and other phenomena are discussed. â€©Validerat; 20140601 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

A few articles contained information on several accidents, e.g. the articles by Hemler (6 cases) [6] and Grossmann (25 cases) [38, 39], and a thesis by Kleibeler (16 cases) [59], though Grossmann included Hemlerâ€™s data, and Kleibeler in turn those from Grossmann.

The idea that writing is a method of learning is based on simple principle: when students write, they process information in a physical, tangible form. Writing activities require students to explore ideas, discover relationships, observe contrasts, sequence ideas, and process information (Fulwiler & Young, 1982; Gage, 1986).
