5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Monroe and Fox {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP {{would not be able to}} finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E

5|$|John Sigismund, {{who never}} married and left no heir, {{was the last}} member of the Zápolya family. In his will, he assured the Diet of its <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the new monarch. The representatives of the Three Nations elected the Roman Catholic Stephen Báthory, who adopted the title Voivode of Transylvania. Gáspár Bekes, {{supported}} by Maximilian, contested the election, but Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and consolidated his rule.|$|E

At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male could become a freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man's mid-twenties. Twenty-one was the assumed age of inheritance, as well, although the law respected {{the rights of the}} deceased to name an earlier age in his will.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – {{she was the first}} English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible.

5|$|The {{innovations}} of Andriamasinavalona {{were numerous}} and enduring. He created two additional noble castes and defined their associated rights, responsibilities and restrictions, and {{was responsible for}} introducing {{the tradition of the}} red parasol as an indicator of royalty; he also decreed that all women had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> their husbands. Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available for the defense of the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury items like silver piastres and porcelain dishes. The dikes around the Betsimitatatra rice fields of Antananarivo were expanded and raised to help ensure against famine.|$|E

Texian militias generally elected their own leaders, and the men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> their own captain rather than report to Martin.

5|$|In 1826, Metcalfe {{served on}} a House {{committee}} that investigated allegations that Vice-President John C. Calhoun had improperly benefited from a contract he awarded while serving as Secretary of War in 1822. While Calhoun was cleared of any wrongdoing, his friend, South Carolina Representative George McDuffie, began an exchange of correspondence with Metcalfe regarding the proceedings. The correspondence became heated, and McDuffie challenged Metcalfe to a duel. As {{the recipient of the}} challenge, Metcalfe had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the terms of the engagement. He chose rifles as the weapon at a distance of 90 feet. McDuffie insisted that wounds from a previous duel had left him incapable of handling a rifle, and proposed pistols as an alternative. Metcalfe replied that he had never handled a pistol in his life. Unable to come to an agreement on the conditions of the duel, both sides eventually dropped the matter entirely.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1723, {{six days}} before his death, Cosimo III {{distributed}} a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany shall stay independent; Anna Maria Luisa shall succeed uninhibited after Gian Gastone; the Grand Duke reserves the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> his successor. Unfortunately for Cosimo, Europe completely ignored it. Gian Gastone, now the Grand Duke, and Anna Maria Luisa were not on good terms. He despised the Electress for engineering his unhappy marriage with Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, while she detested his liberal policies: he repealed all of his father's anti-Semitic statutes and revelled in upsetting her. Consequently, the Electress was compelled to abandon her apartment in the left wing of the royal palace, the Pitti, for the Villa La Quiete. She refurbished La Quiete's house and gardens {{with the assistance of}} Sebastiano Rapi, the gardener of the Boboli Gardens, and the architects Giovanni Battista Foggini and Paolo Giovanozzi. In the period 1722–1725, the Electress embellished the villa further by commissioning twelve statues of various religious figures.|$|E

As the Bench of the Court did not include any judges of the nationality of either party, the parties exercised their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> judges ad hoc {{to sit in the}} case. Singapore appointed Pemmaraju Sreenivasa Rao from India, and Malaysia Christopher John Robert Dugard from South Africa.|$|E

5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand as a challenge to duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the Darien Scheme, and the passing by the English Parliament of the Act of Settlement 1701 asserting the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the order of {{succession}} for English, Scottish and Irish thrones, escalated political hostilities between England and Scotland, and neutralised calls for a united British people. The Parliament of Scotland responded by passing the Act of Security 1704, allowing it to appoint a different monarch to succeed to the Scottish crown from that of England, if it so wished. The English political perspective was that {{the appointment of a}} Jacobite monarchy in Scotland opened up the possibility of a Franco-Scottish military conquest of England during the Second Hundred Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. The Parliament of England passed the Alien Act 1705, which provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property, whilst also restricting the import of Scottish products into England and its colonies (about half of Scotland's trade). However, the Act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Parliament of Scotland entered into negotiations regarding the creation of a unified Parliament of Great Britain, which in turn would refund Scottish financial losses on the Darien Scheme.|$|E
