50|$|Prior to {{discovery}} of the Steinheim skull in the gravel pit, many objects such as bones of elephants, rhinos and wild horses had been unearthed. Therefore, the archaeologists excavating thesite were already sensitized to possible skeletal remains in the quarry. Fritz Berckhemer traveled {{on the same day}} of the skull's discovery and reviewed the still hidden skull in the wall. The next day, together with Max Bock, he began the careful excavation. It was clear, {{on the basis of the}} shape and dimensions of the skull, that it was not a monkey, as had initially been suspected. It turned out to be a human skull from the Pleistocene. The skull was <b>roughly</b> <b>cleaned,</b> hardened and plastered so it would arrive safe and sound in the Museum of Natural History.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "disaster {{recovery}} building" [...] {{was set up}} at {{the site}} of the collapse (a large hole in the ground), where around 95% of all archival items could be held until August 2011, albeit scattered and in many cases badly damaged. Archive repositories all over Germany offered space to store the damaged and only <b>roughly</b> <b>cleaned</b> documents: wet materials were flash-frozen to prevent mold growth. [...] "Itinerant archivists" [...] worked in the receiving archives all over the country and began the task of re-identifying and re-cataloging. A newly installed centre for restoration and digitization on the outskirts of Cologne started working in 2011, with a total cost for restoring the archive estimated at 400 million euros. A freeze-drying unit was installed to handle the deep-frozen materials safely before restoration.|$|E

The play of somewhat straight strokes with roughness results in what Ksiazek says could evoke [...] "particular images, for example, archeological sites, floor plans of artifacts such as cathedrals or quotations from architecture." [...] The under-colors, which are tones placed as previous layerings, mix in myriad fashions with successive layers on top. ArtsEditor ...|$|R
25|$|Before a miner {{could sell}} his ore {{he had to}} dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock {{in which it was}} {{embedded}} and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was <b>roughly</b> washed <b>clean</b> of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a bucker or, in larger mines, on a crushing circle, where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a buddle or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.|$|R
30|$|Robot {{agent-based}} {{systems are}} considered as an attractive alternative of sensor-based systems {{described in the}} previous subsection for the fully autonomous real-time pipeline inspection and monitoring. For natural gas distribution pipelines, Schempf et al. [27, 28] proposed EXPLORER and GRISLEE that provide the visual inspection of 4 -, 6 -, and 8 -in-diameter pipelines. Although EXPLORER and GRISLEE have comparably good mobility in elbows and T-branches of the pipelines, the inspection using EXPLORER and GRISLEE is cost-expensive and time consuming as the robot itself {{is responsible for the}} inspection of the entire pipeline. Moreover, these systems provide no mean for incident localization. Several other robot agents are proposed for inspecting different diameter pipelines, e.g., [8 – 14]; we direct readers to respective papers for details and only summarize their limitations here. It is worth noticing that these robots are manually controlled and experience several limitations including the following two facts: (i) the topology of the pipeline, where some of them have been used, was made simple and does not have vertical segments and Y- and T-branches; and (ii) the robots exhibit localization problems due to several reasons including wheel slips and undetectability of the markers. Some researchers developed semi-autonomous and autonomous solutions [15 – 17]. KANTARO [15] is an autonomous mobile robot used for the inspection of 200 – 300 -mm-diameter sewer pipelines. It uses a simple moving mechanism which reduces resource usage. However, the localization based on wheel rotations is not efficient because a wheel slip can induce large errors on the location computation. MAKRO [17] is another fully autonomous, untethered, multi-segmented, and self-steering articulated robot. It is designed for inspecting <b>roughly</b> <b>cleaned,</b> non-man-entry sewer pipes with a diameter of 300 – 600 mm at dry weather conditions. Similar to KANTARO, MARKO’s localization technique is not efficient, and it does not have vertical mobility. In addition, certain assumptions such as dried pipelines are not suitable for real-time operations [17].|$|E
