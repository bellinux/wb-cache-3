40|$|Some claim 2 ̆ 2 slavery did {{not harm}} the {{descendants}} of slaves 2 ̆ 2 since, without slavery, its descendants {{would never have been}} born and a life worth living, even one including the subsequent harms of past slavery, is preferable to never having been born at all. This creates a classic puzzle known as the 2 ̆ 2 non-identity argument 2 ̆ 2, applied to reject the validity of claims for historic justice based on harms to descendants of victims of historic wrongs: since descendants are never harmed by historic wrongs, they have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rectification.</b> This conclusion is unintuitive. This article explains the nature of harm involved in historic injustice, overcoming the hurdle the non-identity argument poses to historic justice claims. Historic injustice and the harms it generates are best understood as group harms. Claims for historic justice can be grounded in harms currently living individuals suffer {{as a function of the}} harms their group or community currently suffers as a consequence of historic wrongs. One form of harm, 2 ̆ 2 constitutive harm 2 ̆ 2, differs from the aggregative account of harm assumed by the non-identity argument and is immune to it. It is the type of harm people suffer as members of certain historically wronged groups and communities. Therefore, the constitutive harm people suffer in cases of historic injustice may serve as a basis for justifying claims for historic justice...|$|E

40|$|Early 1960 's meander {{rectification}} of the Ste-Marguerite River, Quebec, Canada, {{was undertaken}} {{in order to}} facilitate highway construction along the valley bottom. Through analysis of thalweg elevation and grain size data, the fourfold response of the river since rectification has been determined: (1) 1 m of bed incision in the upper 4 km and 2 m of bed aggradation in the lower 2 km of the 6 km straightened reach; (2) coarsening (up to 20 mm) of the pavement D 50 and D 84 in the area of maximum degradation; (3) lateral erosion of the channel into three high terraces; and (4) regrowth of three meanders within the reach. Estimations indicate that reprofiling and pavement coarsening have been most important in reducing the disequilibrium in gravel transport rates due <b>to</b> <b>rectification.</b> Model simulations of the response <b>to</b> <b>rectification</b> have been validated against field data and the half-time scale of response has been estimated at 10 years.
