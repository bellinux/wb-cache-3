5|$|Starting in the 1950s, {{development}} of highways and new housing led to movement of middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some {{of the movement}} was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to <b>revitalize</b> <b>the</b> downtown and Midtown areas with the re{{development of}} the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.|$|E

Armenians living {{in countries such as}} Cyprus, France, Greece, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria were primarily the survivors or the descendants of the genocide. They were offered the option of having their expenses paid by the Soviet government for their trip back to their homeland.

5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used to <b>revitalize</b> <b>the</b> Appaloosa was the Arabian horse, {{as evidenced}} by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian horse, the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|A {{year into}} development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could <b>revitalize</b> <b>the</b> franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E
