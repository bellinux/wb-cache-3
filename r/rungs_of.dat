5|$|After a ten-month absence, Christian {{returned}} from injury on the June 17, 2013 episode of Raw, defeating Wade Barrett. Later that week on SmackDown, after defeating Drew McIntyre, Christian {{was attacked by}} The Shield while delivering a promo. On the June 26 episode of Main Event, Christian took on Shield member Dean Ambrose, {{which resulted in a}} disqualification win for Christian following interference from Ambrose's stablemates, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns. That same week on SmackDown, Christian teamed up with the Usos to defeat The Shield, handing the stable their second loss in six-man tag matches. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Christian competed in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but was unsuccessful as the match was won by Randy Orton. During the match, Christian had his teeth chipped after a strong punch from Sheamus through the <b>rungs</b> <b>of</b> a ladder. On the July 29 episode of Raw, Christian defeated World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio in a non-title match. That same week on SmackDown, Christian defeated Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam in a three-way match to become number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, after which, he was attacked by Del Rio during a post-match interview. On the August 9 episode of SmackDown, Christian again defeated Del Rio in a non-title match. On August 18 at SummerSlam, Christian failed in his title challenge against Del Rio. On the September 9 episode of Raw, following Edge's opinion on Triple H's recent abuse of power, The Shield dragged out an assaulted Christian as a message to anyone that disrespected Triple H. On that week's SmackDown, Edge promised Christian would return soon and get his payback. Christian returned and appeared on the 2013 Slammy Awards, where he presented an award and appeared in a segment involving John Cena and Randy Orton.|$|E

25|$|Möbius ladders are vertex-transitive – {{they have}} symmetries taking any vertex {{to any other}} vertex – but (again with the {{exception}} of M6) they are not edge-transitive. The edges from the cycle from which the ladder is formed can be distinguished from the <b>rungs</b> <b>of</b> the ladder, because each cycle edge belongs to a single 4-cycle, while each rung belongs to two such cycles. Therefore, there is no symmetry taking a cycle edge to a rung edge or vice versa.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Petraeus became aide-de-camp to General John Galvin, then Commanding General of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). He {{spent the}} next few years furthering his {{military}} and civilian education, including spending 1982–83 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, attending the Command and General Staff College. At graduation in 1983, he was the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. From 1983 to 1985 he was at Princeton; and 1985–87 at West Point. After earning his PhD and teaching at West Point, Petraeus continued up the <b>rungs</b> <b>of</b> the command ladder, serving as military assistant to Gen. John Galvin, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. From there, he moved to the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized). During 1988–1989, he served as operations officer to the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized)'s 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized). He was then posted as aide and assistant executive officer to the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General Carl Vuono, in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|In the short-term, Kovel advocates {{activities}} {{that have the}} “promise of breaking down the commodity form”. This includes organizing labor, which is a “reconfiguring of the use-value of labor power”; forming cooperatives, allowing “a relatively free association of labor”; forming localised currencies, which he sees as “undercutting the value-basis of money”; and supporting “radical media” that, in his eyes, involve an “undoing of the fetishism of commodities”. He advocates economic localisation {{in the same vein}} as many in the Green movement, although only as a prefigurative step rather than an end in itself. He also advises political parties attempting to “democratize the state” that there should be “dialogue but no compromise” with established political parties, and that there must be “a continual association of electoral work with movement work” to avoid “being sucked back into the system”. Such parties, he believes, should focus on “the local <b>rungs</b> <b>of</b> the political system” first, before running national campaigns that “challenge the existing system by the elementary means of exposing its broken promises”.|$|E

500|$|Carlos Baker, Hemingway's first biographer, {{believes}} that while Anderson suggested Paris because [...] "the monetary exchange rate" [...] {{made it an}} inexpensive place to live, more importantly it was where [...] "the most interesting people in the world" [...] lived. In Paris, Hemingway met writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound who [...] "could help a young writer up the <b>rungs</b> <b>of</b> a career". The Hemingway of the early Paris years was a [...] "tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man." [...] He and Hadley {{lived in a small}} walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine [...] in the Latin Quarter, and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building. [...] Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris, became Hemingway's mentor and godmother to his son Jack; she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom she referred to as the [...] "Lost Generation"—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises. A regular at Stein's salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Juan Gris. He eventually withdrew from Stein's influence and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades. The American poet Ezra Pound met Hemingway by chance at Sylvia Beach's bookshop Shakespeare and Company in 1922. The two toured Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924. They forged a strong friendship, and in Hemingway, Pound recognized and fostered a young talent. Pound introduced Hemingway to the Irish writer James Joyce, with whom Hemingway frequently embarked on [...] "alcoholic sprees".|$|E
