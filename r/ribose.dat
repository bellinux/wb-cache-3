5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a <b>ribose</b> or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a <b>ribose</b> sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E
5|$|While DNA {{contains}} deoxyribose, RNA contains <b>ribose</b> (in deoxyribose {{there is}} no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA {{because it is more}} prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a <b>ribose</b> ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
5|$|Nucleotides {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to <b>ribose).</b> Both adenine and guanine {{are made from}} the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.|$|E
5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars {{can be modified}} in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and <b>ribose</b> is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as <b>ribose,</b> the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar <b>ribose</b> in RNA.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, for cAMP, 3’5’-cyclic {{adenosine}} monophosphate {{indicates that a}} single phosphate group forms a cyclic structure with the <b>ribose</b> group at its 3’ and 5’ carbons, while the <b>ribose</b> group is also attached to adenosine (this bond is understood {{to be at the}} 1’ position of the <b>ribose).</b>|$|E
25|$|Resulting {{hydroxyl}} attacks <b>ribose</b> carbonium ion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ribose</b> zipper is an RNA {{tertiary}} {{structural element}} {{in which two}} RNA chains are held together by hydrogen bonding interactions involving the 2’OH of <b>ribose</b> sugars on different strands. The 2'OH can behave as both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, which allows formation of bifurcated hydrogen bonds with another 2’ OH.|$|E
25|$|Bond {{cleavage}} {{results in}} an oxycarbonium ion on the <b>ribose,</b> stabilized by Glu177.|$|E
25|$|Depurination of adenine {{results in}} a neutral <b>ribose</b> on an intact phosphodiester RNA backbone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribose</b> is an {{aldopentose}} (a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms) that, in its open chain form, has an aldehyde {{functional group}} at one end. In the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides, the carbon atoms are numbered from C1' (in the aldehyde group) to C5'. The deoxyribose derivative found in DNA differs from <b>ribose</b> {{by having a}} hydrogen atom {{in place of the}} hydroxyl group at C2'. This hydroxyl group performs a function in RNA splicing.|$|E
25|$|Arg180 is {{positioned}} {{such that it}} can protonate N-3 of adenine and break the bond between N-9 of the adenine ring and C-1’ of the <b>ribose.</b>|$|E
25|$|ADP binds {{behind the}} NAD-BD, {{just beneath the}} pivot helix - the second {{coenzyme}} binding site. The adenosine moiety binds down into a hydrophobic pocket with the <b>ribose</b> phosphate groups pointing up toward the pivot helix.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribose</b> is a {{carbohydrate}} {{with the}} formula C5H10O5; specifically, it is a pentose monosaccharide (simple sugar) with linear form H−(C=O)−(CHOH)4−H, which {{has all the}} hydroxyl groups {{on the same side}} in the Fischer projection.|$|E
25|$|Methylation is the {{attachment}} or substitution of a methyl group onto various substrates. The rRNA of humans contain approximately 115 methyl group modifications. The {{majority of these}} are 2'O-ribose-methylations (where the methyl group {{is attached to the}} <b>ribose</b> group).|$|E
25|$|D-Ribose {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1891 by Emil Fischer. It is a C'-2 carbon epimer {{of the sugar}} D-arabinose (both isomers of which are named for their source, gum arabic) and <b>ribose</b> itself is named as a partial rearrangement of letters in the word 'arabinose'.|$|E
25|$|Like many monosaccharides, <b>ribose</b> {{exists in}} an {{equilibrium}} among 5 forms—the linear form H−(C=O)−(CHOH)4–H and {{either of the}} two ring forms: alpha- or beta-ribofuranose (“C3'-endo”), with a five-membered ring, and alpha- or beta-ribopyranose (“C2'-endo”), with a six-membered ring. The beta-ribopyranose form predominates in aqueous solution.|$|E
25|$|Complex I is also {{blocked by}} {{adenosine}} diphosphate <b>ribose</b> – a reversible competitive inhibitor of NADH oxidation – by binding to the enzyme at the nucleotide binding site. Both hydrophilic NADH and hydrophobic ubiquinone analogs act {{at the beginning}} and the end of the internal electron-transport pathway, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Caspases {{can also}} induce an {{inflammatory}} response on a transcriptional level. There is evidence where it promotes transcription of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that assists in transcribing inflammatory cytokines such as IFNs, TNF, IL-6 and IL-8. For example, Caspase-1 activates Caspase-7, {{which in turn}} cleaves the poly (ADP) <b>ribose</b> – this activates transcription of NF-κB controlled genes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the hexose glucose and fructose sugars, most strains of O. oeni can use the residual pentose sugars left behind from yeast fermentation including L-arabinose and <b>ribose.</b> Only around 45% of O. oeni strains can ferment sucrose (the form of sugar usually added for chaptalization that gets converted by yeast into glucose and fructose).|$|E
25|$|The {{convention}} for a {{nucleic acid}} sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5' end to the 3' end of the polymer chain, where 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of carbons around the <b>ribose</b> ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} thus likely involves abstraction of the 2'-proton from C17, {{followed by}} nucleophilic attack upon the adjacent phosphate. As {{the bond between}} the scissile phosphorus and the 5'-O leaving group begins to break, a proton is supplied from the <b>ribose</b> of G8, which then likely reprotonates {{at the expense of}} a water molecule observed to hydrogen bond to it in the crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{explanation}} is then that G12, in the deprotonated form, {{is the general}} base, and the <b>ribose</b> of G8 is the general acid. The apparent kinetic pKa of the hammerhead ribozyme is 8.5, whereas the pKa of guanosine is about 9.5. It {{is possible that the}} pKa of G12 is perturbed from 9.5 to 8.5 in the hammerhead catalytic core; this hypothesis is currently the subject of intense investigation.|$|E
25|$|Pyrimidine ribonucleosides {{and their}} {{respective}} nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure <b>ribose</b> aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This {{can be viewed as}} a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. <b>Ribose</b> aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine ribonucleotide. Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerize into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme {{ribonucleotide}} reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo {{synthesis of}} dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of <b>ribose</b> 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin.|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates perform {{numerous}} {{roles in}} living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for {{the storage of}} energy (e.g. starch and glycogen) and as structural components (e.g. cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods). The 5-carbon monosaccharide <b>ribose</b> {{is an important component}} of coenzymes (e.g. ATP, FAD and NAD) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA. The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.|$|E
25|$|The {{tertiary}} {{interactions in}} the full-length hammerhead ribozyme stabilize what strongly {{appears to be}} the active conformation. The nucleophile, the 2'-oxygen of the cleavage-site nucleotide, C17, is aligned almost perfectly for an in-line attack (the SN2(P) reaction). G12 is positioned within hydrogen bonding distance of this nucleophile, and therefore would be able to abstract a proton from the 2'-oxygen if G12 itself becomes deprotonated. The 2'-OH of G8 forms a hydrogen bond to the 5'-leaving group oxygen, and therefore potentially may supply a proton as negative charge accumulates on the 5'-oxygen of the <b>ribose</b> of A1.1.|$|E
25|$|Several Epac-selective cAMP analogs {{have been}} {{developed}} to clarify the functional roles of Epacs as well those of the Epac-dependent signaling pathway distinct from the PKA-dependent signaling pathway. The modifications of 8-position in the purine structure and 2’-position in <b>ribose</b> is considered to be crucial to the specificity for Epacs. So far, 8-pCPT-2’-O-Me-cAMP (8-pCPT) and its membrane permeable form 8-pCPT-AM are used for their great specificity toward Epacs. Sulfonylurea drugs (SUs), widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes through stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, have also been shown to specifically activate Epac2.|$|E
25|$|Monosaccharides are {{classified}} according to three different characteristics: {{the placement of}} its carbonyl group, the number of carbon atoms it contains, and its chiral handedness. If the carbonyl group is an aldehyde, the monosaccharide is an aldose; if the carbonyl group is a ketone, the monosaccharide is a ketose. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses, those with four are called tetroses, five are called pentoses, six are hexoses, and so on. These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, glucose is an aldohexose (a six-carbon aldehyde), <b>ribose</b> is an aldopentose (a five-carbon aldehyde), and fructose is a ketohexose (a six-carbon ketone).|$|E
25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{reaction is}} a phosphodiester isomerization reaction that is initiated by abstraction of the cleavage-site <b>ribose</b> 2’-hydroxyl proton from the 2’-oxygen, which then becomes the attacking nucleophile in an “in-line” or SN2(P)-like reaction, {{although it is}} not known whether this proton is removed prior to or during the chemical step of the hammerhead cleavage reaction. (The cleavage reaction is technically not bimolecular, but behaves in the same way a genuine SN2(P) reaction does; it undergoes inversion of configuration subsequent to forming an associative transition-state consisting of a pentacoordinated oxyphosphrane.) The attacking and leaving group oxygens will both occupy the two axial positions in the trigonal bipyramidal transition-state structure as is required for an SN2-like reaction mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The enzymes transketolase, {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are {{all important}} in carbohydrate metabolism. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase {{is a key}} player in the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and <b>ribose.</b> The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a major form of energy for the cell. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, while the reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and for myelin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{comparing}} DNA repair {{capacity in}} different mammalian species {{have shown that}} repair capacity correlates with lifespan. The initial study of this type, by Hart and Setlow, showed that the ability of skin fibroblasts of seven mammalian species to perform DNA repair after exposure to a DNA damaging agent correlated with lifespan of the species. The species studied were shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human. This initial study stimulated many additional studies involving {{a wide variety of}} mammalian species, and the correlation between repair capacity and lifespan generally held up. In one of the more recent studies, Burkle et al. studied the level of a particular enzyme, Poly ADP <b>ribose</b> polymerase, which is involved in repair of single-strand breaks in DNA. They found that the lifespan of 13 mammalian species correlated with the activity of this enzyme.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 a 2.2 Å {{resolution}} {{crystal structure}} of the full-length hammerhead ribozyme was obtained. This new structure (shown on the right) appears to resolve the most worrisome of the previous discrepancies. In particular, C17 is now positioned for in-line attack, and the invariant residues C3, G5, G8 and G12 all appear involved in vital interactions relevant to catalysis. Moreover, the A9 and scissile phosphates are observed to be 4.3 Å apart, {{consistent with the idea}} that, when modified, these phosphates could bind a single thiophilic metal ion. The structure also reveals how two invariant residues, G-12 and G-8, are positioned within the active site consistent with their previously proposed role in acid/base catalysis. G12 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the 2’–O of C17, the nucleophile in the cleavage reaction, and the <b>ribose</b> of G8 hydrogen bonds to the leaving group 5’-O. (see below), while the nucleotide base of G8 forms a Watson-Crick pair with the invariant C3. This arrangement permits one to suggest that G12 is the general base in the cleavage reaction, and that G8 may function as the general acid, consistent with previous biochemical observations. G5 hydrogen bonds to the furanose oxygen of C17, helping to position it for in-line attack. U4 and U7, {{as a consequence of the}} base-pair formation between G8 and C3, are now positioned such that an NOE between their bases is easily explained.|$|E
500|$|From the {{perspective}} of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components, a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar <b>ribose,</b> and the triphosphate. [...] It is used in cells as a coenzyme.|$|E
