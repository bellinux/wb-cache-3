5|$|Many {{people with}} Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{have experienced the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} an infection in the 3–6 weeks prior to the onset of the neurological symptoms. This may consist of upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infection (rhinitis, sore throat) or diarrhea.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the lower}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> {{including}} the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> (trachea and bronchi), digestive tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|Common ailments in {{domestic}} guinea pigs include <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections, diarrhea, scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), abscesses due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay {{embedded in the}} throat, or from external scratches), and infections by lice, mites, or fungus.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 1990s, Sailer {{has been}} working on the {{treatment}} of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The main cause for this condition are extremely narrow upper <b>respiratory</b> (oropharyngeal) <b>tracts.</b> This anatomical situation that leads to respiratory arrests, decrease of oxygen in the blood and other symptoms like high blood pressure can be eliminated by the bimaxillary Rotation Advancement Operation developed by Sailer, where the upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> are dilated permanently ...|$|R
5000|$|Palate, lung, and nasal {{epithelium}} clone protein [...] (PLUNC) is {{a gene encoding}} a secretory protein. It is {{also called}} Secretory protein in upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> (SPURT). In humans, it is encoded by the BPIFA1 gene, previously called PLUNC.|$|R
40|$|Wegener's granulomatosis is a multisystem {{disease with}} {{variable}} clinical expression.

5|$|The {{size of the}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> and {{the flow}} of air also protect the lungs from larger {{particles}}. Smaller particles deposit in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are trapped in nasal hair after inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract,</b> skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E

50|$|T. gallinae is {{generally}} {{found in the}} oral-nasal cavity or anterior end of the digestive and <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts.</b> The trichomonads multiply rapidly by simple division (binary fission), but do not form a resistant cyst. They therefore die quickly when passed out of the host.|$|R
5|$|HSP occurs {{more often}} in {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows an upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infection. Half of affected patients are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in boys as in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the upper <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract.</b> The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{are part}} of the lower <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract,</b> and {{accommodate}} the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea. The lungs include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
40|$|Particle {{inhalation}} {{from the}} ambient environment and particle deposition in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> are numerically investigated using an integrated breathing human manikin which includes detailed facial features {{as well as}} nasal cavity, laryngopharynx and trachea. Visualized and quantitative results including the airflow field, particle tracks and particle inhalation and deposition patterns are obtained. Compared with the previous studies which dealt with particle inhalation and deposition separately, this integrated method provides a comprehensive method for assessment of health risk associated with particle inhalation since it make it possible to trace particles from their source in the environment into their deposition locations in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts.</b> More importantly, this method eliminates the information loss of velocity profile at the nostrils, which leads to a more accurate prediction...|$|R

5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract,</b> which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections.|$|E
5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
