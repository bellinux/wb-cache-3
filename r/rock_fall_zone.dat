40|$|Sheppard, Rebecca J. Located in {{the scenic}} Yosemite Valley, {{and at the}} base of its towering cliffs, is Curry Village, {{historically}} called Camp Curry after founders David and Jennie Curry. The camp, established in 1899, began with only seven canvas tents and soon flourished into a successful business. The camp continually expanded, eventually becoming a driving force behind the development of overnight lodging within Yosemite National Park. In an attempt to offer accommodations beyond canvas tents, twenty-four wooden cabins with baths were added to the site in 1918, followed by another four in 1919, and in 1923 the final nineteen were completed. With the addition of these rustic style lodging structures guests were offered the option of staying in a canvas tent or a hard-sided cabin with modern amenities including access to an attached private or semiprivate bath, hot and cold running water, heat and electricity. Spurred by changing tourism trends and the popularity of the national parks, the construction of these forty-seven new structures on the site allowed Camp Curry to diversify its overnight offerings appealing to more visitors. Today, forty-six of the forty-seven cabins with baths stand in their original locations and suffer from a number of deterioration issues and deferred maintenance affecting the appearance of the structures and their energy efficiency. However, these cabins still maintain a majority of their character-defining features, adding to the historic character of the camp. All cabins were rented to overnight guests until October 2008 when a rock slide in Curry Village permanently closed a number of structures, including twenty of the historic cabins. These structures, although undamaged, are within the designated <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> <b>zone</b> and have remained untouched since the initial rock fall while the cabins outside of the designated area are minimally maintained. This thesis analyzes and documents the current condition of all cabins with baths and makes recommendations for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction of these structures. Included in these plans are proposed designs for the adaptation of the core of the buildings to improve energy efficiency and guest comfort. A proposed plan for the relocation of the twenty historic cabins within the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> <b>zone</b> is described, in an effort to facilitate their future use by visitors. Because these structures {{are an integral part of}} the history and architecture of Camp Curry and Yosemite, this thesis advocates for their long-term preservation, retention and use within Curry Village.

40|$|The {{identification}} of risky areas along the railroad {{in the context}} of a railway system is a complex problem. A railway system is spatially and functionally distributed; its subsystems have a high degree of autonomy, and are in constant interaction with each other and with their geographic environment. In order to identify risky areas in the vicinity of <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> <b>zones</b> we need to model and simulate the train behaviours in large scale geographic environments. Such a process involves coping with a variety of dynamic variables including the train characteristics, the environment properties as well as the weather conditions. The traditional mathematical and statistical modelling techniques which are usually used for the {{identification of}} risky areas do not satisfy all the requirements of such a complex process where spatial constraints are of high importance. In this context, multi-Agent geo-Simulation provides a flexible approach that can be used to easily simulate complex systems in large scale georeferenced environments. The purpose of this paper is to present Train-MAGS, an agent-based geosimulation tool which simulates train behaviours and identifies risky areas in large scale geographic environments. We show how agentbased simulation opens interesting perspectives regarding the development of new functionalities to improve risk assessment in the transportation field, more particularly for railway networks...|$|R
40|$|A medium-ranged high {{performance}} handheld reflectorless laser measurement system, {{was used for}} a morphological survey on the Strug <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> in W Slovenia in the period from August 2003 to August 2004. The purpose was to evaluate its potential for monitoring ground surface changes in <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> source areas and to help evaluating morphological changes by measuring distance from fixed points. In the area, 21 fixed geodetic points have been established. Altogether, seven measurement sets with more than 5500 points have been gathered in the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> area. Choosing a point cloud with a density of less than 1 point per 10 m 2 on a very rough <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> surface failed {{to be a good}} solution. The changes on larger areas were shown by displacements of selected significantly large-sized rock blocks with a volume of several m 3. Because only smaller changes were observed between the single field series, the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> surface generally remained unchanged. Local surface changes of the order of 1 m or more, were clearly shown by measurements in the selected referenced cross sections. The usage of these cross sections gave a possibility to evaluate volumetric changes on the surface. The laser measurement system provided a good replacement for the classical terrestrial geodetic survey equipment, especially when performing remote monitoring of morphological changes in <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> hazard <b>zones,</b> however, the case is different when fixed points are to be measured precisely...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) {{is being}} {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} field of geology and, among the others, in the planning of quarrying activity. This technology can be useful in underground quarries where it is difficult to acquire information related to the different morphologies and to model the excavation surfaces. In this context this technique can be useful in tackling various problems and facilitating a proper planning of quarrying activities in respect to safety. By generating clouds of points, three-dimensional laser scanning overcomes most of the limitations of traditional methods, rapidly supplying accurate and detailed geometrical information. TLS, in fact, has the capability of obtaining very large amounts of geometric data (millions of points) with sub-centimetric accuracy in short working times. Furthermore, {{in the last few years}} the time needed for acquiring such a data has been significantly reduced: only three years ago it could take hours for scanning a whole underground quarry, while today within few minutes you can get a dense 3 D point cloud: the speed of data acquisition has passed from thousands to millions of points per second. This work aims to make a contribution to the existing body of knowledge in mining studies, presenting a multi-temporal point clouds comparison. The general purpose of this study is to propose an innovative and efficient methodology to investigate the morphological differences of extracted material in an underground marble quarry of the Apuan Alps (Italy), over a sample time frame of three years. In total three different field surveys were carried out using terrestrial laser scanning. In addition, GPS and Total Station were utilized to georeference the point clouds in an absolute reference system in order to be able to link all the different surveys. This process, named as registration, was carried out by using targets as constraints to apply a spatial transformation (3 D roto-translation). After each scan, high resolution images were taken in order to color every individual point of the cloud through a texturing process. Later, the data acquired was processed using the open source CloudCompare software and, specifically, the M 3 C 2 plugin which enables point clouds analysis. This approach consists in performing a direct comparison of point clouds computing distances in 3 D and using search cylinders to find corresponding points between the two clouds. This method delivers accurate results and it has a much more straightforward workflow respect to other existing approaches. In fact, thanks to the direct comparison of point cloud and thanks to the absence of surface meshing or DEM generation, it does not introduce an error due to interpolation process. Lastly, it enables to perform change detection analyses with point clouds related to different temporal epochs. In this work the point clouds have demonstrated to be a powerful tool for three-dimensional characterization of underground quarrying activities. Moreover, the accuracy of the involved data, together with the rapidity of acquisition, make this procedure adaptable in several contexts and promising for the future. In addition, this method allows quarry workers to gain information about the morphological differences of extracted material and possible <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> <b>zones.</b> Finally, allowing reliable evaluation of productivity, this approach can be used to correctly plan future excavation activities...|$|R

In historical time (1857 ? 2002) 392 <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> and <b>rock</b> slides have been documented in the valley, {{and some of them}} have been mapped in detail. We present the results of an attempt to assess <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> hazards in the Yosemite Valley. Spatial and temporal aspects of <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> hazard are considered.

The extent of the areas potentially subject to <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> hazards in the Yosemite Valley were obtained using STONE, a physically-based <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> simulation computer program. The software computes 3 -dimensional <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> trajectories starting from a digital elevation model (DEM), the location of <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> release points, and maps of the dynamic rolling friction coefficient and of the coefficients of normal and tangential energy restitution. For each DEM cell the software calculates the number of <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> passing through the cell, the maximum <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> velocity and the maximum flying height. For the Yosemite Valley, a DEM with a ground resolution of 10 × 10 m was prepared using topographic contour lines from the U. S. Geological Survey 1 : 24 000 -scale maps. <b>Rock</b> <b>fall</b> release points were identified as DEM cells having a slope steeper than 60 °, an assumption based on the location of historical <b>rock</b> <b>falls.</b> Maps of the normal and tangential energy restitution coefficients and of the rolling friction coefficient were produced from a surficial geologic map. The availability of historical <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> mapped in detail allowed us to check the computer program performance and to calibrate the model parameters.

40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>falls</b> were {{monitored}} in Yosemite Valley using seismic and infrasound sensors {{in order}} to gain insights into the feasibility of <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> detection and <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> processes. The research objectives were to characterize the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> seismic signal and use that data to study the initiation, triggering, and dynamics of <b>rock</b> <b>falls,</b> correlate the data with physical and environmental conditions, and to search for potential <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> precursors. Yosemite Valley has approximately one <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> per week in an area that measures 15 km 2, making it an ideal laboratory for monitoring <b>rock</b> <b>falls.</b> Data were collected continuously at 500 - 1000 sps using a network of one to four stations during two winter seasons. Three stations were located within a 600 m long footprint on the cliff or {{at the base of the}} historically active Middle Brother formation and one station was located 2 km to the east. There were three widely reported <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> that were also easily identifiable in the seismic data: these three events were critical in the development of a triggering algorithm and criteria for distinguishing <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> from the thousands of triggers. In addition to <b>rock</b> <b>falls,</b> snow avalanches, construction activity, rain, wind, pressure waves generated from Yosemite Falls, thermally-driven long period seismic anomalies, and earthquakes triggered or were identified in the seismic and acoustic data. A total of twelve to seventeen <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> were recorded, out of which only eight were reported by eyewitnesses. All but one <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> event came from within one kilometer of the seismic network and originated at four distinct source areas. The spectral similarities between some events allowed them to be placed with high certainty as coming from a particular talus slope even when there were too few stations in operation to precisely locate the source. Detachment and impact signals were recorded for multiple <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> events, and timing delay between detachment and impact correlated well with physical parameters such as falling and impact distances. The Ahwiyah Point <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> on 28 March 2009 was a large enough event to have been widely captured on regional seismic networks and is the only <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> recorded at a distance greater than 1 km. The Ahwiyah Point <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> was uniquely well-documented with pre and post <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> high resolution photography and LiDAR to supplement the seismic and acoustic data. The <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> dynamics were resolved by integrating these different data to show that a large block detached, slid off of a steeply dipping ledge, launched into a ballistic trajectory, impacted the cliff with enough force to detach another large volume of rock, continued down the cliff face to the talus, and produced an airblast upon impact. P and Rayleigh wave phases were recorded for multiple <b>rock</b> <b>falls,</b> although S-waves were generally not detected. P-waves were calculated to have arrived via granitic cliff faces rather than directly through unconsolidated valley sediments via single station polarities and multiple station timing delays. Rayleigh waves generated by <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> on the same cliff as the seismic sensor travel along and are oriented to the cliff face (e. g. tilted from normal). However Rayleigh waves do appear to travel through the valley when arriving from other cliffs and can be difficult to identify due to boundary interactions at the base of the cliff. Distances were calculated using the phase arrival differences of P and Rayleigh waves and the arrival time differences of P and infrasound acoustic waves. Thus, <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> were successfully detected, located, and their dynamics reconstructed with the seismic and acoustic data...|$|R

The combination of multivariate statistical and empirical analyses indicates that (1) “cold and dry weather” and “high rainfall and high wind” are the conditions most likely to trigger <b>rock</b> <b>falls,</b> (2) the main triggering factors of <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> are effective rainfall (for <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> mostly between 200 and 1, 400 m 3 or larger than 10, 000 m 3 and coming from the whole cliff face), freeze/thaw cycles (especially for <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> smaller than 200 m 3 and coming from the foot and top of the cliff face) and marine roughness (<b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> mainly smaller than 200 m 3 and coming from the cliff foot). However, the contribution of each factor to triggering is difficult to determine because of combinations of factors (85 % of 331 cases), relays of processes and hysteresis phenomena.

Over the long term, peak water pressures from intermittent heavy rainfall events have contributed to the slow, creeping movement of the overlying, joint-bounded block resulting in the progressive loading of the underlying rock mass. The rock fracture phase was extremely rapid and overlaps with the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> event. The kinematics of the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> has been interpreted from broken surfaces, scratches and positions of debris.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new method}} (HGP) is {{proposed}} {{to estimate the}} failure probability of potentially unstable rock masses in a homogenous area, {{as a function of}} time. It is based on both geomechanical and historical approaches: the first one is aimed to classify the rock masses according to their relative failure probability, but the time factor can not be approached by a mechanical analysis; the second one to estimate the mean expected <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> number in the studied area, for the considered period and for different volume classes. This <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> frequency can be estimated from a <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> inventory, directly or indirectly using a power law for the volume distribution. A relation between these frequencies and the erosion rate is established, which allows to approach the former from a paleogeographical study. The failure probabilities can be calculated from the expected total <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> number in the area, and the numbers of potential <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> with different relative probabilities.

40|$|Permafrost is {{a common}} and {{important}} thermal phenomenon in the subsurface of high mountains. Its degradation due to climate change may lead to adverse effects, such as decreasing stability of infrastructure or an increase in <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> from permafrost slopes. Research intensively deals with assessing and modeling mountain permafrost conditions, since they are not directly visible and extrapolation of measurements is difficult in steep and inhomogeneous terrain. So far, focus of mountain permafrost modeling studies was typically on the thermal conditions of the near-surface. The objective of this thesis is to describe and analyze mountain permafrost in greater depths (i. e., below the active layer), with a main focus on its three-dimensional distribution and transient effects from past and possible future climate variations. We design a modeling procedure that includes the processes in the atmosphere, at the surface, and in the subsurface, and {{which is based on}} the combination of existing approaches. To calculate subsurface temperature fields we determine ground surface temperatures with a distributed surface energy balance model based on climate time series. The result is used as upper boundary condition in a heat conduction scheme. For the simulation of scenarios of future permafrost conditions, we use climate time series constructed from Regional Climate Model results. The modeling procedure is tested in a number of validation steps, namely sensitivity studies and comparisons with field data. Due to the complex situation in nature, we first apply the modeling procedure to a number of idealized test cases with simplified topography, typical surface and subsurface characteristics, and different climate scenarios. The subsequent application to real topography includes the characterization of permafrost conditions at borehole sites and <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> starting <b>zones.</b> The results indicate a three-dimensional distribution pattern of mountain permafrost, which is mainly influenced by topography and spatially and temporally variable surface temperatures. Isotherms incline steeply and strong lateral heat fluxes exist, which minimizes the influence of the geothermal heat flux. Transient signals from past climate variations in current permafrost temperatures derive mainly from the last glacial period and the major fluctuations during the past millennium. Temperature depressions in high mountains are smaller than in flat terrain, because multi-lateral warming in steep topography accelerates the pace of a surface temperature signal intruding into the subsurface. Simulations of future conditions point to subsurface temperature fields that substantially deviate from stationary conditions and are characterized by deep-reaching and long-term perturbations, generally rising temperatures, and an increase in both volume and vertical extent of warm permafrost zones. In the European Alps, near-surface permafrost on steep south-exposed slopes will have disappeared even in the highest peaks within the next two centuries, but substantial permafrost volumes will remain at depth for centuries to millennia. Three-dimensional and transient modeling tools are important for the comprehensive analysis of mountain permafrost conditions, since in complex mountain topography nearsurface conditions do not provide sufficient information.

This paper analyses some issues concerning fragmen-tal <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> hazard mapping methodologies. Two Swiss ap-proaches based on <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> trajectory simulations results are presented. An application to a site in Switzerland emphasises {{the differences in the}} results, uncertainties related to hazard zoning procedures and the influence of some factors on the mapping process. In particular, the influence of a change in the temporal <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> frequency, of the longer propagation along the slope of only a few computed blocks (defined in this sense as “extreme blocks”) and of the number of runs performed in trajectory modelling have been studied. Results are discussed with the purpose of achieving a more reliable and objective hazard analysis. The presented considerations are based on the Swiss Federal Guidelines, but many of them could be extended to other countries that evaluate <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> hazard using an intensity-frequency diagram. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since 1857 {{more than}} 600 <b>rock</b> <b>falls,</b> <b>rock</b> slides, debris slides, and debris flows have been {{documented}} in Yosemite National Park, with <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> in Yosemite Valley representing {{the majority of the}} events. On 26 December 2003, a <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> originating from west of Glacier Point sent approximately 200 m 3 of rock debris down a series of jointcontrolled ledges to the floor of Yosemite Valley. The debris impacted talus near the base of Staircase Falls, producing fragments of flying rock that struck occupied cabins in Curry Village. Several years later on 9 June 2007, and again on 26 July 2007, smaller <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> originated from the same source area. The 26 December 2003 event coincided with a severe winter storm and was likely triggered by precipitatio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> volume {{distribution}} for three <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> inventories and we fit the observed data by a power-law distribution, which {{has recently been}} proposed to describe landslide and <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> volume distributions, and is also observed for many other natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. We use these statistical distributions of past events to estimate <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> occurrence rates on the studied areas. It is an alternative to deterministic approaches, which have not proved successful in predicting individual <b>rock</b> <b>falls.</b> The first one concerns calcareous cliffs around Grenoble, French Alps, from 1935 to 1995. The second data set is gathered during the 1912 – 1992 time window in Yosemite Valley, USA, in granite cliffs. The third one covers the 1954 – 1976 period in the Arly gorges, French Alps, with metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. For the three data sets, we find a good agreement between the observed volume distributions and a fit by a power-law distribution for volumes larger than 50 m 3, or 20 m 3 for the Arly gorges. We obtain similar values of the b exponent close to 0. 45 for the 3 data sets. In agreement with previous studies, this suggests, that the b value is not dependant on the geological settings. Regarding the rate of <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> activity, determined {{as the number of}} <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> events with volume larger than 1 m 3 per year, we find a large variability from one site to the other. The <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> activity, as part of a local erosion rate, is thus spatially dependent. We discuss the implications of these observations for the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> hazard evaluation. First, assuming that the volume distributions are temporally stable, a complete <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> inventory allows for the prediction of recurrence rates for future events of a given volume in the range of the observed historical data. Second, assuming that the observed volume distribution follows a power-law distribution without cutoff at small or large scales, we can extrapolate these predictions to events smaller or larger than those reported in the data sets. Finally, we discuss the possible biases induced by the poor quality of the <b>rock</b> <b>fall</b> inventories, and the sensibility of the extrapolated predictions to variations in the parameters of the power law...|$|R

40|$|Yosemite Valley has {{experienced}} over 600 <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> since 1850, but determining the exact source areas, volumes, and failure mechanisms for these <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> {{has previously been}} difficult {{because of a lack}} of comprehensive imagery of the cliff faces. We obtained high-resolution imagery, acquired before and after large <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> in Yosemite Valley, California, by combining of gigapixel panoramic photography and terrestrial laser scanning (LiDAR). Following comprehensive baseline image acquisition of Glacier Point in eastern Yosemite Valley, two large <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> occurred from within the imaged area in October of 2008. We used repeat gigapixel photography acquired with GigaPans to characterize the rock-fall detachment surface and adjacent cliff area in high resolution. Coupled with LiDAR analyses, these photos reveal that the <b>rock</b> <b>falls</b> consisted of a near planar, vertically oriented rock slab with a detachment surface area of 2, 409 m 2 and a volume of 5, 663 m 3. These data inform hazard assessment for this and other rock-fall events in Yosemite. Our results demonstrate the utility of high-resolutio...|$|R
