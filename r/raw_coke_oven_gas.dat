40|$|This study {{considers}} {{production of}} methanol as a motor fuel, generated from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> at the steel mill SSAB Tunnplåt in Luleå. In addition, different systems with a biomass gasification plant included are considered. The produced synthesis gas {{is mixed with}} the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> to enhance the methanol production. Different technologies for production of the alcohol are applied. The selected techniques are based upon their advantageous by economical and technical characteristics. The selected systems are modelled in Aspen plus, which is a widely used process simulation software. The resulting dimensions of streams, units and the energy balances are subsequently used for the economic analysis. Global warming caused by an increased concentration of greenhouse gases is of major concern today. It is predicted that global warming will cause sea level rise and other environmental impacts that may harm humans and nature. The significant increase of greenhouse gases over the last 200 years is almost entirely due to human activities and particularly due to combustion of fossil fuels. By using biomass as fuel for production of methanol as motor fuel, it would contribute to decrease the total green house gas emission level. The <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> which origins from fossil based coal, {{could be used in}} a better manner as fuel for methanol production than for increase the present electricity production at LULEKRAFT AB (LUKAB). That is because the methanol production leads to a product with lower specific CO 2 emissions due to that the conversion- and total plant efficiency are much higher. The wood-pellets produced from sawdust at Bioenergi are to a large extent exported from the county to heat and power plants, which purchase the pellets to a low price. A better option would be to use the sawdust for methanol production, which would be more profitable and could be used within the county and thereby also minimize the transportation costs and green house gas emissions. The conclusion is that methanol produced from 400 GWh <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> would have a production cost in the range of 1, 20 - 2, 44 SEK/litre. Methanol produced from both 420 GWh sawdust and the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> would result in a production cost in the range of 1, 20 - 2, 70 SEK/litre. The minimum methanol sale price was calculated via a fuel value analysis which analyzed the fuel input value within the MEOH plant, LUKAB and Bioenergi. The methanol produced from the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> would have a minimum sale price in the range of 1, 20 - 2, 68 SEK/litre. Methanol produced from both sawdust and <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> would result in a minimum sale price in the range of 1, 28 - 3, 17 SEK/litre.

40|$|A novel slag carbon {{arrestor}} process (SCAP) {{was proposed}} to improve the heat recovery in energy-intensive steelmaking process, which typically has a low heat recovery. The proposed SCAP process introduces a tar reformer to utilise the slag - a by-product from steelmaking process - as the catalyst to convert <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> and tar into hydrogen-enriched fuel gas. This is achieved by making use of the valuable carbon and/or energy contained in the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas,</b> which otherwise being wasted, to assist in tar reforming and produce hydrogen-enriched gas. Such concept is expected to reduce the undesired tar formation in steelmaking process along with improved heat recovery efficiency and higher quality <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> production. Both simulation and experimental studies on the slag carbon arrestor process were performed.

The experimental results showed that the highest desulfurization efficiency and sulfur capacity appeared at 673 K. The reactivity of the nanosized active components in the char increased with increasing the desulfurization temperature in the temperature range of 473 - 673 K. In the case of Fe-Mo-impregnated sorbents, Fe and Mo combined together to form complex Fe-Mo oxide phases.

To lower stability requirement of gas production in UCG (underground coal gasification), create better space and opportunities of development for UCG, an emerging sunrise industry, in its initial stage, and reduce the emission of blast furnace gas, converter <b>gas,</b> and <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas,</b> this paper, for the first time, puts forward a new mode of utilization of multiple gas sources mainly including ground gasifier gas, UCG gas, blast furnace gas, converter <b>gas,</b> and <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> and the new mode was demonstrated by field tests. According to the field tests, the existing power generation technology can fully adapt to situation of high hydrogen, low calorific value, and gas output fluctuation in the gas production in UCG in multiple-gas-sources power generation; there are large fluctuations and air {{can serve as a}} gasifying agent; the gas production of UCG in the mode of both power and methanol based on multiple gas sources has a strict requirement for stability. It was demonstrated by the field tests that the fluctuations in gas production in UCG can be well monitored through a quality control chart method. 1...|$|R
