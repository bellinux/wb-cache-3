For example, the A-24 dive bomber trigger motors and solenoids were found to have been overlooked in unpacking and destroyed due to being nailed inside the packing crates and burned with the crates. Few of the troops, mostly artillerymen, were familiar with general supply outside their specialties, yet were now responsible for the unexpected unloading and <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> for retention in Australia or transshipment onward to Java and possibly the Philippines even as they were required to begin forming a base in Australia.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of secretory transport through the Golgi apparatus remain {{an issue of}} debate. The precise functional importance of calcium ions (Ca(2 +)) for intra-Golgi transport has also been poorly studied. Here, using different approaches to measure free Ca(2 +) concentrations in the cell cytosol ([Ca(2 +) ](cyt)) and inside the lumen of the Golgi apparatus ([Ca(2 +) ](GA)), we have revealed transient increases in [Ca(2 +) ](cyt) during the late phase of intra-Golgi transport that are concomitant with {{a decline in the}} maximal [Ca(2 +) ](GA) restoration ability. Thus, this <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> Ca(2 +) from the Golgi apparatus into the cytosol during the movement <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> through the Golgi apparatus appears to have a role in intra-Golgi transport, and mainly in the late Ca(2 +) -dependent phase of SNARE-regulated fusion of Golgi compartments...|$|R
40|$|The article {{gives an}} account of the results of working out a {{generalized}} dynamic model <b>of</b> fixation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads jointly with flexible and thrust elements. Working out a generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> fixation is rather a complicated problem not in the sense of solving differential equations systems but in the sense of presenting them as a complex mechanical system “cargo – pads – flexible elements – thrust bars”. Generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads observed that this model represents technology of joint work of flexible and thrust fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> on rolling stock.

40|$|Does the Liberal Democratic Party (the LDP) really {{intervene}} in the budgetary process? The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the relationship between the LDP, which is the dominant governing party, and the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> public investment. The LDP is widely regarded as having stronger influence over the budgetary process than bureaucrats, and being able to significantly affect the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> public investment. Many political scientists and economists have examined the causal relationship between the LDP’s political power and the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> public capital. Most of them conclude that the LDP has a significant impact on the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> public capital. However, identifying the precise effect of the LDP on the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> public capital is difficult because of a simultaneity problem between electoral success and the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> public investment, and because of the presence of possibly omitted variables like residents’ preference for a specific party. When there are simultaneity problems and omitted variables, ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimates suffer from bias. However, many researches ignore the potential endogeneity of the LDP’s political power. Therefore, there is possibility that the estimated results of previous studies are wrong. To tackle these problems, this paper uses fixed-effect...|$|R

40|$|Rapidly cycling {{proteins}} of {{the early}} secretory pathway can operate as cargo receptors. Known cargo receptors are abundant proteins, but it remains mysterious why their inactivation leads to rather limited secretion phenotypes. Studies of Surf 4, the human orthologue <b>of</b> the yeast <b>cargo</b> receptor Erv 29 p, now reveal a novel function <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> receptors. Surf 4 was found to interact with endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) - 53 and p 24 proteins. Silencing Surf 4 together with ERGIC- 53 or silencing the p 24 family member p 25 induced an identical phenotype characterized by a reduced number of ERGIC clusters and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus without effect on anterograde transport. Live imaging showed decreased stability of ERGIC clusters after knockdown of p 25. Silencing of Surf 4 /ERGIC- 53 or p 25 resulted in partial <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> coat protein (COP) I but not Golgi matrix proteins to the cytosol and partial resistance of the cis-Golgi to brefeldin A. These findings imply that cargo receptors are essential for maintaining the architecture of ERGIC and Golgi by controlling COP I recruitment...|$|R
