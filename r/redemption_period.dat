Hedge funds with greater managerial incentives, proxied by the delta of the option-like incentive fee contracts, higher levels of managerial ownership, and the inclusion of high-water mark provisions in the incentive contracts, are associated with superior performance.

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} history of {{mortgage}} law in the United States. I explore {{the history of}} foreclosure procedures, <b>redemption</b> <b>periods,</b> restrictions on deficiency judgments, and foreclosure moratoria. The historical record shows that the most enduring aspects of mortgage law stem from case law rather than statute. In particular, the ability of creditors to foreclose nonjudicially is determined very early in states’ histories, usually before the Civil War, and usually in case law. In contrast, the aspects of mortgage law developed through statute change more frequently. This finding calls into question whether common law is inherently more flexible than the civil-law system used in some other countries.

5000|$|American Tax Funding (ATF) is {{a private}} company based in Jupiter, Florida that engages in the {{purchasing}} and servicing of delinquent municipal real estate tax lien sales. Originally formed in 1997 as Transamerica Municipal Finance (TMF), a division of Transamerica Corporation. In August 2000 the founders completed a form of a management buyout of TMF, creating ATF. ATF currently buys and services real estate tax liens in over 14 states and has provided over $1 billion in relief to local governments. Many ATF tax liens are secured by either Wells Fargo Foot Hill or the Harris Nesbitt Corporation. The process of privatizing the municipal tax foreclosures process and outsourcing to out of state third party, for-profit, private companies has drawn criticism from housing advocates who argue that a for-profit tax foreclosure process leads to more foreclosures, displacement and vacancy. [...] The other argument is that third party purchases of tax liens enables local governments to pay for essential services such as salaries for teachers, health care, police officers and firefighters. To date, no study {{has shown that the}} sale of tax liens to third parties leads to any increase in foreclosure activity.

[...] Usually the lien holder is not permitted during this period to contact the property owner (or anyone else having an interest in the property, such as the mortgage holder) to demand payment or threaten foreclosure, or else the lienholder can face sanctions (such as: termination of the lien and loss of money spent, being banned from future sales, and/or criminal charges).|$|E

Looking back through Americanlegislative history, one sees both the state legislatures and the Congress intervening on behalf of debtors {{in a variety of ways}} onmany occasions. An early example of such intervention was the enactment, particularly in the Midwest and West, of generous exemption laws that removed a variety of property beyond the reach of general creditors.

Other examples are laws giving mortgagors rights to redeem property after foreclosures and laws providing for upset prices at foreclosure sales.
