50|$|A {{material}} generally deforms elastically {{under the}} influence of small forces; the material <b>returns</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original shape when the deforming force is removed. This phenomenon is called elastic deformation. This behavior in materials is described by Hooke's Law. Materials behave elastically until the deforming force increases beyond the elastic limit, which is also known as the yield stress. At that point, the material is permanently deformed and fails <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original shape when the force is removed. This phenomenon is called plastic deformation. For example, if one stretches a coil spring up to a certain point, it will <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original shape, but once it is stretched beyond the elastic limit, it will remain deformed and won't <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original state.|$|R
