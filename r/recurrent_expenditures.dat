In this paper, we empirically examine the importance of leakage of government resources in the health sector in Chad and its effects on medication mark-up. We make use of data collected in Chad as part of a Health Facilities Survey organized by the World Bank in 2004. The survey covers 281 primary health care centers and hospitals and contains information on the provision of medical material, financial resources and medication allocated by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to the regional administration and primary health centers. While the regional administration is officially allocated 60 % of the MoH’s non-wage <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures,</b> the share of the resources that actually reach the regions is estimated to be 18 %. The health centers, which are the frontline providers and the entry point for the population, receive less than 1 % of the MoH’s non-wage <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Accounting for the endogeneity of the level of competition among health centers, we observe that leakage of government resources has a significant and negative impact on the mark-up health centers charge patients on drugs sales.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between capital expenditures and gross fixed capital formation in Nigeria. The study made use of secondary data covering the period 1981 to 2011. A least square regression analysis was carried out on a time series data, and to avert the emergence of spurious results, unit root tests were conducted. Other econometric tools of co- integration, Vector Auto Regression technique as well as Granger causality tests were deployed to ascertain the order of co integration {{and the level of}} relationships existing between the dependent and independent variables. Findings of study reveal that while Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) maintained a negative significant relationship with Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in Nigeria at both 1 % and 5 % Alpha levels; Imports and National Savings had a positive significant relationship with GFCF at both the short and long runs. It was equally observed that the lagged value of GFCF had no significant impact on GFCF in the preceding year. Outcome of study did not come as a surprise, seeing that a functional classification of Nigeria’s expenditure profile for the period under review reveals that; outlays on capital expenditure accounted for only about 32 % of total expenditures, while the remaining balance of 68 % went to <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures.</b> That is certainly not good enough for a nation that is aspiring to grow.

40|$|Jamaica's {{fiscal and}} debt {{position}} {{has long been}} recognized as a major issue for the country, and the country has made several attempts to resolve this challenge by increasing revenue or reducing expenditures. Despite these adjustments, Jamaica has systematically failed to achieve its budget targets. This analysis shows that the major weakness in the budget planning execution is revenue projection, which influences planned expenditures. In contrast, the limitation in reducing rigid <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures</b> -mostly interest and wage salary payments- {{has led to the}} introduction of measures aimed at meeting appropriate revenue targets. In addition, capital expenditure has systematically underperformed relative to the budget, possibly to compensate for these weaknesses.

Using quarterly time series data, a clear pattern emerges of pre-election manipulations of fiscal policy by incumbent governments, mainly {{in the form of}} increased development spending and overall primary expenditure, followed in some cases by retrenchment in post-election periods. These findings are consistent with the predictions of rational opportunistic political business cycle theory. It is noteworthy that revenue was not statistically significantly related to elections, either in the pre- or post-election period. In this regard, electoral swings in fiscal deficits reflect a preference for influencing expenditures rather than taxation.

40|$|Provides detail {{regarding}} {{trends in}} health expenditure between 2003 - 04 and 2013 - 14 for <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> and capital expenditure. Summary This report is {{a companion to}} Health expenditure Australia 2013 - 14. It provides more detail regarding trends in health expenditure between 2003 - 04 and 2013 - 14 for <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> and capital <b>expenditure.</b> <b>Recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> is categorised according to the whether the expenditure was on hospitals, primary health care, or other health goods and services. Of particular focus in this report are trends in the sources of funds for each category of health expenditure as well as variations between jurisdictions. Total expenditure by source of funds As noted in Health expenditure Australia 2013 - 14, over the decade from 2003 - 04 to 2013 - 14, <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> increased {{for all types of}} health goods and services, as did capital expenditure, and expenditure for all sources of funds. Growth in expenditure by governments has been relatively slow, however, over the past 2 years. In 2013 - 14, estimated Australian Government funding per person on health averaged $ 2, 725, which was $ 653 more in real terms than in 2003 - 04 but just $ 30 more in real terms than in the previous year. All state and territory governments except New South Wales reduced their per person expenditure in 2012 - 13. In 2013 - 14, Queensland, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory continued to decrease their per person <b>expenditure.</b> Trends in <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> In 2013 - 14, $ 58. 8 billion was spent on Hospitals in Australia, $ 54. 7 billion on Primary health care and $ 32. 0 billion on Other health goods and services. Hospitals made up around 40 % of <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> throughout the decade, Primary health care accounted for 38 % and the remaining 22 % was for Other health goods and services. In 2012 - 13 and 2013 - 14, Unreferred medical services attracted the highest share of Primary health care funding at 19. 1 % and 19. 3 %, respectively. This was different to earlier in the decade, when benefit-paid pharmaceuticals attracted the most spending from 2008 - 09 to 2011 - 12. Related to this, growth in expenditure on benefit-paid pharmaceuticals slowed in the last 3 years compared {{with the rest of the}} decade. This slower growth in expenditure was in contrast to a steady increase in the number of prescriptions dispensed over the same period; this suggests that slower expenditure growth in this case did not necessarily mean fewer services. Around 50 % of Other health goods and services expenditure is through Referred medical services, with an expenditure of $ 16. 1 billion in 2013 - 14. The fastest growth in expenditure on Referred medical services over the decade was by private health insurers (6. 1 %), who also had the highest growth in 2013 - 14 (5. 5 %). Trends in capital expenditure In 2013 - 14, there was $ 9. 1 billion in Capital expenditure related to health. There was a relatively rapid increase in Capital expenditure by the state and territory and local governments between 2009 - 10 and 2011 - 12, which was supported by the $ 5. 0 billion Health and Hospitals Fund established by the Australian Government in 2009.
