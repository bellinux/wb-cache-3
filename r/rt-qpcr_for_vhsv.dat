Reverse genetics system is currently available <b>for</b> <b>VHSV.</b> A vaccinia virus free reverse genetic system <b>for</b> Great Lakes <b>VHSV</b> (Genotype IVb) was developed by a research group from the USA. This system allows the investigators to explore the functional properties of individual viral genes of VHSV in detail. This system was immediately utilized to characterize the non-virion (NV) gene of novirhabdoviruses. Even though it has been demonstrated that the NV gene is not necessary for viral replication, it is highly essential for viral pathogenesis. A new role of NV protein has been discovered and demonstrated that it inhibits apoptosis at the early stage of viral infection. This discovery unlocked the mystery of presence of NV proteins in novirhabdoviruses.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The leech Myzobdella lugubris is {{widespread}} in the Lake Erie Watershed, especially Lake St. Clair. However, its role in pathogen transmission is not fully understood. In this same watershed, several widespread fish mortalities associated with the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSV) were recorded. Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia is an emerging disease in the Great Lakes Basin that is deadly to the fish population, yet {{little is known about}} its mode of transmission. To assess the potential role of M. lugubris in VHSV transmission, leeches were collected from Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie and pooled into samples of five. Cell culture and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the presence of the virus and its identity. Results showed that 57 of the 91 pooled leech samples were positive by cell culture <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> and 66 of the 91 pooled leech samples were positive by RT-PCR <b>for</b> the <b>VHSV.</b> Two representative virus isolates were sequenced for further genetic confirmation and genotype classification. VHSV detected within M. lugubris was homologous to the Great Lakes strain of VHSV genotype IVb.

With a broad host range and a long-term persistence, VHSV has become a worldwide threat, particularly to both fish farming and recreational fishing. As {{a result of the}} massive mortality events between 2005 - 2007 followed by disease disappearance in the Great Lakes, research began to focus on understanding the mechanisms of transmission and persistence of this new genotype of VHSV, IVb. In this study, a robust quantitative RT-PCR assay was first developed to provide a more sensitive tool to survey fish in the Great Lakes and has allowed the detection of persistent sub-clinical VHSV IVb infections throughout the region. The mechanisms of viral entry, replication, shedding, and transmission are only partially understood {{due to the lack of}} a suitable laboratory model host <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> IVb. A second phase of this work is the development a zebrafish model <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> IVb immersion infection that reflects many parameters governing infection of fish in the wild. This model has been used to evaluate temperature, dose and age effects on disease susceptibility. Using this model we have shown that VHSV IVb RNA and infectious virus are readily detected in infected postmortem zebrafish for more than 100 days at 4 °C in air or water suggesting that deceased fish may contribute to viral persistence. Data are presented to show that direct physical contact with an infected host greatly enhances VHSV IVb transmission. Together data from the study will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms of infection and transmission of VHSV IVb and provide a platform for further studies and translation to VHSV IVb transmission and pathogenesis in natural hosts...|$|R

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 is involved in the processes of remodeling and inflammation, which play key role in tissue fibrosis. The aim of the study was, therefore, to investigate the effect of PDE 4 inhibition in experimental model of PF. Methods: PF was induced in C 57 BL/ 6 N mice by instillation of bleomycin. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE 4 was achieved by using cilomilast, a selective PDE 4 inhibitor. Changes in either lung inflammation or remodeling were evaluated at different stages of experimental PF. Lung inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) differential cell count and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (<b>RT-qPCR)</b> <b>for</b> inflammatory cytokines.

However,it is becoming evident that persistent leukemic stem cells, which are in-sensitive to TKIs in their quiescent state, can lead to CML recurring. Nanog is a pluripotency gene associated to {{a vital role in}} neoplasia, correlating with cell proliferation, clonogenic growth, tumorigenicity, and therapeutic resistance. Our group carried out microarray experiments on Ph+ KCL 22 cell line with a sensible (Kcl 22 -S) or resistant (Kcl 22 -R) phenotype to Imatinib (Ima). The gene expression of Nanog was significantly increased in the Kcl 22 -R. Thus, we sought to investigate the role of Nanog in the TKI resistance observed in patients with CML-CP. Methods: Real Time RT-PCR (<b>RT-qPCR)</b> <b>for</b> the expression of Nanog was con- ducted on Ph+ K 562 cell line treated with increasing doses of Ima. Western blotting (WB) analysis was conducted for the protein expression of Nanog on K 562 cells treated with 5 uM Ima. RNA was purified from mononuclear cells of 27 CML patients at diagnosis and after 3 months of TKI treatment. Patients were monitored by <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> the expres- sion of the fusion BCR-ABL mRNA. <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> the expression of Nanog, was conducted. RT-qPCR results were normalized by the ex- pression of Gus mRNA (Normalized mRNA copy Number: NCN). Re- sults: We observed a significant increase of Nanog mRNA expression in K 562 cells treated with 0. 5 uM of Imatinib. Moreover, we were also able to observe a significant increase of Nanog protein expression in K 562 cells treated with 1 - 5 uM Imatinib by WB. In peripheral blood samples of CML patients at diagnosis, we observed a significant higher mRNA expression of Nanog in No-Optimal Responder compared to Optimal Responder patients (NANOg mRNA: 0. 3 ± 0. 25 NCN by GUS mRNA vs 0. 6 ± 0. 7 NCN by GUS mRNA) Conclusions and Summary: These data sug- gest that the expression analysis of Nanog at CML patient baseline, may assist in the early prediction of molecular response in patients treated with TKI.

In standard hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test both polyclonal NDV antiserum and monoclonal antibodies 161 / 617 specific for pigeon variants of NDV showed inhibition of heamagglutination of the isolated virus. Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) has shown that the isolate is mesogenic virus (ICPI = 0. 81). One-step <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> detection of M gene was performed indicating a presence of NDV and <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> discrimination between lentogenic and velogenic strains based on F gene was also performed indicating a presence of virulent NDV. A portion of the F gene was amplified and sequenced for determination of virulence and phylogenetic characterization. The F protein cleavage site sequence of the isolate had multiple basic amino acids at residues 112 – 116 and a phenyl alanine at residue 117 (112 RRQKR*F 117) which is typical for velogenic strains.

40|$|Even in {{the adult}} {{mammalian}} brain progenitor cells proliferate and give rise to young neurons which integrate into the neuronal network. The dentate gyrus possesses such a neurogenic niche reactive to external stimuli like physical activity.

To address this issue, we allowed male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice free access to a running wheel for 2 or 7 days. We injected bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) before the last running night, respectively, and quantified cell proliferation with immunocytochemistry for BrdU and Ki- 67. Furthermore, we performed immunocytochemistry for doublecortin (DCX) and real-time <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> NeuroD 1 to characterize and quantify changes in neurogenesis on the protein and mRNA level. Real-time <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> neurogenic niche factors (BDNF, FGF- 2, BMP 4, Noggin) was used to detect changes in the molecular composition of the neurogenic niche. Interestingly, we observed that cell proliferation was already affected after 2 days of running showing a transient decrease, which was followed by a rebound with increased proliferation after 7 days. Neurogenesis was stimulated after 2 days of running, reflected by elevated NeuroD 1 mRNA levels, and it was significantly increased after 7 days as indicated by DCX immunostaining. On the level of niche factors we observed changes in expression in favor of neuronal differentiation (increased BDNF mRNA expression) and proliferation (decreased BMP 4 mRNA expression) already after 2 days, although increased proliferation is reflected on the cellular level only later. In summary, our data show that 2 days of running are sufficient to activate neurogenic processes and we hypothesize that a strong pressure toward differentiation privileges neurogenesis while proliferation lags behind...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High {{throughput}} {{applications of}} the reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (<b>RT-qPCR)</b> <b>for</b> quantification of gene expression demand straightforward procedures to isolate and analyze {{a considerable number of}} DNA-free RNA samples. Published protocols are labour intensive, use toxic organic chemicals and need a DNase digestion once pure RNAs have been isolated. In addition, for some tissues, the amount of starting material may be limiting. The convenience of commercial kits is often prohibitive when handling large number of samples. Findings We have established protocols to isolate DNA-free RNA from Arabidopsis thaliana tissues ready <b>for</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> applications. Simple non-toxic buffers were used for RNA isolation from Arabidopsis tissues with the exception of seeds and siliques, which required the use of organic extractions. The protocols were designed to minimize the number of steps, labour time and the amount of starting tissue to as little as 10 – 20 mg without affecting RNA quality. In both protocols genomic DNA (gDNA) can be efficiently removed from RNA samples before the final alcohol precipitation step, saving extra purification steps before cDNA synthesis. The expression kinetics of previously characterized genes confirmed the robustness of the procedures. Conclusion Here, we present two protocols to isolate DNA-free RNA from Arabidopsis tissues ready <b>for</b> <b>RT-qPCR</b> applications that significantly improve existing ones by reducing labour time and the use of organic extractions.

40|$|University of {{minnesota}} Ph. D. dissertation. February 2013. Major: Veterinary Medicine. Advisors:Sagar M. Goyal and Katharine M. Pelican. 1 computer file (PDF); xi, 165 pages, appendices A-B. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) {{is a highly}} contagious and pathogenic virus, affecting more than 70 farm raised and wild fish species worldwide. A new viral strain (VHSV-IVb) has proven both virulent and persistent, spreading throughout the Great Lakes of North America and to inland water bodies in the region. As this new biological hazard continues to grow, so too must {{our understanding of the}} disease. The focus of this dissertation is to improve diagnostic capacity and management of VHSV-IVb to rapidly respond to outbreaks, prevent further dissemination, and scientifically justify current prevention strategies. To better understand the geographic distribution of the virus, we used a modified real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay for high-throughput testing of fish <b>for</b> <b>VHSV.</b> The assay was shown to be twice as sensitive as the gold standard, virus isolation, and did not cross react with other viruses found in fish. In addition, the diagnostic turnaround time was reduced from 28 - 30 days for virus isolation to 2 - 4 days for rRT-PCR. To demonstrate the usefulness of the rRT-PCR assay, 115 high priority water bodies in Minnesota were tested by both methods from April 2010 - June 2011. All survey sites tested negative <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> by both methods. The survey results have informed fisheries managers on the absence of VHSV in Minnesota and have better prepared them for the eventual arrival of the disease. In addition, the results demonstrate the value of this rRT-PCR as a surveillance tool to rapidly identify an outbreak {{so that it can be}} controlled in a timely manner. The aforementioned rRT-PCR assay (Phelps et al. 2012) along with another (Jonstrup et al. 2012), were evaluated for the potential for sample-induced inhibition from common diagnostic samples, including kidney/spleen, entire viscera, and ovarian fluid. The detection of high, medium, and low VHSV-IVb dilutions in each tissue type was not affected using the assay by Jonstrup et al (2012). However, using the assay by Phelps et al. (2012), the detection of VHSV-IVb was decreased for the kidney/spleen samples spiked with low virus levels and increased for the ovarian fluid spiked with medium virus levels. Entire viscera, the tissue type most likely to inhibit the rRT-PCR reaction, did not affect the sensitivity of virus detection for either assay. The emergence of VHSV-IVb in the Great Lakes region has resulted in unprecedented regulatory response to better manage the disease. In Minnesota, all VHSV-susceptible fish must be inspected annually prior to intra or interstate movement - a significant bottleneck for the aquaculture industry. In 2009, Minnesota enacted legislation requiring fish for regulatory health inspections to be collected by a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) approved individual. The so-called Fish Health Collector could be 1) an American Fisheries Society - Fish Health Section Fish Health Inspector or Pathologist, 2) an accredited veterinarian with approved training, or 3) an individual (i. e. MNDNR field biologist) with approved training. In response, a fish health collector training workshop was developed for veterinarians and field biologists to fulfill the MNDNR requirements. A manual was developed to supplement a full-day workshop and provide the basic information and references to perform a fish health collection. This training resulted in a sufficient number of fish health collectors, well distributed across Minnesota, now available to rapidly respond to a disease outbreak and better serve the regulatory needs of the aquaculture industry. In the USA, current state and federal fish health regulations target the spread of VHSV-IVb through movement restrictions of live fish but largely ignore the potential for the virus to be spread through the commercial distribution and use of frozen baitfish from VHSV-IVb positive regions. Some state laws do require treatment of frozen baitfish to inactivate VHSV and additional methods have been proposed, but there have been few scientific studies examining the efficacy of these treatments. In an effort to evaluate these treatments, bluegills were challenged with VHSV-IVb, frozen to represent standard industry methods, disinfected by various treatments, and tested for infectious VHSV-IVb using virus isolation. The virus was isolated from 70 % of fish subjected to three freeze thaw cycles. All other treatment methods were effective in inactivating the virus, including treatment with isopropyl alcohol, mineral oil, salt with borax, and dehydration. Dehydration followed by rehydration is rapid and effective, and therefore, seems to be the best option for inactivating VHSV-IVb present in frozen baitfish while maintaining their usefulness as bait. Monitoring or regulating all risk factors for the transmission of VHSV is an infeasible task. A semi-quantitative risk assessment model was utilized to focus VHSV management efforts in Minnesota. The risk of VHSV introduction to major watersheds in Minnesota was directly correlated with proximity to Lake Superior, the only VHSV-positive waterbody in the state. Although the current regulations are uniform across Minnesota, the risk varied for specific locations within the watersheds. For example, the introduction of game fish for stock enhancement (a common fisheries management practice) was found to be a significant risk factor <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> introduction into public waterbodies and waterbodies frequently used for wild baitfish harvest. Aquaculture facilities with strict biosecurity programs and frequent health inspections received the lowest risk scores and were largely considered protected and of low risk <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> introduction. These results suggest the current management strategy, based on political boundaries, should be reevaluated. A risk-based management strategy would better allocate efforts to watersheds or specific waterbodies at higher risk and relax efforts in areas of lower risk of VHSV introduction in Minnesota...|$|R

Without exposure to UVC, IHNV and VHSV were maintained in 4 °C blood water for up to 48 hours without significant reduction in virus titer. However when exposed to UVC radiation using a low pressure mercury vapour lamp collimated beam, IHNV and VHSV were inactivated, and the efficacy of UVC radiation was dependent upon the solution and virus type being treated.

40|$|Abstract Background Pulmonary {{fibrosis}} (PF) is a {{group of}} devastating and largely irreversible diseases. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 is involved in the processes of remodeling and inflammation, which play key role in tissue fibrosis. The aim of the study was, therefore, to investigate the effect of PDE 4 inhibition in experimental model of PF. Methods PF was induced in C 57 BL/ 6 N mice by instillation of bleomycin. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE 4 was achieved by using cilomilast, a selective PDE 4 inhibitor. Changes in either lung inflammation or remodeling were evaluated at different stages of experimental PF. Lung inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) differential cell count and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (<b>RT-qPCR)</b> <b>for</b> inflammatory cytokines. Changes in tissue remodeling were evaluated by pulmonary compliance measurement, quantified pathological examination, measurement of collagen deposition and <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> late remodeling markers. Survival in all groups was analyzed as well. Results PDE 4 inhibition significantly reduced the total number of alveolar inflammatory cells in BALF of mice with bleomycin-induced PF at early fibrosis stage (days 4 and 7). Number of macrophages and lymphocytes, but not neutrophils, was significantly reduced as well. Treatment decreased lung tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α mRNA level and increased mRNA level of interleukin (IL) - 6 but did not influence IL- 1 β. At later stage (days 14 and 24) cilomilast improved lung function, which was shown by increase in lung compliance. It also lowered fibrosis degree, as was shown by quantified pathological examination of Hematoxilin-Eosin stained lung sections. Cilomilast had no significant effect on the expression of late remodeling markers such as transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 and collagen type Ia 1 (COL(I) α 1). However, it tended to restore the level of lung collagen, assessed by SIRCOL assay and Masson's trichrome staining, and to improve the overall survival. Conclusions Selective PDE 4 inhibition suppresses early inflammatory stage and attenuates the late stage of experimental pulmonary fibrosis. </p...|$|R

Sensitive and quantitative detection of human enteric viruses is typically achieved through quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). A nanofluidic real-time PCR system was used to develop novel high-throughput methods for qualitative molecular detection (RT-qPCR array) and quantification of human pathogenic viruses by digital RT-PCR (RT-dPCR). The performance of high-throughput PCR methods was investigated for detecting 19 human pathogenic viruses and two main process controls used in food virology. The conventional real-time PCR system was compared to the RT-dPCR and RT-qPCR array. Based {{on the number of}} genome copies calculated by spectrophotometry, sensitivity was found to be slightly better with RT-qPCR than with RT-dPCR for 14 viruses by a factor range of from 0. 3 to 1. 6 log 10. Conversely, sensitivity was better with RT-dPCR than with <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> seven viruses by a factor range of from 0. 10 to 1. 40 log 10. Interestingly, the number of genome copies determined by RT-dPCR was always from 1 to 2 log 10 lower than the expected copy number calculated by RT-qPCR standard curve. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR and RT-qPCR array assays was found to be similar for two viruses, and better with RT-qPCR than with <b>RT-qPCR</b> array <b>for</b> eighteen viruses by a factor range of from 0. 7 to 3. 0 log 10.

Finally, the RT-qPCR array and RT-dPCR assays were successfully used together to screen clinical samples and quantify pathogenic viruses. Additionally, this method made it possible to identify co-infection in clinical samples. In conclusion, given the rapidity and potential for large numbers of viral targets, this nanofluidic RT-qPCR assay should {{have a major impact on}} human pathogenic virus surveillance and outbreak investigations and is likely to be of benefit to public health...|$|R
30|$|Confirmatory {{analysis}} of novel miRNA {{was performed by}} <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> those which was possible to design primers (Additional file 3). We were able to obtain single amplicons by melting curve analysis for only 7 miRNA primers. All these 7 miRNAs (zma-miRX 03, zma-miRX 05, zma-miRX 06, zma-miRX 10, zma-miRX 11, zma-miRX 13 and zma-miRX 20) have provided positive amplifications via RT-qPCR (Table  5). Surprisingly, amplifications were also obtained in samples that showed no miRNA reads by miRNome sequencing. Spurious amplifications might {{be explained by the}} amplification of similar or identical miRNA mature sequences originated from different pri-miRNA loci. Poor sequencing of the sample and/or limitations of the bioinformatics analysis is also a possibility. In fact, in spite of the availability of a few amplification-based platforms for miRNA detection, the common technical challenges still exist, namely sensitivity, specificity especially for one base variation, selectivity between precursor and mature miRNAs [33].|$|R

40|$|Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a {{rhabdovirus}} {{found in}} fish from oceans {{of the northern}} hemisphere and freshwaters of Europe. It has caused extensive losses of cultured and wild fish and has become established in the North American Great Lakes. Large die-offs of wild fish in the Great Lakes due to VHSV have alarmed the public and provoked government attention on the introduction and spread of aquatic animal pathogens in freshwaters. We investigated the relations between VHSV dispersion and shipping and boating activity in the Great Lakes by sampling fish and water at sites that were commercial shipping harbors, recreational boating centers, and open shorelines. Fish and water samples were individually analyzed <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and cell culture assays. Of 1, 221 fish of 17 species, 55 were VHSV positive with highly varied qRT-PCR titers (1 to 5, 950, 000 N gene copies). The detections of VHSV in fish and water samples were closely associated and the virus was detected in 21 of 30 sites sampled. The occurrence of VHSV {{was not related to}} type of site or shipping related invasion hotspots. Our results indicate that VHSV is widely dispersed in the Great Lakes and is both an enzootic and epizootic pathogen. We demonstrate that pathogen distribution information could be developed quickly and is clearly needed for aquatic ecosystem conservation, management of affected populations, and informed regulation of the worldwide trade of aquatic organisms...|$|R
2500|$|... qPCR {{allows the}} {{quantification}} and detection {{of a specific}} DNA sequence in real time since it measures concentration while the synthesis process is taking place. There are two methods for simultaneous detection and quantification. The first method is fluorescent dyes that are retained nonspecifically in between the double strands. The second method are probes that code for specific sequences and are fluorescently labeled. Detection of DNA using these methods can only be seen after the hybridization of probes with its complementary DNA takes place. An interesting technique combination is real-time PCR and reverse transcription (RT-qPCR). This sophisticated technique allows for the quantification of a small quantity of RNA. Through this combined technique, mRNA is converted to cDNA, which is further quantified using qPCR.

Samples of cDNA were amplified with specific primers for O. niloticus MyoD, myogenin, myostatin (Nebo et al., 2013), IGF- 1, IGF- 1 receptor, and the ubiquitin regulating gene, MAFbx/atrogin- 1 designed from cDNA nucleotide sequences, available in GenBank ([URL] The gene expression analyses were performed with an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The reactions were run in duplicate using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Target gene expression was normalized to ubiquitin-like protein 3 (ubl 3) gene expression and melting dissociation curves were performed to confirm that only a single product was amplified. Control reactions lacking cDNA template were also included to check for reagent contamination. The normalization genes were previously tested and the gene with the least variation between samples was chosen.|$|R

40|$|An {{antigen capture}} {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid (anti-N system) was developed for the diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic septicemia. Four monoclonal antibodies directed against the viral nucleocapsid were produced; they all recognized the four viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) serotypes. Three of these monoclonal antibodies were used in a new antigen capture ELISA. The efficiency of the anti-N system in detecting purified and crude viruses {{as well as the}} virus in infected-organ extracts and infected blood was compared with that of a recently described antigen capture ELISA based on the detection of viral envelope glycoprotein Gp (anti-G system). For the detection of purified virus, the anti-N system was found to be as sensitive as the anti-G system (detection limit, 1 ng of total viral protein per ml), but the anti-N system was much more sensitive than the anti-G system for the detection of crude VHSV I (detection limits, 1 x 10 (4) PFU/ml versus 5 x 10 (5) PFU/ml). In organ extracts, VHSV I could be detected by both systems 3 days postinfection. The signal for the assay of VHSV I in blood 24 h postinfection was higher with the anti-N system than the anti-G system. Furthermore, VHSV I could be detected in 80 % of the brain samples of surviving trout by the anti-N system and also by the anti-G system, but with a lower signal. In conclusion, we have developed a highly sensitive immunoassay <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> I that is more rapid and easier to perform than the currently used plaque assay...|$|R
40|$|In 2003, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) {{emerged in}} the Laurentian Great Lakes causing serious losses {{in a number of}} ecologically and recreationally {{important}} fish species. Within six years, despite concerted managerial preventive measures, the virus spread into the five Great Lakes and to a number of inland waterbodies. In response to this emerging threat, cooperative efforts between the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MI DNR), the Michigan State University Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory (MSU-AAHL), and the United States Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (USDA-APHIS) were focused on performing a series of general and VHSV-targeted surveillances {{to determine the extent of}} virus trafficking in the State of Michigan. Herein we describe six years (2005 – 2010) of testing, covering hundreds of sites throughout Michigan’s Upper and Lower Peninsulas. A total of 96, 228 fish representing 73 species were checked for lesions suggestive of VHSV and their internal organs tested for the presence of VHSV using susceptible cell lines. Of the 1, 823 cases tested, 30 cases from 19 fish species tested positive <b>for</b> <b>VHSV</b> by tissue culture and were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gene sequence analyses of all VHSV isolates retrieved in Michigan demonstrated that they belong to the emerging sublineage “b” of the North American VHSV genotype IV. These findings underscore the complexity of VHSV ecology in the Great Lakes basin and the critical need for rigorous legislation and regulatory guidelines in order to reduce the virus spread within and outside of the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, real-time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) {{analysis}} {{has become the}} method of choice not only for quantitative and accurate measurement of mRNA expression levels, but also for sensitive detection of rare or mutated DNA species in diagnostic research. RT-qPCR {{is based on the}} standard principles of PCR amplification in addition to the use of specific probes or intercalating fluorescence dyes. At the end of every cycle, the intercalating dye binds to all double-stranded DNA. There is a quantitative relationship between the amount of starting DNA and the amount of amplification product during the exponential phase. However, to obtain meaningful RT-qPCR data, the quality of the starting material (RNA, DNA) and the analysis method of choice are of crucial importance. In this chapter, we focus on the details of RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis methods, on the application of <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> measurements of cytokine mRNA levels using Sybr-Green I as detection chemistry, and finally, we discuss the pros and contras of the absolute quantification versus relative quantification analysis.

40|$|International audienceThe {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} lyssavirus infection (including rabies) in {{animals and humans}} is based on laboratory confirmation. The reference techniques for post-mortem rabies diagnosis are still based on direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation, but molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods, are increasingly being used and now constitute the principal tools for diagnosing rabies in humans and for epidemiological analyses. However, it remains a key challenge to obtain relevant specificity and sensitivity with these techniques while ensuring that the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses does not compromise detection. We developed a dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (combo <b>RT-qPCR)</b> method <b>for</b> pan-lyssavirus detection. This method is based on two complementary technologies: a probe-based (TaqMan) <b>RT-qPCR</b> <b>for</b> detecting the RABV species (pan-RABV RT-qPCR) and a second reaction using an intercalating dye (SYBR Green) to detect other lyssavirus species (pan-lyssa RT-qPCR). The performance parameters of this combined assay were evaluated with a large panel of primary animal samples covering almost all the genetic variability encountered at the viral species level, and they extended to almost all lyssavirus species characterized to date. This method was also evaluated for the diagnosis of human rabies on 211 biological samples (positive n = 76 and negative n = 135) including saliva, skin and brain biopsies. It detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested and confirmed the sensitivity and the interest of skin biopsy (91. 5 %) and saliva (54 %) samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. Finally, this method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). This combined RT-qPCR method constitutes a relevant, useful, validated tool for the diagnosis of rabies in both humans and animals, and represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance...|$|R
