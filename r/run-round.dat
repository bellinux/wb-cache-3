25|$|The {{railway station}} has 4 {{platforms}} {{and a short}} bay that was previously used for the Red Star parcels facility. Platform 1 has a <b>run-round</b> facility for locomotive hauled trains (mainly freight services). The track layout and associated signalling was remodelled {{during the course of}} a week-long engineering blockade from 25 October to 3 November 2008 to permit higher speeds on both routes into the station and also allow trains to approach the station from both Leeds and Halifax simultaneously (something that was not possible with the old track configuration).|$|E
500|$|Facilities were limited, with a {{borehole}} [...] deep supplying a {{water column}} at Sandtoft, and a <b>run-round</b> loop with a lever frame at Hatfield Moor, where the staff {{consisted of a}} single porter. Traffic was agricultural, but the Railway Company hoped to obtain the peat traffic. They held discussions in September 1909, but the BMLC continued to transport their peat overland to Maud's Bridge goods yard, on the Doncaster to Scunthorpe line. The Axholme Joint Railway then built a loading dock for the peat, which was completed in December 1911, but still {{did not succeed in}} getting the peat traffic. An agreement was eventually made in April 1913, which required the Railway Company to extend their line into the peat works. When completed, all peat left the works on the Axholme Joint Railway. It continued to serve the works until 30 September 1963, and was formally closed on 29 February 1964.|$|E

5000|$|Battersby used to {{have three}} {{platforms}} - two lengthy up and down line platforms connected by a central footbridge, along with a shorter bay platform with a <b>run-round</b> loop. Water towers were located {{at both ends of}} the station. Only the one at the current [...] "junction end" [...] remains today. The signal box also located here has also long since vanished, although traces of the third platform are still visible and a <b>run-round</b> loop is still available for loco-hauled trains.|$|E

50|$|Passenger trains {{initially}} ran eastwards from Leyburn to Leeming Bar, {{but these}} were extended on to Redmire in August 2004. The company plans to relay/re-instate a <b>run-round</b> loop trackbed (for heritage locos to <b>run-round),</b> but hopes to one day eventually rebuild and reopen the abandoned line westwards to Hawes and eventually to Garsdale and run trains along {{the full length of}} the entire Yorkshire dale from Northallerton to Garsdale — a trip of almost 40 miles (64 km) in length (which would nearly make the railway itself the longest heritage line in the UK).|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} gauge side comprises a single platform (Platform 1) opening directly {{on to the}} station car park and the High Street. There is a {{standard gauge}} <b>run-round</b> loop used by occasional locomotive hauled charter trains. The narrow gauge side comprises an island platform (Platforms 2 and 3) with an overall roof reached via a footbridge and also from the standard gauge platform and the town centre by a pedestrian level crossing at the terminal end. Narrow gauge trains normally use Platform 3. There is also a narrow gauge <b>run-round</b> loop.|$|E

50|$|A {{small number}} of railtour {{companies}} have waivers to operate Mark 1 carriage stock on railtour duties. The conditions usually involve the fitting of central door locking and having either a non-passenger or non-Mark 1 carriage {{at the ends of}} the train. This is often achieved by running with a locomotive {{at each end of the}} train, instead of just at the front, which also reduces the need to <b>run-round</b> at minor terminus stations, many of which lost their <b>run-round</b> facilities when locomotive hauled trains of Mk1 or Mk2 coaches gave way to multiple unit operation on service trains.|$|E
50|$|A {{crossover}} {{was added}} near the terminus at Morpeth, giving {{a very short}} <b>run-round</b> for the rapid reversal of the dummy, and the crossover still remains, looking rather absurd to the casual observer.|$|E
5000|$|By November 2012, the Walsall end of {{the line}} has been {{completely}} cleared of vegetation - subsequently the line was relayed as far as the former Bescot Curve Junction to provide a <b>run-round</b> facility.|$|E
50|$|Although {{a common}} {{procedure}} for passenger trains when {{the majority of}} them were locomotive-hauled, the manoeuvre is now becoming rarer on public service railways. Increased use of multiple unit and push-pull passenger services avoids the requirement for dedicated track and the need for railway staff to detach and reattach the locomotive at track level. However, on heritage railways <b>run-round</b> loops are still usually more or less necessary {{at each end of the}} running line, partly because train services are usually locomotive-hauled, and partly because the <b>run-round</b> operation gives added interest to visitors. This practice is still very common on Intercity services in Victoria, Australia.|$|E
50|$|Early {{photographs}} variously {{name the}} southern terminus Marine Drive and Lakeside, {{but it has}} been referred to as the Pleasureland terminus for many years. In 2017 there were two workshops and an engine shed here, with a single island platform serving two running lines with <b>run-round</b> loops which converge to form the running line alongside the lake. There is also a third siding for stock storage. At the Marine Parade end of the line there are two platforms, though one has been taken out of use and its track lifted. Locomotives change ends using a <b>run-round</b> loop. The station building at Marine Parade has been completely rebuilt.|$|E
50|$|During 2013, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of three restored L&B heritage carriages, each 35 feet long, and with a fourth being restored for delivery during 2014, the platform and <b>run-round</b> loop were extended to cater for larger trains.|$|E
50|$|Appledore {{had its own}} Station Master, Mr. H R Moody; a <b>run-round</b> loop, one {{platform}}, platform lighting, {{a ticket}} office, signal box hut and a small engine shed, a water tower, footbridge and a fuel store siding.|$|E
5000|$|Ashburton; the {{terminus}} had an all-over train shed, {{covering the}} passenger platform and the <b>run-round</b> road, {{which in the}} twentieth century had a platform face for goods and cattle. Ashburton had an engine shed and a turntable until 1900.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a <b>run-round</b> facility, on the rare {{occasion}} that a locomotive-hauled train arrives (such as on a railtour), a second locomotive must follow the train light engine from Dublin to haul the train back from Howth.|$|E
50|$|Roadstone from Ingleton Quarry {{has also}} {{occasionally}} been railed {{out of the}} sidings. All services leaving must head north over Ribblehead Viaduct {{due to the lack}} of <b>Run-round</b> facilities at the station. Southbound trains can then reverse at Blea Moor Loop.|$|E
50|$|It {{was opened}} {{partly on the}} 14 and fully on 16 May 1932. It had an island {{platform}} with a <b>run-round</b> loop. Originally the branch from Stoke Junction was single track, but it was doubled in 1935, and singled again in 1957.|$|E
50|$|A <b>run-round</b> loop (or {{run-around}} loop) is a track {{arrangement that}} enables a locomotive to {{attach to the}} opposite end of the train. It is commonly used to haul wagons onto a siding, or at a terminal station to prepare for a return journey.|$|E
