40|$|Performance of AlGaN/GaN {{heterostructure}} field-effect transistors (HFETs) with recessed {{gate was}} investigated and compared with non-recessed counterparts. Optimal dry etch conditions by plasma assisted Ar sputtering {{were found for}} ~ 6 nm gate recess of a 20 nm thick AlGaN barrier layer. A decrease of the residual strain after the gate <b>recessing</b> (<b>from</b> - 0. 9 GPa to - 0. 68 GPa) was evaluated from the photoluminescence measurement. The saturation drain current at the gate voltage VG = 1 V decreased from 1. 05 A/mm to 0. 85 A/mm after the recessing. The gate voltage for a maximal transconductance (240 - 250 mS/mm) has shifted from - 3 V for non-recessed HFETs to - 0. 2 V for recessed counterparts. Similarly, the threshold voltage increased after the gate recessing. A decrease of the sheet charge density from 1 x 10 13 cm- 2 to 4 x 10 12 cm- 2 at VG = 0 V has been evaluated from the capacitance measurements. The RF measurements yielded a slight increase of the cut-off frequencies after the gate recessing. All these indicate that the gate recessing is a useful tool to optimize the AlGaN/GaN HFET performance for high-frequency applications {{as well as for}} the preparation of normally-off devices...|$|E
