50|$|The SAES group {{provides}} advanced {{technological solutions}} to the electronic devices {{of a wide range}} of markets, including the aeronautical, medical, industrial, security, defence and basic research sectors. The products developed in this division include getters of different types and formats, alkaline metal dispensers, cathodes and materials for thermal management. The offered products are employed in various devices such as X-ray tubes, microwave tubes, solid state lasers, electron sources, photomultipliers and <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>amplification</b> systems.|$|E

The sounds and images are converted into electrical signals by a microphone (sounds) or video camera (images), amplified, and used to modulate a carrier wave that has been generated by an oscillator circuit in a transmitter. The modulated carrier is also amplified, then applied to an antenna that converts the electrical signals to electromagnetic waves for radiation into space. Such waves radiate {{at the speed of light}} and are transmitted not only by line of sight but also by deflection from the ionosphere. Receiving antennas intercept part of this radiation, change it backto the form of electrical signals, and feed it to a receiver. The most efficient and most common circuit for <b>radiofrequency</b> selection and <b>amplification</b> used in radio receivers is the superheterodyne. In that system, incoming signals are mixed with a signal from a local oscillator to produce intermediate frequencies (IF) that are equal to the arithmetical sum and difference of the incoming and local frequencies. One of those frequencies is applied to an amplifier. Because the IF amplifier operates at a single frequency, namely the intermediate frequency, it can be built for optimum selectivity and gain. The tuning control on a radio receiver adjusts the local oscillator frequency. If the incoming signals are above the threshold of sensitivity of the receiver and if the receiver is tuned to the frequency of the signal, it will amplif...|$|R
