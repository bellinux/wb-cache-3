40|$|Campoletis sonorensis ichnovirus (CsIV) is a {{symbiotic}} virus {{associated with the}} endoparasitic wasp C. sonorensis. The virus is injected into the wasp’s host, Heliothis virescens, during oviposition. One CsIV gene {{has been identified as}} a repeat element (rep) gene and encodes a ubiquitous imperfectly conserved 540 bp sequence. We report the sequencing and mapping of a rep-containing segment, segment I, that hybridizes to a known <b>rep</b> <b>sequence</b> from segment O 1. Analysis of this 8 � 6 kbp segment identified three ORFs having high similarity to the 540 bp <b>rep</b> <b>sequence.</b> All three <b>rep</b> <b>sequence</b> ORFs were expressed in parasitized H. virescens as well as in C. sonorensis tissues. Two of these rep genes, I 0. 9 and I 1. 1, have single copies of the 540 bp repeat sequence, while the third rep gene, I 1. 2, has two imperfect copies, which are more similar to each other than to sequences on the segment I single-motif genes. Like the CsIV BHv 0. 9 rep gene, the segment I rep genes lack introns and a signal peptide, suggesting that they are not secreted. Based on their similarity in nucleotide sequence, predicted amino acid sequence and gene structure, the three segment I repeat-containing genes, I 0. 9, I 1. 1 and I 1. 2, are new members of the rep gene family...|$|E

Samples taken from internal organs and the polypoid proliferative tissue from the mouth were examined by PCR {{for the detection of}} several viruses. Positive results were obtained with a nested PCR targeting the rep gene of circoviruses. Analysis of the partial <b>rep</b> <b>sequence</b> indicated the presence of a putative novel circovirus, but attempts to isolate it remained unsuccessful. The missing part of the genome was acquired by an inverse nested PCR with 2 specific primer pairs, designed from the newly determined <b>rep</b> <b>sequence,</b> followed by genome walking. The circular full genome was found to consist of 1378 nt (GenBank accession no. KC 469701). Two oppositely oriented open reading frames (ORFs) were present, of which one was unambiguously identified as a circoviral rep gene. However, the predicted product of the other ORF, though it is a clear positional counterpart of the cap genes, showed no obvious homology to any known circoviral capsid proteins. A stem-loop-like element in the intergenic region between the 5 ’ ends of the ORFs was also found. Phylogenetic calculations indicated that the novel virus belongs to the genus Circovirus in the family Circoviridae. The relative amount of the viral DNA in the organ samples was estimated by quantitative real-time PCR. The results suggested that the examined fish was caught in an active viremic state, although the role of this circovirus in the etiology of the cauliflower diseases could not be ascertained...|$|E

40|$|A {{family of}} {{repetitive}} extragenic palindromic (<b>REP)</b> <b>sequences</b> {{is composed of}} hundreds of copies distributed throughout the chromosome. Their palindromic nature and conservation suggested that they are specifically recognized by a protein(s). We have identified DNA gyrase [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing), EC 5. 99. 1. 3] {{as one of the}} REP-binding proteins. Gyrase has at least a 10 -fold higher affinity for DNA containing <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> than for DNA not containing <b>REP</b> <b>sequences.</b> Binding effectiveness correlates directly with the number of <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> in the DNA. DNase I footprinting shows that gyrase protects 205 base pairs on a REP-containing DNA fragment enclosing the <b>REP</b> <b>sequences.</b> In agreement with the above results, a comparison of the <b>REP</b> consensus <b>sequence</b> with the sequence of previously identified pBR 322 "strong" gyrase cleavage sites reveals a high degree of homology. Because <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> are numerous and found throughout the genome, we suggest they have physiological functions mediated through their interaction with gyrase, such as being sites of action for the maintenance of DNA supercoiling.

40|$|The pst operon of Escherichia coli is {{composed}} of five genes that encode a high-affinity phosphate transport system. As {{a member of the}} PHO regulon, pst transcription is activated under phosphate shortage conditions. Under phosphate-replete conditions, the pst operon also functions as a negative regulator of the PHO genes. Transcription of pst is initiated at the promoter located upstream to the first gene, pstS. Immediately after its synthesis, the primary transcript of pst is cleaved into shorter mRNA molecules. The transcription unit corresponding to pstS is significantly more abundant than the transcripts of the other pst genes due to stabilisation of pstS mRNA by a repetitive extragenic palindrome (REP) structure downstream to the pstS locus. The presence of the <b>REP</b> <b>sequence</b> also results in an increased level of PstS proteins. However, the surplus level of PstS proteins produced in the presence of REP does not contribute to the repressive role of Pst in PHO expression.

Primers {{based on the}} <b>REP</b> <b>sequence</b> generate complex band patterns with genomic DNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique named REP-PCR. We used REP-PCR with genomic DNA to fingerprint 47 isolates of Citrobacter diversus. Previously, 37 were assigned electrophoretic types (ETs) by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and 35 were evaluated by using outer membrane protein profiles. Fingerprints were compared by visual inspection and by similarity coefficients (SimCs) {{based on the number}} of common bands versus total bands between two given isolates. DNA fingerprints were highly similar visually for patient pairs and outbreak-related sets. SimCs for these were > or = 0. 952. Fingerprints of isolates with different ETs generally were distinctive. Among 21 unrelated isolates representing 15 ETs, only 6 of 210 comparisons had SimCs of > or = 0. 952. REP-PCR rapidly generated DNA fingerprints which were highly similar for epidemiologically linked isolates of C. diversus and distinct for previously characterized strains within this species. The ability of this method to discriminate between C. diversus isolates with the same biotype was similar to that of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and outer membrane protein profiles.

40|$|Abstract Background Mobile {{elements}} {{are involved in}} genomic rearrangements and virulence acquisition, and hence, are important elements in bacterial genome evolution. The insertion of some specific Insertion Sequences had been associated with repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) elements. Considering {{that there are a}} sufficient number of available genomes with described REPs, and exploiting the advantage of the traceability of transposition events in genomes, we decided to exhaustively analyze the relationship between <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> and mobile elements. Results This global multigenome study highlights the importance of repetitive extragenic palindromic elements as target sequences for transposases. The study is based on the analysis of the DNA regions surrounding the 981 instances of Insertion Sequence elements with respect to the positioning of <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> in the 19 available annotated microbial genomes corresponding to species of bacteria with reported <b>REP</b> <b>sequences.</b> This analysis has allowed the detection of the specific insertion into <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> for ISPsy 8 in Pseudomonas syringae DC 3000, ISPa 11 in P. aeruginosa PA 01, ISPpu 9 and ISPpu 10 in P. putida KT 2440, and ISRm 22 and ISRm 19 in Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 genome. Preference for insertion in extragenic spaces with <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> has also been detected for ISPsy 7 in P. syringae DC 3000, ISRm 5 in S. meliloti and ISNm 1106 in Neisseria meningitidis MC 58 and Z 2491 genomes. Probably, the association with REP elements that we have detected analyzing genomes is only the tip of the iceberg, and this association could be even more frequent in natural isolates. Conclusion Our findings characterize REP elements as hot spots for transposition and reinforce the relationship between <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> and genomic plasticity mediated by mobile elements. In addition, this study defines a subset of REP-recognizer transposases with high target selectivity that can be useful in the development of new tools for genome manipulation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Repetitive extragenic {{palindromic}} (<b>REP)</b> <b>sequences</b> are a ubiquitous {{feature of}} bacterial genomes.

In addition to REPINs, other more complex arrangements of REPs have been identified in bacterial genomes, including the genome of the model organism Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25. Here, we summarize existing knowledge and present new data concerning REPIN diversity.

40|$|Members of the Geminiviridae have {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes that replicate in nuclei {{of infected}} plant cells. All geminiviruses encode a conserved protein (Rep) that catalyzes initiation of rolling-circle replication. Earlier {{studies showed that}} three conserved motifs—motifs I, II, and III—in the N termini of geminivirus Rep proteins are essential for function. In this study, we identified a fourth sequence, designated GRS (geminivirus <b>Rep</b> <b>sequence),</b> in the Rep N terminus that displays high amino acid sequence conservation across all geminivirus genera. Using the Rep protein of Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV AL 1), we show that GRS mutants are not infectious in plants and do not support viral genome replication in tobacco protoplasts. GRS mutants are competent for protein-protein interactions and for both double- and single-stranded DNA binding, indicating that the mutations did not impair its global conformation. In contrast, GRS mutants are unable to specifically cleave single-stranded DNA, which is required to initiate rolling-circle replication. Interestingly, the Rep proteins of phytoplasmal and algal plasmids also contain GRS-related sequences. Modeling of the TGMV AL 1 N terminus suggested that GRS mutations alter the relative positioning of motif II, which coordinates metal ions, and motif III, which contains the tyrosine involved in DNA cleavage. Together, these results established that the GRS is a conserved, essential motif characteristic of an ancient lineage of rolling-circle initiators and {{support the idea that}} geminiviruses may have evolved from plasmids associated with phytoplasma or algae...|$|E

To gain insight into TA system evolution, we analyzed the distribution of the chromosomally encoded ccdO 157 system in 395 natural isolates of Escherichia coli. It was discovered in the E. coli O 157 :H 7 strain in which it constitutes a genomic islet between two core genes (folA and apaH). Our study revealed that the folA-apaH intergenic region is plastic and subject to insertion of foreign DNA. It could be composed (i) of a repetitive extragenic palindromic (<b>REP)</b> <b>sequence,</b> (ii) of the ccdO 157 system or subtle variants of it, (iii) of a large DNA piece that contained a ccdAO 157 antitoxin remnant in association with ORFs of unknown function, or (iv) of a variant of it containing an insertion sequence in the ccdAO 157 remnant. Sequence analysis and functional tests of the ccdO 157 variants revealed that 69 % of the variants were composed of an active toxin and antitoxin, 29 % were composed of an active antitoxin and an inactive toxin, and in 2 % of the cases both ORFs were inactive. Molecular evolution analysis showed that ccdBO 157 is under neutral evolution, suggesting that this system is devoid of any biological role in the E. coli species.

40|$|Two strand-specific {{origins of}} {{replication}} {{appear to be}} required for mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. Structural equivalents of these origins {{are found in the}} <b>rep</b> <b>sequences</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtDNA. These striking similarities have contributed to a universal model for the initiation of mtDNA replication in which a primer is created by cleavage of an origin region transcript. Consistent with this model are the properties of deletion mutants of yeast mtDNA ([rho-]) with a high density of reps (HS [rho-]). These mutant mtDNAs are preferentially inherited by the progeny resulting from the mating of HS [rho-] cells with cells containing wild-type mtDNA ([rho+]). This bias is presumed to result from a replication advantage conferred on HS [rho-] mtDNA by the high density of <b>rep</b> <b>sequences</b> acting as origins. To test whether transcription is indeed required for the preferential inheritance of HS [rho-] mtDNA, we deleted the nuclear gene (RPO 41) for the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, reducing transcripts by at least 1000 -fold. Since [rho-] genomes, but not [rho+] genomes, are stable when RPO 41 is deleted, we examined matings between HS [rho-] and neutral [rho-] cells. Neutral [rho-] mtDNAs lack <b>rep</b> <b>sequences</b> and are not preferentially inherited in [rho-] x [rho+] crosses. In HS [rho-] x neutral [rho-] matings, the HS [rho-] mtDNA was preferentially inherited whether both parents were wild type or both were deleted for RPO 41. Thus, transcription from the rep promoter {{does not appear to be}} necessary for biased inheritance. Our results, and analysis of the literature, suggest that priming by transcription is not a universal mechanism for mtDNA replication initiation...|$|R

We refer to these newly defined entities as REPINs (REP doublets forming hairpins) and identify short reads from population sequencing that reveal putative transposition intermediates. The proximal relationship between GI, GII, and GIII REPINs and specific REP-associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs), combined with features of the putative transposition intermediate, suggests a mechanism for within-genome dissemination.

This insertion sequence (named IS 621) has one large open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 326 amino acids in length. A computer-aided homology search using the DNA sequence as the query revealed that IS 621 was homologous to the piv genes, encoding pilin gene invertase (PIV). A homology search using the amino acid sequence of the putative protein encoded by IS 621 as the query revealed that the protein also has partial homology to transposases encoded by the IS 110 /IS 492 family elements, which were known to have partial homology to PIV. This indicates that IS 621 belongs to the IS 110 /IS 492 family but is most closely related to the piv genes. In fact, a phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of amino acid sequences of PIV proteins and transposases revealed that IS 621 belongs to the piv gene group, which is distinct from the IS 110 /IS 492 family elements, which form several groups. PIV proteins and transposases encoded by the IS 110 /IS 492 family elements, including IS 621, have four acidic amino acid residues, which are conserved at positions in their N-terminal regions. These residues may constitute a tetrad D-E(or D) -D-D motif as the catalytic center. Interestingly, IS 621 was inserted at specific sites within repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences at 10 loci in the ECOR 28 genome. IS 621 may not recognize the entire <b>REP</b> <b>sequence</b> in transposition, but it recognizes a 15 -bp sequence conserved in the REP sequences around the target site. There are several elements belonging to the IS 110 /IS 492 family that also transpose to specific sites in the repeated sequences, as does IS 621. IS 621 does not have terminal inverted repeats like most of the IS 110 /IS 492 family elements. The terminal sequences of IS 621 have homology with the 26 -bp inverted repeat sequences of pilin gene inversion sites that are recognized and used for inversion of pilin genes by PIV. This suggests that IS 621 initiates transposition through recognition of their terminal regions and cleavage at the ends by a mechanism similar to that used for PIV to promote inversion at the pilin gene inversion sites...|$|E

Plasmid F 128 (proAB lac) is a type II F plasmid (37) formed by recombination between chromosomal sequences that flank the F plasmid insertion site. F 128 was excised from Escherichia coli Hfr P 804 and was shown genetically to include the entire lac operon and the nearby proA and proB genes but not proC (24). The F 128 plasmid was widely used to study the lac operon (8, 30, 45, 49), mutation and mutagen specificity (9, 29), dele-tion and inversion formation (1, 38, 42), gene amplification (43, 48), and mechanisms of F-plasmid integration (10, 20).

The first entirely characterized EuMV isolate is native from Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico; subsequently, EuMV was detected in weeds and pepper plants from another region of Mexico, and partial DNA-A sequences revealed significant differences in their putative replication specificity determinants with respect to EuMV-YP. This study was aimed to investigate the replication compatibility between two EuMV isolates from the same country. Results A new isolate of EuMV was obtained from pepper plants collected at Jalisco, Mexico. Full-length clones of both genomic components of EuMV-Jal were biolistically inoculated into plants of three different species, which developed symptoms indistinguishable from those induced by EuMV-YP. Pseudorecombination experiments with EuMV-Jal and EuMV-YP genomic components demonstrated that these viruses do not form infectious reassortants in Nicotiana benthamiana, presumably because of Rep-iteron incompatibility. Sequence analysis of the EuMV-Jal DNA-B intergenic region (IR) led to the unexpected discovery of a 35 -nt-long sequence that is identical to a segment of the rep gene in the cognate viral DNA-A. Similar short <b>rep</b> <b>sequences</b> ranging from 35 - to 51 -nt in length were identified in all EuMV isolates and in three distinct viruses from South America related to EuMV. These short <b>rep</b> <b>sequences</b> in the DNA-B IR are positioned downstream to a ~ 160 -nt non-coding domain highly similar to the CP promoter of begomoviruses belonging to the SLCV clade. Conclusions EuMV strains are not compatible in replication, indicating that this begomovirus species probably is not a replicating lineage in nature. The genomic analysis of EuMV-Jal led to the discovery of a subgroup of SLCV clade viruses that contain in the non-coding region of their DNA-B component, short <b>rep</b> gene <b>sequences</b> located downstream to a CP -promoter-like domain. This assemblage of DNA-A-related sequences within the DNA-B IR is reminiscent of polyomavirus microRNAs and could be involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of the cognate viral rep gene, an intriguing possibility that should be experimentally explored</p...|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{ecological}} importance of Trichoderma spp. and their application as a biocontrol {{agent in the}} field, {{it is important to}} understand their biodiversity. However, accurate species identification based on morphology is difficult due to the paucity and similarity of morphological characters and increasing numbers of morphologically cryptic species (Kullnig et al. 2001). This has already resulted in incorrect identification. In recent years, the usefulness of molecular markers such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and repetitive-element polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR) in resolving species differences among microbial species are also well documented (Sharma et al. 2009; Solanki et al. 2013; Srivastava et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2014; Kashyap et al. 2015). RAPD utilized PCR to amplify DNA segments with single primer of arbitrary nucleotide sequence generating fragments by hybridizing with compatible regions of DNA and amplifying the regions where the primers are in correct orientation and appropriately spaced (100 – 2500  bp). However, REP-PCR uses oligonucelotide primers complementary to repetitive sequences dispersed throughout the genome. Using PCR, this method amplifies diverse regions of DNA flanked by the conserved repetitive sequences, leading to amplicon patterns specific for an individual bacterial and fungal strain. Three different families of repetitive sequences include: the 35 – 40  bp repetitive extragenic pallindromic (<b>REP)</b> <b>sequence,</b> the 124 – 127  bp enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence and 154  bp BOX (composed of the box A, B and C subunits) element. These sequences appear to be located in distinct, intergenic positions around the genome elements (Mohapatra et al. 2007). Methods based on such repetitive elements have also been used for studying the diversity in the ecosystem, presenting the phylogenetic relationship between strains and discriminating between microorganisms those are genetically close to each other (Rai et al. 2015; Kashyap et al. 2016). Unfortunately, these methods have not been extensively used for the differentiation of Trichoderma spp. Since, species of Trichoderma are reported as the causal agent of green mould disease (Ospina-Giraldo et al. 1998), the understanding of the nature and diversity of Trichoderma is critical for its widespread use against phytopathogenic fungi as there could be the risk of unwanted disease on non-target hosts. Under such situations, it is valuable to establish patterns of gene flow, as well as to develop a fingerprint of Trichoderma isolates. Diversity studies have recently been undertaken to assess its ecological specialization. Several studies reported about a series of new isolates as well as new phylogenetic species of Trichoderma in a series of natural ecosystems (Zachow et al. 2009; Körmöczi et al. 2013). On the other hand, only a few studies were focusing on agricultural environments. However, the results of these studies demonstrated that besides the natural ecosystems, the investigation of agricultural soils also reveals important information about Trichoderma biodiversity. The practical impact of such studies is that the rhizosphere of agricultural soils may be an ideal source of beneficial strains with biocontrol potential. Based on these studies, we speculate that the species composition, distribution, and genetic structure of Trichoderma on the tomato rhizosphere may be different. The confirmation of the differences will help in revealing the biodiversity, origin, and evolutionary processes of Trichoderma under different biological niches.|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} a new gene, glpX, belonging to the glp regulon of Escherichia coli, located directly downstream of the glpK gene. The transcription of glpX is inducible with glycerol and sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate and is constitutive in a glpR mutant. glpX is the third gene in the glpFKX operon. The function of GlpX remains unknown. GlpX has an apparent molecular weight of 40, 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. In addition to determining the E. coli glpX sequence, we also sequenced the corresponding glpFKX region originating from Shigella flexneri, which after transfer into E. coli was instrumental in elucidating the function of glpF in glycerol transport (D. P. Richey and E. C. C. Lin, J. Bacteriol. 112 : 784 - 790, 1972). Sequencing of the glpFKX region of this hybrid strain revealed an amber mutation instead of the tryptophan 215 codon in glpF. The most striking difference between the E. coli and S. flexneri DNA was found directly behind glpK, where two repetitive (<b>REP)</b> <b>sequences</b> were present in S. flexneri, {{but not in the}} E. coli sequence. The presence or absence of these <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> had no effect on transport or on growth on glycerol. Not including the REP sequence-containing region, only 1. 1 % of a total of 2, 167 bp sequenced was different in the two sequences. Comparison of the sequence with those in the EMBL data library revealed a 99 % identity between the last third of glpX and the first part of a gene called mvrA. We show that the cloned mvrA gene (M. Morimyo, J. Bacteriol. 170 : 2136 - 2142, 1988) originated from the 88 -min region of the Escherichia coli chromosome and not, as reported, from the 7 -min region and that the gene product identified as MvrA is in fact encoded by a gene distal to glpX...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial DNA exerts immunostimulatory {{effects on}} {{mammalian}} cells via the intracellular TLR 9. Although broad analysis of TLR 9 -mediated immunostimulatory potential of synthetic oligonucleotides has been developed, which kinds of natural bacterial DNA sequences {{are responsible for}} immunostimulation are not known. This work provides evidence that the natural DNA sequences named repetitive extragenic palindromic (<b>REPs)</b> <b>sequences</b> present in Gram-negative bacteria are able to produce innate immune system stimulation via TLR 9. A strong induction of IFN-α production by REPs from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis was detected in splenocytes from 129 mice.

40|$|Aim: The main aim of {{the present}} study was to use three PCR-based {{techniques}} for the analysis of genetic variability among Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains isolated from the Philippines. Methods and Results: Seventeen strains of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from shrimps (Penaeus monodon) and from the environments where these shrimps are being cultivated were analysed by random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD-PCR), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR). The results of this work have demonstrated genetic variability within the V. parahaemolyticus strains that were isolated from the Philippines. In addition, RAPD, ERIC and REP-PCR are suitable rapid typing methods for V. parahaemolyticus. All three methods have good discriminative ability and can be used as a rapid means of comparing V. parahaemolyticus strains for epidemiological investigation. Based on the results of this study, we could say that REP-PCR is inferior to RAPD and ERIC-PCR owing to the fact that it is less reproducible. Moreover, the REP-PCR analysis yielded a relatively small number of products. This may suggests that the <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> may not be widely distributed in the V. parahaemolyticus genome. Conclusions: Genetic variability within V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated in the Philippines has been demonstrated. The presence of ERIC and <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> in the genome of this bacterial species was confirmed. Significance and Impact of the Study:The RAPD, ERIC and REP-PCR techniques are useful methods for molecular typing of V. parahaemolyticus strains. To our knowledge this is the first study of this kind carried out on V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from the Philippines.

40|$|AbstractThe Rep 68 and Rep 78 {{proteins}} of {{adeno-associated virus}} type- 2 (AAV) are multifunctional DNA binding proteins which {{are involved in}} the positive and negative regulation of AAV genes, as well as various cellular and heterologous viral genes. In this study we report that Rep 68 enhances expression from the major immediate early promoter (MIEP) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). This Rep-mediated enhancement of RNA levels is abrogated by the introduction of a <b>Rep</b> recognition <b>sequence</b> (RRS) at either position − 18 or − 244 in the HCMV–MIEP. However, a mutant RRS (mRRS), which is not bound by Rep 68 is unable to negate the effect of <b>Rep</b> 68. <b>Sequence</b> analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed no Rep 68 binding sites within the wild-type HCMV–MIEP. Rep 68 may therefore be enhancing expression from the HCMV–MIEP by interacting with other regulatory proteins that {{have an effect on the}} expression from this promoter or by altering the expression of a cellular gene whose product influences the HCMV–MIEP. Our results may also help to explain the previous observation that coinfection with AAV enhances the cytopathic effect of HCMV...|$|R
40|$|Hypersuppressiveness is a {{heritable}} {{property of}} some rho- mutants (called HS) that, in crosses to rho+, {{give rise to}} about 100 % rho- cells. The mtDNAs of all HS rho- mutants reveal a common organization: they all share a homologous region of about 300 base pairs (called rep) and the fragments retained are always short (ca. 1 % of the wild-type genome) and tandemly repeated. Using one HS rho- mutant as an example, we show that, after crosses with rho+ strains, the mitochondrial genome of the progeny is indistinguishable {{from that of the}} HS parent. This suggests that HS mtDNA molecules have a decisive selective advantage for replication during the transient heteroplasmic stage that follows zygote formation, the rep regions playing a role in the control of replication initiation of the mtDNA molecules. The complete nucleotide sequence of one HS rho- mutant and its localization in the oli 1 -rib 3 segment of the rho+ mitochondrial genome are presented. Comparison of the nucleotide <b>sequences</b> of the <b>rep</b> regions of two different HS rho- mutants reveals that several <b>rep</b> <b>sequences</b> must exist in the wild-type genome, probably as a result of duplications of an originally unique ancestor...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli, the {{phosphorylation}} and dephosphorylation of {{isocitrate dehydrogenase}} (IDH) are catalyzed by a bifunctional protein kinase/phosphatase. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of aceK, the gene encoding IDH kinase/phosphatase. This gene {{consists of a}} single open reading frame of 1, 734 base pairs preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome-binding site. Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of IDH kinase/phosphatase revealed sequences which {{are similar to the}} consensus sequence for ATP-binding sites. This protein did not, however, exhibit the extensive sequence homologies which are typical of other protein kinases. Multiple copies of the REP family of repetitive extragenic elements were found within the intergenic region between aceA (encoding isocitrate lyase) and aceK. These elements have the potential for combining to form an exceptionally stable stem-loop structure (delta G = - 54 kcal/mol [ca. - 226 kJ/mol]) in the mRNA. This structure, which masks the ribosome-binding site and start codon for aceK, may contribute to the downshift in expression observed between aceA and aceK. Another potential stem-loop structure (delta G = - 29 kcal/mol [ca. 121 kJ/mol]), unrelated to the <b>REP</b> <b>sequences,</b> was found within aceK...|$|R
40|$|Polyadenylation {{is thought}} to be {{involved}} in the degradation and quality control of bacterial RNAs but relatively few examples have been investigated. We used a combination of 5 '-tagRACE and RNA-seq to analyze the total RNA content from a wild-type strain and from a poly(A) polymerase deleted Mutant. A total of 178 transcripts were either up- or down-regulated in the mutant when compared to the wild-type strain. Poly(A) polymerase up-regulates the expression of all genes related to the FliA regulon and several previously unknown transcripts, including numerous transporters. Notable down-regulation of genes in the expression of antigen 43 and components of the type 1 fimbriae was detected. The major consequence of the absence of poly(A) polymerase was the accumulation of numerous sRNAs, antisense transcripts, <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> and RNA fragments resulting from the processing of entire transcripts. A new algorithm to analyze the position and composition of post-transcriptional modifications based on the sequence of unencoded 3 '-ends, was developed to identify polyadenylated molecules.

40|$|The prokaryotic REP (repetitive extragenic palindromes) or PU (palindromic units) {{sequences}} {{are often}} associated with other repetitive elements, forming arrangements which have been called 'BIMEs' (bacterial interspersed mosaic elements). It is estimated that the Escherichia coli chromosome carries approximately 300 - 500 BIMEs, whose biological role is at present unknown. We have identified a family of BIMEs consisting of two converging <b>REP</b> <b>sequences</b> flanking a 35 bp conserved segment which carries a static DNA bend and a binding site for IHF, the integration host factor of E. coli. We estimate that the E. coli genome harbors approximately 100 copies of this module, which we name 'RIB' (reiterative ihf BIME). We have analyzed by gel retardation and by footprinting the in vitro interaction of IHF with individual RIBs, and shown that the protein binds strongly and specifically to their center. We have also demonstrated binding of IHF to the chromosomal population of RIBs, using a new approach which combines two-dimensional bandshift and Southern blotting. RIB elements are {{at the end of}} transcription units, and thus define a new class of ihf sites. Possible implications for genome structure and DNA topology are discussed...|$|R
