5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French <b>Revolution</b> and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} <b>Revolution</b> controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the <b>Revolution</b> in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French <b>revolution.</b> While they saw the <b>revolution</b> as analogous to Britain's own Glorious <b>Revolution</b> in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French <b>revolution</b> as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the French in the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Belgium came under Dutch rule. The Belgian <b>Revolution,</b> which broke out on 25 August 1830 after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, was inspired to some extent by the Brabant <b>Revolution.</b> The day after the <b>revolution</b> broke out, revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by the colours chosen by the Brabant <b>Revolution</b> of 1789. The colours (red, yellow and black) today form the national flag of Belgium. Some historians have also argued that the Vonckists and Statists were the forerunners of the major political factions, the Liberals and the Catholics, which would dominate Belgian politics after independence.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} course, the Brabant <b>Revolution</b> had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French <b>Revolution.</b> Some historians, following Henri Pirenne, {{have seen it}} as a key moment {{in the formation of}} a Belgian nation-state, and an influence on the Belgian <b>Revolution</b> of 1830.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} typologies of <b>revolutions</b> in social science and literature. For example, classical scholar Alexis de Tocqueville differentiated between political <b>revolutions,</b> sudden and violent <b>revolutions</b> that seek not only {{to establish a new}} political system but to transform an entire society, and slow but sweeping transformations of the entire society that take several generations to bring about (such as changes in religion). One of several different Marxist typologies divides <b>revolutions</b> into pre-capitalist, early bourgeois, bourgeois, bourgeois-democratic, early proletarian, and socialist <b>revolutions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the club's 4–0 home defeat, United {{returned}} to Open Cup play, where they took on New England <b>Revolution</b> in the MLS qualification semifinals. Hosted at Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds, the <b>Revolution</b> quickly {{got off to}} a 2–0 lead, thanks to a pair of goals from <b>Revolution</b> midfielder Kheli Dube. Dube scored in 37th and 47th minutes of play. Twenty minutes following Dube's second goal, Virginia-native Alan Koger gave the Revs a 3–0 lead. Shortly thereafter, United's Branko Bošković scored his first two goals of 2011 to trim the lead down to one goal. The late rally, however, proved to be too little, too late as the <b>Revolution</b> defeated United 3–2. Consequently, {{it was the first time}} since 2002 that United did not qualify into the main tournament propers of the Open Cup.|$|E

40|$|Master of ArtsCommunications StudiesCharles J. GriffinThe 2011 Arab Spring <b>Revolutions</b> {{across the}} Middle East North Africa (MENA) region drew {{international}} {{attention to the}} collection action phenomenon of <b>revolutions.</b> Despite having {{a significant impact on}} today’s globalized world, <b>revolutions</b> have been widely unexplored by social movement rhetorical scholars. This lack of study has prompted scholars to call for the investigation of the role human agency plays during <b>revolutions</b> (Morris, 2000). Rhetorical scholars are well-suited to meet this call but lack a methodological framework to examine <b>revolutions.</b> In responding to Morris’ call and with an interest in adding to the body of rhetorical social movement literature, this thesis asks two research questions. What are the rhetorical characteristics of <b>revolutions?</b> Are <b>revolutions</b> rhetorically distinct from social movements? To answer these questions, this thesis translates Jack Goldstone’s (1998) Divergent View of Social Movements and <b>Revolutions</b> into a rhetorical model for studying <b>revolutions.</b> This adaptation of the political science model relies heavily on Leland Griffin’s (1969) and Charles Stewart’s (1980) models of social movements. Additionally, the adapted model also incorporates James Wilkinson’s (1989) discussion of revolutionary rhetorical functions. The application of the new rhetorical model to the Egyptian Arab Spring reveals <b>revolutions</b> rhetorically develop and function in ways that creates a clear distinction between <b>revolutions</b> from social movements. These findings prompt discussion of methodological and critical implications...|$|R

This paper reviews three liberal <b>revolutions</b> [...] in religion, politics, and economics [...] to examine the dynamics of change and to derive three general principles: (1) <b>revolutions</b> breed counter-revolutions, (2) <b>revolutions</b> require the appropriate conditions to succeed, and (3) <b>revolutions</b> in different domains influence one another. The paper then examines the role of usability in two on-going liberal <b>revolutions</b> [...] in technology and information. The operation of each of the principles is examined in order to determine ways to apply usability research and engineering most effectively...|$|R

Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May <b>Revolution</b> intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the <b>revolution</b> under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical <b>revolution.</b>|$|E
