He exhausted himself trying to explain, to think of Indian words enough to show {{he was not the}} missionary. He even implored Girty to speak for him. When the renegade sat there stolidly silent Joe's rage burst out.|$|E
50|$|Hanshin {{threatened}} in the 2nd when Arias singled his way on, but a strike'-em-out, throw-'em-out double play and another strikeout of Yano ended the threat. Daiei had something {{of their own}} going in the 3rd, but the Hawks themselves had a <b>runner</b> <b>cut</b> down at 2nd. Daiei would threaten again in the 6th with a runner on 2nd, but Shimoyanagi struck out Johjima to end the inning.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970 Rebel 400 at Darlington, Petty {{was injured}} when his Plymouth Road <b>Runner</b> <b>cut</b> a tire and slammed hard {{into the wall}} {{separating}} the track from the pit area. The car flipped several times before coming to rest on its side. This accident injured Petty's shoulder, and helped Bobby Isaac to win the 1970 Grand National Championship. During the accident, Petty's head hit the track pavement several times, which led NASCAR to mandate {{the installation of the}} Petty-developed safety net that covers the driver's side window.|$|E

5000|$|In the Oaks at Epsom Racecourse on 5 June Carson {{opted to}} ride the Hern stable's other <b>runner</b> <b>Cut</b> Loose, leaving the ride on Swiftfoot to Greville Starkey. She was {{travelling}} well {{in the early stages}} but [...] "choked" [...] soon after entering the straight and was eased down by Starkey to finish last of the thirteen runners behind Time Charter. Hern was never able to explain the incident and said that nothing similar happened to the filly before or after. Twelve days after her run at Epsom the filly was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Oaks on good to firm ground at the Curragh and started the 4/1 second favourite behind the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Prince's Polly in a ten-runner field. The other fancied contenders were Santa Roseanna (winner of the Minstrel Stakes), Rosananti (Premio Regina Elena), Cooliney Princess and More Heather (C L Weld Park Stakes). With Carson in the saddle, Swiftfoot took the lead from the start and extended her advantage early in the straight. Prince's Polly emerged as her only challenger ibut never looked a serious threat, and Swiftfoot drew away in the closing stage to win by three lengths with a gap of three lengths back to Rosananti in third. The racecourse stewards inquired into the winner's improvement but accepted Hern's explanation. On 17 August Swiftfoot started 11/4 favourite in a seven-runner field for the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse. She took the lead from her stablemate Height of Fashion early in the straight and maintained a narrow lead entering the final furlong but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Awaasif with the Ribblesdale Stakes winner Dish Dash a head away in third.|$|E
2500|$|At noon {{the advance}} on the II Corps front had been {{stopped by the}} local German {{defenders}} and their artillery. The arrival of the British advance further north on the green line, [...] beyond the Steenbeek on the XIX Corps front at about [...] {{took a long time}} to be communicated to the British divisional headquarters because of mist, slow going by <b>runners,</b> <b>cut</b> signal cables and poor reconnaissance results from contact-patrol aircraft, caused by troops being unwilling to light flares while overlooked by German defences. Around [...] Gough ordered all XIX Corps troops to advance to the green line, in support of the three brigades which had reached it. Delays persisted and a German force approaching from behind the Broodseinde–Passchendaele ridge was not seen by British aircraft. A message from a ground observer did not reach 15th Division headquarters until [...] and rain began soon after, cutting off the view of advanced British troops by artillery observers.|$|R

25|$|Running {{alongside}} {{his enthusiasm for}} DVD, Scott {{is known for his}} use of the director's cut. The positive reaction to the Blade <b>Runner</b> Director's <b>Cut</b> encouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment {{at the time of their}} release (including Legend and Kingdom of Heaven), which have been met with acclaim. Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.|$|R

50|$|Bowerman {{was obsessed}} with shaving weight off his athletes' running shoes. He {{believed}} that custom-made shoes would weigh less on the feet of his <b>runners</b> and <b>cut</b> down on blisters, as well as reduce the overall drag on their energy for every ounce he could remove from the shoe. By his estimation, removing one ounce (28 g) from a shoe, based on a six-foot gait for a runner, would translate in a reduction of 55 pounds (25 kg) of lift over a one-mile (1.6 km) span.|$|R
5000|$|His {{time as a}} {{professional}} <b>runner</b> was <b>cut</b> short in 1993 by a two-year battle with Hodgkin’s disease.

In 2009 he was named director of track and field and cross country for the university.

50|$|In {{the late}} {{spring and early summer}} of 1981 many horses in the Dick Hern stable, {{including}} Cut Above, suffered from a viral infection and the trainer had very few <b>runners.</b> <b>Cut</b> Above returned from a two-month break and was given a most challenging task when he was matched against the Aga Khan's colt Shergar in the Irish Sweeps Derby at the Curragh on 27 June. Shergar had created an enormous impression when winning the Epsom Derby by a record ten lengths and started the 1/3 favourite, with Cut Above third in the betting on 14/1. Carson sent Cut Above into the lead from the start and maintained a narrow advantage until the turn into the straight when he was overtaken by Shergar. Although he never had any chance with the winner, who was given a very gentle ride by Lester Piggott, Cut Above stayed on well to finish second, four lengths behind the winner. At Newbury in August, Cut Above was moved up in distance and matched against older horses in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen furlongs. He appeared to be unsuited by the slow pace and finished third of the four runners behind Ardross and Castle Keep.|$|R
5000|$|After Bell and Lytle {{combined}} for 1,850 rushing yards in 1974, Schembechler said: [...] "Bell and Lytle {{are the greatest}} combination in the country. Bell is the best <b>cut</b> <b>runner</b> I've ever had. Lytle is a great power runner. The tailback position is healthy to say the least." ...|$|R
5000|$|However he {{was late}} {{removing}} the runner guards {{off of his}} sled by three minutes in the parc fermé (a holding area for the sleds prior to the race), and was disqualified from the race. Warmer sled <b>runners</b> can <b>cut</b> through the ice on the track faster, Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT) spokesman Don Krone explained, [...] "The reasons the runners need to be uncovered is so that they're {{all at the same}} ambient air temperature, It's a standard procedure at every single skeleton competition, so the procedures are well known. It's not something different for the Olympic Games." [...] Teammate Jon Montgomery {{went on to win the}} gold medal.|$|R
50|$|Statcast {{data can}} be used to prevent {{injuries}} by tracking physical performance metrics through the course of the season. Data can also be extended to team performance metrics. For example, analysts can chart a defensive team's ability to throw runners out at home from various points on the field, accounting for relay throw efficiency and speed. A third base coach armed with this information should have a heightened degree of situational awareness, which ultimately affects their decision to hold a runner at third or send them home. This should reduce the number of <b>runners</b> needlessly <b>cut</b> down at home, however, one must also take into account the fact that this information may lead to overly cautious decisions during situations when the reward outweighs the risks.|$|R
50|$|A stair rod, also {{commonly}} referred to as a carpet rod, is an ornamental decorative hardware item used to hold carpeting in place on steps. (Such long but narrow strips of carpeting are known as carpet runners or stair runners or stair carpet). Traditionally, stair rods were used to hold a carpet runner in place on stairs, but with superior carpet installation techniques and more rigid safety standards today, stair rods serve primarily a decorative purpose. Stair rods are however still an integral part of many installation techniques. They hide dimples in the carpet runner caused by installation staples or nail heads and they are also often required to conceal a pattern mismatch when the carpet <b>runner</b> is <b>cut</b> during installation at each step where the tread meets the riser.|$|R
50|$|Following the Games in 2002, the Hoey sisters teamed up; Aoife in {{the driving}} seat and Siobhain as brake athlete. Together the sisters contested European Cup and World Cup events, and the European and World Championships. The sisters placed 13th in the FIBT World Championships in Koenigssee, Germany and placed among the medals in European start championships. Their bid for {{qualification}} for the 2006 games {{got off to}} a disastrous start when Siobhán was badly injured in a freak accident in the ice house at Calgary, Canada. Mid-training, her heel was hit by the sled <b>runner</b> and <b>cut</b> right through to the Achilles tendon. She had to compete in both the Calgary and Lake Placid events with her foot stitched. The remaining events of the World Cup circuit went well, however the team missed qualification for the 2006 Winter Olympics.|$|R
5000|$|Then, the cope {{is placed}} on the drag, and dowels (or pins) are put in the sand to make holes for the sprue and one or more risers. Talcum powder and sand are again sifted over the pattern, and rammed to fill the cope. The pins are then {{carefully}} pulled out of the sand. The critical part of the operation is to separate the cope and drag to remove the pattern. The pattern may be vibrated with a powered vibrator, or the pattern, and maybe the cope and drag flask, will be lightly tapped with a small hammer. The pattern is lifted from the sand, leaving a molding cavity. A passageway for metal to enter the mold, called a [...] "gate", is then cut from the sprue hole to the void left by the pattern, and a <b>runner</b> is <b>cut</b> from the sand to allow metal to flow into the riser.|$|R
40|$|In {{her first}} novel When Fox is a Thousand (1995), Calgary-based author Larissa Lai {{incorporated}} into her narrative selected scenes from the movie Blade <b>Runner</b> (Director’s <b>Cut</b> 1992) to interrogate a contemporary filmic definition of humanness that is premised on racialised, sexualised and gendered hierarchies. Lai’s intertextual engagement with Blade Runner articulates {{an awareness of the}} power of the Hollywood viewing apparatus to colour the look (white) and perpetuate dichotomies of racial difference. In the opening pages of Fox, however, the protagonist Artemis Wong watches and contemplates pivotal scenes from the movie in a way that suggests the novel’s vision(w) ary renegotiation of power relations based on domination and subordination. The dialectic between Fox and Blade Runner is continued in Lai’s second novel Salt Fish Girl (2002), which will be the primary focus of this paper. Characterised by intertextual layering, Salt Fish Girl interrogates the construction of identity through allusion to an older iconic sf western text, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Lai’s fiction functions as a contestation and complication of the literary and filmic perpetuation of an ideology o f a pure, originary and unmarked “humanness”, a definition which has historically accorded the white, western, heterosexual male a universal and centred subject positioning...|$|R
50|$|At Royal Ascot in 1919 Diadem {{started as}} the 7/2, fourth {{favourite}} for the King's Stand Stakes. She {{won the race}} by two lengths from favourite Best Born. In July she beat Iron Hand by three lengths to win the July Cup at Newmarket. At Goodwood she started in the King George Stakes, but another <b>runner,</b> Sun d'Or <b>cut</b> across her at the start and she was never in contention, cantering home behind winner Chiffre d'Amour and two others. At the Doncaster St. Leger meeting she carried top weight and started favourite for the seven-furlong Town Moor Handicap. She took the lead with {{a quarter of a}} mile still to run and despite being challenged in the closing stages, she held on the win by a head from Quadrille. In October Diadem beat her only opponent, Freesia, by three quarters of a length to win the Challenge Stakes. Later in the month she finished second of eighteen in the Cambridgeshire Stakes, six lengths behind winner Brigand.|$|R
60|$|After {{watching}} {{it for some}} minutes he ordered the stays and <b>runners</b> to be <b>cut,</b> {{at the same time}} calling all hands aft. Scarcely had the men gathered there than the vessel plunged her head into the sea. There was a loud report, and the top-gallant mast fell over her bows with a crash. Two of the Chilians with axes crawled out along the bowsprit and cut away the gear that held the spar alongside, and the wreckage at once floated away. The jib-boom was then got in, and the vessel felt the relief and lifted her head more buoyantly over the seas. For four days the gale continued, her bulwarks were carried away, and the waves swept her decks continually. One tremendous roller carried away the boats, the caboose, and all the deck fittings, together with four of the Chilians and six of the Peruvian sailors. The straining had opened her seams, and although the pumps had been kept going as long as the crew had been able to work at them, the water had been gaining steadily, and even the Chilians, who had kept on doggedly long after the Peruvians had thrown themselves down exhausted and hopeless, now ceased what was evidently a useless labour.|$|R
