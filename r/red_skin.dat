This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by <b>red</b> <b>skin.</b> Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards.

25|$|Dermatitis, {{also known}} as eczema {{is a group of}} {{diseases}} that results in inflammation of the skin. These diseases are characterized by itchiness, <b>red</b> <b>skin,</b> and a rash.

25|$|Currently {{there are}} three main {{cultivar}}s or groups of cultivar (red, orange and gold) grown in the subtropical {{northern part of the}} North Island near Dargaville and widely available throughout New Zealand year-round, where they are a popular alternative to potatoes. The red cultivar has dull <b>red</b> <b>skin</b> and purple-streaked white flesh, and is the most popular. The orange cultivar {{is the same as the}} American 'Beauregard'. The gold kumara has pale, yellowish skin and flesh.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{maceration}} method {{which gives}} some, albeit very brief, {{time for the}} juice to be {{in contact with the}} skins vin gris are wines made from the immediate pressing of <b>red</b> <b>skin</b> grapes without any maceration time. Despite the name vin gris, the resulting juice is actually not grey but rather a very pale pink that is usually much lighter than traditionally made rosés using the limited maceration and saignée methods. Under French wine laws, wines labelled gris de gris must only be made from lightly tinted grape varieties such as Cinsault, Gamay and Grenache gris. The style is a specialty of the Lorraine Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) Côtes de Toul made from Gamay and in Morocco where the orange-pink wine is made from a blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E

She speaks and dresses formally, and is normally well-mannered, but easily loses her temper whenever her plans fall apart. With her sister Kneesocks, Scanty comes up with schemes to kill or otherwise humiliate the Anarchy sisters, though they are often foiled by her excitable nature. Scanty wears two pairs of panties that transform into revolvers called , which she can combine into a shotgun. Her design is a partial reference to the character Nia, from Gainax's previous series Gurren Lagann.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{anthropomorphic}} form varies. Child gods {{are depicted}} nude, as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized. Certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts, signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance. Whereas most male gods have <b>red</b> <b>skin</b> and most goddesses are yellow—the same colors used to depict Egyptian men and women—some are given unusual, symbolic skin colors. Thus the blue skin and paunchy {{figure of the}} god Hapi alludes to the Nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought. A few deities, such as Osiris, Ptah, and Min, have a [...] "mummiform" [...] appearance, with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth. Although these gods resemble mummies, the earliest examples predate the cloth-wrapped style of mummification, and this form may instead hark back to the earliest, limbless depictions of deities.|$|E

500|$|The Mascarene parrot was [...] {{in length}} {{with a large}} red bill and long, rounded tail feathers. Its legs were red, and it had naked <b>red</b> <b>skin</b> around the eyes and nostrils. It had a black facial mask and {{partially}} white tail feathers, but the colouration of the body, wings and head is unclear. Descriptions from life indicate the body and head were ash grey, and the white part of the tail had two dark central feathers. In contrast, descriptions based on stuffed specimens state that the body was brown and the head bluish but do not mention the dark central tail feathers. This {{may be due to}} the specimens having changed colour as a result of aging and exposure to light, as well as other forms of damage. Very little is known about the bird in life.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{references}} to Christian {{beliefs in the}} film, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the Christian devil, complete with <b>red</b> <b>skin</b> and horns. Maul's facial tattoos were inspired by the indigenous peoples of Brazil. The Star Wars film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the [...] "chosen one"the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Forcewho was conceived of a virgin birth and is tempted to join the Sith. Anakin's fall from grace seemingly prevents him from fulfilling his destiny as the [...] "chosen one" [...] (until Return of the Jedi reveals the prophecy was ultimately true). The inspiration behind {{the story of the}} virgin birth parallels a concept developed by Joseph Campbell and his work on The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which heavily influenced Lucas' writing of the original Star Wars trilogy's outline.|$|E
500|$|The {{black stork}} {{is a large}} bird, {{measuring}} between [...] in length with a [...] wingspan, and weighing around [...] Standing as tall as , it has long red legs, a long neck and a long, straight, pointed red beak. It bears some resemblance to Abdim's stork (C. abdimii), which can be distinguished by its much smaller build, predominantly green bill, legs and feet, and white rump and lower back. The plumage is black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, armpits, axillaries and undertail coverts. The breast feathers are long and shaggy, forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The black stork has brown irises, and bare <b>red</b> <b>skin</b> around its eyes. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. Moulting takes place in spring, with the iridescent sheen brighter in new plumage. It walks slowly and steadily {{on the ground and}} like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.|$|E

500|$|Sensitized {{individuals}} may show a skin contact allergy to nickel {{known as a}} contact dermatitis. Highly sensitized {{individuals may}} also react to foods with high nickel content. Sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients with pompholyx. Nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide, partly due to its use in jewelry for pierced ears. Nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy, <b>red</b> <b>skin.</b> Many earrings are now made without nickel or low-release nickel to address this problem. The amount allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the European Union. In 2002, researchers found that the nickel released by 1 and 2 Euro coins was far in excess of those standards. This {{is believed to be}} the result of a galvanic reaction. Nickel was voted Allergen of the Year in 2008 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. In August 2015, the American Academy of Dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel: [...] "Estimates suggest that contact dermatitis, which includes nickel sensitization, accounts for approximately $1.918 billion and affects nearly 72.29 million people." ...|$|E
