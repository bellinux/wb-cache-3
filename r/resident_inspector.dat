In 1933, he became the <b>resident</b> <b>inspector</b> for the U.S. Navy at the Navy Aircraft Office located at Grumman Aircraft, then in Farmingdale, New York. In this capacity, Mr. Titterton was a [...] "watchdog" [...] for the Navy's interests and created numerous memos documenting suggestions for improvement in the Grumman production process as was (and still is) typical of a government agency overseeing its contractors. [...] During his three-year stay there, he was awarded a degree in Aeronautical Engineering by New York University.|$|E
5000|$|On Friday, 8 May 1885, Thomas Stevens, <b>resident</b> <b>inspector</b> for the Clifton Suspension Bridge, {{reported}} that Henley had {{climbed over the}} railings {{and on to the}} parapet. Before anyone could reach her, she had thrown herself off. Witnesses claimed that a billowing effect created by an updraft of air beneath her crinoline skirt slowed the pace of her fall, misdirecting her away from the water and instead toward the muddy banks of the Bristol side of the Avon River. [...] Although {{there is no evidence that}} the wind or the skirt saved Henley from the fall, the story has nevertheless become a local Bristol legend.|$|E

He thus familiarized himself with fishing and the fisherman's point of view {{so far as to}} become a recognised authority on the subject and a medium of communication between fishermen and the government. He {{was a member of the}} committee of inquiry into Devon and Cornwall fisheries (1912), and of the departmental committee on inshore fisheries (1913), and in that year he was appointed adviser on inshore fisheries to the Development Commission. In 1914, he became also <b>resident</b> <b>inspector</b> of fisheries for the S.W. area.|$|E
40|$|Fire {{can be a}} {{significant}} contributor to reactor plant risk. In many cases, the risk posed by fires is comparable to or exceeds the risk from internal events. The fire protection program shall extend the concept of defense in depth (DID) to fire protection in plant areas important to safety by: (1) preventing fires from starting, (2) rapidly detecting, controlling, and extinguishing those fires that do occur, and (3) providing protection for structures, systems, and components important to safety so that a fire that is not promptly extinguished by fire suppression activities will not prevent the safe shutdown of the reactor plant. LEVEL OF EFFORT: Quarterly Inspection: The <b>resident</b> <b>inspector</b> will perform a DID walkdown of four to six plant areas important to safety (on a plant specific basis) each calendar quarter per Section 02. 01. Annual Inspection: Each year, the <b>resident</b> <b>inspector</b> will evaluate the fire brigade performance by observing selected fire drills. Fire brigade drills may be announced or unannounced.

In implementing this oversight, NRC allocates specific roles and responsibilities to <b>resident</b> <b>inspectors</b> assigned to each plant, regional officials at one of four regional offices responsible for most oversight activities, headquarters officials, and the nuclear power industry. NRC also builds into its processes incentives for plant managers to identify concerns about reactor safety, report those concerns to NRC, and take prompt actions to correct them. NRC's processes for identifying and assessing findings and violations are based on prescribed agency procedures and include several points where NRC staff must exercise their professional judgment, such as determining whether issues of concern identified during physical inspections constitute findings or violations and the risk significance of any findings or the severity of any violations, among other things. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{significance}} determination process Phase II {{risk assessment}} was performed for the ANO Unit 2 Fire Door 269 being left in an untested (double doors not latched) configuration. The senior <b>resident</b> <b>inspector</b> identified an inoperable fire door between the redundant ANO Unit 2 4 kV switchgear rooms (2 A 3 & 2 A 4 vital busses). The fire barrier {{consists of a}} double door, one door {{is intended to be}} stationary (latched at top and bottom into the floor) and the other door is used for ingress/egress). A slight push on the stationary door opened them both. Redundant safe shutdown cables/switchgear are less than 10 feet apart. This condition had existed for about 4 days. All the SDP Phase 2 analyses assume that all equipment required for a transient is lost and that the TDEFW is recoverable. I. Background Fire Door 269 which provides a 3 -hour fire barrier between the Unit 2 vital switch gear rooms 2 A 3 (North) and 2 A 4 (South) was found closed but the upper and lower latches were not secured.

40|$|Pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 90, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is {{submitting}} {{a request}} for an amendment (TS- 08 - 11) to License NPF- 90 for WBN. The amendment revises Technical Specification (TS) TS 3. 4. 15, "RCS Leakage Detection, " to remove the requirement for one operable containment atmosphere gaseous radioactivity monitor. The leakage detection requirements remaining in the TSs will continue to provide adequate diverse RCS leakage detection. A corresponding change is being made to the TS Bases 3. 4. 15. TVA has determined {{that there are no}} significant hazards considerations associated with the proposed change and that the TS change qualifies for categorical exclusion from environmental review pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 51. 22 (c) (9). Additionally, in accordance with 10 CFR 50. 91 (b) (1), TVA is sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to the Tennessee State Department of Public Health. TVA requests that NRC provide an exigent review of this license amendment request in accordance with 10 CFR 50. 91 (a) (6) and approval by November 28, 2008, in order to avoid a plant shutdown of Unit 1 per Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) 3. 4. 15.

40|$|This {{inspection}} of component design bases verifies that plant components are maintained within their design basis. Additionally, this inspection provides {{monitoring of the}} capability of the selected components and operator actions to perform their design bases functions. As plants age, modifications may alter or disable important design features making the design bases difficult to determine or obsolete. The plant risk assessment model assumes the capability of safety systems and components to perform their intended safety function successfully. This inspectable area verifies aspects of the Initiating Events, Mitigating Systems and Barrier Integrity cornerstones for {{which there are no}} indicators to measure performance. LEVEL OF EFFORT: Review 15 - 25 risk significant samples in the following categories: components and operating experience. 71111. 21 - 01 INSPECTION OBJECTIVE To gain reasonable assurance that risk significant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) can adequately perform their design basis function. This includes reasonable assurance that the risk significant component can fulfill their design basis function during or after licensee’s activities (e. g., maintenance, surveillance) which can affect component’s availability, reliability and capability. Additionally, this includes that reasonable assurance that risk significant issues resulting from the generic communications have been adequately addressed. 71111. 21 - 02 INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDANCE 02. 01 Sample Selection. Using the guidance provided in paragraphs 02. 01. a through 02. 01. c, select the required number of components and operating experience for inspection as follows: 11 to 16 components; one to three components associated with containment-related SSCs which are considered for LERF implications (see Table 4. 1 of IMC 0609 Appendix H for selection); and three to six components associated with issues identified through one of the operating experience feedback process identified in paragraph 02. 02. d.

5000|$|The DN-1 was the US Navy's first airship. Captain Mark L. Bristol, {{the second}} Director of Naval Aviation, {{supported}} {{the development of}} the dirigible in the anti-submarine role. Victor Herbster, Holden Richardson and LCDR Frank McCrary drew up the specifications for the DN-1. The contract was awarded on 1 June 1915 to the Connecticut Aircraft Company of New Haven, CT. The U.S. Navy had no experience with airships and it seems neither had any of the principles of Connecticut Aircraft Company. They were a lawyer who was the financial backer, an amusement park owner who acted as manager; the technical staff was an Austrian, Hans Otto Stagel, who claimed to be a dirigible pilot and a German engineer and mechanic, who claimed to be Zeppelin experts. Jerome Clarke Hunsaker of MIT and his assistant Donald Wills Douglas, later founder of the Douglas Aircraft Company, aided the Connecticut Aircraft Company in the design of DN-1.

We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. I would make use of some twenty-five <b>inspectors</b> <b>resident</b> in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. Somehow it all came together. The inspections would begin on the morning of the 6th.|$|R
500|$|According to Foster et al., {{the most}} {{rigorous}} inquiries into the alleged massacre {{have been made}} by four professional or amateur historians, A. T.

Saunders was the Register journalist who engaged with Beviss in the pages of that newspaper in 1926, and relied on the official records made by the Government <b>Resident</b> and police <b>inspector,</b> which do not support the massacre story. Somerville examined the limited records held by the South Australian Archives, and concluded in 1936 that there was no formal evidence of a massacre, and that the confrontation at Horn's hut precipitated the [...] "myth". Baillie worked with Somerville and agreed with his conclusions, adding that the facts of the incident at Horn's hut had been used by [...] "ambitious raconteurs [...] superimpose... the massacre story, elevating modest fact to unbridled fancy." [...] In 1989, Charter re-examined the archival evidence, and concluded that it [...] "appears likely that the rumours relating to the Elliston Massacre have a foundation in fact, and that some form of punitive action did take place on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay, upon which an exaggerated myth had developed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Iran's Khodadad Seifi {{responded to}} {{allegations}} against the Iranian nuclear programme saying that Iran has an inalienable right to peaceful nuclear energy and is fully committed to its non-proliferation agreements, {{that it has}} always been for peaceful purposes and that Iran continues to fully cooperate with the IAEA. All activities are carried out under the agency’s cameras and <b>resident</b> <b>inspectors</b> regularly visit the sites and measure and seal uranium containers. Some cooperation, it said, is even beyond the legal obligations so as to build more trust and confidence; non-diversion has always been confirmed by the agency. He added that the [...] "agency continues to verify the material at the nuclear facilities by Iran in accordance with the agreement." [...] He further noted that all countries have right to nuclear energy and none to nuclear weapons: “nuclear energy for all and nuclear weapons for no one.” Iran addresses genuine proliferation but rejects conflating peaceful nuclear energy with developing nuclear weapons. In addition to obligations, he said, Islamic teaching is against pursuing nuclear weapons program. Nuclear weapons do not bring security but are the greatest threat to nuclear-haves and have-nots. As {{there is no reason to}} accept nuclear weapons but many reasons to abolish them all, nuclear weapons have no place in the defence doctrine of Iran. Yet some countries express concerns over Iranian nuclear weapons and there is a deep mistrust by Iran over the policies and intentions of these countries. Therefore there is a need to build mutual trust that is possible only by resorting to the force of logic not the logic of force. The golden rule is to resort to diplomacy alone. Sustainable solutions are attainable only by peaceful and respectful negotiations. For its part, Iran expresses full readiness to stick to meaningful time-bound negotiations. Iran stands ready to ensure its nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful and remove concerns of other parties and acknowledge the inherent right of Iran to peaceful nuclear energy including a full national fuel cycle. As such sanctions, whether unilateral or multilateral, should be lifted. Mutual respect and equal treatment is essential for a win-win situation. Other parties need to adopt the same approach. Moreover Iran underlines the important contribution other countries can make to the process. Iran takes this opportunity to thank all countries that support sovereign rights to peaceful science and tech and those who have supported, in the past several days, the Iranian programme. However, he cited the as yet extremely inflammatory statement by the “last speaker” with allegations against the peaceful nuclear activities of Iran and it would not dignify such unfound accusations with answers other than categorically rejecting them all. He said that Netanyahu tried to “mislead this august body” about the nuclear programme, but that unlike last year his comments tried to be more royal than a king by setting a standard for Iranian nuclear activities and level of enrichment. As such, he must know that no one can dictate to Iran what to do and not to do. “As a party to the NPT, Iran is fully aware of its rights and is fully committed to its obligations. Indeed the one who is badly in need to be educated about these issues is Israel, the only non-party to the NPT in the Middle East. And to that end Israel no choice but to accede to the NPT without delay and place all its nuclear possessions under IAEA safeguards. Netanyahu talked of WMDs in the Middle East without mention that Israel is the only one in the region that possesses all types of WMDss but is still not party to any treaty banning them.“ Netanyahu also did not mention the proposed 2012 conference on the establishment of a WMD free zone in the Middle East which was not convened only due to Israeli objections. Similarly to last year, he continued sabre rattling to Iran by abusing the General Debate by threatening a founding member of the body that was intended to prevent breaches of the peace according to the UN charter. Despite this Israel enjoys full freedom and is “proud of all atrocities and over 10 wars waged in 65 years by the Israel regime against all neighbours and others as well. It may wish to apply for an international award certifying the ability of Israeli forces in never ending savage attacks against people under occupation, in particular women and innocent children.” Iran warned that Israel should seriously avoid miscalculation about Iran and that Iran’s century’s old policy of non-aggression should not be seen as an inability to defend itself not because of its ability but its principled policy of rejecting the use of force. Iran is proud of being the best in exercising the inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN charter. Thus Netanyahu better not think of attacking Iran let alone planning for that. In conclusion, to point allegedly made by Iran’s foreign minister at the General Debate: “we have been accused of having a smile attack, a smile attack is better than a military attack” he then concluded that “indeed a smile policy is better than lying.” ...|$|R
