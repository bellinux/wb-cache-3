5|$|<b>Rovelizumab,</b> trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rovelizumab,</b> {{also known}} as LeukArrest and Hu23F2G, is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody which was an experimental immunosuppressive drug. <b>Rovelizumab</b> was developed by Icos to treat patients suffering from haemorrhagic shock. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that suppresses white blood cells which become overly active during shock. During testing {{the number of patients}} given the drug was low because <b>rovelizumab</b> had to be delivered within four hours of the injury and consent was required. Often the patient was unconscious and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June 1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August 1998 for five medical centers. Development of <b>rovelizumab</b> was halted in April 2000 when interim data from phase III clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals. The company's goals for <b>rovelizumab</b> included reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death-rate from shock at 28 days. <b>Rovelizumab</b> was also being tested for treating heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, and was being explored as a treatment for cerebral vasospasm, head trauma, kidney transplantation, and restenosis.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{companies}} {{have tried to}} develop anti-CD18 drugs, {{but none of them}} have been successful. Among them are Icos's <b>rovelizumab</b> (LeukArrest), and two drugs developed by Protein Design Labs and Centocor. Although trials in humans have not gone well, the research of CD18 drugs in animals has been encouraging. It is thought that the experimental medicines are affecting the lymphocyte adhesion pathway in humans in unintended ways. One hypothesis is that the endothelial cell barrier function fails when blood supply is low for a prolonged time in humans. If this is true, the drug is not able to stop lymphocyte movement into inflamed tissue.|$|E
