5000|$|The old <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights,</b> SMI-4 (СМИ-4), {{have been}} {{replaced}} with the LED powered headlight SFOK (СФОК).|$|R
50|$|<b>Halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> {{were added}} in June 1976. As with the 230, the 330 was {{offered as a}} Sedan, Wagon/Van, Coupé, and rare pillarless Hardtop Sedan.|$|R
50|$|June 1976 saw {{cosmetic}} changes, with <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> {{being used}} on all versions except the sedan used for taxi service. Wheel covers are now painted {{to match the}} exterior body color.|$|R
50|$|June 4, 1983 saw a major restyle of the {{previous}} generation for all versions of the Gloria. Sedans used for taxi service utilized four round headlights whereas other versions upgraded to European style <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|During 2009–2010, 600 {{underwent}} a major overhaul and rebuild, the first Boat to undergo such high maintenance. Work included the fitting of modern safety {{features such as}} <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> and a rubber bumper and fiberglass skirt on each end. This tram carries the original 1930s green and cream livery.|$|R
5000|$|Lighting: 35W <b>Halogen</b> Multi-reflector <b>Headlight</b> & 21/5W Brake light ...|$|R
50|$|Also {{inherited}} from the previous model was the combination of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, but now with twin braking circuits as an additional safety feature, and servo-assistance. The 26M received enlarged front brake discs to complement its power-assisted steering, twin <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights,</b> and twin exhaust pipes.|$|R
50|$|All EU07 {{locomotives}} {{were originally}} fitted with large headlights the buckets. After 1990 {{these have been}} successively replaced with <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> of smaller diameter. The cheapest such replacement was to put the new headlight inside the bucket. More elaborate changes included cutting the bucket out and creating flat headlight for better aerodynamic performance.|$|R
5000|$|June 1979 saw a {{completely}} redesigned Nissan Gloria with assistance with Pininfarina, {{with a more}} simple and straightforward appearance over the previous generation, and exchanging the single unit <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> with 4 sealed beam headlight units, achieving a more American appearance, similar to the Buick Century {{during the same time}} period. Computer-controlled fuel injection was added to more engines offered, with the [...] "E" [...] designation signifying fuel injection.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{domestic}} market Hardtop has rectangular <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights,</b> all export models come with twin round headlights. This model sold very badly in the US, possibly related to the futuristic styling (called [...] "" [...] in period marketing material) with flush bumpers that was a bit ahead of its time. Only {{the first two years}} were imported to the USA, where it was the last Crown to be sold. The Corona Mark II, replaced the Crown in North America.|$|R
50|$|This {{generation}} of the Gloria has been completely shared with the Cedric, essentially being the same vehicle, aside from changes in appearance. <b>Halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> are introduced to the Gloria, along with both a 2-door and 4-door hardtop body style, {{in addition to a}} 4-door sedan. Twin carburetors are removed from the L20 4-cylinder, due to emission regulations. The 2.8 L engine is replaced with the 2.6 L and used on the 4-door sedan for taxi usage, and uses LPG fuel.|$|R
5000|$|With {{a smaller}} design and {{engineering}} budget than General Motors, Lincoln stylists {{were unable to}} give the Versailles the distinct body {{that was given to}} the Cadillac Seville. Adopting many features from the 1975-1976 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the Lincoln Versailles was given a Lincoln-style [...] "radiator" [...] grille, quad rectangular headlights (the first Lincoln since 1969 with exposed headlights), and a Mark-style trunklid (simulated spare tire). The Versailles introduced two notable features to American-market cars: <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> and clearcoat paint.|$|R
50|$|For the 1977 model year, Lincoln {{introduced}} the Versailles as its compact sedan offering, expanding the Lincoln model {{line for the}} first time since 1960. Although the smallest Lincoln, the Versailles carried the highest base price at $11,500 ($48,154 in 2017 dollars), in line with its Cadillac counterpart. The first Lincoln manufactured outside of Wixom Assembly since 1957, the Versailles was produced alongside the Mercury Monarch and Ford Granada. The model was notable for being the first production vehicle to be sold with clearcoat paint and <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> in North America.|$|R
50|$|On 20 January 2017, ABS and EBD {{were added}} to the facelifted Standard G trim model as standard. <b>Halogen</b> {{projector}} <b>headlights</b> were also made standard across all trim levels.|$|R
2500|$|The Toyota Curren was a Japanese {{automobile}} {{built by}} the Toyota Motor Corporation. It {{was based on the}} Toyota T200 chassis. It shared the same interior and rear end design as the 1994-1998 Toyota Celica coupé. Instead of having four round headlights like the Celica, it had a rectangular headlight design providing a more traditional <b>halogen</b> <b>headlight</b> appearance.

50|$|The central directable fascia vents {{could be}} heated and angled, {{so that they}} could be pointed {{directly}} at the windscreen in front of the driver, to keep it clear in extreme misting conditions. There was also an additional mid-level vent. The C15 also had height-adjustable <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights,</b> and multi-speed/intermittent front wipers, which was better than most commercial vehicles of the time. Early models had a single wide rear door, but this was awkward for loading in a tight space and prone to sagging or to snapping off in a high wind, so, after a year or two, only conventional two-door versions were sold with fold-back hinges.|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of illumination of motor vehicles. Thesis {{is divided into two}} sections, from which the first discusses precisely the possibilities of lighting of motor vehicles at the present time. What are the modern lighting techniques, that {{can be found on the}} market and what is their impact on safety enhancement in road traffic. Second section is about the practical measurement of low and high beam afterglow. This measurement is being compared between two types of headlamps, namely <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> and xenon headlights. Part of the measurement is as well measurement of illumination intensity precisely for these headlights. The output of measurement is the creation of own illumination intensity diagrams and afterglow diagrams of particular headlights, in comparison to isolux diagrams provided by the headlights manufacturer. Consequently are solved the issues about utilization of the isolux diagrams in expert praxis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} of the Lolyne was built using the Alusuisse [...] "System M5438" [...] system, for optimum strength. Glazing was with laminated glass, and gasket glazing came with the bus as standard - with bonded glazing available - and had hopper opening windows. The heating was thermostatically controlled and windows and air vents provided ventilation. The seating was trimmed in customer's required moquette. The floor had a 12mm Xyligen Basileum treated Finnish Birch combi plywood floor on the lower deck and both decks a non-slip flooring. Electrical features were the fluorescent light on the bus' ceilings, and twin circular <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights.</b> Also, CCTV was available.

50|$|The European and British {{versions}} {{were installed}} with standard headlight washers and rear fog lights, so that other drivers {{could see them}} in inclement weather and at night. European models also received glass-lens <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> that could have the distance the light was projected adjusted from an electric switch installed on the dashboard, and also received speed sensitive, variable effort power steering, and both items were standard installed. The Australian-spec sedan and wagon were equipped with the rear fog light, but not the headlight washers. The British and Europeans could also install a front bumper bull bar and an 8 mm thick steel sump guard that extended from the bottom edge of the front bumper to the front suspension. The Europeans could not get an in-dash cupholder located in the small space below the HVAC controls and above the stereo, found in the Australian, USA and Japanese models. In that location instead is a clock, and a button to deploy an electric radio antenna, if so equipped. Clocks are integrated with the OEM stereo internationally.|$|R

40|$|Currently no driver-aid system {{effectively}} addresses glare-reduction for oncoming headlights. Glare {{at night}} {{has the ability}} to decrease our visual acuity and cause discomfort or pain. This decreased visual ability constitutes an increased risk for driver error and a potential roadway safety hazard. The severity of these detrimental effects has previously been shown to increase with driver age and is thought to be further exacerbated by the increased brightness of High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlights. In the current study, the effects of headlight glare from HID and halogen lights on driver performance was examined in a custom driving simulator. A novel polarized headlight glare-blocking system was also examined for its effectiveness in reducing headlight glare. Decreased visual field perception occurred across all age groups with the use of oncoming HID <b>headlights</b> compared to <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights.</b> In addition, older drivers 2 ̆ 7 performance on the visual awareness task was significantly decreased as compared to their younger counterparts. The performance-restoring effects of the headlight-blocking system were especially beneficial to older adults exposed to HID headlights, restoring visual field perceptual abilities to nearly that of the younger age group. As even brighter LED-based headlights reach the automotive market {{in the midst of an}} expanding older driver population, it is urged that automotive manufacturers consider glare-mitigation strategies when designing current headlight systems...|$|R
50|$|The first Cresta was {{introduced}} April 1980 and was available exclusively at the renamed Toyota Vista Store (formerly Toyota Auto Store) sales channels across Japan, joining the recently introduced Chaser. The Cresta was positioned as a high-level luxury sedan {{just below the}} established, traditional luxury sedan, the Crown. The sales goal of the Cresta was to provide buyers with a luxury sedan, but not incur tax consequences for exceeding dimension regulations, the vehicle was limited to an engine size at 2000cc as well as dimensions under 4.7 m long, 1.7 m wide, and 2 m high, and allowing another Toyota dealership network to offer a luxury-sports oriented product originally exclusive to Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. The Cresta {{was introduced}} with <b>halogen</b> <b>headlights</b> to provide a modern European appearance, and was available with {{a full range of}} luxury amenities and conveniences. The SOHC 2.0 L M-EU engine was used with an automatic transmission only, which was shared with the Crown, as well as the 2.0L 1G-EU straight six engine, also used in the Crown. Trim levels used names meant to suggest luxury overtones, such as Super Lucent, Super Touring, Super Deluxe, Super Custom, and Custom, names that were similarly used on the Crown. Upper level trim levels used two-tone paint schemes to further the Cresta's elevated status towards a younger demographic. The Nissan competitor was the Laurel.|$|R

As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette's 5.7 L V8, the LS1 of the C5 Corvette, as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued. The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered. Beginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased potential traveling range. GM's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment. In 1999, a Hurst shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds. In 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants. For 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment, while cassette stereos were phased out.|$|R
