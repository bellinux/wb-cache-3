On-site renewable energy generation is intended to produce 100% of the building's energy throughout the year using the following energy efficiency features: Variable <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flow</b> for the HVAC, a geo-exchange system, advanced metering and building controls, high-efficient lighting systems, thermally enhanced building envelope, interior window system (to maintain historic windows), and advanced power strips (APS) with individual occupancy sensors.|$|E

With daylighting, variable <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flow</b> HVAC, and displacement ventilation, it is designed to use half of the energy of a conventional California school building, and, through a building-integrated solar array, provides 108% of the energy needed to offset its annual electricity use.

2500|$|A {{refrigeration}} cycle describes {{the changes that}} take place in the refrigerant as it alternately absorbs and rejects heat as it circulates through a refrigerator. [...] It is also applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning HVACR work, when describing the [...] "process" [...] of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flow</b> through an HVACR unit, whether it is a packaged or split system.|$|E
50|$|The <b>refrigerant</b> liquid <b>flows</b> {{through the}} {{turboexpander}} {{where it is}} vaporized and the vapor undergoes an isentropic expansion which results in a low-temperature mixture of vapor and liquid. The vapor-liquid mixture is then routed through the evaporator where it is vaporized by heat absorbed from the space being cooled. The vaporized <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flows</b> to the compressor inlet to complete the cycle.|$|R
50|$|The warmer is the {{air that}} reaches the evaporator, the higher is the {{pressure}} of the vapor mixture discharged from it and therefore the higher is the load placed on the compressor and therefore on the engine to keep the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flowing</b> through the system.|$|R
25|$|Heat pumps use a {{refrigerant}} as {{an intermediate}} fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes, in the evaporator, and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses, in the condenser. The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flows</b> through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser, allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances.|$|R
2500|$|The {{heat pump}} is a {{refrigeration}} based appliance which reverses <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flow</b> between the {{indoor and outdoor}} coils. [...] This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a [...] "4-way" [...] or [...] "change-over" [...] valve). [...] During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat {{is removed from the}} outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil. [...] The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool. [...] Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an [...] "O" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a [...] "B" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating. [...] The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building. [...] A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point. [...] Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place. [...] This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity. [...] Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil. [...] This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements. [...] The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building. [...] The elements are then used in the [...] "reheat" [...] function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail. [...] This function is normally activated by an [...] "E" [...] terminal on the thermostat. [...] When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.|$|E

25|$|In heating mode, {{the outdoor}} coil is an {{evaporator}}, while the indoor is a condenser. The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flowing</b> from the evaporator (outdoor coil) carries the thermal energy from outside air (or soil) indoors. Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it. The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy (including {{energy from the}} compression) to the indoor air, which is then moved around {{the inside of the}} building by an air handler.|$|R

The results of {{transfer function}} are compared with experimental data, obtained by applying both step inputs and periodic changes to the <b>refrigerant</b> mass <b>flow</b> rate. The influence of the hunting, typical of a thermostatic expansion valve, is also estimated experimentally and then validated by the transfer function, obtaining a good agreement.

5000|$|Digital freeze stats, {{also known}} as {{electronic}} or solid state freeze stats, use an electronic circuit, microprocessor, or microcontroller {{in place of the}} mechanical freeze stat's diaphragm and switch. They also use one or more electric or electronic sensors in place of the capillary tube and bulb for temperature sensing. Digital freeze stats utilizing microcontrollers or microprocessors can also perform more advanced functions than simply opening or closing switch contacts. Digital freeze stats can perform seemingly intelligent operations such as reversing the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flow</b> and using some building heat to thaw a freon-to-liquid heat exchanger and then restoring the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>flow</b> to its normal direction once the danger of freezing the water coil has been averted.Disadvantages ...|$|E

The vaporisation performances were evaluated at two evaporation temperatures, - 15 and - 20 degrees C, and different <b>refrigerant</b> mass <b>flow</b> rates and {{compared with those of}} the traditional refrigerant for domestic refrigeration HFC 134 a. The performance analysis was carried out using both thermocouples installed on the rear side of the roll-bond evaporator and an IR thermo-camera.

An experimental setup based on an inverse Rankine refrigeration cycle is used to obtain the heat transfer data in an R- 134 a refrigerant mini-tube evaporator set operated under constant heat flux conditions.
