50|$|Bows {{are usually}} very simple. Most {{do not have}} sights, and aiming is by {{line-of-sight}} judgment down the arrow. There {{are a couple of}} types of rests including the hook and <b>roller</b> <b>rest.</b> Most bows have little to no let-off and not much draw weight. This differs with what one has available and personal preference. There are two main types of bows. Traditional bows include long bows and recurve bows. In more modern times, compound bows came into use. They use a system of pulleys to help the archer. Modern bows can have as much as 120 pounds (50 kg) draw weight.|$|E
50|$|The firing {{platform}} was a semi-portable mount {{that could}} be emplaced anywhere after several weeks of labor to prepare the position. It rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount. The rear was supported by <b>rollers</b> <b>resting</b> on a semicircular rail and was generally equipped with a gun shield.|$|R
50|$|The {{guns for}} the Western Front were mounted in Bettungsschiessgerüst (firing platforms), which were {{portable}} mounts {{that could be}} emplaced anywhere after several weeks of labor to prepare the position. The Bettungsscheissgerüst rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount; the rear was supported by <b>rollers</b> <b>resting</b> on a semicircular rail.

40|$|Photograph of men {{pulling a}} pavement-roller in China, ca. 1900. A central man holds the handles of the roller {{behind his back}} at center, {{while the rest of}} the group pulls it with ropes that have been {{fastened}} to it. The <b>roller</b> <b>rests</b> on flattened ground to the left, while to the right, rough, rock-strewn ground can be seen. In the background, a two-story pagoda-like building appears to be under construction, encapsulated with bamboo scaffolding...|$|R
5000|$|VéloSoleX is a moped, or {{motorised}} bicycle, {{usually just}} {{referred to as}} 'Solex', which was originally produced by the French manufacturer Solex, based in Paris, France. The company manufactured centrifugal radiators, carburetors, and micrometers, before branching into assist motors and bicycles. The moped originally created during World War II and mass-produced between 1946 and 1988 came in various iterations, whilst keeping the same concept of a motor with <b>roller</b> <b>resting</b> on the front wheel of bicycle ...|$|R
50|$|Clear Run: A dumbbell-like <b>roller</b> <b>rests</b> {{at the top}} of a ramp on one end of a long, {{straight}} track. Several pegs are {{inserted into}} the other end: six white ones, followed by a number of orange ones equal to the target number. The player must press a button next to the ramp to start the roller, then run to the pegs and pull them all out with one hand so that the roller reaches the far end without touching any of them.|$|R
5|$|The {{island of}} Helgoland {{received}} four twin gun turrets between 1909–12, although their exact type is unknown. Battery Kaiser Wilhelm II {{was built to}} protect the port of Zeebrugge in Occupied Flanders during World War I. It consisted of four guns in concrete barbettes mounted on Bettungsschiessgerüst (BSG) (firing platforms). These manually powered mounts rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount and the rear was supported by <b>rollers</b> <b>resting</b> on a semi-circular rail. They were equipped with a gun shield and capable of all-around fire. They were manned by sailors from Naval Artillery Regiment (Matrosen Artillerie Regiment) 1.|$|R
5000|$|The Outfit {{formed in}} 2007, after the {{collapse}} of another roller derby organization in Chicago, the Chi-Town Sirens. While many of the former Sirens joined [...] "the other" [...] Chicago league, the Windy City <b>Rollers,</b> the <b>rest</b> launched the Outfit as a new organization that only played against other league's teams, rather than creating its own home league.|$|R
25|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} roller-printing machine {{consists of a}} strong cast iron cylinder mounted in adjustable bearings capable of sliding up and down slots in {{the sides of the}} rigid iron framework. Beneath this cylinder the engraved copper <b>roller</b> <b>rests</b> in stationary bearings and is supplied with colour from a wooden roller that revolves in a colour-box below it. The copper roller is mounted on a stout steel axle, at one end of which a cogwheel is fixed to gear with the driving wheel of the machine, and at the other end a smaller cogwheel to drive the colour-furnishing roller. The cast iron pressure cylinder is wrapped with several thicknesses of a special material made of wool and cotton lapping, the object of which is to provide the elasticity necessary to enable it to properly force the cloth to be printed into the lines of engraving.|$|R
5000|$|The loss of {{the armored}} cruiser [...] during the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 {{rendered}} its four reserve 21 cm SK L/45 C/06 guns surplus as no other ships used them. An order was placed with Krupp to design a Bettungsschiessgerüst (firing platform) in May 1915 that could use the redundant guns. They were portable mounts that could be emplaced anywhere after several weeks of labor to prepare the position. It rotated on a pivot {{at the front of}} the mount and the rear was supported by <b>rollers</b> <b>resting</b> on a semicircular rail and was generally equipped with a gun shield. One obvious change made for land service was the placement of a small counterweight just forward of the trunnions to counteract the preponderance of weight towards the breech. This, although heavy, was simpler than adding equilibrators to perform the same function.|$|R
50|$|The E. u. B. could {{fire from}} any {{suitable}} section of track after curved wedges were {{bolted to the}} track behind each wheel to absorb any residual recoil after the gun cradle recoiled backwards. It also had a pintle built into {{the underside of the}} front of the mount. Two large rollers were fitted to the underside of the mount at the rear. Seven cars could carry a portable metal firing platform (Bettungslafette) that had a central pivot mount and an outer rail. It was assembled {{with the aid of a}} derrick or crane, which took between three and five days, and railroad tracks were laid slightly past the firing platform to accommodate the front bogies of the gun. The gun was moved over the firing platform and then lowered into position after the central section of rail was removed. After the gun's pintle was bolted to the firing platform's pivot mount, the entire carriage was jacked up so that the trucks and their sections of rail could be removed. The carriage was then lowered so that the rear <b>rollers</b> <b>rested</b> on the outer track. Concrete versions were also used. It could have up to 360° of traverse.|$|R
500|$|Some of the 28cm SK L/40 {{guns were}} {{transferred}} to the German Army from the Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) when the pre-dreadnoughts began to be disarmed and relegated to training duties in 1916 after the Battle of Jutland had proved {{that they were not}} suitable for contemporary naval combat. [...] One obvious change made for land service was the placement of a large counterweight just forward of the trunnions to counteract the preponderance of weight towards the breech. This, although heavy, was simpler than adding equilibrators to perform the same function. It was fitted with a hydro-pneumatic system to absorb the recoil from firing and to return the gun to its firing position, ready for the next round. The first four guns were placed in Bettungsschiessgerüst (firing platform) (BSG) mountings in 1917 for coast defense duties as part of [...] "Batterie Graf Spee" [...] on the island of Wangerooge.

It rotated on a pivot {{at the front of the}} mount and the rear was supported by <b>rollers</b> <b>resting</b> on a semicircular rail and was sometimes equipped with a gun shield. The gun's rate of fire in these mounts was about one round per five minutes.|$|R

25|$|The box-trail {{carriage}} revolved on a turntable {{that sat}} on a ball race on the firing platform and was capable of 360° traverse. The end of the carriage <b>rested</b> on <b>rollers</b> which <b>rested</b> on a metal track or rail. For transport the K 39 broke down into three loads, the barrel, the carriage and the firing platform with the turntable. Each of these was carried on a trailer with pneumatic tires. Emplacing the gun took six to eight hours, mainly to dig in and anchor the firing platform.|$|R
60|$|We {{had built}} her upon a low {{bank of the}} river close to where it emptied into the sea, and just above high tide. Her keel we had laid upon several rollers cut from small trees, the ends of the <b>rollers</b> in turn <b>resting</b> upon {{parallel}} tracks of long saplings. Her stern was toward the water.|$|R
50|$|This type of cam {{was used}} for example in {{mechanical}} time keeping clocking-in clocks to drive the day advance mechanism at precisely midnight and consisted of a follower being raised over 24 hours by the cam in a spiral path which terminated at a sharp cut off at which the follower would drop down and activate the day advance. Where timing accuracy is required as in clocking-in clocks these were typically ingeniously arranged to have a roller cam follower to raise the drop weight {{for most of its}} journey to near its full height, and only for the last portion of its travel for the weight to be taken over and supported by a solid follower with a sharp edge. This ensured that the weight dropped at a precise moment, enabling accurate timing. This was achieved by the use of two snail cams mounted coaxially with the <b>roller</b> initially <b>resting</b> on one cam and the final solid follower on the other but not in contact with its cam profile. Thus the roller cam was initially carried the weight, until at the final portion of the run the profile of the non-roller cam rose more than the other causing the solid follower to take the weight.|$|R
