30|$|Various {{protection}} {{strategies have}} been proposed for MTDC networks [10 – 14]. In [10] a handshaking’ protection method for VSC based MTDC network is proposed where DC switch and AC circuit breakers (ACCBs) are used to protect the entire system though the complete network has to be shutdown <b>and</b> <b>de-energized</b> to allow the DC switches to isolate the faulty branches. The proposed concept can pose major operational problems for a large MTDC network and connected AC systems as the large ‘loss of infeed’ may cause large excursion in AC frequency. Thus, fast and reliable protection is mandatory for fast fault clearance to avoid complete shutdown of the entire network so as to minimize the disturbances to the connected AC networks. Some MMC topologies [15 – 17] can block or control DC fault current but resulting additional capital cost and power loss. In addition, such converter topologies cannot isolate fault from the MTDC network apart from protecting themselves from over-current so additional DC protection equipment is still required.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{value of}} {{distributed}} sensors, embedded biomedical implants, and other wireless microsystems is {{the information they}} collect, process, and transmit over time. Unfortunately, powering such tiny devices for extended periods is a major challenge because miniaturized batteries cannot store sufficient energy and connecting wires to recharge the batteries demands considerable space overhead. Electromagnetically coupling energy to recharge these devices wirelessly is possible, but practical only if power losses are low enough for sufficient energy to reach the batteries. Because small inductors capture little energy, minimizing the power that switches dissipate to energize <b>and</b> <b>de-energize</b> an inductor is critical. This paper presents how transmitted power changes with distance and, as a result, with inductive coupling factor k C, and shows how to use that information to minimize the power lost in the interconnecting MOSFETs. This way, a 0. 18 -�m near-field electromagnetic energy-harnessing IC loses on average (in simulations) 3 �W across k C's ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 1, which roughly represents 3. 9 % of the total power transferred...|$|R

Probably, cooperation between PIMAC and carriers may accomplish metabolite movement across the inner membrane under both energized <b>and</b> <b>de-energized</b> conditions.
