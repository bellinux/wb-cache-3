The key reason for choosing this topic is the author's personal experience with dealing with the issues that arose {{as a result of the}} transfer of rights and obligations pertaining to renting of an apartment of the author's acquaintance, his experience gained during the assistance at the civil proceedings held by district court for Prague 3, the fact that renting is currently an issue of great significance in the Czech law system, and also the increasing number of people living in rented apartments. The thesis comprises ten chapters, each of them considering different aspects of the issues involved. Having provided the background information to the reader in the introductory chapter, the first chapter considers the historical framework of renting apartments.

In this case, the landlord provides housing, while the tenant provides rent payment. Third, the bargain terms must be <b>of</b> value. The <b>apartment</b> is worth what the tenant hands over each month. Therefore, this contract has met its consideration requirement, because it fits all elements of consideration.|$|R

The main focus of the thesis is on the different types of rentals. Prices of profit rentals are determined freely, wich is not the case for the non - profit rentals, where the price of the rental is determined according to the Housing Act. Rents for aparments in Municipality of Ljubljana are analysed in details. Comparison between advertised freely formed rent and non-profit rent is included. Correlations between the crucial elements that influence the particular rental type and the way in wich they interact are presented. The data for the advertised freely formed rentals were gathered from various internet advertising sources and non-profit rentals were gathered from the database of the Housing Fund of the Municipality of Ljubljana. Advertised rental price is mainly influenced by the location <b>of</b> the <b>apartment,</b> its surface area and its age; on the other hand non-profit <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>apartment</b> mainly by it's age and the apartment's surface area.

40|$|Krakow is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} top academic centres in Poland. In the local universities nearly 200 thousand students acquire knowledge. Only a few of them are permanent inhabitants of Krakow. For this reason, also, annually the market <b>of</b> <b>apartments</b> <b>rent</b> in the capital city of Małopolska in the period of holiday observes fluctuations of prices. At the same time students (or their parents) prefer the proximity of the chosen academic centre or the communication accessibility over the standards of the premises. This allows to sustain the prices <b>of</b> <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> <b>apartments</b> in this neighbourhood and constitutes a stable source of income for real estate owners that could not be attractive for the remaining social groups. For the purpose of supplying information concerning the apartments preferred by the students a study was conducted, in which questions were asked to individuals who now or in recent years rented an apartment in Krakow and they are or have been students of the AGH University of Science and Technology. The post was chosen because of the compact structure of educational institutions, proximity attractive zones, and thus expensive, and the ease of obtaining information from respondents as a result of the conducted studies it is possible to consider that among the surveyed most often rent contracts were concluded for apartments with two rooms nearby, or with a good connection to the universities. It was also noticed that the most important factor having impact on the average price for the rent is the location, in the particular urban units of the city of Krakow it differs from the average by a few hundred PLN. Another, relatively obvious criterion determining the height of the rate is the technical condition and furnishing standard <b>of</b> the <b>apartment.</b> The terms on which the <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>apartment</b> is profitable for its owner were verified. Finally, it was noticed that the benefits arising from the <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> the premises to students are disproportionate for different parties. The information obtained by means of the conducted studies and completed analyses is helpful both for people willing, in the future, to take advantage of the benefits from leasing an apartment, as well as for thousands of students who each year are struggling against the fundamental choice of the place where they will spend the nearest months or years.

In addition, according to a cost–benefit analysis based on these estimation results, investment in earthquake–proof structures is profitable for landlords who own older wood–framed apartment buildings in relatively risky areas given the current level of the government subsidy introduced in 2002...|$|R
