The performance and riding comfort of the automobiles are affected due to the vibrating forces.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hysteretic}} {{behavior of}} mechanical components permits efficient passive control of mechanical system vibrations but makes response prediction delicate {{due to their}} high non linearity. In this work, the generalized Dahl model is applied to rubber mounts used to support automotive engine cooling module. The general idea is to define an analytical model for the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount,</b> and to implement it into a global finite element model of the engine cooling module. The work presented illustrates the method on a simplified system. The rubber mounts exhibit a non-linear behavior which depends on preload and frequency. Analytical restoring force models are well adapted to simulate their behavior. An experimental investigation was conducted {{in order to identify}} the model parameters. The model considers: two envelop curves (upper and lower) which can be modeled by polynomial functions, a parameter beta that governs the transition between the compression and extension phases of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount.</b> Based on the load-deflection hysteretic loops measured, an automated procedure was realized to extract the polynomial coefficients of the envelop curves and beta. The calculated coefficients are function of the preload and the excitation frequency. Hence, the behavior of the rubber mounts can predicted versus time. In a second time, the model identified is implemented in a finite element model of a cantilever beam supported by a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> at its free end. The dynamic transient response to a forced excitation is predicted and compared to experimental results...|$|E

40|$|The {{mitigation}} of {{the vibrations}} of components and structures, {{through the use}} of rubber mounts, is a common practice in many industries, such as in automotives and aeronautics or energy. It is a very important issue, because it is a key factor not just for the fatigue life but also for matters of comfort. On the other side, these industries make extensive use of finite element models to predict the dynamic behaviour of structures. Therefore, it means that the non-linear constitutive equations of <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> devices need to be properly integrated into the global analytical model. The quasi-static and dynamic behaviour of these devices can be quite complex, because they are usually done by a steel cover with an elastomer inside. Experimental test campaigns are usually carried forward to characterize the quasi-static and dynamic behaviour in terms of dynamic stiffness and loss factor. The experiments are designed to determine dependency on the frequency, the dynamic amplitude, the temperature and the preload. In this paper an optimization methodology, combining hyper-elasticity, visco-elasticity and elasto-plasticity constitutive equations will be presented to obtain representative elastomeric behaviour, able to fit the experimental data in hand and to predict the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> behaviour in load conditions different from those tested. The numerical results obtained are in very good agreement with the experimental data...|$|E
