60|$|Of {{those three}} {{varieties}} of fore-and-aft rig, the cutter--the racing rig par excellence--is of an appearance the most imposing, {{from the fact}} that practically all her canvas is in one piece. The enormous mainsail of a cutter, as she draws slowly past a point of land or the end of a jetty under your admiring gaze, invests her with an air of lofty and silent majesty. At anchor a schooner looks better; she has an aspect of greater efficiency and a better balance to the eye, with her two masts distributed over the hull with a swaggering <b>rake</b> <b>aft.</b> The yawl rig one comes in time to love. It is, I should think, the easiest of all to manage.|$|E
60|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} the clipper build are, knife-like sharpness of the cut-water and bow, and exceeding correctness of cut in the sails, so that these may be drawn as tight and flat as possible. Too much bulge in a sail is a disadvantage {{in the way of}} sailing. Indeed, flatness is so important a desideratum, that experimentalists have more than once applied sails made of thin planks of wood to their clippers; but we do not know that this {{has turned out to be}} much of an improvement. The masts of all clippers, except those of the sloop or cutter rig, generally <b>rake</b> <b>aft</b> a good deal--that is, they lean backwards; a position which is supposed to tend to increase speed. Merchant vessels are seldom of the clipper build, because the sharpness of this peculiar formation diminishes the available space for cargo very much.|$|E
5000|$|The clipper type {{bow of the}} pinas {{often carried}} a carved figurehead called [...] "Gobel" [...] and the transom stern was <b>raked</b> <b>aft</b> and reached pretty high up above the waterline. The pinas had a well defined sheer and was a {{seaworthy}} vessel.|$|R
5000|$|In naval architecture, a transom is {{the surface}} {{that forms the}} stern of a vessel. Transoms may be flat or curved {{and they may be}} vertical, raked forward, also known as a retroussé or reverse transom, angling forward (toward the bow) from the {{waterline}} to the deck, or <b>raked</b> <b>aft,</b> often simply called [...] "raked", angling in the other direction. The bottom tip of the transom can be approximately on the waterline, in which case the stern of the vessel is referred to as a [...] "transom stern", or the hull can continue so that the centreline is well above the waterline before terminating in a transom, in which case it is referred to as a [...] "counter stern" [...] or [...] "cutaway stern." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{the most}} {{unexpected}} sights assailed us. It {{seemed to me}} as if a miraculous change had taken place on everybody and everything during the night. The ship when she had set sail was as untidy and lumbered about the decks as a merchantman usually is on quitting port. Now everything was clean, in its place, snugly fastened, and in order. The sails appeared to have undergone some modification. I fancied, too, that the masts <b>raked</b> <b>aft</b> a good deal more than they had done, and round the foot of them were ranged muskets, pistols, cutlasses, and boarding-pikes, where masses of cordage and handspikes had been before. The hencoops had vanished, and in their place were rows of brass carronades, while in the centre of the deck an enormous swivel gun occupied the place, on which the long-boat had formerly rested. Even the captain seemed to have changed. His costume was somewhat Eastern in its character, and his whole aspect was much more ferocious than when I first saw him.|$|R
2500|$|The visual unpopularity of Seppings' {{circular}} stern {{was soon}} rectified by Sir William Symonds. In this revised stern, {{a set of}} straight post timbers (also called [...] "whiskers", [...] "horn timbers", or [...] "fan tail timbers") stretches from the keel diagonally aft and upward. It rests {{on the top of}} the sternpost and runs on either side of the rudder post (thus creating the [...] "helm port" [...] through which the rudder passes) to a point well above the vessel's waterline. Whereas the timbers of the transom stern all heeled on the wing transom, the timbers of the elliptical stern all heel on the whiskers, to which they are affixed at a 45̊ angle (i.e., [...] "canted") when viewed from overhead and decrease in length as they are installed aft until the curvature is complete. [...] The finished stern has a continuous curved edge around the outside and is <b>raked</b> <b>aft.</b> Other names for the elliptical stern include a [...] "counter stern," [...] in reference to its very long counter, and a [...] "cutaway stern." [...] The elliptical stern began use during the age of sail, but remained very popular for both merchant and warships well into the nautical age of steam and through the first eight decades of steamship construction (roughly 1840–1920), despite the fact that the design left the rudder exposed and vulnerable in combat situations.|$|R
5000|$|... brogans, {{the open}} {{hull of the}} log canoe was decked, with hatches {{covering}} holds created by subdividing the hull with bulkheads. Brogans typically used the same sail plan as the log canoes of the Tilghman Island region, a leg-of-mutton (i.e., triangular) foresail, mainsail and jib, with the foremast taller than the main. Both masts <b>raked</b> rather sharply <b>aft,</b> with the mainmast raked significantly more sharply than the foremast.1 ...|$|R
60|$|Well {{might he}} exclaim, for there, tied {{up to the}} dock, lay the strangest looking launch I had ever seen. Not {{that it could be}} called a launch, either, but it seemed to {{resemble}} a launch more than any other kind of boat. It was seventy feet long, but so narrow was it, and so bare of superstructure, that it appeared much smaller than it really was. It was built wholly of steel, and was painted black. Three smokestacks, a good distance apart and <b>raking</b> well <b>aft,</b> arose in single file amidships; while the bow, long and lean and sharp as a knife, plainly advertised that the boat was made for speed. Passing under the stern, we read Streak, painted in small white letters.|$|R
50|$|Sailors {{wishing to}} master the Contender must learn how to trapeze and steer the boat at the same time, and how to move about the boat while keeping it level. As part of race tuning, the Contender mast is {{commonly}} <b>raked</b> well <b>aft,</b> which results in restricted space between the boom and deck. Tacking consequently requires technique and practice to avoid getting stuck under the boom. Sailing the boat level at all times (except in very light winds) is fastest and reduces capsizes, which can happen fast if the boom dips into the water. There is a trade-off between raking the mast far aft and keeping the kicker (boom vang) tight at all times (which is faster) and the higher probability of capsizing due to this less forgiving set up. Unlike older and heavier dinghy designs, the Contender requires the centerboard to be lowered at least somewhat to avoid quick capsizes when reaching and running in a breeze.|$|R
40|$|Afterbody and nozzle {{pressures}} {{measured on}} a 1 / 12 -scale model and in flight on a twin-jet fighter aircraft were compared as Mach number varied from 0. 6 to 1. 2, Reynolds number from 17. 5 million to 302. 5 million, and angle of attack from 1 to 7 deg. At Mach 0. 6 and 0. 8, nozzle pressure coefficient distributions and nozzle axial force coefficients agreed and showed good recompression. At Mach 0. 9 and 1. 2, flow complexity caused a loss in recompression for both flight and wind tunnel nozzle data. The flight data exhibited less negative values of pressure coefficient and lower axial force coefficients than did the wind tunnel data. Reynolds number effects were noted only at these Mach numbers. Jet temperature and mass flux ratio {{did not affect the}} comparisons of nozzle axial flow coefficient. At subsonic speeds, the levels of pressure coefficient distributions on the upper fuselage and lower nacelle surfaces for flight were less negative than those for the model. The model boundary layer thickness at the <b>aft</b> <b>rake</b> station exceeded that for the forward rake station and increased with increasing angle of attack. The flight boundary layer thickness at the <b>aft</b> <b>rake</b> station was less than that for the forward rake station and decreased with increasing angle of attack...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the feasibility of using an aerobrake system for manned and unmanned missions to Mars, and to Earth from Mars and lunar orbits. A preliminary thermal protection system (TPS) was examined for five unmanned small nose radius, straight bi-conic vehicles and a scaled up Aeroassist Flight Experiment (AFE) vehicle aerocapturing at Mars. Analyses were also conducted for the scaled up AFE and an unmanned Sample Return Cannister (SRC) returning from Mars and aerocapturing into Earth orbit. Also analyzed were three different classes of lunar transfer vehicles (LTV's) : an expendable scaled up modified Apollo Command Module (CM), a <b>raked</b> cone (modified <b>AFT),</b> and three large nose radius domed cylinders. The LTV's {{would be used to}} transport personnel and supplies between Earth and the moon in order to establish a manned base on the lunar surface. The TPS for all vehicles analyzed is shown to have an advantage over an all-propulsive velocity reduction for orbit insertion. Results indicate that TPS weight penalties of less than 28 percent can be achieved using current material technology, and slightly less than the most favorable LTV using advanced material technology...|$|R
6000|$|... "Avast there! fond as I am of salt water, I don't {{like this}} kind," [...] cried the breezy {{voice of the}} fourth spirit, who had a tiny ship instead of a tassel on his cap, and who wiped his wet eyes with {{the sleeve of his}} rough blue cloak. [...] "It won't take me long to spin my yarn; for things are pretty taut and ship-shape aboard our craft. Captain Taylor is an {{experienced}} sailor, and has brought many a ship safely into port in spite of wind and tide, and the devil's own whirlpools and hurricanes. If you want to see earnestness come aboard some Sunday when the Captain's on the quarter-deck, and take an observation. No danger of falling asleep there, no more than there is up aloft, 'when the stormy winds do blow.' Consciences get <b>raked</b> fore and <b>aft,</b> sins are blown clean out of the water, false colors are hauled down and true ones run up to the masthead, and many an immortal soul is warned to steer off in time from the pirates, rocks and quicksands of temptation. He's a regular revolving light, is the Captain,--a beacon always burning and saying plainly, 'Here are life-boats, ready to put off in all weathers and bring the shipwrecked into quiet waters.' He comes but seldom now, being laid up in the home dock, tranquilly waiting till his turn comes to go out with the tide and safely ride at anchor in the great harbor of the Lord. Our crew varies a good deal. Some of 'em have rather rough voyages, and come into port pretty well battered; land-sharks fall foul of a good many, and do a deal of damage; but most of 'em carry brave and tender hearts under the blue jackets, for their rough nurse, the sea, manages to keep something of the child alive in the grayest old tar that makes the world his picture-book. We try to supply 'em with life-preservers while at sea, and make 'em feel sure of a hearty welcome when ashore, and I believe the year '67 will sail away into eternity with a satisfactory cargo. Brother North-End made me pipe my eye; so I'll make him laugh to pay for it, by telling a clerical joke I heard the other day. Bellows didn't make it, though he might have done so, as he's a connection of ours, and knows how to use his tongue as well as any of us. Speaking of the bells of a certain town, a reverend gentleman affirmed that each bell uttered an appropriate remark so plainly, that the words were audible to all. The Baptist bell cried, briskly, 'Come up and be dipped! come up and be dipped!' The Episcopal bell slowly said, 'Apos-tol-ic suc-cess-ion! apos-tol-ic suc-cess-ion!' The Orthodox bell solemnly pronounced, 'Eternal damnation! eternal damnation!' and the Methodist shouted, invitingly, 'Room for all! room for all!'" ...|$|R
