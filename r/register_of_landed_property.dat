As indicated in the reference books, it constitutes an institution of law, which in the social perception is seen as providing legal order in the scope of establishing the range of laws, of the sense of security resulting from the fact of the entering of the subjects of taxation and the possibility to exert one’s rights under the registration proceedings. However, the current shape <b>of</b> the <b>register</b> does not meet social expectations.

40|$|Real {{estate is}} defined as ground, which is divided into property. Ground means {{every part of the}} surface, which is {{situated}} within the country. There is no legal definition of property to be found. Property is usually explained as every unit, which legally should be registered in the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>landed</b> <b>properties.</b> To constitute a property the property must permanently be suited for its purpose. Property subdivision has up to now been made by a lateral demarcation on the ground level. A precise vertical demarcation of property has hitherto not been found. A government bill has recommended that properties could also be divided vertically, so called three-dimensional property subdivision. The purpose of three-dimensional property subdivision is to create the opportunity of, for instance, house-building on already existing commercial premises. To properties belong certain belongings, which is called fixtures. It could be buildings, pipes etc. Due to the establishment of three-dimensional property subdivision the need to use the adjoining property fixtures will be more apparent. In the government bill it is suggested that for instance fixtures to buildings should belong to the property where the fixture is. Thus there can be situations where a fixture stretches through a number of properties, which imply that a property, {{to a greater extent than}} by traditional property subdivision, is obliged to use an adjoining property. To relieve some problems those occur due to three-dimensional property subdivision the use of easement or jointly-owned facilities could be useful. These two trouble-shooters´ advantages and disadvantages are analysed in the theses. The result is that jointly-owned facilities is the best solution to the problem...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the role <b>of</b> formalization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>property</b> {{rights in the}} war against illicit crops in Colombia. We argue that {{as a consequence of the}} increase of state presence and visibility during the period of 2000 and 2009, municipalities with a higher level of formalization <b>of</b> their <b>land</b> <b>property</b> rights saw a greater reduction in the area allocated to illicit crops. We hypothesize that this is due to the increased cost of growing illicit crops on formal land compared to informal, and due to the possibility of obtaining more benefits in the newly in- stalled institutional environment when land is formalized. We exploit the variation in the level <b>of</b> formalization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>property</b> rights in a set of municipalities that had their first cadastral census collected in the period of 1994 - 2000; this selection procedure guarantees reliable data and an unbiased source of variation. Using fixed effects estimators, we found a significant negative relationship between the level <b>of</b> formalization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>property</b> rights and the number of hectares allocated to coca crops per municipality. These results remain robust through a number of sensitivity analyses. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the positive effects <b>of</b> formal <b>land</b> <b>property</b> rights, and effective policies in the war on drugs in Colombia. <b>Land</b> <b>property</b> rights; Coca crops; War on drugs...|$|R
