25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver)</b> that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
500|$|... "Glowbugs" [...] are {{a related}} aspect of vintage radio and harken {{back to the}} early days of amateur radio, when the {{majority}} of hams hand-crafted their own equipment. Smaller in size than [...] "boat anchors", [...] "glowbug" [...] is a term used by US amateurs to describe a simple home-made tube-type radio set, reminiscent of the shortwave radio-building craze of the 1920s and 1930s. [...] "Glow" [...] refers to the glow of the vacuum tubes and [...] "bug" [...] to the gear's relatively diminutive size. The Doerle <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver</b> and Hartley transmitter circuits are considered [...] "classic" [...] glowbug designs. Generally, any small, home-built tube-type transmitter or receiver may be referred to as a glowbug. The majority of glowbug transmitters are designed {{to be used in the}} CW radiotelegraphy mode.|$|E
2500|$|It {{had been}} noticed {{that when a}} <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver</b> went into oscillation, other nearby {{receivers}} would suddenly start picking up stations on frequencies different from the stations' transmission frequency. Armstrong (and others) eventually deduced that this {{was caused by a}} [...] "supersonic heterodyne" [...] between the station's carrier frequency and the regenerative receiver's oscillation frequency. Thus if a station was transmitting on 300kHz and the oscillating receiver was set to 400kHz, the station would be heard not only at the original 300kHz, but also at 100kHz and 700kHz.|$|E
50|$|Other {{shortcomings}} of <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers</b> are {{the presence of}} a characteristic noise (“mush”) in their audio output, and sensitive and unstable tuning. These problems have the same cause: a <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver’s</b> gain is greatest when it operates on the verge of oscillation, and in that condition, the circuit behaves chaotically. Simple <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers</b> lack an RF amplifier between the antenna and the regenerative detectors, so any change with the antenna swaying in the wind, etc. can change the frequency of the detector.|$|R

5000|$|In World War II the {{regenerative}} circuit {{was used}} in some military equipment. An example is the German field radio [...] "Torn.E.b". <b>Regenerative</b> <b>receivers</b> needed far fewer tubes and less power consumption for nearly equivalent performance.|$|R
5000|$|The WD-11 vacuum tube, a triode, was {{introduced}} by the Westinghouse Electric corporation in 1922 for their Aeriola RF model radio and found use in other contemporary <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers</b> (used as a detector-amplifier) including the Regenoflex and Radiola series.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore {{other methods}} {{may be used}} to {{increase}} selectivity, such as Q multiplier circuits and <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers.</b> Superheterodyne receivers allow use one or more fixed intermediate frequency tuned circuits for selectivity. Fixed tuning eliminates the requirement that multiple tuning stages accurately match while being adjusted.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{regenerative}} grid-leak detector {{was one of}} {{the more}} sensitive detectors of its day, its ability to radiate radio frequency energy when improperly adjusted limited its use in urban settings where multiple receivers would be operated in close proximity. The RCA Radiola III and IIIa and the Crosley Model 51 are examples of <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers</b> from this period.|$|R
5000|$|Reaction sets, {{also known}} as <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers,</b> rely on {{positive}} feedback to achieve adequate gain. This approach provided high performance with a minimum number of expensive vacuum tubes, but these receivers tended to radiate RF interference in their immediate vicinity.

5000|$|Self-oscillation {{reduced the}} quality of its {{reception}} of an AM (voice) radio signal but made it useful as a CW (Morse code) receiver. The beat signal between the oscillation and the radio signal would produce an audio [...] "beeping" [...] sound. The oscillation of the <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver</b> could also be a source of local interference. An improved design known as the super-regenerative receiver improved the performance by allowing an oscillation to build up which was then [...] "quenched", with that cycle repeating at a rapid (ultrasonic) rate. From the accompanying schematic for a practical <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver,</b> one can appreciate its simplicity in relation to a multi-stage TRF receiver, while able to achieve the same level of amplification through the use of positive feedback.|$|E
50|$|The core {{material}} increases the inductance dramatically, thereby raising its Q factor. The cores of such transformers help improve {{performance at the}} lower frequency end of the band. RF transformers sometimes used a third coil (called a tickler winding) to inject feedback into an earlier (detector) stage in antique <b>regenerative</b> radio <b>receivers.</b>|$|R

This model allows us to optimize these elements and to determine their impact on the overall performance of a magnetocaloric device. We present here a finite-difference model of AMRR cycles for a sub-unit of MCM crossed by micro-channels of fluid connected to cold and hot <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers.</b> Thus, the calculation of the output parameters such as the temperature span, and thermal power passing from the cold receiver to the hot receiver has been performed. The influence of the geometry of the MCM and the fluid flow were investigated over the working domain highlighting the current technological achievements and indicating possible improvements...|$|R

50|$|The reflex {{receiver}} {{should not be}} confused with a <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver,</b> in which the same signal is fed back from the output of the amplifier to its input. In the reflex circuit there are two separate signals at different frequencies passing through the amplifier at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1920s, an {{advantage}} of the TRF receiver over the <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver</b> was that, when properly adjusted, it did not radiate interference. [...] The popular <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver,</b> in particular, used a tube with positive feedback operated very close to its oscillation point, so it often acted as a transmitter, emitting a signal at a frequency near {{the frequency of the}} station it was tuned to. [...] This produced audible heterodynes, shrieks and howls, in other nearby receivers tuned to the same frequency, bringing criticism from neighbors. [...] In an urban setting, when several regenerative sets in the same block or apartment house were tuned to a popular station, it could be virtually impossible to hear. [...] Britain, and eventually the US, passed regulations that prohibited receivers from radiating spurious signals, which favored the TRF.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} incorporated, in 1914, as the [...] "National Toy Company", but by 1916 had {{included}} household appliances in their product range. This expansion {{led to the}} name change to the [...] "National Company, Inc.". By 1923 the product line included toys, food mixers, and radio components. Radio components were {{to play an important}} part in the company's growth in the mid-1920s as they moved into the large scale manufacture of capacitors. It was at this time that two engineers from Harvard University, Fred H. Drake and Glen Browning, approached National to manufacture components to their specifications for a radio receiver of their own design. This relationship led to the production and sale of the [...] "National Regenaformer" [...] kit for home construction of the Browning-Drake design. The set was capable of tuning the standard AM broadcast band only and could not achieve shortwave reception. By the early 1930s National had established a reputation with the amateur radio community based upon their line of <b>regenerative</b> <b>receivers,</b> including the SW-3 and SW-5.|$|R
5000|$|Pancake or [...] "honeycomb" [...] coil vario-couplers {{were used}} in the 1920s in the common Armstrong or [...] "tickler" [...] <b>regenerative</b> radio <b>receivers.</b> One coil was {{connected}} to the detector tube's grid circuit. The other coil, the [...] "tickler" [...] coil was connected to the tube's plate (output) circuit. It fed back some of the signal from the plate circuit into the input again, and this positive feedback increased the tube's gain and selectivity.|$|R
5000|$|This circuit {{was widely}} used in the <b>regenerative</b> radio <b>receiver,</b> popular until the 1940s. In that application, the input radio {{frequency}} signal from the antenna is magnetically coupled into the tank circuit by an additional winding, and the feedback is reduced with an adjustable gain control in the feedback loop, so the circuit is just short of oscillation. The result is a narrow-band radio-frequency filter and amplifier. The non-linear characteristic of the transistor or tube also demodulated the RF signal to produce the audio signal.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1930s, the {{superheterodyne}} design {{began to}} gradually supplant the <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver,</b> as tubes became far less expensive. In Germany the design was still {{used in the}} millions of mass-produced German [...] "peoples receivers" [...] (Volksempfänger) and [...] "German small receivers" [...] (DKE, Deutscher Kleinempfänger). Even after WWII, the regenerative design was still present in early after-war German minimal designs {{along the lines of}} the [...] "peoples receivers" [...] and [...] "small receivers", dictated by lack of materials. Frequently German military tubes like the [...] "RV12P2000" [...] were employed in such designs. There were even superheterodyne designs, which used the <b>regenerative</b> <b>receiver</b> as a combined IF and demodulator with fixed regeneration. The superregenerative design was also present in early FM broadcast receivers around 1950. Later it was almost completely phased out of mass production, remaining only in hobby kits, and some special applications, like gate openers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first person}} to exploit {{negative}} resistance diodes practically was Russian radio researcher Oleg Losev, who in 1922 discovered negative differential resistance in biased zincite (zinc oxide) point contact junctions. He used these to build solid-state amplifiers, oscillators, and amplifying and <b>regenerative</b> radio <b>receivers,</b> 25 years before {{the invention of the}} transistor. Later he even built a superheterodyne receiver. However his achievements were overlooked because of the success of vacuum tube technology. After ten years he abandoned research into this technology (dubbed [...] "Crystodyne" [...] by Hugo Gernsback), and it was forgotten.|$|R
