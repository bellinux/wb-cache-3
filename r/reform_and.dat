40|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} routes {{for the production of}} hydrogen or syngas for use in fuel cell applications is the <b>reforming</b> <b>and</b> partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. The use of hydrocarbons in high temperature fuel cells is achieved through either external or internal <b>reforming.</b> <b>Reforming</b> <b>and</b> partial oxidation catalysis to convert hydrocarbons to hydrogen rich syngas {{plays an important role in}} fuel processing technology. The current research in the area of <b>reforming</b> <b>and</b> partial oxidation of methane, methanol and ethanol includes catalysts for <b>reforming</b> <b>and</b> oxidation, methods of catalyst synthesis, and the effective utilization of fuel for both external <b>and</b> internal <b>reforming</b> processes. In this paper the recent progress in these areas of research is reviewed along with the reforming of liquid hydrocarbons, from this an overview of the current best performing catalysts for the <b>reforming</b> <b>and</b> partial oxidizing of hydrocarbons for hydrogen production is summarized...|$|R

5|$|During the West Virginia Democratic Party Senatorial Convention held at Moorefield in August 1886, White {{proposed}} and advocated the first tariff <b>reform</b> <b>and</b> anti-monopoly resolutions ever passed and {{adopted by a}} West Virginia Democratic Party Convention. Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition.

White had been among the first Democratic Party members in Hampshire County to openly declare his opposition to the fiscal policies of the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. Under White's leadership, Hampshire County's Democratic delegation was the first Democratic county organization in West Virginia to hold public meetings in opposition to Cleveland's fiscal policies. As the county executive committee chairman, White was the first Democrat in Hampshire County to deliver a public speech denouncing these policies.
