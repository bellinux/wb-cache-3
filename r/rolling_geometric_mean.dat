40|$|INTRODUCTION: The intravaginal {{ejaculation}} {{latency time}} (IELT) behaves in a skewed manner and needs the appropriate statistics for correct interpretation of treatment results. AIMS: To explain the rightful use of geometrical mean IELT {{values and the}} fold increase of the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IELT because of the positively skewed IELT distribution. METHODS: Linking theoretical arguments to the outcome of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and modern antidepressant study results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IELT and fold increase of geometrical mean IELT. RESULTS: Log-transforming each separate IELT measurement of each individual man {{is the basis for}} the calculation of the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IELT. A drug-induced positively skewed IELT distribution necessitates the calculation of the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IELTs at baseline and during drug treatment. In a positively skewed IELT distribution, the use of the "arithmetic" mean IELT risks an overestimation of the drug-induced ejaculation delay as the mean IELT is always higher than the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IELT. Strong ejaculation-delaying drugs give rise to a strong positively skewed IELT distribution, whereas weak ejaculation-delaying drugs give rise to (much) less skewed IELT distributions. Ejaculation delay is expressed in fold increase of the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IELT. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-induced ejaculatory performance discloses a positively skewed IELT distribution, requiring the use of the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IELT and the fold increase of the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> IEL...|$|R

Herds with 15 to 26 tests (frequently monthly) from January 2009 through October 2010 were included. Somatic cell scores (SCS) from 14, 854 herds and 164, 794 herd-tests were analyzed for DHI herds with ≥ 10 cows for all tests. Herd test-day SCC was derived {{as a proxy for}} BTSCC and was the basis for determining noncompliance and percentage of the milk it represented. For FMO herds, actual milk marketed and BTSCC were available from 27, 759 herds and 325, 690 herd-tests. A herd was noncompliant for the current EU BTSCC standard after 4 consecutive <b>rolling</b> 3 -test <b>geometric</b> <b>means</b> (<b>geometric</b> method) were > 400, 000 cells/mL. A herd was noncompliant for the current US BTSCC standard after 3 of 5 consecutive monthly BTSCC shipments (frequency method) were > 750, 000 cells/mL. Alternative proposed standards (600, 000, 500, 000, or 400, 000 cells/mL) also were examined. A third method designated noncompliance when a single 3 -mo <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> of > 550, 000 or > 400, 000 cells/mL and a subsequent test exceeded the same level. Results were examined based on herd size or milk shipped by month. Noncompliance for the current US standard for the 12 mo ending October 2010 in DHI and FMO herds was 0. 9 and 1. 0 %, respectively, compared with 7. 8 and 16. 1 % for the current EU standard. Noncompliance was always greater for the frequency method than for the geometric method and was inversely related to herd size or milk shipped. Using the frequency method at 400, 000 cells/mL, noncompliance was 19. 1 % for DHI herd-tests in herds with 9, 000 t. All methods proposed increased the percentages of herds and shipped milk that exceeded the regulatory limit. Producers will need to place more emphasis on reducing the incidence and prevalence of subclinical mastitis through known management practices such as proper milking techniques, well-functioning milking machines, postmilking teat disinfectant, dry cow treatment, and culling of problem cows to meet any of the proposed new standards...|$|R
