40|$|A newly {{designed}} UV spectrometer {{will replace the}} current 351 nm, full aperture backscatter (FABS) spectrometer that {{is used in the}} OMEGA laser system. The FABS spectrometer has a time resolution of 270 ps. The new spectrometer will improve the temporal resolution to 10 ps, while maintaining signal throughput by superimposing 27 separate spectra onto the detector. This is accomplished by placing a 27 -element <b>roof</b> <b>mirror</b> array between two identical diffraction gratings operating at opposite orders. The retro-reflecting property of the <b>roof</b> <b>mirror</b> array breaks the 270 ps pulse front tilt into 27 10 ps pulse front tilts. FRED, an optical design program, was used to model the spectrometer. Image rotation, pulse front tilt, and images from other grating orders were analyzed. It was found that image rotation can be corrected by rotating the input slit. The separation between the <b>roof</b> <b>mirror</b> array and the gratings was chosen to prevent images from other grating orders from reaching the detector. The pulse front tilt analysis demonstrates that the spectrometer will achieve the desired 10 ps time resolution...|$|E

The basic idea of the shield design is to shape the surfaces as <b>roof</b> <b>mirrors</b> to redirect the stray radiation {{in the opposite direction}} of incidence. The baffles are used to stop radiation close to the field of view. In this way we are able to avoid most of the unwanted radiation.

50|$|In {{binoculars}} with Schmidt-Pechan <b>roof</b> prisms, <b>mirror</b> coatings {{are added}} to some surfaces of the roof prism because the light is incident {{at one of the}} prism's glass-air boundaries at an angle less than the critical angle so total internal reflection does not occur. Without a mirror coating most of that light would be lost. Schmidt-Pechan <b>roof</b> prism aluminum <b>mirror</b> coating (reflectivity of 87% to 93%) or silver mirror coating (reflectivity of 95% to 98%) is used.|$|R

50|$|The John T. Cyphers House is a small, one-story cottage {{with a lower}} wing {{projecting}} from the rear.

Directly above the windows are two dormers {{projecting from}} the <b>roof,</b> <b>mirrored</b> by another two dormers facing the rear. The house is largely plain, but there are Gothic Revival decorations in an arch above the door, arched windows on the gable ends, and rusticated wooden trim. Much of this trim is covered up by modern roofing material, and the carved bargeboards are gone. A 20th-century owner recoated the outer walls to prevent spalling of the original grout.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{the effect of}} tilt of the <b>roof</b> <b>mirrors</b> in a double pendulum Martin-Puplett Polarizing Interferometer (MPI), focusing on the polarization of the interfering beams. In principle, the tilt affects the efficiency and polarimetric properties of the interferometer. The case of a moderate resolution spectrometer is analysed in detail. Using the Stokes formalism we recover the analytical expressions for the orientation angle and the ellipticity of the beam reflected from a metallic surface, and we compute these quantities for the roof-mirror of a MPI. We find that the polarization rotation and depolarization are small. Using the Jones formalism we propagate their effect on the measured interferogram and spectrum, and demonstrate that the performance degradation is small compared to other systematic effects.

5000|$|One of {{the first}} keyhole-shaped kofun {{was built in the}} [...] area, the southeastern part of the Nara Basin. Hashihaka Kofun, which was built {{in the middle of the}} 3rd century AD, is 280 meters long and 30 meters high. Its scale is {{obviously}} different from previous Yayoi tombs. During the next three decades, about 10 kofun were built in the area, which are now called as the Makimuku Kofun Group. A wooden coffin was placed on the bottom of a shaft, and the surrounding walls were built up by flat stones. Finally, megalithic stones formed the <b>roof.</b> Bronze <b>mirrors,</b> iron swords, magatama, clay vessels and other artifacts were found in good condition in undisturbed tombs. Some scholars assume the buried person of Hashihaka kofun was the shadowy ancient Queen Himiko of Yamataikoku, mentioned in the Chinese historical texts. According to the books, Japan was called Wa, which was the confederation of numerous small tribes or countries. The construction of gigantic kofun is the result of the relatively centralized governmental structure in the Nara Basin, possibly the origin of the Yamato polity and the Imperial lineage of Japan.|$|R
