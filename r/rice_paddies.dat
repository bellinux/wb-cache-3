5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
5|$|Some {{grasshopper}} species, {{like the}} Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in <b>rice</b> <b>paddies.</b> Ploughing exposes the eggs {{on the surface}} of the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.|$|E
5|$|Sarus cranes {{preferentially}} use wetlands or uncultivated patches amid flooded <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> (locally called khet-taavadi) for nesting in India. Breeding pairs are territorial and {{prefer to}} forage in natural wetlands, though wet crops like rice and wheat are also frequented. In south-western Uttar Pradesh, sarus cranes {{were found in}} wetlands of all sizes with larger number in larger wetlands.|$|E

40|$|Cicindela (Calochroa) whithilli (Hope) and Cicindela (Calochroa) flavomaculata Hope (Cicindelidae: Coleoptera) are {{seasonally}} dominant predatory {{insects in}} the cultivated, and irrigated <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> {{fields of the}} South Indian peninsula. While studying the feeding ecology of these tiger beetles in <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> agro-ecosystems in Sringeri area of the central Western Ghats, we examined their potential as biocontrols on the major <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> pest populations available in this region. Earthworms and tadpoles were significant prey organisms during the early cultivation period, while other traditional prey organisms like ants and spiders (mainly wolf and jumping spiders) were more common as prey organisms toward the mid-season. The {{results showed that the}} feeding fauna of tiger beetles can extend to prey items beyond arthropods, to include vertebrates. Cicindela (Calochroa) duponti Dejean is another common species that occurs abundantly in the Areca orchards and on the bunds that separate <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> fields from adjacent uncultivated lands. We performed laboratory tests to determine the feeding guild of these beetles, and to investigate their possible role as a predator of the <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> pests. Although preliminary in nature, the results suggest that both C. whithilli and C. flavomaculata are ineffective as biocontrol agents of <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> agro-ecosystems. They appear to have only a marginal impact on the larvae of Leptocorisa acuta, a major insect pest of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> but further experimental and observational studies are needed to firmly establish the significance of this observation...|$|R
5|$|Although it can {{be found}} in {{elevations}} up to about , it is far more commonly found in humid lowland areas, and most often observed in subtropical, marshy regions of its range. It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, <b>rice</b> <b>paddies,</b> and ditches. It may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas. It is able to survive in other habitats also.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the <b>rice</b> <b>paddies.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} and associated weather brought widespread rain {{to much of}} south and central India, with heavy rain falling in some locations.

5|$|It {{is a white}} bird {{adorned with}} buff plumes in the {{breeding}} season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and <b>rice</b> <b>paddies.</b> They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal.|$|E
5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and {{tamarisk}} scrub {{and tall}} grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} brought intense monsoon {{conditions to}} Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha during its life. Over 210mm (8inches) {{of rain and}} winds of 85km/h (50mph) were recorded in Paradip as the depression made landfall on June 30. Inland, the heavy rains caused some rivers in Orissa to overflow and flooded <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> in Cuttack District. Further west, the Wainganga River overflowed its banks in places. Road transport in Madhya Pradesh was disrupted and there was damage to crops in the Raipur area. Raipur recorded the highest 24-hour rains associated with the depression, with 230mm (9inches) falling there on July 2.|$|E

Seven microsites of a Japanese <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> field were the focus of the study: floodwater, surface soil, bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, root, basal stem of rice plant, and rice stumps of previous harvest. Based on pmoA gene analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), four type I, and nine type II MOB isolates were obtained from the highest dilution series of enrichment cultures. The type I MOB isolates included a novel species in the genus Methylomonas from floodwater {{and this is the first}} type I MOB strain isolated from floodwater of a <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> field. In the type I MOB, two isolates from stumps were closely related to Methylomonas spp.; one isolate obtained from rhizosphere soil was most related to Methyloccocus-Methylocaldum-Methylogaea clade. Almost all the type II MOB isolates were related to Methylocystis methanotrophs. FISH confirmed the presence of both types I and II MOB in all the microsites and in the related enrichment cultures. The study reported, for the first time, the {{diversity of}} cultivable methanotrophs including a novel species of type I MOB in <b>rice</b> <b>paddy</b> field compartments.
