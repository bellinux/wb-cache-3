25|$|After {{arriving}} in Peking, Phillips was immersed in Chinese lessons. Phillips worked under Dr. Aspland, another medical missionary, who {{put her in}} control of the women and children outpatients and the women's ward at the dispensary. Phillips stayed in Peking for six months to gain experience, working with Dr. Aspland as well as visiting multiple other mission hospitals in the area. During her time in Peking, Phillips developed an acute case of Tuberculosis and was advised by Dr. Aspland to leave Peking and go to the country for fresh air. Over the six weeks spent at the mission <b>rest-house,</b> Phillips idealistic view of mission work became slightly tarnished by the lack of friendliness displayed by her coworkers in Peking.|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} five days of that journey I saw little of Quilla, but at length one night {{we were forced to}} camp at a kind of <b>rest-house</b> upon the top of a high {{mountain}} pass, where it was very cold, for the deep snow lay all about. At this place, as here were no Curacas to trouble me, I went out alone when Kari was elsewhere, and climbed a certain peak which was not far from the <b>rest-house,</b> that thence I might see the sunset and think in quiet.|$|E
50|$|Purmandal Temple, {{dedicated}} to Parvati, {{is built on}} {{the west bank of the}} river. A number of other temples are {{dedicated to}} Shiva. There is a large haveli (mansion) dating from about 1830, in good condition, and several dharamshalas (<b>rest-houses</b> for pilgrims), mostly severely deteriorated. Many of these structures are decorated with murals dating from between 1813 and 1898.|$|R

However, they had to fetch and eat it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The town is {{situated}} on the confluence of two mini nallahs, Mahlwani and Mahl, which flow all the year round. The locally recognized [...] "Haji Peer Pass" [...] is about 32 kilometres from Bagh City. In 2011-2012, the population was 87,523. Middle-standard hotels and forest <b>rest-houses</b> are available for visitors, and basic necessities {{are available in the}} Bagh bazaars.|$|R

60|$|We {{went down}} to tea at the <b>rest-house,</b> where Stanley stuffed himself with {{sardines}} and raspberry jam, and beer, and cold mutton and pickles, when Garm wasn't climbing over him; and then Vixen and I went on.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{her mind}} was set upon it, and I didn't interfere. She would be away all night, she said. There was a <b>rest-house</b> for pilgrims {{attached}} to the chapel, {{and she would be}} back again at Maisonette (our bungalow) the morning after.|$|E
50|$|Waghorn's {{business}} plan began to flourish. He {{set up an}} agency in Cornhill, London, for conveying post—and passengers—to India via Egypt. Between 1835 and 1837, he lived among Arabs in the desert and laid the foundations for the overland route across the desert from Cairo to Suez. This involved building <b>rest-houses</b> and supplying guides, boats, horses and carriages for travellers.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to construction of defensive walls and {{completion of the}} Great Ziggurat of Ur, Shulgi {{spent a great deal}} of time and resources in expanding, maintaining, and generally improving roads. He built <b>rest-houses</b> along roads, so that travelers could find a place to rest and drink fresh water or spend a night. For this last feat, Samuel Noah Kramer calls him the builder of the first inn.|$|R
50|$|Ell is most {{remembered for}} his strong {{interest}} in recreation and conservation. From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed {{for the creation of}} a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of <b>rest-houses</b> to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these <b>rest-houses,</b> designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: the Sign of the Bellbird, Sign of the Kiwi, and Sign of the Packhorse. The last, and grandest, the Sign of the Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed to blend in with the landscape. The Sign of the Kiwi and Sign of the Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while the Sign of the Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks. The Sign of the Packhorse is managed by the Department of Conservation and used as a hut by trampers.|$|R
60|$|So I {{went and}} was {{conducted}} by Billali, the old chamberlain, for such seemed to be his office, who had been waiting patiently without all this while, back to our <b>rest-house.</b> On my way I picked up Hans, whom I found sitting outside the arch, and found that as usual that worthy had been keeping his eyes and ears open.|$|E
60|$|Reflecting thus I went {{to sleep}} and did not wake until the sun was setting. Finding that Hans was also {{sleeping}} at my feet just like a faithful dog, I woke him up and we went back together to the <b>rest-house,</b> which we reached as the darkness fell with extraordinary swiftness, {{as it does in}} those latitudes, especially in a place surrounded by cliffs.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly Kadir Buksh said, {{over his}} shoulder: [...] "Here is Solon"; and Garm snored where he lay {{with his head}} on my knee. Solon is an {{unpleasant}} little cantonment, but it {{has the advantage of}} being cool and healthy. It is all bare and windy, and one generally stops at a <b>rest-house</b> nearby for something to eat. I got out and took both dogs with me, while Kadir Buksh made tea. A soldier told, us we should find Stanley [...] "out there," [...] nodding his head towards a bare, bleak hill.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, I {{was once}} a famed teller of stories when I was begging on the road between Koshin and Etra; before the last pilgrimage that ever I took to Orissa. I told many tales and heard many more at the <b>rest-houses</b> in the evening when we were merry {{at the end of}} the march. It is in my heart that grown men are but as little {{children}} in the matter of tales, and the oldest tale is the most beloved.' ...|$|R
50|$|Being {{located on}} a very {{important}} trade route between the Levant and Northern Caucasus, the region was home to many <b>rest-houses</b> and caravanserais for the merchants and their caravans. In the 1780s, during the Persian rule, the village of Karavansara was founded. In 1801, the area of Ijevan along with Lori Province and the Georgian territories {{became part of the}} Russian Empire. During the rule of Paul I, approximately 6000 Armenian families from Karabakh were allowed to move to the valley of Aghstev river and occupy the region around Karavansara village.|$|R
5000|$|Along roads I {{have had}} banyan trees planted {{so that they}} can give shade to animals and men, and I have had mango groves planted. At {{intervals}} of eight krosas, I have had wells dug, <b>rest-houses</b> built, and in various places, I have had watering-places made for the use of animals and men. But these are but minor achievements. Such things to make the people happy have been done by former kings. I have done these things for this purpose, that the people might practice the Dhamma. Pilar Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika) ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{we came to}} the <b>rest-house</b> where I {{found that}} Robertson had already eaten his midday meal and like the Amahagger gone to sleep, while {{apparently}} Umslopogaas had done the same; at least I saw nothing of him. Of this I was glad, since that wondrous Ayesha seemed to draw vitality out of me and after my long talk with her I felt very tired. So I too ate and then went to lie down under an old wall in the shade at a little distance, and to reflect upon the marvellous things that I had heard.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But what folly is theirs!' said Gobind, {{throwing}} out his knotted hand. 'A tale that is told {{is a true}} tale {{as long as the}} telling lasts. And of their talk upon it--you know how Bilas Khan, that was the prince of tale-tellers, said to one who mocked him in the great <b>rest-house</b> on the Jhelum road: [...] "Go on, my brother, and finish that I have begun," [...] and he who mocked took up the tale, but having neither voice nor manner for the task came to a standstill, and the pilgrims at supper made him eat abuse and stick half that night.' ...|$|E

"Leo, I {{yearned to}} look upon thee and {{to be certain that}} thy heart had not changed, {{although}} until the alloted time thou mightest not hear my voice or see my face who wert doomed to undergo that sore trial of thy faith. Of Holly also I desired to learn whether his wisdom could pierce through my disguise, and how near he stood to truth. It was for this reason that I suffered him to see me draw the lock from the satchel on thy breast and to hear me wail over thee yonder in the <b>Rest-house.</b> Well he did not guess so ill, but thou, thou knewest me--in thy sleep--knewest me as I am, and not as I seemed to be, yes," [...] she added softly, [...] "and didst say certain sweet words which I remember well." ...|$|E
50|$|When Anathapindika had {{finished}} his business at Rājagaha {{he set out}} towards Sāvatthi, giving orders {{along the way to}} his friends and acquaintances to prepare dwellings, parks, <b>rest-houses</b> and gifts all along the road to Sāvatthi in preparation for the Buddha's visit. He had many friends and acquaintances and he was Ādeyyavaco (his word was held to be of weight), loc. cit., p. 158. But see J. i.92, where it is said that Anāthapindika bore all the expenses of these preparations. Vihāras were built costing l,000 pieces each, a yojana apart from each other.|$|R
5000|$|Verse 24 {{continues}} to applaud Ayushchandra. According to K. V. Ramesh, it states Ayushchandra [...] "was of good conduct and abhorred strife". Kishore Kunal translates this part {{to state that}} Ayushchandra [...] "pacified dissension through his righteous conduct". The verse states that the city of Ayodhya was home to [...] "towering abodes, intellectuals and temples". It further states that during while residing at Ayodhya, Ayushchandra constructed [...] "thousands of wells, tanks, <b>rest-houses</b> and ponds" [...] in Saketa-mandala (the province of Ayodhya). According to Kishore Kunal, this verse proves that Ayodhya had [...] "many grand temples" [...] before the Muslim conquest.|$|R
50|$|We know of Firuz Shah Tughlaq in part {{through his}} 32-page autobiography, titled Futuhat-e-firozshahi.. He was 45 when he became Sultan of Delhi in 1351. He ruled until 1388. At his succession, {{after the death of}} Muhammad Tughlaq, he faced many rebellions, {{including}} in Bengal, Gujarat and Warangal. Nonetheless he worked to improve the infrastructure of the empire building canals, <b>rest-houses</b> and hospitals, creating and refurbishing reservoirs and digging wells. He founded several cities around Delhi, including Jaunpur, Ferozpur, Hissar, Firuzabad, Fatehabad. Most of Firozabad was destroyed as subsequent rulers dismantled its buildings and reused the spolia as building materials, and the rest was subsumed as New Delhi grew.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was very}} late before I arrived at Pacheem bungalow, the most sinister-looking <b>rest-house</b> I ever saw, {{stuck on a}} little cleared spur of the mountain, {{surrounded}} by dark forests, overhanging a profound valley, and enveloped in mists and rain, and hideous in architecture, being a miserable attempt to unite the Swiss cottage with the suburban gothic; it combined a maximum of discomfort {{with a minimum of}} good looks or good cheer. I was some time in finding the dirty housekeeper, in an outhouse hard by, and then in waking him. As he led me up the crazy verandah, and into a broad ghostly room, without glass in the windows, or fire, or any one comfort, my mind recurred to the stories told of the horrors of the Hartz forest, and of the benighted traveller's situation therein. Cold sluggish beetles hung to the damp walls,--and these I immediately secured. After due exertions and perseverance with the damp wood, a fire smoked lustily, and, by cajoling the gnome of a housekeeper, I procured the usual roast fowl and potatos, with the accustomed sauce of a strong smoky and singed flavour.* [Since writing the above a comfortable house has been erected at Senadah, the name now given to what was called Pacheem Bungalow.] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{road from}} Nowshera to the Malakand Pass and camps is forty-seven miles long, and {{divided into four}} stages. Usually there is an {{excellent}} tonga service, and the distance is covered in about six hours; but while the Field Force was mobilised so much traffic and so many officers passed {{up and down the}} line, that the tonga ponies were soon reduced to a terrible condition of sores and emaciation, and could hardly drag the journey out in nine, ten, or even twelve hours. After leaving Nowshera, and crossing the Cabul River, a stage of fifteen miles brings the traveller to Mardan. This place--pronounced [...] "Merdane"--is the permanent station of the Corps of Guides. It is shady and agreeable, though terribly hot in the summer months. It boasts an excellent polo ground and a comfortable <b>rest-house.</b> The passer-by should pause to see the Guides' cemetery, perhaps the only regimental cemetery in the world. To this last resting-place under the palm trees, close to the fields where they have played, and the barracks in which they lived, have been borne the bodies of successive generations of these wardens of the marches, killed in action across the frontier line. It is a green and pleasant spot. Nor is there any place in the world where a soldier might lie in braver company.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} {{afternoon}} by the banks of a swiftly rushing river, a river that gave back a haze of heat from its waters {{as though it were}} some stagnant steaming lagoon, and yet seemed to be whirling onward with the determination of a living thing, perpetually eager and remorseless, leaping savagely at any obstacle that attempted to stay its course; an unfriendly river, to whose waters you committed yourself at your peril. Under the hot breathless shade of the trees on its shore arose that acrid all-pervading smell that seems to hang everywhere about the tropics, a smell as of some monstrous musty still-room where herbs and spices have been crushed and distilled and stored for hundreds of years, and where the windows have seldom been opened. In the dazzling heat that still held undisputed sway over the scene, insects and birds seemed preposterously alive and active, flitting their gay colours through the sunbeams, and crawling over the baked dust in the full swing and pursuit of their several businesses; the flies engaged in Heaven knows what, and the fly-catchers busy with the flies. Beasts and humans showed no such indifference to the temperature; the sun would have to slant yet further downward before the earth would become a fit arena for their revived activities. In the sheltered basement of a wayside <b>rest-house</b> a gang of native hammock-bearers slept or chattered drowsily through the last hours of the long mid-day halt; wide awake, yet almost motionless in the thrall of a heavy lassitude, their European master sat alone in an upper chamber, staring out through a narrow window-opening at the native village, spreading away in thick clusters of huts girt around with cultivated vegetation. It seemed a vast human ant- hill, which would presently be astir with its teeming human life, as though the Sun God in his last departing stride had roused it with a careless kick. Even as Comus watched he could see the beginnings of the evening's awakening. Women, squatting in front of their huts, began to pound away at the rice or maize that would form the evening meal, girls were collecting their water pots preparatory to a walk down to the river, and enterprising goats made tentative forays through gaps in the ill-kept fences of neighbouring garden plots; their hurried retreats showed that here at least someone was keeping alert and wakeful vigil. Behind a hut perched on a steep hillside, just opposite to the <b>rest-house,</b> two boys were splitting wood with a certain languid industry; further down the road a group of dogs were leisurely working themselves up to quarrelling pitch. Here and there, bands of evil-looking pigs roamed about, busy with foraging excursions that came unpleasantly athwart the border-line of scavenging. And from the trees that bounded and intersected the village rose the horrible, tireless, spiteful-sounding squawking of the iron-throated crows.|$|E
5000|$|The state confiscated also {{all types}} of {{property}} such as <b>rest-houses,</b> khans (hostels), shops, and mills, which were the main sources of income for the religious institutions. Mosques and Churches, mainly Catholic and sometimes Orthodox, were used as ammunition depots or military hostels. Many mosques were destroyed under the pretext of development, urbanisation, or the building of highways. Today's national theater stands {{in the place where}} one mosque was some 60 years ago. [...] The religious communities opposed such reforms, and criticized the government for the confiscation of their property, but the government never listened, maintaining that these acquisitions were necessary in the light of an economic crisis.|$|R
50|$|Ancient {{inscriptions}} were incised in the Pandu-lena caves near Nasik {{describing how}} Rishabhadatta was son of Dinika and had married Dakshamitra, daughter of Nahapana. According to the inscriptions, Ushavadata accomplished various charities and conquests {{on behalf of}} his father-in-law. He constructed <b>rest-houses,</b> gardens and tanks at Bharukachchha (Broach), Dashapura (Mandasor in Malva), Govardhana (near Nasik) and Shorparaga (Sopara in the Thana district). He also campaigned in the north under the orders of Nahapana to rescue the Uttamabhadras who had been attacked by the Malayas (Malavas). He excavated a cave (one of Pandavleni Caves) in the Trirashmi hill near Nasik and offered it to the Buddhist monks. In his reign, he converted to Hinduism.|$|R
50|$|The {{administration}} of Harsha {{was similar to}} the Gupta Empire. He was just in his administration and punctilious in exercising his responsibilities. There was no forced labour and everyone was free to busy himself with his own affairs. Harsha built {{for the benefit of the}} poor throughout his Empire in both the towns and rural parts <b>Rest-Houses</b> which provided food, drink and medicine. Harsha was continually travelling up and down his wide dominions to see with his own eyes how the people were ruled in his Empire. The merchants travelled freely in his Empire and officials were paid regularly. The taxes were light and one-sixth of the land produce was charged as land revenue.|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{the first}} day the Inca Upanqui, he who is my father and whose lawful heir I am, {{although}} he discarded me for Urco and believes me dead, made it a habit to take his food in the same tent or <b>rest-house</b> chamber as the lady Quilla. Lord, being very clever, she set herself to charm him, so that soon he began to dote upon her, as old, worn-out men sometimes do upon young and beautiful women. She, too, pretended to grow fond of him and at last told him {{in so many words}} that she grieved it was not he that she was to marry whose wisdom she hung upon, in place of a prince who, she heard, was not wise. This, she said, because she knew well that the Inca would never marry any more and indeed had lived alone for years. Still, being flattered, he told her it was hard that she should be forced to wed one to whom she had no mind, whereon she prayed him, even with tears, to save her from such a fate. At last he vowed that he would do so by setting her among the Virgins of the Sun on whom no man may look. She thanked him and said that she would consider the matter, since, for reasons that you may guess, Lord, she did not desire to become a Virgin of the Sun and to pass the rest of her days in prayer and the weaving of the Inca's garments.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Kerrick sat at {{a little}} teak-wood table in the {{verandah}} of a low- pitched teak-built house that stood on the steep slope of a brown hillside. Her youngest child, with the grave natural dignity of nine- year old girlhood, maintained a correct but observant silence, looking carefully yet unobtrusively after the wants of the one guest, and checking {{from time to time}} the incursions of ubiquitous ants that were obstinately disposed to treat the table-cloth as a foraging ground. The wayfaring visitor, who was experiencing a British blend of Eastern hospitality, was a French naturalist, travelling thus far afield in quest of feathered specimens to enrich the aviaries of a bird-collecting Balkan King. On the previous evening, while shrugging his shoulders and unloosing his vocabulary over the meagre accommodation afforded by the native <b>rest-house,</b> he had been enchanted by receiving an invitation to transfer his quarters to the house on the hillside, where he found not only a pleasant-voiced hostess and some drinkable wine, but three brown- skinned English youngsters who were able to give him a mass of intelligent first-hand information about the bird life of the region. And now, at the early morning breakfast, ere yet the sun was showing over the rim of the brown-baked hills, he was learning something {{of the life of the}} little community he had chanced on. [...] "I was in these parts many years ago," [...] explained the hostess, [...] "when my husband was alive and had an appointment out here. It is a healthy hill district and I had pleasant memories of the place, so when it became necessary, well, desirable let us say, to leave our English home and find a new one, it occurred to me to bring my boys and my little girl here--my eldest girl is at school in Paris. Labour is cheap here and I try my hand at farming in a small way. Of course it is very different work to just superintending the dairy and poultry-yard arrangements of an English country estate. There are so many things, insect ravages, bird depredations, and so on, that one only knows on a small scale in England, that happen here in wholesale fashion, not to mention droughts and torrential rains and other tropical visitations. And then the domestic animals are so disconcertingly different from the ones one has been used to; humped cattle never seem to behave in the way that straight-backed cattle would, and goats and geese and chickens are not a bit the same here that they are in Europe--and of course the farm servants are utterly unlike the same class in England. One has to unlearn a good deal of what one thought one knew about stock- keeping and agriculture, and take note of the native ways of doing things; they are primitive and unenterprising of course, but they have an accumulated store of experience behind them, and one has to tread warily in initiating improvements." ...|$|E

Apputhi Adigal belonged to the Pallava (Kshatriya) caste. His family had the job of reciting the Vedic scriptures.

Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the Malay peninsula into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, <b>rest-houses</b> and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.|$|R
