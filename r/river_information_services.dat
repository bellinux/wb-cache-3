It is seen as essential to develop in the implementation of these technologies a more integrated and coordinated approach to avoid that in the future the added value of these technologies will hamper. Consequently there is, in the development of new systems, a growing need for: Standardization and harmonisation Efficient and simplified solutions, Interoperability.

40|$|The {{transport}} sector {{and in particular}} inland waterway transport, is increasing the use of information and communication technology (ICT). The use of ICT can improve this mode of transport eg efficiency and the competition with road transport. An ICT concept, called RIS, <b>River</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Services,</b> is developed during the last years for the exchange of information with inland vessels {{for a number of}} applications. To bring this concept alive, a research project, INDRIS (Inland Navigation Demonstrator for River lnformation Services), was defined to establish standards for the information flows in terms of data elements, protocols and communication means as well as to demonstrate the principles of the concept. INDRIS is carried out by governmental bodies, transport industry, shipping industry and research institutes in The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Belgium and France. The RIS concept covers navigation, safety and logistìc applications. For this reason it was necessary to define data communication and communication systems for time critical applications (real time), such as navigation and safety related data exchange, and not time critical applications eg reporting, gathering fairway information, weather reports and planning. For time critical data communication the Automatic Identification System, AIS, is chosen. This paper describes Inland AIS as demonstrated in INDRIS...|$|E
40|$|To {{operate in}} a RIS (<b>River</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Services)</b> {{environment}} certain 'tools' will be needed. RINAC deals with a concept of the bridge (wheel-house) of an inland navigation vessel, to {{operate in a}}n RIS environment. RINAC stands for River Information, Navigation And Communication system, and describes an architecture of the future bridge of an inland vessel {{as a result of}} a study in the Fourth Framework Program of the European Commission. This architecture is based on the two most important tasks of an inland navigation skipper. The first one comprises the tactical tasks like monitoring the traffic environment and making manoeuvring decisions. The RIS concept will assist the skipper to complete the traffic image aboard with additional information in particular on places where the onboard radar cannot oversee the situation. The second task of the skipper is called the strategic task. This includes gathering information from the fairway for voyage planning, cargo loading etc. Reporting dangerous goods is another strategic task that will be part of the RIS concept. The Human Machine Interface, the way how to work with this tool, and how to present the information, forms a part of this study. RINAC describes also the communication requirements as integrated part of the RINAC set-up. Tactical communication must be real time and meet very high reliability and availability of standards. It deals with safety and navigation. Communication for strategic purposes is less time critical and can be obtained from public communication networks. Communication must be transparent for the user. The system decides how data exchange will take place and which available communication means and protocols will be used. Working in an RIS environment will have consequences on training and certification to all involved with the system. This has been investigated during the projec...|$|E

However, the digital home service levels have not sufficiently met rising demand from users. Therefore, it is urgent to propose and develop new service modes for the digital home. Geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> can provide various spatial <b>information</b> <b>services</b> such as map search, spatial information query. It has become an inevitable trend to implement geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the digital home. This paper proposes three new geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> modes for the digital home after sufficient requirement analysis: pushed <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode, interactive <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode, personalized <b>information</b> <b>service</b> mode.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a market}} where {{the provision of}} <b>information</b> <b>service</b> is costly, but <b>information</b> <b>service</b> has {{the characteristics of a}} public good. Consumers, on the other hand, can use the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> to make an informed purchase decision and derive higher utility from consuming their ideal product. However, after receiving the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> from an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider, consumers can easily free ride by purchasing at low-price sellers who do not provide any <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> The paper examines the competition where sellers compete by providing <b>information</b> <b>service</b> for horizontally differentiated products and where technology reduces consumers' search cost. It is found that in this market a seller needs to establish itself as an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider in order to make positive profits, even when there is free riding. A seller, however, cannot make positive profits by free riding all the time. Also, with an increase in competition in the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> market, sellers have reduced incentives to provide <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> It is also found that in this market a decrease in search cost may increase or decrease social welfare. free riding, search cost, electronic markets, electronic commerce...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a {{structured}} literature review, design concepts, and research propositions related to a product-oriented design theory for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Information</b> <b>services</b> facilitate the exchange of information goods with or without transforming these goods. Exemplar <b>information</b> <b>services</b> are e-publishing, electronic communities-of-practice, and management reporting. The importance of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the current economy merits the development of an explicit product- and process-oriented design theory. Design/methodology/approach – This article focuses on the product-oriented design theory by applying Walls et al. 's framework. A product-oriented design theory of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> identifies relevant descriptive and explanatory insights (i. e. content, use, value, and revenue), meta-requirements, and meta-designs. The paper describes design problems for <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> and gives key requirements for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> Next, it describes the information, organizational and information technological components of an <b>information</b> <b>service,</b> and identifies at least four <b>information</b> <b>service</b> architectures.
