50|$|Gymnasts competed on the {{horizontal}} <b>bar,</b> parallel <b>bars,</b> <b>rings,</b> and pommel horse. Three judges marked each performer {{in each of}} the four apparati; these 12 scores were summed to give a final score.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{trade-off}} between the amplifying {{effect of the}} resonators {{and the length of}} sustain of a <b>ringing</b> <b>bar.</b> The energy in a <b>ringing</b> <b>bar</b> comes from the initial mallet strike, and that energy can either be used to make the <b>bar</b> <b>ring</b> louder initially, or not as loudly but {{for a longer period of}} time. This is not an issue with marimbas and xylophones, where the natural sustain time of the wooden bars is short, but vibraphone <b>bars</b> can <b>ring</b> for many seconds after being struck, and this effect is highly desirable in many circumstances. Therefore, the resonators in a vibraphone are usually tuned slightly off-pitch to create a balance between loudness and sustain.|$|R

5000|$|Since then, with Custodio, the four-piece has gelled as a {{regularly}} gigging live {{band in the}} Bay Area {{and begun}} collaborating, complementing Georgantas' narrative lyrics with a sound they describe as [...] "space bar rock" [...] ("space <b>rock,</b> <b>bar</b> <b>rock,</b> space <b>bar</b> rock").

40|$|Nuclear stellar <b>bars,</b> <b>rings</b> and/or spirals in disk {{galaxies are}} thought to stimulate the inward {{funnelling}} of disk materials, fuelling the AGN. However, how such small-scale structures and the central AGN activities are actually related still remains uncertain. Therefore, we performed {{a detailed analysis of}} the structures and isophotal properties for three barred S 0 galaxies NGC 2681, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 having small-scale stellar <b>bars,</b> <b>rings</b> and a point source. Building on this and using our imaging of the narrow lines (Hβ, [O III], Hα, [N II], and [S II]) to measure the pertaining emission fluxes, we constructed the standard BPT diagnostic diagrams. Our results favor bar-related AGN fuelling and nuclear gas ionisation. However, we argue that the bar-driven scenario alone cannot account for the formation of these three S 0 s...|$|R

5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming <b>bars,</b> <b>rings</b> or tail-like structures.|$|R
25|$|In another damper technique—half pedaling—the player {{depresses}} {{the pedal}} {{just enough to}} remove the spring pressure from the bars, {{but not enough to}} make the pad lose contact with the bars. This lets the <b>bars</b> <b>ring</b> slightly longer than with the pad fully up and can make a medium-fast passage sound more legato without pedaling every note.|$|R
