25|$|The US and European <b>refractories</b> {{industry}} had {{a crisis in}} 2000–2003, with an indifferent market for steel and a declining refractory consumption per tonne of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures. Many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of Harbison-Walker <b>Refractories</b> by RHI AG and some plants had their equipment auctioned off. Since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick, graphite consumption within the <b>refractories</b> area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and monolithics, and away from brick.

25|$|The {{most common}} way of {{recycling}} graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used {{all the way}} down to the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel. Graphite-containing <b>refractories</b> are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this model}} (from 1944) the {{companion}} went nova with ejected material {{captured by the}} Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova. [...] In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength {{would have to be}} 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of <b>refractories</b> must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only <b>refractories</b> remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Refractory</b> status epilepticus is a {{life-threatening}} disease in children wherein seizure movements don't response to first line anti convulsion drugs. This study reviewed risk factors, management and early outcome {{of children with}} <b>refractory</b> status epilepticus. Methods: Patients with <b>refractory</b> status epilepticus admitted in Tabriz children's hospital between 2003 and 2006 were reviewed prospectively for risk factors, management and outcome at time of discharge from hospital. Results: Of the total of 121 patients with status epilepticus, 47 patients (38. 8 %) were afflicted with <b>refractory</b> status epilepticus. The {{most common form of}} <b>refractory</b> status epilepticus was acute symptomatic (38. 3 %).
