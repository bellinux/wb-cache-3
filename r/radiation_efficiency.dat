40|$|In the {{derivation}} of {{the equation}} for the flanking sound reduction index for EN 12354 - 1, reciprocity {{was used to remove}} the <b>radiation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the elements from the calculations. The exclusion of the <b>radiation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> was beneficial since they are often not known. However, the assumption of reciprocity may only be applicable to the heavy monolithic constructions for which EN 12354 - 1 was intended. If EN 12354 - 1 is applied to lightweight constructions which may exhibit direction dependent sound transmission, the assumption of reciprocity may contribute to an over prediction of the apparent sound reduction. A correction factor is proposed to correct for the over prediction due to the assumption of reciprocity. However, due to the inclusion of the <b>radiation</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in the correction factor, its use is limited. Alternatively, the correction factor may be used to estimate the error due to the assumption of reciprocity so that the accuracy of the EN 12354 - 1 predictions can be assessed for lightweight constructions. ...|$|R

A simpler, faster and lower cost approach uses the antennas’ scattering parameters to determine correlation coefficient.

A level of incident radiation reduced by 25 % under birdguard shadecloth decreased final yield and final leaf area index, but increased canopy leaf nitrogen concentration and <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> (19 - 14 %) (compared with the full sun treatment). A similar level of reduced incident radiation under solarweave shadecloth (which provided an increased proportion of diffuse radiation), increased final yield and <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> (46 - 50 %).

40|$|International audienceAntennas, {{and more}} {{generally}} any {{equipment under test}} (EUT) capable of coupling to impinging electromagnetic waves, are well-known sources of power loss in reverberation chambers (RCs). As such, it is fundamental to model their contribution to an RC quality factor. The standard model available in the literature is based on power dissipated in loads connected to an antenna. This paper argues about the inaccuracy of this description, where internal dissipation within an antenna (or EUT), associated to potentially low <b>radiation</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> is neglected. An alternative model is validated by showing its self-consistency in predicting change in loading effects {{as opposed to the}} standard model. It is expected to have practical importance for tests performed in the low-frequency range of RCs, where antenna-related dissipation is the dominant loss mechanism, and in particular for EUTs which can be expected to display poor <b>radiation</b> <b>efficiencies...</b>|$|R

Previous research has shown that increasing vapor pressure deficit has a negative effect on <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> of many crops. In this study, the <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> of cot-ton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown in two contrasting production environments, Arkansas and California, was evaluated for two years, in 2006 and 2007.

Leaf area index was used in daily intervals to calculate daily intercepted radiation. Light extinction coefficient was calculated as the slope of regression line between log transformed fraction of intercepted radiation and leaf area index during growing season. <b>Radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> was calculated as the slope of linear regression between cumulative intercepted radiation and cumulative biomass during growing season.

The <b>efficiency</b> of <b>radiation</b> interception and absorption is dependent on leaf area index, light extinction coefficient and <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency.</b> In order to study mentioned coefficients a randomized complete block design with four replications was conducted during 2005 for different sugar beet cultivars (7233, 7112, 436, 276 and Rasoul) at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad experimental farm station. The cultivars were cultivated in eight rows with 50 centimeters distance in plots with 12 meter length and optimum condition of nutrients and irrigation. In addition to measuring the radiation above and under the canopy, the plots were sampled 9 times during growing season and leaf area index, total dry matter and finally light extinction coefficient and <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> were measured. Mean maximum leaf area index was 3. 51. The final yield of total dry matter for different genotypes varied from 15670 to 25920 kilogram per hectare. There were no significant differences among genotypes in light extinction coefficient and <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> and their mean values were about 0. 56 and 1. 23 g.

Seasonal variation of <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> was similar to leaf area index changes during the crop growth cycle and maximum <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> was located before the reaching of maximum green leaf area index.

In order {{to estimate the}} <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> and <b>radiation</b> interception of Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) under different treatments of animal manure, a completely randomized block design with three replications and four treatments {{was conducted on the}} research farm of Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Treatments at four levels including 15, 20, 25 and 30 tons of animal manure per hectare were designed. The results showed that the growing season of Fenugreek was coincident with absorbed radiation by canopy, so the time to reach the maximum leaf area index was in accordance with the time to reach the maximum incident radiation by canopy of Fenugreek. The lowest leaf area index (0. 22) and <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> (1. 42 g Mj- 1) was obtained with the application of 15 ton ha- 1 animal manure and highest leaf area index (0. 30). And <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency</b> (1. 74 g Mj- 1) was obtained with the application of 25 ton ha- 1 animal manure. The results also indicated that increasing the animal manure enhanced leaf area index and consequently <b>radiation</b> use <b>efficiency,</b> but this advantage was seen only up to a certain level of animal manure application (25 ton ha- 1).

50|$|Antenna gain {{is closely}} related to {{directivity}} and often incorrectly used interchangeably. However, gain is always less than directivity by a factor called <b>radiation</b> <b>efficiency,</b> η. Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of antenna, gain takes into account the losses that always occur in the real world. Specifically, accelerating charge (time varying current) causes electromagnetic radiation per Maxwell's equations. Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on radiating elements to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna. This coupling is never 100% efficient (by Laws of Thermodynamics), and therefore antenna gain will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.|$|E
