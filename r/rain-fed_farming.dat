Accordingly, the government of Ethiopia has been increasing water resource development and utilization. However, to what extent the irrigation users are better off than rainfall dependent counterparts on their technical effi ciency (TE) and variability in productivity among the farmers is not well known. Therefore, this study compared the technical effi ciency of farmers who are producing potato under irrigation and through rainfall in Eastern Ethiopia. Propensity Score Matching was applied to select irrigated farms with comparable attributes to <b>rain-fed</b> <b>farms</b> to see the true effi ciency diff erences between the two groups.

The central approach of this research is combining an agent-based model (ABM) representing farmers with various types of production systems with a water resources model (WRM).

For this reason a knowledge elicitation workshop was conducted where farmers simulated their main farming activities on a monthly basis.

A {{number of studies}} were conducted to quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) worldwide. The objective of this review was to evaluate organic carbon stocks, dynamics and restoration in soils of agroecosystems in Ethiopia. Soil data from 32 different observations, representing four different agroecosystems, were analysed. The mean SOC stocks in the four agroecosystems varied and ranged from 25. 66 (sub-humid agroecosystem) to 113. 17 (humid mid-highland agroecosystems) Mg C ha - 1 up to one meter depth. The trend of mean SOC followed (in descending order) : humid mid-highland (113. 17 Mg C ha - 1) > per-humid highland (57. 14 Mg C ha - 1) > semi-arid (25. 77 Mg C ha - 1) > sub-humid (25. 66 Mg C ha - 1). Compared with soils of tropical countries, those in Ethiopian agroecosystems contained low SOC storage potential. This might be associated with differences in measurement and analysis methods as 53. 1 % of the studies employed the Walkley-Black Method, which is known to underestimate carbon stocks in addition to ecological and management effects. However, shifts of land management from <b>rain-fed</b> to irrigation <b>farming</b> systems exhibited progress in the improvement of mean SOC storage potential. The analyses showed that farming systems involving irrigation sequestered more carbon than <b>rain-fed</b> <b>farm</b> systems. The mean SOC in the various agricultural land uses followed the following trend (in descending order) : agroforestry (153. 57 Mg C ha - 1) > grazing land (34. 61 Mg C ha - 1) > cereal cultivation (24. 18 Mg C ha - 1).
