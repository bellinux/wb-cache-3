5|$|The size of {{a matrix}} {{is defined by the}} number of <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns that it contains. A matrix with m <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> n columns is called an m×n matrix or m-by-n matrix, while m and n are called its dimensions. For example, the matrix A above is a 3×2 matrix.|$|E
5|$|By the {{spectral}} theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an eigenbasis; that is, every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. In both cases, all eigenvalues are real. This theorem can {{be generalized to}} infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns, see below.|$|E

5|$|The numbers, symbols or {{expressions}} in {{the matrix}} are called its entries or its elements. The {{horizontal and vertical}} lines of entries in a matrix are called <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Each row in a smartsheet {{may have}} files {{attached}} to it, emails stored within it, and a discussion board associated with it. When a new smartsheet is created, notifications are pushed out to staff to populate its <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns. As information is updated, other smartsheets tracking the same task, project or data-point are updated automatically. The service also has alerts for when a task deadline is coming up, and {{keeps track of}} document versions.|$|E
5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has {{the same number of}} <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with an {{infinite}} number of rows or columns (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E

5|$|The {{inception}} of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg, Born and Jordan led to studying matrices with infinitely many <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns. Later, von Neumann {{carried out the}} mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, by further developing functional analytic notions such as linear operators on Hilbert spaces, which, very roughly speaking, correspond to Euclidean space, but with an infinity of independent directions.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{cemetery}} {{is surrounded}} by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and <b>rows,</b> <b>and</b> a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb <b>rows,</b> <b>and</b> eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic {{table in a}} new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in <b>rows,</b> <b>and</b> those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist. These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements. It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was francium (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939. However, plutonium, produced synthetically in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring element in 1971.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing <b>rows,</b> <b>and</b> every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E
5|$|The {{copper shark}} has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} slightly arched profile just behind the head. The snout is rather long and pointed, with the nostrils preceded by low flaps of skin. The round, moderately large eyes are equipped with nictating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth has short, subtle furrows at the corners and contains 29–35 upper tooth <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> 29–33 lower tooth rows. The teeth are serrated with single narrow cusps; the upper teeth have a distinctive hooked shape and become more angled towards {{the corners of the}} jaw, while the lower teeth are upright. The upper teeth of adult males are longer, narrower, more curved, and more finely serrated than those of adult females and juveniles. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E

50|$|Byermoor {{colliery}} {{occupied the}} area to the South of the church prior to closure in 1968, along with four terraces built to house its workforce. Nearest to the A692 were Double <b>Row</b> <b>and</b> New <b>Row</b> <b>and</b> beyond these, Pit <b>Row</b> <b>and</b> Furnace <b>Row.</b> The {{only one of these}} houses to survive is the former colliery manager's house that stood at the Eastern end of New <b>Row</b> <b>and</b> was considerably larger than the others. One of the colliery's reservoirs stood alongside this, and the site of the reservoir is now occupied by some small industrial units. The access road to these was originally built as access to Double <b>Row</b> <b>and</b> the colliery itself, while just to the South of this, the road that served New Row is still in place, albeit fenced off and overgrown from a couple of yards beyond the junction with the main road.|$|R
5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E
5|$|About twenty {{teeth and}} a jaw {{fragment}} have {{been referred to}} Ferugliotherium, but the assignment {{of many of these}} is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as Ferugliotherium is in question. The identity of a few additional isolated premolars assigned to Ferugliotherium, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (Vucetichia gracilis), which is now considered a synonym of Ferugliotherium. They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E
