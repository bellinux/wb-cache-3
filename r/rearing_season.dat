Silkworm pupation rate, infection rate and synnemata characteristics of I. tenuipes were examined. Normal silkworms had a higher pupation rate than silkworms inoculated with I. tenuipes. The pupae survival percentage of normal silkworm in cocoons was 92. 5 ~ 97. 6 %, whereas it ranged from 91. 1 ~ 95. 6 % in silkworms sprayed with I. tenuipes. Female Yangwonjam showed the highest survival percentage at 97. 6 % among the silkworm varieties tested.

We hypothesized that metabolic alkalosis occurs in seabirds even under natural conditions during the breeding season. Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae feed their chicks by regurgitating food for 50 - 60 d until the chicks fledge. In this study, the concentrations of Cl-, HCO 3 -, Na+, K+, pH, and {{in the blood of}} breeding Adélie penguins were measured throughout the chick-rearing season. The pH of penguin venous blood shifted from 7. 54 in the guarding period to 7. 47 in the crèche period. Decreasing Cl- and increasing HCO 3 - blood concentrations in parents were associated with increasing mass of their brood in the guarding period, the early phase of the <b>rearing</b> <b>season,</b> indicating that regurgitating to feed chicks causes loss of gastric acid and results in relative metabolic alkalosis. The inverse trend was observed during the crèche period, the latter phase of the <b>rearing</b> <b>season,</b> when parents spent more time at sea and have fewer opportunities for gastric acid loss. This was assumed to be the recovery phase. These results indicate that regurgitation might cause metabolic alkalosis in breeding Adélie penguins.

Our study {{examined the effects of}} the removal of predatory mammals at the BRMBR on the home range size and spatial overlap of the remaining populations of red foxes, raccoons, and striped skunks. The removal of predators through traps, snares, and night-shooting created a lower predator population during the predators 2 ̆ 7 <b>rearing</b> and dispersal <b>seasons.</b> Predator removal did not result in a change of home range size for red foxes, raccoons, or striped skunks.

After predator removal, the proportion of a home range that overlapped with that of another conspecific decreased in foxes but increased in raccoons. However, predator removal did not change the proportion of inter-specific home range overlap between foxes and raccoons. These findings indicate that home range sizes of these mammalian predators were not constrained by their population densities prior to predator management. In this situation, predator control may be only temporarily successful in reducing predator populations.

50|$|The common {{kingfisher}} typically lays two to ten glossy white eggs, which average 1.9 cm in breadth, 2.2 cm in length, and weigh about 4.3 g, of which 5% is shell. One or two eggs in most clutches fail to hatch because the parent cannot cover them. Both sexes incubate by day, {{but only the}} female at night. An incubating bird sits trance-like, facing the tunnel; it invariably casts a pellet, breaking {{it up with the}} bill. The eggs hatch in 19-20 days, and the altricial young are in the nest for a further 24-25 days, often more. Once large enough, young birds will come to the burrow entrance to be fed. Two broods, sometimes three, may be <b>reared</b> in a <b>season.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{evidence}} that for several years rural communities in Northern Ghana have been confronted with single rainfall season which is also unpredictable. The poor weather condition has cumulatively contributed to {{the high incidence of}} poverty among households. In the midst of this, the indigenes have stayed and persevered through other diversified means of survival with little or no external support. The study therefore seeks to identify traditional and diversified livelihoods coping mechanisms that these rural families have adopted to at least secure them, minimal food and other socio-economic security/assets. Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) techniques were mostly used to collect data. Some of the techniques used were group discussions, wealth ranking, structured and unstructured questionnaires, and observation. The data analysis employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the key issues identified. The study reveals that, most communities are living in difficult condition but are resilient to make ends meet. They have done this through diversification of their livelihood portfolios which include diversified crop cultivation, livestock <b>rearing,</b> dry <b>season</b> gardening, petty trading and especially out-migrant remittances. This strategy adopted also enable them cope with other competing demands in terms of food, healthcare, education, farming and shelter among others. The study observed that farmers/households will do better if they are incentivized (inputs and extension service) to boost subsistence farming, diversify more into income generating activities (animal rearing) ...|$|R
40|$|Medium-sized {{carnivores}} (Carnivore), {{representative of}} which are also fox (Vulpes vulpes) and European badger (Meles meles), are represented in a rather high number in Slovenia. Both are dietary generalists and mostly eat everything available. These two species have very similar preferences in searching the most appropriate habitat. They like to inhabit ecologically diverse landscapes in vicinity of farmland the best. Their activity depends on {{the form of the}} habitat, population density, and the amount of food, which is a consequence of the first two factors. The purpose of the thesis was to research the activity of fox and badger, and to establish whether factors, such as social periods, temperature, precipitation, moon phases, and daylight, influence the activity. Collection of samples took place from the beginning of February to the end of May 2016 {{in the area of the}} Čadraška hosta in the vicinity of Šentjernej. I used a method of monitoring by using a photo trap in order to obtain the data. The data was then collected, classified by time, added notes, and statistically analysed. I established that the activity is influenced by factors, such as daylight, amount of precipitation, and social periods (in my case: mating period and a period of <b>rearing</b> <b>season).</b> Day and night activity were mainly changing in the case of fox, which had five offspring in May. In the case of badger this activity was not changed, and it took place only at night. The amount of precipitation influenced both species. Mainly serious precipitation decreased activity. We saw differences in activity in the period of changing dawn and dusk in both species. Exits from den depended on time of dusk and dawn in both species, badger and fox. Changes occurred only in the period of offspring´s activity in den, which forced the doe to leave the den with them and to be active. However, the factors moon phases and temperatures during my monitoring did not caused statistically important differences...|$|E
40|$|In this overview, {{our current}} {{knowledge}} and research being {{conducted on the}} use of palm oil in the commercial feeds for cold-water salmonid species such as Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout will be highlighted. Salmonids have a high requirement for lipid as a source of energy and n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to maintain membrane fluidity in a cold water environment. The culture of salmonid fishes has traditionally depended on marine fish oils for this purpose but with limited supplies and the rapid increase in salmon production, alternatives to fish oils must be investigated. Research has shown that crude palm oil can be used to replace 100 % of added fish oils in salmonid diets without compromising growth performance and feed utilization efficiency despite reductions in lipid and fatty acid digestibilities that occurs during low water temperatures in the winter <b>rearing</b> <b>season.</b> Fatty acid desaturation and elongation activities increased with increasing dietary palm oil and to a certain extent, decreasing water temperatures. The effects of palm oil on fish health requires further research but the use of this more saturated vegetable oil may reduce oxidative stress in fish thereby reducing pathological conditions associated with this physiological state. It is generally known that fish fillet fatty acid composition directly reflects that of the dietary oil used. Extrapolating from work done with other vegetable oils, the supply of beneficial n- 3 (omega- 3) PUFA in salmon fillets to the human consumer can be maintained by using a “wash-out” feeding strategy just prior to harvesting despite significant reductions in these fatty acids when high levels of dietary palm oil are used to feed fish. The use of palm oil can also add additional benefits to fillet quality and health benefits to the consumer due to the potential bioaccumulation of tocopherols and tocotrienols in salmon flesh and minimizing the deposition of undersirable fatty acids such as 18 : 2 (n- 6). Fillet texture and color were not affected by feeding salmon palm oil-based diets...|$|E
40|$|Chalk brood is {{a disease}} of {{honeybee}} larvae caused by the fungus Ascosphdera apis, which causes the death and mummification of sealed honeybee brood, and with the consequent weakness of the colony. It is widespread amongst honeybees in Europe and North America. In Africa the only report of chalk brood has been from Tunisia (Heath, 1985). The disease is spread by robbing, drifting bees and by the normal practices of beekeeping (Warhurst, 1998). Ascosphaera apis produces sticky spores, which are commonly present on adult bees and all surfaces within occupied hives. The disease develops only if the brood is physiologically stressed in some way, for example chilling. In Ethiopia, the existence of two adult honeybee diseases Nosema apis and Melpighamoebae me/// 7 /'caand their distribution was studied and reported (Gezahegn & Amsalu, 1991; Desalegn & Amsalu, 1999). Until now {{there has been no}} record on the existence of any honeybee brood diseases in the country. Materials and methods The survey transects and beekeepers to be surveyed were selected randomly. A survey was carried out around the Holetta area on beekeeper's colonies, and at Gedo demonstration site about 150 km west of Holetta. Following the brood <b>rearing</b> <b>season</b> October 2000 to January 2001, 276 colonies at 13 survey sites were inspected externally and internally for signs of chalk brood disease. Colonies showing any symptoms of chalk brood: dead infected larvae left uncapped by nurse bees in the comb cells, and mummies at the hive entrances, on the hive floor and on the ground perpendicular to the hive opening, were examined. From 13 apiary sites, larval mummies were collected from eight apiaries that were found to display positive signs of the disease. Overall 240 black mummies of honeybee larvae from 48 bee colonies (five per colony) were collected. Each mummy was macerated separately in a sterile mortar with distilled water to prepare suspensions containing Ascosphaera apis from each site. The suspensions were filtered through fine cloth and the fungus was grown in the laboratory, using Potato Dextrose Agar containing antibiotic to avoid any bacterial contamination, on petri dishes. After eight days, microscopic examination of the cultures was made to determine the size of th...|$|E

Twenty-one oval and 10 peanut cocoon shaped lines were <b>reared</b> in different <b>seasons</b> of the year. Since the polyvoltines are non-diapausing, six generations were reared and evaluated for various economically important traits based on evaluation index and sub-ordinate function statistical methods. Ten top ranked lines obtained by using both the methods were identified as potential parental strains. Among oval lines, APM 14, APM 11, APM 18, APMW 9, and APM 19, and among peanut lines APMD 5, APMD 1, APMD 3, APMD 9 and APMD 8 were selected as base material.

40|$|Many {{arthropods}} exhibit behaviours precursory {{to social}} life, including adult longevity, parental care, nest loyalty and mutual tolerance, {{yet there are}} few examples of social behaviour in this phylum. The small carpenter bees, genus Ceratina, provide important insights into {{the early stages of}} sociality. I described the biology and social behaviour of five facultatively social species which exhibit all of the preadaptations for successful group living, yet present ecological and behavioural characteristics that seemingly disfavour frequent colony formation. These species are socially polymorphic with both / solitary and social nests collected in sympatry. Social colonies consist of two adult females, one contributing both foraging and reproductive effort and the second which remains at the nest as a passive guard. Cooperative nesting provides no overt reproductive benefits over solitary nesting, although brood survival tends to be greater in social colonies. Three main theories explain cooperation among conspecifics: mutual benefit, kin selection and manipulation. Lifetime reproductive success calculations revealed that mutual benefit does not explain social behaviour in this group as social colonies have lower per capita life time reproductive success than solitary nests. Genetic pedigrees constructed from allozyme data indicate that kin selection might contribute to the maintenance of social nesting -, as social colonies consist of full sisters and thus some indirect fitness benefits are inherently bestowed on subordinate females as a result of remaining to help their dominant sister. These data suggest that the origin of sociality in ceratinines has principal costs and the great ecological success of highly eusociallineages occurred well after social origins. Ecological constraints such as resource limitation, unfavourable weather conditions and parasite pressure have long been considered {{some of the most important}} selective pressures for the evolution of sociality. I assessed the fitness consequences of these three ecological factors for reproductive success of solitary and social colonies and found that nest sites were not limiting, and the frequency of social nesting was consistent across brood <b>rearing</b> <b>seasons.</b> Local weather varied between seasons but was not correlated with reproductive success. Severe parasitism resulted in low reproductive success and total nest failure in solitary nests. Social colonies had higher reproductive success and were never extirpated by parasites. I suggest that social nesting represents a form of bet-hedging. The high frequency of solitary nests suggests that this is the optimal strategy when parasite pressure is low. However, social colonies have a selective advantage over solitary nesting females during periods of extreme parasite pressure. Finally, the small carpenter bees are recorded from all continents except Antarctica. I constructed the first molecular phylogeny of ceratinine bees based on four gene regions of selected species covering representatives from all continents and ecological regions. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian Inference tree topology and fossil dating support an African origin followed by an Old World invasion and New World radiation. All known Old World ceratinines form social colonies while New World species are largely solitary; thus geography and phylogenetic inertia are likely predictors of social evolution in this genus. This integrative approach not only describes the behaviour of several previously unknown or little-known Ceratina species, bu~ highlights the fact that this is an important, though previously unrecognized, model for studying evolutionary transitions from solitary to social behaviour...|$|R
5000|$|While captive Malay peacock-pheasants may {{sometimes}} appear to polygynous or promiscuous, not forming lasting pair bonds, {{this is probably}} atypical as peacock-pheasants are as a rule monogamous with males participating in nest defense and chick <b>rearing.</b> The mating <b>season</b> is not well resolved; recently used nests {{have been found in}} March, April and August. Breeding activity may in fact occur essentially all year round (as in many lowland rainforest birds), triggered by abundance of mast rather than by a fixed [...] rhythm. Males scrape the debris and leaf litter off their display sites in forest clearings, from where they maintain vocal contact with their mate and progeny. They adopt various highly stereotyped and ritualised postures and associated plumage displays, which reveal prominent ocelli on remiges and rectrices. These behaviors are likewise used in self-defense. When utilised in pair-bonding behavior copulation may occur subsequent to lateral displays. Anterior displays are also performed which may include curious clicking and vibrating pulsations of feather quills created via stridulation.|$|R
