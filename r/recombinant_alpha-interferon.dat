50|$|The Roche Institute of Molecular Biology {{was created}} on July 14, 1967 when John Burns, then the vice {{president}} of research at Hoffman-La Roche, persuaded biochemist Sidney Udenfriend to leave the National Institutes of Health and help him create a basic science institute at the Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, New Jersey facility. It lasted for 28 years and was associated with a number of well-known and well-regarded scientists. At one time, {{it was one of the}} largest post-doctoral training programs funded by industry with approximately 70 fellows at one time. It was one of the first examples of a successful relationship between a basic biological research institute and biomedical company. Notable discoveries include Abuscreen, a product for detecting drug abuse, and Aferon, a <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon.</b> Udenfriend claims that the decision of Roche to close the institute was despite the fact that the institute had been producing useful research for the company, and was very highly ranked in terms of independent research institutes. He does note that the scientists leaving the institute were in high demand and were given generous leave packages from Roche, including personal leave salaries, bridging grants and the allowance to keep all equipment in the laboratory.|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B with <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon</b> {{results in the}} disappearance of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) from serum in nearly 40 % of patients (1, 2). In addition, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serocon-version occurs in approximately one third of responders (2). Improvement in serum aminotransferase levels and partial resolution of hepatic inflammation have been seen in most responders when evaluated 6 to 12 months {{after the completion of}} therapy (2 - 4). Whereas recent data indicate that the disappearance of serum markers for viral replication and improvement in liver function are often maintained indefinitely (5), the long-term his-tologic outcome has not been evaluated, and immuno-histochemical study of liver tissue for viral antigens ha...|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} with multiple myeloma {{were treated with}} <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon</b> (r IFN-alpha 2 b Intron AR) along with combination chemotherapy i. e. melphelan and prednisolone. In one case it was given as an initial therapy, while the other two patients had refractory and relapsing disease respectively. IFN-alpha 2 b was given in the dose of 2 x 10 (6) Mu/m 2 by subcutaneous injection thrice in a week for six months in two patients and for three months in one patient. All three patients experienced improvement in bone pains; partial response with reduction in the paraprotein level was seen in one patient; while there was no radiological, biochemical or haematological improvement in two patients. Side effects noted were flu like syndrome in all three patients and urticaria in one patient. They were treated symptomatically and did not require cessation of interferon therapy...|$|E
40|$|The acyclic {{nucleoside}} DHPG [9 -(1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl) guanine] and <b>recombinant</b> human <b>alpha-interferon</b> of clones A/D potentiate each other's antiviral activity {{against a}} systemic infection with {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2. The effective dose at which 50 % of the mice survived was lowered approximately 10 -fold for DHPG when it was given in combination with a marginally effective dose of alpha-interferon and greater than 10 -fold for alpha-interferon when it was given in combination with a nontherapeutic dose of DHPG...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one adult {{patients}} with chronic hepatitis B and active viral replication as indicated by positivity for hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B virus DNA, with increased DNA polymerase levels for more than 6 months, were entered into a prospective trial of low-dose <b>recombinant</b> human <b>alpha-interferon</b> therapy. All patients were treated with 5 million units of recombinant interferon alfa- 2 b given subcutaneously every other day for 12 weeks. During treatment, 18 patients (86 %) showed a significant reduction of DNA polymerase levels (p {{less than or equal}} to 0. 001), which reached normal values in ten (48 %). After 10 months' mean follow up, seven patients (33 %) were hepatitis B e antigen negative and five (24 %) subsequently became positive for antibodies to e antigen. By 27 months, nine patients (43 %) were both hepatitis B e antigen negative and e antibody positive. Only one patient became permanently negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. One patient relapsed during the second year of follow up. Side effects necessitated withdrawal of therapy in two patients: one due to worsening thrombocytopenia after two doses of interferon (data omitted from the study results) and one due to a local reaction at the injection sites. Our data indicate that small doses of recombinant interferon alfa- 2 b given during a 12 -week period induce a significant reduction in viral replication and approximately triple the spontaneous seroconversion rate observed in {{patients with}} chronic hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant gamma-interferon (r gamma-IFN) has {{contrasting}} {{effects on}} thromboplastin (TPL) synthesis induced in monocytes (M) and endothelial cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol ester (TPA), and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) the induced thromboplastin response was significantly augmented by r gamma-IFN whereas the monocyte response was inhibited. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon</b> (r alpha-IFN) {{had no effect}} on thromboplastin induction in endothelial cells but had a significant inhibitory effect on the TPL response in monocytes when LPS or LPS and cyclosporin A (CS) were used as inducing agents. Cyclosporin A, previously shown to enhance thromboplastin synthesis induced in monocytes, also contributes to a higher level of thromboplastin activity in endothelial cells. Its effect on monocytes was in most cases fully inhibited by r gamma-IFN (and also by r alpha-IFN when tested). gamma-Interferon and alpha-interferon alone had a weak stimulatory effect or none on thromboplastin synthesis in both cell types...|$|E
40|$|Three {{short-term}} human melanoma {{cell lines}} were tested for sensitivity to human recombinant alpha-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in a semisolid agar colony formation assay. Cells from three pigmented and one amelanotic strain displayed low sensitivity to TNF. The ID 50 for the inhibition of melanoma colony formation ranged from 2, 500 to 20, 000 U/ml. We then tested {{the ability of}} human <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon</b> (IFN-alpha) and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) to interact with TNF to inhibit melanoma colony formation. Analysis of the TNF-IFN mixtures using the median effect method demonstrated that both IFNs interacted synergistically with TNF to inhibit melanoma colony formation. On a unit basis, IFN-gamma was more active with TNF than IFN-alpha. The addition of the second interferon to the mixture enhanced the ability of TNF to promote the cytolysis of human melanoma cells. The enhanced killing effect seen with the combination of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and TNF suggests an interesting strategy {{for the treatment of}} human melanoma...|$|E

Se presenta un estudio retrospectivo de 7 pacientes con diagnóstico de micosis fungoides tratados con alfa-interferón recombinante (alfa-INFR) y se concluye su efectividad en el tratamiento de esta enfermedad y su disponibilidad en el tratamiento en Cuba. Los efectos adversos observados a las dosis utilizadas fueron fundamentalmente fiebre, escalofríos y malestar general que cedieron con tratamiento analgésico.

40|$|Sera from 30 {{patients}} with community-acquired, biopsy-proven chronic non-a,non-B hepatitis (NANBH) were tested for antibodies to the C 100 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV). The 20 patients who showed reactivity in this assay were followed prospectively for 6 months, {{during which time}} seven were treated with <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon.</b> HCV RNA was detected by "nested" polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 19 of the 20 anti-C 100 -positive sera taken {{at the onset of}} the study and also in five of the ten anti-C 100 -negative sera. Pretreatment viraemia levels ranged from 2 x 10 (3) to 2 x 10 (8) HCV genomes/ml. After 6 months of interferon, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had fallen to normal in four of the seven treated patients. In each case the response to interferon was accompanied by either a disappearance of or a decline (1 log to 8 log reduction) in viraemia. HCV genome titres in the three nonresponders and in the 13 untreated anti-C 100 -positive patients did not change significantly over this 6 month period. These findings confirm the aetiological role of HCV in community-acquired NANBH and suggest that quantitative PCR will become a valuable technique for monitoring the antiviral effect of interferon and other experimental treatments...|$|E
40|$|Megakaryocyte (MK) colony {{growth of}} bone marrow {{mononuclear}} non-adherent cells was evaluated in 28 patients with essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and in 26 normal controls. The number of MK-colony forming units (CFU-MK per 3 x 10 (5) plated cells) was similar in ET (68 +/- 33) and in controls (63 +/- 37), independently of bone marrow accessory cells. On the contrary, {{the size of}} the MK colonies was significantly (P less than 0. 01) greater in ET patients. Human <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon</b> 2 a (alpha-IFN), administered to 10 patients at a dose of 3 x 10 (6) IU/d s. c. for 11 +/- 3 weeks, was capable of inducing a significant (P less than 0. 01) decrease in the number (from 72 +/- 16 to 31 +/- 14) and size of bone marrow CFU-MK, together with a significant reduction of the platelet count (from 1031 +/- 325 to 378 +/- 75 x 10 (9) /l). When added in vitro at time 0 to the culture dishes, alpha-IFN inhibited the CFU-MK growth of both normal and ET bone marrow samples, even at very low concentrations (1 and 10 IU/ml). This study demonstrates that alpha-IFN, both in vivo and in vitro, exerts an inhibitory effect on the growth of MK progenitors, which appears to correlate with the clinically documented antiproliferative effect of this cytokine...|$|E
40|$|Human blood {{lymphocytes}} that express Type 3 complement receptors (CR 3) can {{be divided}} into a major subset with high density Fc receptors for IgG (FcR) identified with the monoclonal antibody Leu 11 and two minor subsets which display either CD 8 (Leu 2) or CD 4 (Leu 3) markers. We isolated CR 3 + lymphocyte subsets and examined them for regulatory effects on pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated cells. The FCR CR 3 + cell suppressed PWM-induced proliferation and Ig production. Pretreatment of these lymphocytes with immune complexes was required to suppress proliferation, but not IgG production. The CR 3 + Leu 2 + FCR- subset also had suppressive activity, but this effect was not observed unless the CR 3 + Leu 3 + enriched subset was removed. In fact, the CR 3 + Leu 3 + enriched subset enhanced IgG synthesis. Brief exposure of CR 3 + lymphocytes to recombinant interleukin 2, <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon,</b> but not gamma-interferon, markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect. Time course studies and a comparison of inhibition of Ig synthesis with natural killer cell activity suggested that CR 3 + lymphocytes act shortly after lymphocytes are exposed to PWM and that Ig production was regulated by suppression rather than cytotoxicity. These CR 3 + lymphocyte subsets may have broad antigen non-specific effects on immunoglobulin synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Unregulated or {{increased}} {{expression of}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGF-R) is a common event in neoplastic transformation; modulation of such a receptor by physiological agents could be, therefore, of clinical interest. We have studied the binding ability, the availability at cell surface, and the synthesis of EGF-R in the A 431 and KB human epidermoid cancer cell lines after treatment with <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon</b> (IFN-alpha). After 48 h of treatment, IFN-alpha induces, in both cell lines, growth inhibition and enhances class I major histocompatibility HLA complex expression, which is a common marker of IFN action. [I- 125]EGF total binding assessed after 48 h of treatment with IFN-alpha shows a dose-dependent upregulation of EGF-R binding capacity. Saturation plots of the binding data show that IFN-alpha treatment does not dramatically alter the affinity of the EGF-R and indicate that IFN-alpha only increases the number of low affinity receptors. We show that this effect {{is due to a}} specific increase in the synthesis of the receptor protein, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of [S- 35]methionine-labeled cell extracts. Electron microscopy analysis has confirmed an increase of EGF-R proteins at cell surface without major changes in the morphology of the cells. Taken together, these results indicate that IFN-alpha consistently induces both the binding capacity and the synthesis of EGF-R in human epidermoid cancer cells and suggest the use of such a mechanism for new anticancer therapies...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{hepatitis}} B virus-associated membranous nephropathy with <b>recombinant</b> <b>alpha-interferon.</b> An open, randomized trial {{study on the}} therapeutic effect of recombinant α-interferon (IFNα) in 40 patients with hepatitis B virus membranous nephropathy (HBVMN) was conducted. All were pathologically proven to have HBVMN which showed no response to corticosteroid treatment represented by persistent heavy proteinuria. Both HBeAg and HBsAg were positive in all. Group 1 was composed of 20 patients who were treated with recombinant IFNα (5 subjects, body wt < 20 kg; 8 subjects, body weight ≥ 20 kg) by subcutaneous (s. c.) injection {{three times a week}} for 12 months. In group 2 there were 20 patients who received supportive treatment only. At {{the end of the third}} month of treatment, all patients in Group 1 were free of proteinuria. In contrast, 10 patients (50 %) in Group 2 had persistent heavy proteinuria and another 10 patients (50 %) had light proteinuria with exacerbation during respiratory tract infection. At the end of the twelfth month, 8 patients (40 %) in Group 2 still had persistent heavy proteinuria and 12 patients (60 %) had light proteinuria with frequent relapses. Eight patients (40 %) in Group 1 had HBeAg seroconversion between the fourth and sixth months and HBsAg seroconversion between the tenth and twelfth months. HBe seroconversion only [HBeAg (-) /HBsAg (+) ] was found in four patients. Four patients had no change in HBV serological markers [HBeAg (+) /HBsAg (+) ]. The remaining 4 patients had HBeAg (-) / HBeAb (+) HBsAg (-) /HBsAb (-) at the end of the twelfth month. In contrast, there was no seroconversion of HBeAg (+) /HBsAg (+) in Group 2 patients. Flu-like symptoms were found in all patients during the first two weeks of IFNα treatment and disappeared spontaneously. Psychiatric problems were late side-effects found in 30 % of patients which disappeared when the dosage of IFN was reduced. These results suggest that IFNα therapy is of value in complete resolution of heavy proteinuria, and provides some benefit in seroconversion of HBeAg (+) /HBsAg (+) in children with HBVMN...|$|E
