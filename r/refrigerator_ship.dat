In 1985 China established eleven shipping offices and jointly operated shipping companies in foreign countries. In 1986 China ranked ninth in world shipping {{with more than}} 600 ships and a total tonnage of 16 million, including modern roll-on and roll-off ships, container ships, large bulk carriers, <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ships,</b> oil tankers, and multipurpose ships. The fleet called at more than 400 ports in more than 100 countries.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 May 1965 the Treasury-class vessels were re-designated as High Endurance Cutters or WHEC. This {{designation}} {{indicated a}} multi-mission ship {{able to operate}} at sea for 30–45 days without support and Taney was then re-classified as WHEC-37. In March 1965 she conducted an Alaskan Patrol and on 29 March she successfully fought a fire on board the disabled fishing vessel Glacier Bear [...] south of Cape Fairweather and then towed her to safety.

2500|$|Just after 13:00 on 29 January, Kormoran {{encountered}} a large merchantman which altered course on sighting the raider, but {{returned to her}} original heading after Kormoran made no aggressive moves. Detmers instead waited until {{the distance between the}} ships had decreased before the raider altered course to intercept, dropped her camouflage, and ordered the merchantman to stop. The ship did not comply, and after a warning shot elicited no response, Kormoran fired for effect. A distress signal was transmitted but jammed by the raider, and after unsuccessfully trying to break away from the faster German ship, the merchant vessel came to a stop and ceased attempts to transmit. The crew was ordered by signals from Kormoran to abandon ship, but the merchant sailors did not comply until after the raider resumed fire, having observed an attempt to man the ship's stern gun. A boarding party identified the victim as the 11,900-ton <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ship</b> Afric Star, carrying meat and butter to England. The complicated configuration and damaged condition of Afric Star ruled against her capture as a prize ship; after confiscating code books and other vital documents, and recovering 76 people, including two women, attempts were made to scuttle her.

50|$|Between 1873 and 1879 British {{agriculture}} {{suffered from}} wet summers that damaged grain crops. Cattle farmers {{were hit by}} foot-and-mouth disease, and sheep farmers by sheep liver rot. The poor harvests, however, masked a greater threat to British agriculture: growing imports of foodstuffs from abroad. The development of the steam ship {{and the development of}} extensive railway networks in Britain and the USA allowed US farmers with much larger and more productive farms to export hard grain to Britain at a price that undercut the British farmers. At the same time, large amounts of cheap corned beef started to arrive from Argentina, and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the development of <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ships</b> (reefers) in about 1880 opened the British market to cheap meat and wool from Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina. The Long Depression was a worldwide economic recession that began in 1873 and ended around 1896. It hit the agricultural sector hard and was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fuelled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. By 1900 half the meat eaten in Britain came from abroad and tropical fruits such as bananas were also being imported on the new <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R

25|$|Factory {{ships were}} not used by Japan until the 1930s. As whale catches diminished in coastal waters, Japan looked to Antarctica. Toyo Hogei K.K. {{purchased}} the Norwegian factory ship, Antarctic, renaming it the Tonan Maru in 1934. <b>Refrigerator</b> <b>ships</b> were sent along to freeze and transport the meat back to Japan. By capitalizing on both the meat and oil of whales, the Japanese industry continued to out-compete other whaling nations. Improvements in technology such as the world's first diesel-powered whale catcher, the Seki Maru, also increased the capacity to take whales. In the years building up to World War II, the Germans purchased whale oil from Japan and both nations used it in preparation for war.|$|R
50|$|Germany {{sent out}} two waves of six surface raiders each during World War II. Most of these vessels {{were in the}} 8000 - 10000 LT range. Many of these vessels had {{originally}} been <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ships,</b> used to transport fresh food from the tropics. These vessels were faster than regular merchant vessels, which was important for a warship. They were armed with six 15cm (5.9 inch) naval guns, some smaller guns, torpedoes, reconnaissance seaplanes and some were equipped for minelaying. Several captains demonstrated great creativity in disguising their vessels to masquerade as allied or as neutral merchants.

The area just {{north and south of}} Santiago is a large producer of fruits, including the grapes from which the best Chilean wines are made. Exports of fresh fruit began to rise dramatically in the mid-1970s because Chilean growers had the advantage of being able to reach markets in the Northern Hemisphere during that part of the world's winter. Most of these exports, such as grapes, apples, and peaches, go by <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ships,</b> but some, such as berries, go by air freight.|$|R

YP-278 was one of only a few private yachts seized by the Navy and converted to ocean-going <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ships</b> in order to enable the War Department to distribute food supplies from Australia and New Zealand rather than from the more distant U.

50|$|A Service Squadron (ServRon) was a U.S. Navy {{squadron}} {{that supported}} fleet combat units. Service Squadrons {{were used by}} the United States Navy from their inception in 1943 to {{as late as the}} early 1980s. At the time of their inception during the Second World War they allowed the US Navy to operate across the vast reaches of the Pacific ocean for extended periods of time. Service Squadrons created temporary forward bases to allow the naval squadrons to spend less time in transit and more time in the area of combat. Ulithi, a small volcanic atoll in the central Pacific, is one such example. Service Squadrons essentially created a major naval base near the area of operation. With the naval base at Ulithi to refit, repair and resupply, many ships were able to deploy and operate in the western Pacific {{for a year or more}} without returning to a major port facility. Among the vessels operating in service squadrons were tankers, oilers, <b>refrigerator</b> <b>ships,</b> ammunition ships, supply ships, floating docks and repair ships. They provided diesel, ordnance, aviation fuel, food stuffs and all other supplies. Equally important at places like Ulithi were the portable piers and floating dry docks which allowed many ships damaged by enemy action or Pacific storms to undergo repair without having to travel the thousands of miles back to a major US naval base. Ulithi was as far forward from the US naval base at San Francisco as the San Francisco base was from London, England. To have a fully functional major port in the middle of the Pacific was a significant aid to U.S. Navy operations.|$|R
