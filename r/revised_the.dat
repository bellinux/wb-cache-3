5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.

He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin <b>revised</b> <b>the</b> established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E
