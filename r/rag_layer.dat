40|$|In {{oil sands}} froth treatment, an {{undesirable}} intermediate layer, often accumulates during {{the separation of}} water-oil emulsions. The layer referred to as <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> is a complex mixture of water, oil, solids and interfacially active components. The presence of a <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> has a detrimental impact on the separation of water and fine solids from diluted bitumen. The current study focuses on characterisation of solids from a <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> forming stream of a naphthenic froth treatment plant {{in an attempt to}} understand the mechanism of <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> formation. Through detailed characterisation of rag-forming and non-rag-forming solids, the mineralogy of solids and their contamination were shown to be critical to <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> formation. The iron-based minerals such as siderite and pyrite were found to be enriched within the <b>rag</b> <b>layer.</b> Analysis of surface organic complexes confirms a high level of organic matter associated with these solids through the binding of carboxylic acid group with iron on solids, resulting in a surface hydrophobicity susceptible for <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> formation...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{volatile}} crude oils was characterized using the Asphaltene Determinator oncolumn precipitation and re-dissolution method developed at Western Research Institute (WRI). Gravimetric asphaltenes and polars fractions from silica gel chromatography {{separation of the}} oils were characterized also. A study to define the differences in composition of asphaltenes in refinery desalter <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> emulsions and the corresponding feed and desalter oils was conducted. Results indicate that the most polar and pericondensed aromatic material in the asphaltenes is enriched in the emulsions. The wax types and carbon number distributions in the two heptaneeluting fractions from the Waxphaltene Determinator separation were characterized by repetitive collection of the fractions followed by high temperature gas chromatography (GC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). High resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICRMS) was conducted {{by researchers at the}} Florida State University National High Magnetic Field laboratory in a no-cost collaboration with the study...|$|E

The supporting material of the beams was identified as cypress wood, and a <b>rag</b> paper <b>layer</b> {{was used as a}} base for the paint layer, mainly composed by a white ground layer on which the color was then added; the yellow pigments are orpiment and chrome yellow. The green color probably arises from a mixture of orpiment, red lead, ultramarine blue and calcite.|$|R

40|$|Stable water-in-oil {{emulsions}} {{persist in}} bitumen froth from surface mining process of Athabasca oil sands because of asphaltenes and clay solids. This dissertation {{focuses on the}} characterization and separation of water in diluted bitumen emulsions. A novel approach to process experimental data from classic NMR experiments for the characterization of water in diluted bitumen emulsions has been proposed and tested. NMR PGSE restricted diffusion measurement can characterize emulsion drop size distribution. Experiments show that drop size of emulsion does not change much with time, which indicates that water in diluted bitumen emulsion is very stable without demulsifier. Water fraction profile and water droplet sedimentation velocity {{can be obtained from}} MRI 1 -D T 1 weighted profile measurement. Emulsion flocculation can be deduced by comparing the sedimentation velocity from experiment data and Stokes Law prediction. PR 5 (a polyoxyethylene (EO) /polyoxypropylene (PO) alkylphenol formaldehyde resin) is an appropriate demulsifier for water in diluted bitumen emulsion. Almost complete separation can be obtained in the absence of clay solids. For the sample with solids, a <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> containing solids with moderate density forms between the clean oil and free water layers. Partially oil-wet clay solids prevent complete separation of the emulsion. Experiments reveal that wettability of clay solids has significant effect on emulsion stability. Kaolinite with 100 ppm sodium naphthenate in toluene-brine mixture is chosen as model system for wettability test. Wettability of kaolinite can be altered by pH control, silicate and surfactant. Adding 3 x 10 - 3 M Na 2 SiO 3 at pH 10 can get 80 % of kaolinite water-wet. Over 90 % of kaolinite becomes water-wet adding C 8 TAB, betaine 13 and amine oxide DO with optimal dosages. In diluted bitumen emulsion, about 10 - 4 M sodium meta-silicate can change the wettability of solids from partially oil-wet to more water-wet. Hereby the clay solids can settle down to the aqueous phase and the separation is almost complete. Wettability of kaolinite can be characterized via zeta potential measurement and modeling. Simplified Gouy-Stern-Grahame model and oxide site-binding model can be used to correlate zeta potential of kaolinite in brine with different additives. Sodium silicates have the greatest effect per unit addition on changing zeta potential of kaolinite and can be used to change the wettability of clay solids. Almost complete separation be obtained by the three-step procedure: (a) adding 10 - 4 M Na 2 SiO 3 during initial emulsion formation to make the solids less oil wet; (b) removing the clean oil formed following subsequent treatment with demulsifier and adding NaOH or Na 2 SiO 3 with shaking to destroy the <b>rag</b> <b>layer</b> and form a relatively concentrated oil-in-water emulsion nearly free of solids; and (c) adding hydrochloric acid to break the oil-in-water emulsion...|$|E

50|$|Old Rag Mountain is {{underlain}} by Old Rag Granite, {{named for}} its ubiquitous exposure on the mountain, formed during the Grenville Orogeny about a billion years ago. About 400 million years after the Grenville orogeny during the Catoctin Formation, deposition of basaltic magma occurred during {{the formation of the}} Iapetus Ocean, forming a layer of greenstone over the granite. This was followed by the Weverton Formation, Harpers Formation, and Antietam formation in which sand and rock sedimented on the ocean floor forming quartzite and sandstone deposits. Finally a period of sedimentation of shells and skeletons of foraminifera resulted in deposition of a layer of limestone. Approximately 700 million years after the Greenville Orogeny, the Iapetus Ocean began to close resulting in the Alleghenian Orogeny when the Old <b>Rag</b> Granite and <b>layers</b> of rock deposited upon it were transported westward and eventually thrust up over the limestone bed around it, forming Old Rag and the Blue Ridge Mountains.|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} lymphocytes, {{expression and}} {{activity of the}} recombination activation gene protein 1 (RAG 1) and RAG 2 endonuclease complex is tightly regulated to ensure ordered recombination of the immunoglobulin genes and to avoid genomic instability. Aberrant RAG activity has been implicated in the generation of secondary genetic events in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs), illustrating the oncogenic potential of the <b>RAG</b> complex. Several <b>layers</b> of regulation prevent collateral genomic DNA damage by restricting RAG activity to the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. In this study, we show a novel pathway that suppresses RAG expression in cycling-transformed mouse pre-B cells and human pre-B B-ALL cells that involves the negative regulation of FOXO 1 by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Inhibition of NF-κB in cycling pre-B cells resulted in upregulation of RAG expression and recombination activity, which provoked RAG-dependent DNA damage. In agreement, we observe a negative correlation between NF-κB activity and the expression of RAG 1, RAG 2, and TdT in B-ALL patients. Our data suggest that targeting NF-κB in B-ALL {{increases the risk of}} RAG-dependent genomic instabilit...|$|R
