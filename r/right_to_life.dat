5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E

5|$|Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 9(1), {{guarantees the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> {{and the right}} to personal liberty. The Court of Appeal has called the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> the most basic of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} also imposes {{restrictions on}} these rights. The government restricts these freedoms {{in the interest}} of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of India.

5|$|Human {{rights in}} Turkey {{have been the}} subject of some {{controversy}} and international condemnation.

Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy. Turkey's human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to future membership of the EU.|$|E

An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{voted against}} the Defense of Marriage Act, the Federal Marriage Amendment, and {{was in favor of}} {{repealing}} the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy.

At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions, though he reversed his positions on both issues. On education, he expressed support for the public education system, universal pre-kindergarten, and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program. Moran was given a 100% rating by the NARAL and 0% by the National <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Life</b> Committee, indicating a pro-choice voting record. He also voted to expand research of embryonic stem cells and to allow minors to go across state lines to receive abortions.|$|E

5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person {{has the right to}} defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E
5|$|These {{fundamental}} rights help {{not only in}} protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
50|$|Human rights include women’s {{rights and}} sexual and {{reproductive}} rights.

50|$|The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry {{is closely}} related <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> family <b>life,</b> however the two rights are not identical. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry is {{explicitly}} provided for in all human rights instruments, essentially providing that all people have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry and found a family. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> family <b>life</b> predominantly refers <b>to</b> an individual's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> create and maintain their family relationships. It was clarified in X, Y and Z v United Kingdom that in the situation where a spouse has been deported from their partner's State due to their nationality, there is no infringement on the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry as the individuals are already married, and so the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> family <b>life</b> must be considered.|$|R
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life.</b> Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E
