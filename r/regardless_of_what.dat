5|$|The {{improvement}} in running {{time and the}} wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management {{issued a statement saying}} that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> prostheses he wears, and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.|$|E

50|$|The player's primary {{weapons are}} a sword, used for {{powerful}} close-range attacks, and a rod, used for shooting missiles that travel {{the entire length}} of the screen. Magic spells and items are also available for defeating enemies and negotiating obstacles. The character has three classes: a Fighter who uses the currently equipped sword but who always uses the weakest rod (<b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> equipped), a Magician who uses the currently-equipped rod but uses a dagger instead of a sword, and a Saint who can only attack with the weakest rod and a dagger but who is required for certain tasks (like gaining the NPC Pukin in Chapter 3). Changing into specific classes is often required for other quests as well. The player can change classes (for a fee) at a Mosque or by casting the Great Magic spell Moscom during an Alalart Solar Eclipse.|$|R
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. The consensus is that the German position was doomed, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The Checkers {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the Republican {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> anyone said, he intended to keep one gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named Checkers by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E

5|$|The {{right-hand}} {{side of the}} above equation is the sure information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> values are used to replace Nulls in the database. In the example we considered above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E
5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large-population states. Those who argue that the College favors low-population states point out that such states have {{proportionally}} more electoral votes relative to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (proportionally allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> state they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. <b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E

5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in their life, and that they stay that way <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques ever used. Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though some might share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user has mastered the full power of both of their eyes, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create a construct of chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{retired from}} Parliament with a pension of $72 a week; he had {{resisted}} giving higher pensions to Ministers or longer-serving MPs throughout his tenure. <b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> people {{thought of the}} Playmander, Playford was held in high regard for his integrity; during his premiership, there were no complaints of corruption or government largesse. Playford also prohibited his ministers from sitting {{on the board of}} directors of public companies or owning shares, lest they became conflicted in their decision-making. He returned to his orchard at Norton Summit, and took a continued interest in South Australian politics, but did not typically raise his opinions publicly; he was still consulted in private by Liberals up until his death, however. His closeness to Labor figures did not end either, offering advice to their new South Australian ministers, and assisting in a memorial to the former Labor Prime Minister John Curtin. In line with his reputation for promoting his state, Playford also privately lobbied the Liberal government in Canberra on behalf of the state Labor administration for more infrastructure funding. In 1977, when Don Dunstan celebrated his 50th birthday party, Playford was the only Liberal invited. There he socialised with former and future Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Dunstan, and other Laborites.|$|E

5000|$|Many sources believe Jalaluddin Haqqani and {{his forces}} {{assisted}} with the escape of Al-Qaeda into safe-havens in Pakistan.

Analyst Peter Bergen argues this point in his book [...] "The Battle for Tora Bora" [...] Judging by the possibilities and the amount of US Military assets focused on such a small region, the theory that the Haqqani network aided in the escape seems reasonable. <b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> exactly <b>what</b> occurred in those mountains, the Haqqanis played a role.

50|$|At their core, {{every game}} asks two {{questions}} <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> genre: <b>What</b> do players do when they’re {{sitting around the}} table? What does your character do for themselves and for the group? Once you answer those two questions, {{you will have a}} strong foundation for a game. Think of these questions as the elevator pitch or tagline - but for a game. In Dune, you’ll play a member of the Spacing Guild who’ll work with other diplomats to ensure the spice keeps flowing from Arrakis. In Firefly, you’ll join a crew to find a job and keep flying across the ‘Verse in spite of many obstacles, e.g, 'Find a Crew, Find a Job, Keep Flying.'
