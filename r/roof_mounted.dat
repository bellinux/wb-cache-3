25|$|Unglazed transpired {{collectors}} are perforated sun-facing walls {{used for}} preheating ventilation air. Transpired collectors {{can also be}} <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> for year-round use and can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22°C and deliver outlet temperatures of 45-60°C. The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12years) make them a more cost-effective alternative to glazed collection systems. As of 2015, over 4000 systems with a combined collector area of 500,000 m2 had been installed worldwide. Representatives include an 860 m2 collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1300 m2 collector in Coimbatore, India used for drying marigolds.|$|E

Caprice including rear <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} light bars can {{be important for}} police applications, as fuel efficiency and drag are concerns in patrol and pursuit. [...] Because of this, some police cars do not have <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> lightbars. These ‘slick-top’ cars mount their emergency lights within the cruiser, generally around {{the periphery of the}} windshield or into the leading or trailing edge of the roof. [...] Slick-top police cars also lack the silhouette of a lightbar or beacon, making the car harder to identify as a police vehicle from a distance, especially fore and aft. [...] Because of these visual advantages, these vehicles are sometimes referred to as ‘stealth’ vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|The RLI's {{characteristic}} deployment was the Fireforce {{rapid response}} operation, first created at Mount Darwin and then tested at Centenary in June 1974. This was an operational assault or reaction {{composed of a}} first wave of 32 soldiers (as a rule) carried to the scene by three helicopters and one DC-3 Dakota, called [...] "Dak", with a command/gun helicopter and a light attack aircraft in support. The latter was a Cessna Skymaster, armed with two <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> [...]303 Browning machine-guns and normally two 37mm SNEB rocket pods and/or two small napalm bombs called Frantans, and/or two mini-Golf bombs which were manufactured in Rhodesia.

2500|$|One 1996 NABI {{articulated}} bus, 9619 {{was saved}} and converted into MTA's official [...] "Comfort Bus," [...] a bus specially {{designed to be}} dispatched to special events in Baltimore City during the summer to provide air conditioning to the attendees of special events and to be dispatched around the city for displaced city residents whose homes were made uninhabitable by fire or other causes to provide them heat {{in the winter and}} air conditioning in the summer. The interior for 9619 was heavily modified from its revenue service design with three interior <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> AC units, modified seating arrangement, tables, a water cooler, microwave, mini-fridge, wall electrical outlets, and a door facing the public-area of the bus prohibiting access from {{going in and out of}} the front door, entrance and exit for the public is only through the rear door. Artscape 2015 was the very first event with very high temperatures that 9619 was deployed to as the official MTA Maryland Comfort Bus and the bus had major problems keeping the interior comfortably air conditioned from the three interior <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> AC units that were installed. MTA on July 20, 2015 posted to their Facebook page in a comment to an Artscape 2015 attendee who boarded 9619 and experienced the lack of air conditioning: [...] "We spoke with the HVAC specialists who work on the Comfort Zone Bus and they are aware of and working on the issue.

2500|$|On 12 November 2007, {{the first}} of 129 new 12-coach rakes with {{upgraded}} facilities {{was inducted into the}} fleet of the Western Railways under the MUTP project. The coaches are built of stainless steel, and have non-cushioned seats, emergency fluorescent lights, bigger windows with polycarbonate panes, better suspension systems, <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> forced ventilation to reduce carbon dioxide levels in packed trains, and GPS based passenger information systems in all coaches. The new rakes are much more cool and airy than the old EMUs. The motors of the new rakes also make less noise than the older ones. Since 2010 the front of the EMUs are painted yellow, so that the maintenance workers on the tracks can see the train easily. These rakes have been procured under the project at a total cost of [...] 19 billion (USD 431.0 million).

2500|$|The second batch were {{registered}} {{and used by}} the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the [...] "AXI cars". These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. These three cars all had <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No catalytic converters or Lambda equipment were fitted as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example {{which would have been}} shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982. It includes a unique rearward-facing twin exhaust, no catalytic converters and the UK specification engine as used by Volvo, but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries. The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88:1 versus the standard 3.44:1. Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors.|$|E
40|$|The nominal {{operating}} cell temperature (NOCT), {{an effective}} way to characterize the thermal performance of a photovoltaic module in natural sunlight, is developed. NOCT measurements for more than twenty different modules are presented. Changes in NOCT reflect changes in module design, residential <b>roof</b> <b>mounting,</b> and dirt accumulation.

Electrical degradation resulting from the marriage of photovoltaic and solar water heating modules is demonstrated. Cost-effectiveness of each of these techniques is evaluated...|$|R
50|$|Solar {{energy in}} Finland is used {{primarily}} for water heating {{and by the}} use of photovoltaics to generate electricity. As a northern country, summer days are long and winter days are short. Above the Arctic Circle, the sun does not rise some days in winter, and does not set some days in the summer. Due to the low sun angle, it is more common to place solar panels {{on the south side of}} buildings instead of on the <b>roof.</b> <b>Mounting</b> them vertically reduces the average output by 22% from mounting at a 60° angle.|$|R
40|$|Design {{requirements}} for photovoltaic modules and arrays used in {{commercial and industrial}} applications were identified. Building codes and referenced standards were reviewed for their applicability to commercial and industrial photovoltaic array installation. Four general installation types were identified - integral (replaces <b>roofing),</b> direct (<b>mounted</b> on top of <b>roofing),</b> stand-off (<b>mounted</b> away from <b>roofing),</b> and rack (for flat or low slope <b>roofs,</b> or ground <b>mounted).</b> Each of the generic mounting types {{can be used in}} vertical wall mounting systems. This implies eight mounting types exist in the commercial/industrial sector. Installation costs were developed for these mounting types as a function of panel/module size. Cost drivers were identified. Studies were performed to identify optimum module shapes and sizes and operating voltage cost drivers. The general conclusion is that there are no perceived major obstacles to the use of photovoltaic modules in commercial/industrial arrays...|$|R
