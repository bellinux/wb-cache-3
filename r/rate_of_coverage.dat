2500|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution, collective bargaining {{has been the}} main way to get fair pay, improved conditions, and a voice at work. The need for positive rights to organize and bargain was gradually appreciated after the Clayton Act of 1914. Under §6, labor rights were declared to be outside of antitrust law, but this did not stop hostile employers and courts suppressing unions. In Adair v United States, and Coppage v Kansas, the US Supreme Court, over powerful dissents, asserted the Constitution empowered employers to require employees to sign contracts promising they would not join a union. These [...] "yellow dog contracts" [...] were offered to employees on a [...] "take it or leave it" [...] basis, and effectively stopped unionization. They lasted until the Great Depression when the Norris–La Guardia Act of 1932 banned them. This also prevented the courts from issuing any injunctions or enforcing any agreements {{in the context of}} a labor dispute. After the landslide election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 was drafted to create positive rights for collective bargaining in most of the private sector. It aimed to create a unified federal system so that, under §157, employees would gain the legal [...] "right to self-organization", [...] "to bargain collectively" [...] and use [...] "concerted activities" [...] including strikes for [...] "mutual aid or other protection". The Act was meant to increase bargaining power of employees to get better terms in than individual contracts with employing corporations. However §152 excluded many groups of workers, such as state and federal government employees, railway and airline staff, domestic and agriculture workers. These groups depend on special federal statutes like the Railway Labor Act of 1926 or state law rules, like the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975. In 1979, five US Supreme Court judges, over four forceful dissents, also introduced an exception for church operated schools, apparently because of [...] "serious First Amendment questions". Furthermore, [...] "independent contractors" [...] are excluded, even though many are economically dependent workers. Some courts have attempted to expand the [...] "independent contractor" [...] exception. In 2009, in FedEx Home Delivery v NLRB the DC Circuit, adopting submissions of FedEx's lawyer Ted Cruz, held that post truck drivers were independent contractors because they took on [...] "entrepreneurial opportunity". Garland J dissented, arguing the majority had departed from common law tests. The [...] "independent contractor" [...] category was estimated to remove protection from 8 million workers.

5000|$|The {{most severe}} damage was in Corpus Christi and Aransas Pass. Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were {{destroyed}} and damaged about 55,650 others. About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. Initially, losses were {{estimated to have}} reached $434 million. However, due to lower insurance <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage,</b> the original insured losses, $310 million, were tripled, rather than doubled. Thus, the damage toll was revised upward to $930 million in 2011. Damage to crops was slightly more than $8.8 million. In addition, Celia caused 15 fatalities and injured 466 others. The most severe damage occurred in the streaks of damage, not by tornadoes, but a series microbursts and downbursts, most of which occurred in a 15 minute span. Survivors of the storm described the downbursts as suddenly [...] "rocket shells" [...] exploding. However, areas between the streaks suffered surprisingly little damage, mainly ornamental due to debris from the homes nearby. Celia dropped heavy rains as it made landfall.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Emergency {{departments}} (EDs) nationwide are {{key entry}} points into {{the health care}} system, and their use may reflect changes in access and need in their communities. However, no studies to date have empirically and longitudinally studied how changes in a community's level <b>of</b> insurance <b>coverage,</b> a key determinant of access, affect ED utilization. OBJECTIVE:: To {{determine the effects of}} changes in a community's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> on its population's ED use. METHODS:: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of all California counties between 2005 and 2010 using comprehensive ED visit data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Using Poisson regression with county and year fixed effects, we determined how changes in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> within a given county affect ED visits per 1000 residents. RESULTS:: We found that changes in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> within a county had a slight but significant inverse relationship with ED visits per 1000 residents for both adults and children. For example, if a county's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> among adults jumped from the 10 th (73. 22 %) to the 90 th percentile (84. 93 %), an estimated 2 fewer ED visits would occur per 1000 adult residents. CONCLUSIONS:: As the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> increased within California counties, overall ED utilization declined only slightly. Thus, expanding insurance coverage may not lead to significant decreases in overall ED use. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

Methods: an ecological study analyzing the evolution over time and correlation with <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the FHS between 1999 and 2007. Analyses were carried out for three age groups: 0 - 4 years, 5 - 9 years and 10 - 19 years. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used with a level of significance of 5 %. Results: the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> HCSPAs were found to decline during the period studied. In the population aged 0 - 4 years, a decrease of 19. 1 % was observed.
