The use of epicormic shoots enhanced the rooting capacity of stem cuttings collected from these shoots {{but did not}} appear to reverse the process of maturation. In this study, maturation was based on characteristics typical of mature trees but not necessarily those of the mother plant, because {{it was not possible to}} <b>root</b> <b>cuttings,</b> for comparison, from 5 -, lo- and 30 -year-old ortets, other than from epicormic shoots.

50|$|Thatch is a {{build-up}} {{of organic}} matter which can include dead grass, leaves, stems, stolons, rhizomes and overcrowded grass roots and lateral weed growth. Thatch can stifle the growth and health of grass or turf. Removing the thatch helps the grass by encouraging it to thicken up and also makes it stronger and less susceptible to disease. Reducing thatch levels increases the levels of water, air and nutrients that can get through to the root zone of the grass plants. Significant thatch problems in lawns can cause diseases and can encourage moss {{to grow in the}} areas where grass has died. A by-product of scarifying or de-thatching is that moss is also removed, and depending on how deep the scarifying blades are set, <b>root</b> <b>cutting</b> can also occur, and this in turn helps grass to thicken up over time. Scarifying is normally carried out in autumn or spring. When scarifying or de-thatching, not all thatch should be removed as a small amount of thatch is beneficial to the lawn. A lawn that has excessive thatch may feel spongy when trod upon. After removing thatch, it can be swept or raked up using a lawn sweeper.|$|E
50|$|A sewer jetter is {{composed}} of a controlled high-pressure water source such as a pressure washer or reciprocating displacement pump, a flexible high-pressure line (called a jetter hose which connects the high-pressure engine to the mini-reel) of up to hundreds of metres (several hundred feet) in length, the Mini-Reel (a hose reel which can be taken {{a distance from the}} engine) and a nozzle that uses hydraulic force to pull the line into sewer drains, clean the sides of pipes, and flush out residue. High-pressure sewer jetters can be mounted on trolleys, inside vans or on trailers. The power of a Sewer Jetter ranges from 1000 psi up to 5000 psi. Sewer jetter nozzles come in different sizes and applications; a bullet-type nozzle with a streamlined profile can clear a hole for the larger <b>root</b> <b>cutting</b> nozzle. Root-cutter nozzles are designed to cut roots with a spinning nozzle that shoots a jet stream horizontally inside the pipe. 5000 psi sewer jetters with root-cutting nozzles can clear a hole through the center of a root-infested sewer line and with its rear-facing jet streams cut the roots and clean the pipe walls, flushing the root debris through the sewer line. The sewer jetter has been labeled as a technological advancement of the plumber's snake (also known as an electric eel) drain clearing method.|$|E

To contribute {{to the understanding of}} Fe metabolism, Fe excess was induced in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia grown in hydroponic culture upon <b>root</b> <b>cutting.</b> Toxicity symptoms leading to brown spots covering the leaf surface became visible after 6 h. Photosynthesis was greatly affected within 12 h; the photosynthetic rate was decreased by 40 %. Inhibition of photosynthesis was accompanied by photoinhibition, increased reduction of photosystem II, and higher thylakoid energization. Fe excess seemed to stimulate photorespiration because catalase activity doubled. To cope with cellular damage, respiration rate increased and cytosolic glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity more than doubled. Simultaneously, the content of free hexoses was reduced. Indicative of generation of oxidative stress was doubling of ascorbate peroxidase activity within 12 h. Contents of the antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione were reduced by 30 %, resulting in equivalent increases of dehydroascorbate and oxidized glutathione. Taken together, moderate changes in leaf Fe content have a dramatic effect on plant metabolism.

Our results show that photosynthesis is already affected after 12 h of both treatments and that photoinhibition is induced. Furthermore, the two treatments showed distinct patterns of induction of the genes of the antioxidant systems. Principally, NaCl stimulated catalase activity through activation of the Cat 2 and Call genes, whereas with CuSO 4, transcript levels, protein levels, and enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were differentially induced. The antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione were found to be largely oxidized after 12 h, suggesting an inability of the recycling process to cope with the stress, In addition, both NaCl and CuSO 4 treatments stimulated the accumulation of the osmolyte proline, Therefore, we conclude that the uptake and accumulation of different types of ions lead to the generation of distinct antioxidant responses in N. plumbaginifolia. status: publishe...|$|E
