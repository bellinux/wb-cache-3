The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} new methodology of data analysis based on phase space graphs of temperature and enthalpy, collected by means of multidistributed, low cost and autonomous wireless sensors and loggers. A transoceanic refrigerated transport of lemons in a <b>reefer</b> <b>container</b> ship from Montevideo (Uruguay) to Cartagena (Spain) was monitored with a network of 39 semi-passive TurboTag RFID loggers and 13 i-button loggers. Transport included intermodal transit from transoceanic to short shipping vessels and a truck trip. Data analysis is carried out using qualitative phase diagrams computed on the basis of Takens?Ruelle reconstruction of attractors. Fruit stress is quantified in terms of the phase diagram area which characterizes the cyclic behaviour of temperature. Areas within the enthalpy phase diagram computed for the short sea shipping transport were 5 times higher than those computed for the long sea shipping, with coefficients of variation above 100 % for both periods.

Currently, {{almost all the}} containers produced by Tonglee are exported. Since {{the establishment of the}} company in 1994, HCFC- 141 b has been the sole blowing agent technology for polyurethane foam used in the company. However, some zero ODP blowing agent technologies have been tried to replace the HCFC- 141 b during the last two years. Now, HFC- 365 mfc/ 227 ea (93 %/ 7 %) accounts for nearly 15 % of the total blowing agents used in Tonglee. Compared with cyclopentane and HFC- 245 fa, HFC- 365 mfc/ 227 ea can be used with the same foaming equipment that uses HCFC 141 b without any investment in the equipment. However, since the price of HFC- 365 mfc/ 227 ea is about 5 - 6 times higher than that of HCFC- 141 b, the replacement is only limited to those containers whose foaming agent is specified as HFC- 365 mfc/ 227 ea by overseas end users. Additionally, the customers must be prepared to assume the extra cost themselves. In order to reduce the cost of using HFC- 365 mfc/ 227 ea and help accelerate the phase out of HCFC- 141 b, Huntsman, in collaboration with Tonglee, developed a polyurethane system that reduces the usage of HFC- 365 mfc/ 227 ea by 20 % without negative impact on processing and foam properties.

40|$|Like {{many other}} fruits, table grapes depend on {{accurate}} temperature management during transport in maritime refrigerated containers. Ideally the temperature inside the container {{is equal to}} set point in every location in the container. Unfortunately door-end temperatures are always higher due to poor air flow distribution. In climate chamber tests Lukasse & Staal (2016 a and 2016 b) investigated the effect of covering sections of the container’s T-bar floor. The best T-bar floor cover found in that study was a trapezoid-shape floor cover. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the effect of that trapezoid-shape T-bar floor cover on temperature and fruit quality in commercial <b>reefer</b> <b>container</b> transports of grapes.

The three test containers contained a T-bar floor cover. The three reference containers did not contain the T-bar floor cover. All other parameters were, to the extent possible, the same for all containers. In 31 locations air temperature between the fruit was logged at an interval of 10 min. with an accuracy of approx. ± 0. 1 °C. 15 Trays, evenly distributed in a vertical plane on the container’s longitudinal centre line, were weighed at origin and at destination.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{international}} trade via sea has increased continuously and massively. As a consequence, shipments of commodities have expanded and changed: the volumes of cargo {{carried by the}} specialised bulk fleets have been gradually eroded by the growing competition of global container operators. It turns out that container stakeholders have attracted {{the majority of the}} cargo flows since they work together in various forms. This strategy is based on synergies, improving returns to scale and scope. The increasing trade of goods and the containerisation have generated new problems to solve for the global system of transportation. Not only maritime actors, but also ports have changed their role as nodes in a global network, allowing the interconnection between the foreland with the hinterland. Currently there are emerging association structures even in the hinterland transportation system. Indeed, demand of global transport is located in hinterlands turning this environment highly competitive. The historical development of strategic forms of collaborations has been observed at the maritime and port side. They emerged due to economic and logistics advantages. These advantages become more important whenever many modes, many actors and many network components provide similar services. Contrarily to the main stream in global trade, the transport and logistics chain of bananas seems to develop contrarily. These flows are still opposing to the main trend caused by the phenomenon of containerisation. However, also the association of actors has always being present in the banana trade. In this case, stakeholders are interested in still receiving the benefits of the banana trade. The main finding is that the market power is owned by the multi-nationals who continue to be integrated and control the whole supply chain. That is why the supply providers have started to collaborate and to associate also in different forms in order to grab a part of the market power located at the demand side. The reason is simple, there is a slight difference in prices and a simple cost calculation can be done for revealing the economic benefits and to show the market power of every actor involved. In order to investigate the role of actors in freight and transportation and its main dynamics, this paper has been divided into four sections. An overview of the collaboration forms in the shipping industry considering the main actors and their strategies been provided in section two. The third section is focused on the income that every actor involved in the banana cold chain receives, and a real case illustrates the costs for transporting a <b>reefer</b> <b>container</b> and a bulk reefer. Results show that a coordination of supply actors enforces competition between both ways for shipping reefer products. Finally, in section four some conclusions are drawn on the complete analysis, mainly concerning economic aspects of association structures among global actorsassociation structures, dynamic supply, cooperation, reefer...|$|E

Over {{the last decade}} international seatransport of fruit and vegetables in <b>reefer</b> <b>containers</b> has grown tremendously. <b>Reefer</b> <b>containers</b> may completely close the cold chain only if produce quality inspection is automated. The observation of this growing need for automatic produce quality monitoring has triggered this research. The aim is twofold: to reveal a correlation between fruit gas exchange rates and actual produce quality aspects (1) and to automatically monitor fruit's gas exchange rates in containers from one-point gas concentration measurements only (2). Large experimental datasets have been collected to assess the correlation between respiration, ethylene production and ripeness-related firmness for Elstar apples. Both simulations and experiments have been done to test the feasibility of monitoring (variations in) respiratory activity over time. On the one hand the results prove that both objectives are feasible, at least for Elstar apples. On the other hand some uncertainties remain: 1. Uncertainty in the observed correlation between gas exchange rates and apple firmness, 2.

50|$|Refrigerated cargo is a {{key part}} of the income for some {{shipping}} companies. On multi-purpose ships, refrigerated containers are mostly carried above deck, as they have to be checked for proper operation. Also, a major part of the refrigeration system (such as a compressor) may fail, which would have to be replaced or unplugged quickly in the event of a fire. Modern container vessels stow the <b>reefer</b> <b>containers</b> in cellguides with adjacent inspection walkways that enable <b>reefer</b> <b>containers</b> to be carried in the holds as well as on the deck. Modern refrigerated container vessels are designed to incorporate a water-cooling system for containers stowed under deck. This does not replace the refrigeration system but facilitates cooling down of the external machinery. Containers stowed on the exposed upper deck are air-cooled, while those under deck are water-cooled. The water cooling design allows capacity loads of refrigerated containers under deck as it enables the dissipation of the high amount of heat they generate. This system draws fresh water from the ship's water supply, which in turn transfers the heat through heat exchangers to the abundantly available sea water.|$|R
