40|$|In this report, a <b>reversible</b> <b>control</b> of Fe₃O₄ {{saturated}} magnetization by Li ions is demonstrated. A miniature Li ion battery (LIB) was assembled using a Fe₃O₄ nanoparticle layer as {{the active}} cathode. A stable magnetism modulation is realized by a nondestructive electrochemical {{process in which}} the lithium insertion results in a valence change and partial redistribution of Fe cations in the crystal structure. The relation between the discharge voltage and the chemical phases were studied by ex situ X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurement. In a suitable discharge potential range, a <b>reversible</b> <b>control</b> of Fe₃O₄ saturated magnetization was obtained without structural damage to the magnetic electrode. The experimental results indicate by further optimizing the LIB 2 ̆ 7 s performance, a large reversible change in magnetization could be realized at room temperature, suggesting the potential for future practical applications...|$|E

30|$|Investigation of the {{aforementioned}} PL quenching and shifting, especially the <b>reversible</b> <b>control</b> of these processes, is of significant interest for both fundamental research and technical applications, which are implemented either by electrochemical electron injection or by ionic adsorption. The pioneering work on the electrochemical control of QDs was performed by Wang et al. [17], leading {{to the discovery of}} a mid-infrared absorption corresponding to an intraband transition, a bleach of the visible intraband exciton transition, and quenching of the narrow band-edge PL. Several succeeding studies revealed various interesting optical properties of charged QDs, including the <b>reversible</b> <b>control</b> over the “on” and “off” states [18, 19], the amount of charge injected into a single QD, and the corresponding degree of bleach during absorption [19 – 22]. Recent investigations suggest that the density of trap states can be determined by the electrochemical control of the Fermi level [23, 24], and the energy level offsets in QD heterojunctions can be accurately determined in situ [25].|$|E

40|$|Microbial plant {{pathogens}} {{impose a}} continuous threat to global food production. Similar to animals, an {{innate immune system}} allows plants to recognize pathogens and swiftly activate defence. To activate a rapid response, receptor-mediated pathogen perception and subsequent downstream signalling depends on post-translational modification (PTM) of components essential for defence signalling. We discuss different types of PTMs that {{play a role in}} mounting plant immunity, which include phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, nitrosylation, myristoylation, palmitoylation and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchoring. PTMs are rapid, <b>reversible,</b> <b>controlled</b> and highly specific, and provide a tool to regulate protein stability, activity and localization. Here, we give an overview of PTMs that modify components essential for defence signalling at the site of signal perception, during secondary messenger production and during signalling in the cytoplasm. In addition, we discuss effectors from pathogens that suppress plant defence responses by interfering with host PTMs...|$|R
