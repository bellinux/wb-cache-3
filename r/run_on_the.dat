50|$|Line 2 <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right hand}} track, whereas <b>the</b> Shinbundang Line <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left hand track; {{this is because}} the Shinbundang Line is a {{national}} railway line (which typically <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left), while Line 2 is a subway line (which typically <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right in Seoul). This can be confusing to tourists making a transfer here, as many tourists are accustomed to riding <b>on</b> either <b>the</b> left-hand track or the right-hand track.|$|R
