25|$|Bone is {{constantly}} being created and replaced {{in a process}} known as remodeling. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cells are stimulated by a variety of signals, and together referred to as a remodeling unit. Approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair microdamaged bones from everyday stress, and to shape the skeleton during growth.. <b>Repeated</b> <b>stress,</b> such as weight-bearing exercise or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress (Wolff's law). It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's piezoelectric properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.|$|E

After she recovered, she came second behind Gabriele Andersen at the California International Marathon in Sacramento and her time gained her qualification into the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Trial. The trial race was highly competitive as it came at a time of a burgeoning women's running scene in the United States and, as well as being on home soil, it was the first time the marathon was to be held for women at the Summer Olympics. Cooksey achieved a significant personal record time of 2:35:42 hours at the trial race in Olympia, Washington, but this was only enough for thirteenth place overall. Injuries yet again spoilt her 1985 and 1986 seasons, although she won the American 5K road title in the latter year.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess whether the {{prevalence}} of inducible myocardial ischemia increases over time in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Participants enrolled in the Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics (DIAD) study underwent repeat adenosine-stress myo-cardial perfusion imaging 3 years after initial evaluation. Patients with intervening cardiac events or revascularization and those who were unable or unwilling to <b>repeat</b> <b>stress</b> imaging were exc luded. RESULTS — Of the initial 522 DIAD patients, 358 had <b>repeat</b> <b>stress</b> imaging (DIAD- 2), of whom 71 (20 %) had ischemia at enrollment (DIAD- 1). Of 287 patients with normal DIAD- 1 studies, 259 (90 %) remained normal in DIAD- 2, whereas 28 (10 %) developed new ischemia in DIAD- 2. Of the 71 patients with abnormal DIAD- 1 studies, 56 (79 %) demonstrated resolution of ischemia, whereas 15 (21 %) remained abnormal. During this 3 -year interval, medical treat-ment was intensified, with more patients using statins, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors than at baseline.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that fear can contribute to behavioral changes. One way this phenomenon has been studied is {{on the basis of}} the <b>repeated</b> <b>stress</b> model done by Camp RM et al.(among others). In this particular study, it was examined that the contribution fear conditioning may play a huge role in altering an animal's (Fischer rat's) behavior in a <b>repeated</b> <b>stress</b> paradigm. Behavioral changes that are commonly referred to as depressive-like behaviors resulted from this model of testing. After setting a control and a valid experimental design, Fischer rats were exposed daily to different stressors in a complex environment. After four days of stressor exposure, both exploratory behavior and social interaction were tested on day 5 in either the same environment or a new environment. The rats showed much decreased exploration and social interaction when tested in different contexts compared to control rats. To further make a correlation to the biochemistry (as mentioned below), chronic infusion of propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) prevented the behavioral changes following repeated stressor exposure thus halting long term potentiation. Some physiological changes also occurred including the decrease in body weight gain and adrenal hypertrophy observed in animals exposed to stress. Overall, the conditioned fear responses can contribute to behavioral changes in a <b>repeated</b> <b>stress</b> paradigm. This can be extended to correlate to other animals as well but with varying degrees of responses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we report}} the {{characterization}} of springback degradation of an Invar sheet {{with a combination of}} gamma-ray irradiation and <b>repeated</b> hot-then-cold <b>stresses.</b> The springback factor value of fresh Invar without radiation shows a linear increase with the number of hot-then-cold stress cycles. Continuous springback degradations are observed as the number of hot-then-cold stress cycles reaches 100. When the Invar sheet is subjected to gamma-ray irradiation, the springback factor is greater than that of the <b>repeated</b> hot-then-cold <b>stressed</b> samples. After applying the <b>repeated</b> hot-then-cold <b>stresses</b> to the post-irradiated Invar sheets, the springback factors are first restored to the value of fresh Invar, and then revert to an increasing trend. Our previous X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis excluded the crystalline structural changes in the post-irradiated Invar. It is believed that the radiation-induced defects, which are closely related to the springback degradation, are possibly annealed during the first 20 hot-then-cold stress cycles. These cycles ultimately dominate the springback behavior of the stressed Invar sheets...|$|R
