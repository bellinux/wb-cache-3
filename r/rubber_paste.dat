50|$|Synthetic rubber is used a {{great deal}} in {{printing}} on textiles, in which case it is called <b>rubber</b> <b>paste.</b> In most cases titanium dioxide is used with copolymerization and volatile matter in producing such synthetic rubber for textile use. Moreover, this kind of preparation can be considered to be the pigment preparation based on titanium dioxide.|$|E
30|$|The {{low-temperature}} resistance {{performance of}} asphalt mortar becomes worse {{with the increase}} of filler–bitumen ratio, especially when the ratio increases from 1.2 to 1.4. Its performance falls fast at low temperature, and the decrease of temperature also has a great influence on the stiffness modulus of <b>rubber</b> <b>paste.</b>|$|E
30|$|The DSR test is {{generally}} {{used to evaluate}} the high-temperature characteristics of asphalt mortar [1, 3, 5]. When flat spacing is twice larger than the maximum diameter of rubber cement {{and the size of the}} added grain is not more than 0.250  mm, the DSR can be used to test <b>rubber</b> <b>paste</b> properties [12, 13, 14].|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  6, it is {{seen that}} with the {{increase}} of filler–bitumen ratio, creep stiffness modulus increases; that is, the low-temperature anti-cracking performance of the mortar becomes worse {{with the increase of}} filler–bitumen ratio. At the same time, the temperature also has a great impact on the <b>rubber</b> <b>paste’s</b> stiffness modulus when it decreases. Amplitude of creep rate does not reduce significantly. Hence the filler–bitumen ratio of asphalt mortar with additive SW can be a little larger than that of SB.|$|R
25|$|The Zoozoos are small-bodied, thin women {{covered in}} layers of white fabric. Each facial {{expression}} {{is made of}} <b>rubber</b> and <b>pasted</b> on the actors {{to cut down on}} the time and cost for shoot. The effect was achieved by a variety of methods including choosing the right material for the body suits to ensure that there were no wrinkles when the characters moved, shooting the footage at lower framerates and keeping backgrounds simple in terms of details and the use of a neutral tone of grey. The sets were made larger than life to make the characters look small as the producers could not take children as the schedule of shooting was odd.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{amphetamine}} on neuromuscular synaptic transmission observed in this laboratory (1) suggested {{the possibility of}} an action of this drug on the autonomic ganglion. After a study of the effect on the ganglion, it was thought of interest to extend this investigation to synapses of the central nervous system. METHOD. The stellate ganglion was chosen because of the facility with which the post synaptic potentials can be registered. Cats anesthetized intraperitoneally with a sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal) -urethanc solution (Nembutal 0. 3 gm. for 1 cc. of 25 per cent urethane solution, 1 cc. per kgm. of body weight) were used. The ganglion was isolated according to the technique used by Larrabec and Bronk (2), its circulation being pre served. It was stimulated with silver electrodes (protected with <b>rubber</b> insulating <b>paste)</b> placed between the second and third dorsal vertebrae. The response was picked up by electrodes, similar to those described, or the type used by Sherrington, placed on the inferiorcardiac nerves. Amphetamine sulfate (Merck) was injected in the subclavian artery,which was ligatedat itsdistalend; allitscollateralsother than that to the ganglion were tiedoff...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{finishing}} {{and polishing}} of composite restaurations are procedures that enhance {{the quality of}} restorations and reduce plaque accumulation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate with SEM analysis the effect of different polishing methods and instruments of composite surface after polishing. We used different instruments for finishing and polishing: carbide tungsten burs, diamond fissural burs, steel fissural burs, Lo-Flex Pop On discs, Sof-Lex Pop On discs, Hawe rubber cups, gray rubber cups, green rubber cups, polishing strips, polishing pastes. The results we obtained showed that the most efficient polishing of composite restorations was achieved after treatment with Sof-Lex discs, <b>rubber</b> cups and <b>pastes.</b> Treatment with carbide tungsten burs, was the least effective, producing the lowest smoothness of composite surface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the {{flexural}} strength of the porcelain Duceram Plus ® (Degussa GmbH & Co), through variation of surface treatment and exposure or not to corrosive environment. Fifty six samples with standardized dimensions were fabricated on refractory boxes and divided into four groups according to the surface treatment. Group 1 remained only ground. Group 2 was submitted to natural glazing by heating the specimen to the glazing temperature. The samples from group 3 were submitted to overglazing using the porcelain Duceram Plus Glaze Material®. Samples from group 4 were polished using silicon <b>rubber</b> and diamond <b>paste</b> of 3 and 6 mm grit. Half of the specimens in each group were stored for 16 h at 80 oC in a 4 % acetic acid solution (ISO 6872). Tukey’s test (p< 0, 05) showed that the samples not submitted to corrosion, overglazing and polishing provided an increased strength {{in relation to the}} other groups. In the samples submitted to corrosion, overglazing showed a higher strength than polishing, although both of them did not show significant differences when coMPared to the other groups. Student’s t test (p< 0, 05) showed that glazed and overglazed porcelains did not have their strengths altered due to corrosion effects. Corrosion showed to diminish strength of samples submitted to polishing and enhanced strength of the samples submitted to grinding...|$|R
40|$|This study aims are to i) {{understand}} {{and improve the}} bonding characteristics between crumb <b>rubber</b> and cement <b>paste,</b> and ii) scale-up {{the use of the}} material from lab to full-sized reinforced sections. Firstly a parametric investigation was conducted to determine the effect of crumb rubber replacement on the fresh, mechanical and thermo-physical properties of Plain Rubberised Concrete (PRC) and Self-compacting Rubberised Concrete (SCRC) at different w/c ratios. Secondly, the relative effects of different pre-coating/ treating methodologies were evaluated in terms of ITZ porosity, interfacial bonding, and mix air entrapment. These micro structural characteristics were compared to the resultant macro- scale mechanical and dynamic properties in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} each treatment method. Thirdly, the large-scale serviceability of steel-reinforced PRC and SCRC was experimentally measured and assessed in terms of mechanical structural behaviour, steel reinforcement bond-slip strength, and material durability including chloride ion diffusion and water penetration. It was found that although crumb rubber incorporation decreases the workability/flowability, compactible mixes could be achieved even with zero-slump. Mortar pre-coating was found to be the most effective surface treatment method in improving both the mechanical behaviour and toughness of PRC and SCRC. It caused an elongation in the micro-crack path length at the rubber/ cement interface due to roughening of the surface morphology, leading to increased fracture energy dissipation! stress relaxation. Crumb rubber incorporation led to unusual thermo-physical properties as thermal conductivity decreased whilst volumetric heat capacity increased, with a pronounced moisture-dependency caused by air entrapment. Consequently, the concrete elements were found to store more heat energy, whilst increasing their resistance to heat exchange with the ambient environment. Interestingly, incorporating crumb rubber offers a significant reduction in interior air temperature fluctuations, which is important in terms of building thermal efficiency and comfort. It was found that both PRC and SCRC could be promising structural materials, with preference to SRCR, to be used for casting indoor-use structural members, especially for domestic buildings.
