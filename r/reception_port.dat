50|$|A {{new plan}} {{to manage the}} waste must be found and ships must be {{encouraged}} to use the <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities rather than to discharge waste anywhere in the ocean. As a response, the European Community adopted the Directive 2000/59/EC on <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities {{with the goal of}} eliminating discharges of ship-generated residues into the ocean. The Directive is especially aimed at increasing the prevalence and use of <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities, thereby securing a cleaner and more sustainable marine environment. These ideologies were previously addressed by the MARPOL 73/78 Convention in 1973, however Member States are still encountering difficulties in fully implementing the requirements.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the charging systems for the use of <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for waste oil, and to examine the potential impact of the charging elements of the new (late 2000) EU Directive on <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues.

50|$|The {{first half}} of MARPOL Annex I deals with engine room waste. There are various generations of {{technologies}} and equipment {{that have been developed}} to prevent waste such as: Oily water separators (OWS), Oil Content meters (OCM), and <b>Port</b> <b>Reception</b> Facilities.|$|R
40|$|The paper investogates {{the recent}} {{developments}} in exhaust gas cleaning systems and the growing interests in scrubber installation among ferry and ro-ro shipowners operating on the Baltic Sea. This technology creates the need for reception of scrubber sludge, which is produced alongside with gas cleaning. The study states that {{the information about the}} disposal of scrubber waste is largely limited or vague and evaluates – {{on the basis of a}} questionnaire - the availability of <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for the disposal of waste from sulphur scrubbers at major Baltic Sea ports. The paper concludes that a review of current legislature on <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities is absolutely necessary and expresses the hope that the situation will improve in the wake of recent environmental regulations...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the results of a survey of the availability and uptake of <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities within the North Sea area. The evaluation is based primarily on original survey data from the autumn of 2002 which followed on from a similar survey conducted in the summer of 2000. The EU Directive on <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for ship-generated waste etc. (Directive 2000 / 59 /EC) was due to enter into force in December 2002, and required all EU <b>ports</b> to provide <b>reception</b> facilities to meet the needs of the vessels normally calling in at them.

40|$|The {{ability to}} comply fully with the {{discharge}} requirements {{set out in}} the MARPOL 73 / 78 Convention depends upon the availability of adequate facilities on land for the reception of shipgenerated waste. This paper considers ways of ensuring adequate provision of reception facilities, and discusses the approach taken by the UK {{to reduce the amount of}} pollution entering the marine environment from the deliberate discharge of waste from ships. Arguably, the most significant of the measures adopted by the UK is the requirement for all ports and harbours to prepare port waste management plans. Disincentives to the use of <b>port</b> waste <b>reception</b> facilities are examined, together with the benefits and shortcomings of various financing arrangements, and compulsory discharge of waste in ports. The paper concludes that the statutory approach to improving the provision and use of waste facilities should be supported by an appropriate awareness campaign to educate shipowners about the need to discharge waste legally to <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities. <b>Port</b> waste <b>reception</b> facilities MARPOL 73 / 78 Port waste management planning...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} step was when IMO published their Standard Format for the Advanced Notification Form for Waste Delivery to <b>Port</b> <b>Reception</b> Facilities.

40|$|This report offers {{guidelines}} {{for the provision of}} adequate <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for vessel-generated garbage under the requirements of Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, 1973 (MARPOL 73 / 78), Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships. MARPOL Annex V prohibits at-sea disposal of plastic materials from vessels, and specifies the distance from shore at which other materials may be dumped. Annex V also requires the provision of <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for garbage, but it does not specify these facilities or how they are to be provided. Since the at-sea dumping restrictions apply to all vessels, the reception facility requirement applies to all ports, terminals, and marinas that serve vessels.

The report synthesizes available information and draws upon experience from the first years ofimplementation of MARPOL Annex V. (PDF file contains 55 pages. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the current availability of <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities within the North Sea area. The evaluation is based primarily on original survey data from the summer of 2001, supplemented by existing information from surveys conducted by the International Maritime Organization. The EU Directive on <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for ship-generated waste etc. (Directive 2000 / 59 /EC) requires that all ports provide facilities to meet the needs of those vessels normally calling in at them. In order for the Directive to be implemented effectively, the physical availability of such facilities is vital. This paper audits the wide range of port types within the region and also outlines the wide range of vessel types using these ports, and their requirements for a range of facilities. On the basis of this analysis, conclusions are drawn about the extent to which the provision requirement of the Directive is already being met...|$|R
25|$|It is also {{possible}} for ships to discharge ballast at approved shore <b>reception</b> facilities in <b>ports,</b> as article 5 requires that when cleaning or repair of a ships ballast tanks occurs, ports should have adequate reception facilities for the sediments.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{centered}} on The Role of Effective Ports Management in Facilitating International trade in Nigeria. The specific purpose of the paper {{is to examine the}} role played by various agencies involved in Ports management in Nigeria, and how far such functions have helped in facilitating International trade; which is recognized as a major pivot on which economic development revolves. Essentially, no nation can achieve economic development in isolation, hence the need for cross boarder trade transactions. The ports in Nigeria are the avenues through which imports and exports take place. This study made use of survey research design, with a sample size of 286, out of a population of 1000 made up of various stakeholders in ports management and usage. It relied on Chi-Square statistical test to determine relationship between the role of effective ports management and successful international trade transaction. Among others, it was found that there is a direct relationship between adequate <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities, <b>ports</b> decongestion, less traffic, secure and safe ports (which form the nucleus of good management) and successful international trade. The study therefore, agrees that effective and efficient ports management in Nigeria is a strong panacea in oiling the wheel of international trade. It therefore recommends that concerted efforts should be made by government and other relevant agencies to ensure efficient and effectives management of ports in Nigeria to enhance uninterrupted international trade...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative <b>reception.</b> Majesco's <b>port</b> {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|R

5000|$|In March 2006, MEPC 54 {{emphasized}} {{the value of}} reception facilities that would exceed expectations {{in the implementation of}} MARPOL, and introduced a policy of [...] "zero tolerance of illegal discharges from ships" [...] that could only be enforced when there were adequate <b>reception</b> facilities in <b>ports.</b> Therefore, the Committee urged all Parties to MARPOL, particularly port States, to fulfill their treaty obligations to provide reception facilities for wastes generated during the normal operation of ships.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the need for the new (summer 2000) EU Directive on <b>Port</b> <b>Reception</b> Facilities for Ship-Generated Waste and Cargo Residues. A core issue is the extent to which the new Directive duplicates provisions already in place (the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, and the Bonn Agreement) through which all EU member states make available <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities for the disposal of all types of waste from ships in ports, and undertake inspection and monitoring. This includes provision of facilities for timely reception of residues and oily wastes at oil loading terminals, repair ports and other ports in which there is demand; a system of port inspections; and a system of wider monitoring and surveillance. The paper accordingly presents an analysis and critical evaluation of the provisions of the new Directive in comparison with what is already in place under existing agreements. Conclusions are drawn about the extent to which the new Directive duplicates existing provisions, and the extent to which it represents a progressive departure from what is currently there...|$|R

40|$|Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission members {{seeking to}} {{implement}} MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex IV amendments which recognize the Baltic Sea as special are, in which discharge of uncommitted sewage from passenger ships is forbidden, {{must ensure that}} ports are equipped with adequate reception facilities. To ensure implementation of amendments of Annex IV in port of Klaipeda, the analysis framework model was defined by authors. The model evaluates the readiness of the port to changes brought by the amendments of MARPOL Annex IV. The scientific problem comes with perception of adequacy. Resolution MEPC. 200 (62) amending MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex IV states, that <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities must be adequate {{to the needs of}} passenger ships using them without causing undue delay. Concept of adequacy is not defined, therefore other guidelines explaining adequacy were used: EU directive 2000 / 59 /EC and IMO resolution MEPC. 83 (44) Guidelines for ensuring adequacy of <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities. Based on these sources, criteria that must be met to ensure adequacy were identified and tested in article: 1) reception facilities meet needs of ships normally using them; 2) discharge of sewage does to cause undue delay; 3) reception facilities does not provide disincentive to use them; 4) facilities are accessible; 5) facilities contribute to the improvement of the marine environment...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{follow up study}} which was carried out at the Linne University of Kalmar in 2008, which looked at garbage {{management}} and its integration between merchant vessels, <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities and the local council. That study was undertaken by Lundgren Lindberg & Roysson. They focused their attention on the integration between vessels calling {{at the port of}} Kalmar, the port of Kalmar and Kalmar council. The {{purpose of this study is}} to see whether conditions at two other Swedish ports can be compared with the results which were achieved in the study of 2008 and to look at conditions five years on and see if things have improved or if the same problems still remain. It should be note that the international regulations concerning garbage management on board in the case of what and where may be discharged over board vessels have become more stringent with the implementation of the revised version of Marpol annex V, MEPC, 201 (62), as well as EMSA (European Maritime Safety Agency) directives on <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities within the EU and which basically follow Marpol. On the other hand regulations concerning garbage management in Swedish ports are still regulated by SJÖFS. 2001 : 12 (Sjöfartsverkets Författningssamling) As with Lundgren Lindberg & Roysson study it has been difficult to find relevant literature on said topic apart from regulatory statutes and recommendations, therefore a qualitative study will be used and for the study so as it can be comparable to the previous one as well as fair. The questions asked will be of the same nature and character as were asked in Lundgren Lindberg & Roysson report and this for the same reasons as mentioned above. The main difference of the new study is that it will look at two ports, two councils and a number of vessels. The results that this study has reached vary from ship to ship, from port to port as well as from municipality to municipality. The one thing that everybody who took part in this study could agree on is that a single standard for the handling of ship generated garbage and its integration from merchant ships to <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities and the local councils is missing. The systems which are in place today work satisfactorily but have certain problems with fractioning the different types of waste and are they sorted incorrectly, problems will arise all the way through the transportation chain. Certain principals have solved these problems by having manned <b>port</b> <b>reception</b> facilities and others have left it up to the crews on board the vessels that they will sort the garbage the way the port wishes it to be sorted. The problems do not seem to take any out of the ordinary proportions if only two ports are considered, but should the merchant fleet worldwide be considered, these proportions would grow alarmingly...|$|R
