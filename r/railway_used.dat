5|$|The {{station was}} built with a {{connection}} to the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway, with the platform sunk below ground level; consequently there are considerable gradients leaving the station. The Metropolitan <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> the station as a terminus from 1 February 1875 until 11 July 1875; their own underground station opened on 12 July 1875.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Street {{had been}} {{designed}} to integrate with the expanding London Underground network, and served as the new terminus for the Metropolitan Railway which extended east from Moorgate. From 1874 to 1875 the Metropolitan <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> the Liverpool Street main-line station as a terminus; on 12 July 1875 the company opened their own station, initially called Bishopsgate. Subsurface platforms 1 and 2, were opened in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter <b>Railway,</b> <b>used</b> the east pier.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|The <b>railway</b> <b>used</b> steam {{locomotives}} {{from the}} start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two locomotives, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from Fletcher, Jennings & Co. of Whitehaven in Cumbria, {{and both are}} still in service, 150years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn's rare gauge {{is thought to have}} been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway, and the line's two original steam locomotives were among the earliest locomotives built for such a narrow gauge. No.1 Talyllyn is an 0-4-2ST (saddle tank) and No.2 Dolgoch is an 0-4-0WT (well tank). The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn {{to the foot of the}} Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with MN28 {{on the eastern}} edge of Beardsley and heads south. From here, MN7 passes through farm fields before turning southeasterly along the shore of Big Stone Lake. The lake {{is the source of the}} Minnesota River and forms the Minnesotaâ€“South Dakota state line in Big Stone County. The highway in this area is also a part of the Minnesota River Valley Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and a Minnesota State Scenic Byway. The road turns eastward along a bend in the lake near the community of Foster before running further inland around Big Stone Lake State Park. Past the park, MN7 curves to the south along the shore and continues to Ortonville. The highway follows 2nd Street through town along the lake shore and through residential neighborhoods. South of the end of the lake, MN7 merges with US12, and the two highways run concurrently for about a couple blocks. South of town, MN7 merges onto US75 and the combined highway runs along the Minnesota River. The roadway also runs parallel to a line of the BNSF <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad in the area. East of the Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge and the town of Odessa, US75 and the scenic byway turn south to cross the river, separating from MN7 which continues along the northern banks of the river.|$|E

25|$|The line {{opened in}} 1812; {{it was made}} as a double track line, as a plateway, in which the rails were L-shaped in cross section; wagons with plain wheels could use the line. The <b>railway</b> <b>used</b> horses for traction; a {{locomotive}} was tried, {{but it was too}} heavy and broke the plates. Passengers were carried by independent hauliers.|$|E

The fleet also worked services on the Great Northern route, from London King's Cross to Cambridge, Peterborough, Hertford, Stevenage and King's Lynn, plus at weekends when {{the line to}} Moorgate was closed, the units operated inner suburban services from London King's Cross to Letchworth Garden City, Hertford and Welwyn Garden City.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} was {{the lifeblood}} of the town in the early years. Canadian Pacific <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> to provide passenger train service to the town until the early 1960s. Since then travel to and from town is done almost exclusively by automobile. Today Provincial Highway 39 travels through town making a quick and convenient drive to Weyburn, as well as Regina and Moose Jaw. Twice daily passenger bus service used to be provided by STC, the provincially owned bus line, until STC ceased operations in May 2017.|$|E
25|$|The {{line has}} been used several times as the test route for new types of small rail transport. The Great Western <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> both autotrains {{and one of the}} early railcars on this route, and in December 2005 the route began being used to test the Parry People Mover, a highly {{energy-efficient}} railcar, to provide the Sunday service. The experiment has been sufficiently successful {{to the extent that the}} Sunday service in June 2006 was included in both the Network Rail printed timetables and Internet site, and now runs on a permanent basis.|$|E

25|$|The Tralee and Dingle Light Railway {{was once}} one of Europe's most western {{railways}} when it opened on 31 March 1891 connecting Tralee and Dingle by rail along the Dingle Peninsula before closing in June 1953. In 1993 a 3km section was reopened as a preserved line between the Aquadome in Tralee and Blennerville Windmill. Currently this railway {{is no longer in}} operation. A <b>railway</b> <b>used</b> to operate to Fenit Harbour from Tralee before closing in June 1978. Currently a section of this railway has been restored as a walk/cycle way in the Tralee urban area and it is hoped in the future that this will extend out to Fenit {{along the lines of the}} Great Southern Trail situated in West Limerick.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} freight yards on Staten Island, Arlington and Saint George, were at capacity, and in 1912, {{to ease the}} congestion, the B began running freight into Jersey City on the Jersey Central. The B profited from the heavy coal trade that {{operated}} via the lines on Staten Island. In 1920, 4,000,000 tons of freight had been handled on the railway. In addition, passenger traffic on the line increased. Between 1903 and 1920, daily trips on the North Shore Branch increased from 50 to 65, from 50 to 60 on the South Beach Branch, and from 22 to 34 on the Tottenville Branch. In 1920, 65 trains ran daily on the North Shore Branch, 60 trains ran daily on the South Beach Branch, and 34 trains ran daily on the Main Line or Tottenville Branch. A majority of the passengers of the <b>railway</b> <b>used</b> the North Shore and South Beach branches. In 1920, 8,000,000 passengers used the North Shore and South Beach branches, while 5,000,000 passengers used the main line. Up until the year 1921, 3,369,400 trains had been operated on the SIRT {{and there had been}} no fatalities.|$|E
500|$|A railway {{to serve}} Deeside was {{authorised}} on 16 July 1846, {{but it was}} decided to wait for the Aberdeen Railway to open first. The company survived after the railway mania as the Aberdeen Railway bought a large number of shares. Interest in the line was restored after Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, to which the Royal Family made their first visit in 1848, and the Aberdeen Railway was able to sell its shares. Investors were still hard to find, but a [...] line as far as Banchory was ceremonially opened on 7 September 1853; public services began the following day with three trains a day that took about an hour. First class accommodation was available for d a mile, reduced to 1d a mile for third class. Initially services were operated by the Aberdeen Railway to its terminus at Ferryhill, and the Deeside <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> a horse to shunt wagons at Banchory. In 1854 the Deeside introduced its own rolling stock and ran through to the Aberdeen's Guild Street station which opened the same year.|$|E

500|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} was trialled on {{carriages}} in the 1880s and this became standard in 1891. As the Highland <b>Railway</b> <b>used</b> vacuum brakes, carriages {{used on the}} Aberdeen to Inverness were dual-fitted. The livery changed in the late 1890s, when the upper half was painted cream and the lower purple lake, with gold lining and lettering. Corridor carriages, [...] long on six wheels, lit with electric lamps using Stone's system and with both classes having access to a lavatory appeared in 1896. Bogie corridor carriages, [...] long and weighing [...] were built for the Aberdeen to Inverness express in 1898 with provision for vestibule connections. The Great North also had Royal Saloon carriage that, unusually for the Great North, was built with a clerestory roof. This was [...] long, lit by electric lamps and with steam heating, and divided into a first class compartment and an attendant's coupe, which was fitted with a cooking stove. Later, shorter six-wheeled and bogie compartment carriages were built for secondary services, and communication cords and steam heating were fitted {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century. No. 34, a 6-wheel carriage built in the 1890s is preserved at the Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway as part of the Stately Trains collection.|$|E
