30|$|To offer {{multimedia}} {{services in}} mobile hotspots, many challenging issues {{need to be}} addressed due to high mobility and fast channel fading. A link adaptation scheme is developed in [4] for the WiMAX-based downlink of the mobile hotspot between the WiMAX BS and the AP mounted in the vehicle. Both the BS and AP are equipped with the multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) antenna system. The proposed adaptation algorithm selects an appropriate burst profile for the MIMO transmission mode and the modulation and coding settings to maximize downlink throughput. Another link-layer solution for mobile hotspots is discussed in [5]. It is based on a novel architecture called information raining, in which a number of repeaters are placed along the railway track and multiple antennas are installed on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches.</b> Downlink packets are decomposed into smaller fragments and relayed to the vehicle via multiple adjacent repeaters. A heuristic algorithm matches repeaters with antennas to optimize the throughput.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story was}} based on an {{incident}} of 11th April, 1800, when the Chatham and Rochester coach was emerging from the gateway of the Golden Cross - [...] "a young woman, sitting on the top, threw her head back, to prevent her striking against the beam; but there being so much luggage on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> as to hinder her laying herself sufficiently back, it caught her face, and tore the flesh in a dreadful manner" ...|$|R
50|$|Rescuers {{came from}} the {{neighbourhood}} of the crash, including many workers from the nearby Harland and Wolff Shipyard.

Buses also illuminated the scene using their headlights.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} {{was founded in}} 1914 by Archie Palmer with a horse-drawn coach to transport passengers and groceries, newspapers and mail. Bags were carried on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> and a return trip would cost 2 shillings. A Model-T Ford was the first motorised bus to be acquired and {{was followed by a}} Chevrolet in 1948. The bus service ran twice daily in each direction between Yarramalong and Wyong but services were sometimes cancelled because of flooding in the Yarramalong Valley.|$|R
50|$|With the sheriff’s meager forces {{unable to}} {{themselves}} control the crowd, Paterson’s Mayor Graham and Sheriff Van Voorhies called upon the greatly revered Paterson Roman Catholic priest Father William N. McNulty, {{the moral authority}} of whose exhortations to the crowd were sufficient to temporarily quell or distract that mob, while sheriff’s deputies extricated the constable and the Dalzells {{from the rear of}} the second house and placed them in a transport coach. To prevent the passengers stoning, this brave Father McNulty, then mounted the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach.</b> Some few <b>of</b> the mob did still chase and jump onto the sides <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> as it swiftly fled the scene, but were clubbed off by the constables.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{estimates for the}} line had assumed a dominant goods traffic, approximately balanced from Dundee and to Dundee. In fact passenger traffic became remarkably buoyant, notwithstanding the lack of attraction at Newtyle. The company introduced a variety of season tickets, and workmen's fares conveying sheep shearers at cheap rates as well as excursionists. The original passenger coaches {{were said to be}} old stage coach bodies set on trucks. [...] "Outside" [...] passengers travelled on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coaches.</b> In fact Marshall states that two old [...] "Tally-Ho" [...] coaches that had been operating on the Perth turnpike, which were fixed to a wagon chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{carriage}} is of {{the type}} known as a Berlin. It is constructed substantially of wood, which is richly carved, ornamented and gilded. The body <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> {{is attached to the}} undercarriage by four thick leather straps, each held in place by a huge, intricately decorated gilt buckle featuring the City's coat <b>of</b> arms. The <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> is red painted with gilded ornamentation; there was formerly a central carved feature (depicting four boys holding baskets of fruit) only the base of which now remains. There is a large box seat in front for the coachman, whose foot-rest is {{in the shape of a}} scallop shell. The Lord Mayor's Coach has undergone a number of programs of restorations, with the wheels being replaced three times between 1711 and 1731 alone.|$|R
60|$|Registering {{a fervent}} {{hope that there}} are no tunnels in the next half mile, I rise to my feet and walk down the train half a dozen cars. And let me say that one must leave {{timidity}} behind him on such a passear. The <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> passenger <b>coaches</b> are not made for midnight promenades. And if any one thinks they are, let me advise him to try it. Just let him walk along the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> a jolting, lurching car, with nothing to hold on to but the black and empty air, and when he comes to the down-curving end <b>of</b> the <b>roof,</b> all wet and slippery with dew, let him accelerate his speed so as to step across to the next roof, down-curving and wet and slippery. Believe me, he will learn whether his heart is weak or his head is giddy.|$|R
60|$|A lantern swung {{from the}} <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach,</b> and, turning my {{eyes from the}} mountain, in its light I saw the face of my {{travelling}} companion and--fell in love with it. I had seen it before without any such idea entering my mind; then it had been to me only {{the face of a}} rather piquante and pretty girl, but with this strange and inconvenient result, the sight of the dawn breaking upon Orizaba seemed to have worked some change in me. At least, if only for an instant, it had pierced the barrier that day by day we build within us to protect ourselves from the attack of the impulses of nature.|$|R
60|$|The solemn protestations of the hostler being wholly unavailing, {{the leather}} hat-box {{was obliged to}} be raked up from the lowest depth of the boot, to satisfy him {{that it had been}} safely packed; and after he had been assured on this head, he felt a solemn presentiment, first, that the red bag was mislaid, and next that the striped bag had been stolen, and then that the brown-paper parcel 'had come untied.' At length when he had {{received}} ocular demonstration of the groundless nature of each and every of these suspicions, he consented to climb up to the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach,</b> observing that now he had taken everything off his mind, he felt quite comfortable and happy.|$|R
50|$|Linda {{was born}} to Paula Fox when she was 20, {{the result of a}} {{short-lived}} relationship. Paula lived under the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> acting <b>coach</b> Stella Adler at the time, as did then unknown actor Marlon Brando. There have been persistent rumors that Brando fathered the child, although neither Brando nor Fox ever commented on the matter. Linda Carroll did not meet her birth mother until later in life. Given the tumultuous relationship with Paula's own biological parents, she gave the child up for adoption. Linda was adopted into a Catholic family of part Italian descent, and was raised in Pacific Heights by Jack and Louella Risi. Linda took her surname after her friend Judy Carroll, after Judy's death. Linda {{graduated from high school in}} 1961.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 BR {{converted}} the articulated unit to a two-car set for overhead line maintenance. The centre car was removed {{and the number}} of engines in the set reduced to two. The driving cabs were given flat ends. To enable engineering staff to work on the overhead cables the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> the two <b>coaches</b> were flattened, creating a work space 130 ft long and 5 ft wide. Between the two cars a manually-operated lift was installed that could be raised to 6 ft above roof level.|$|R
5000|$|In 1838, Bretherton {{managed to}} prevent a coach from being {{overturned}} on the Preston road by climbing {{out of the window}} <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> and taking charge of the reins and the horses by riding on their backs. On Monday 19 February 1838, when the Warrington Mail was on route from Preston to Chorley, the wheel <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> went into a deep rut in the road, came into contact with a piece of ice, and threw the coachman off the box into the road. There were no passengers outside and only two inside, one of whom was Bartholomew Bretherton. As the horses increased their speed, Bretherton opened the door, climbed out onto the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> and over the box seat down upon the pole. While the horses were [...] "going at a tremendous rate", and with considerable risk to his life, Bretherton succeeded in getting hold of the reins which were dangling amongst the horses' feet and was able eventually to pull them up just soon enough to prevent the coach running into two carts which were in the road.|$|R
60|$|But {{what does}} that matter? It is five to one, {{including}} the engineer and fireman, and the majesty {{of the law and}} the might of a great corporation are behind them, and I am beating them out. I am too far down the train, and I run ahead over the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coaches</b> until I am over the fifth or sixth platform from the engine. I peer down cautiously. A shack is on that platform. That he has caught sight of me, I know from the way he makes a swift sneak inside the car; and I know, also, that he is waiting inside the door, all ready to pounce out on me when I climb down. But I make believe that I don't know, and I remain there to encourage him in his error. I do not see him, yet I know that he opens the door once and peeps up to assure himself that I am still there.|$|R
60|$|The train {{slows down}} for a station. I dangle my legs down in a {{tentative}} way. The train stops. My legs are still dangling. I hear the door unlatch softly. He is all ready for me. Suddenly I spring up and run forward over the roof. This is right over his head, where he lurks inside the door. The train is standing still; the night is quiet, and I take care to make plenty of noise on the metal roof with my feet. I don't know, but my assumption {{is that he is}} now running forward to catch me as I descend at the next platform. But I don't descend there. Halfway along the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach,</b> I turn, retrace my way softly and quickly to the platform both the shack and I have just abandoned. The coast is clear. I descend to the ground on the off-side of the train and hide in the darkness. Not a soul has seen me.|$|R
25|$|The North Yorkshire Moors Railway {{was first}} opened in 1836 as the Whitby and Pickering Railway. The railway was planned in 1831 by George Stephenson {{as a means}} of opening up trade routes inland from the then {{important}} seaport of Whitby. The initial railway was designed and built to be used by horse-drawn carriages. Construction was carried out by navvies and coordinated by top engineers. Their three main achievements were cutting a 120-yard tunnel through rock at Grosmont, constructing a rope-worked incline system at Beck Hole and traversing the marshy and deep Fen Bog using a bed of timber and sheep fleeces. The tunnel is believed {{to be one of the}} oldest railway tunnels in the world. In its first year of operation, the railway carried 10,000 tons of stone from Grosmont to Whitby, as well as 6,000 passengers, who paid a fare of 1shilling to sit on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> a <b>coach,</b> or 1shilling and 3pence to sit inside. It took two and a half hours to travel from Whitby to Pickering.|$|R
5000|$|The S-Bahn North-South Link saw a more bizarre - {{though not}} unique - state of affairs. This line, plus two U-Bahn lines {{elsewhere}} in the city, suffered from a quirk of geography in that they briefly passed through East German territory en route {{from one part of}} West Berlin to another. This gave rise to the infamous [...] "Geisterbahnhofe" [...] (ghost stations), Potsdamer Platz being the most notorious, those unfortunate ones on the eastern side that were sealed off from the outside world and which trains ran straight through without stopping which was being there from 1961 to 1989. They would generally slow down however, affording passengers the strange sight of dusty, dimly lit platforms patrolled by armed guards, there to prevent any East Berliners from trying to escape to the West by train. At the points where the lines passed directly beneath the actual border, concrete [...] "collars" [...] were constructed within the tunnels with just the minimum clearance for trains, to prevent people clinging to the sides or <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coaches.</b>|$|R
60|$|On the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> were {{assembled}} Polichinelle, Scaramouche, Harlequin, and Pasquariel. Polichinelle {{in black}} and white, his doublet cut in the fashion of a century ago, with humps before and behind, a white frill round his neck and a black mask upon {{the upper half of}} his face, stood in the middle, his feet planted wide to steady him, solemnly and viciously banging a big drum. The other three were seated each at one of the corners <b>of</b> the <b>roof,</b> their legs dangling over. Scaramouche, all in black in the Spanish fashion of the seventeenth century, his face adorned with a pair of mostachios, jangled a guitar discordantly. Harlequin, ragged and patched in every colour of the rainbow, with his leather girdle and sword of lath, the upper half of his face smeared in soot, clashed a pair of cymbals intermittently. Pasquariel, as an apothecary in skull-cap and white apron, excited the hilarity of the onlookers by his enormous tin clyster, which emitted when pumped a dolorous squeak.|$|R
60|$|Rawdon did not warm {{his little}} son for the winter's journey in this way, {{but he and}} Briggs wrapped up the child in shawls and comforters, and he was hoisted respectfully onto the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> in the dark morning, under the lamps of the White Horse Cellar; and with no small delight he watched the dawn rise and made his first journey to the place which his father still called home. It was a journey of {{infinite}} pleasure to the boy, to whom the incidents of the road afforded endless interest, his father answering to him all questions connected with it and telling him {{who lived in the}} great white house to the right, and whom the park belonged to. His mother, inside the vehicle, with her maid and her furs, her wrappers, and her scent bottles, made such a to-do that you would have thought she never had been in a stage-coach before--much less, that she had been turned out of this very one to make room for a paying passenger on a certain journey performed some half-score years ago.|$|R
40|$|This Thesis is {{concentrated}} on feasibility of solar energy harvesting system implementation {{on top of}} the moving train. Following study consists of two different ways of solar energy generation. Firstly, solar system consisting of solar panels with supplementary equipments (the charge controllers, batteries, inverters) is fitted to the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> train <b>coaches</b> to supply its internal energy requirement, and secondly, solar system is implemented over the shelter of platform in train stations to feed the railway grid. Then solar-powered train travels on two specific key routes from south to the north and from south to the west of Kazakhstan are simulated and studied in detail. Above described method has practical challenges in facing variable air temperature, solar radiation and sunshine hours. This data is obtained from the NASA database, and the variable parameters for each station are calculated in MATLAB. Afterwards, the entire solar system is simulated in MATLAB Simulink and the total required investment is calculated including costs of all equipments. The return investment time is calculated according to the power generated from solar system and saved money from fuel economy. Moreover, solar-powered train shows the significant cut of carbon dioxide emission because of the fuel iii economy. Both of the payback time and decreasing of CO 2 emission reveal the benefits of investment...|$|R
60|$|Presently Emma {{seemed to}} fall asleep, {{at least she}} shut her eyes. But I could not sleep, and sat there {{listening}} to the snores of the fat priest and the strange interminable oaths of the drivers as they thrashed the mules. Opposite to me, tied to the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> immediately above Emma's head, was a cheap looking-glass, provided, I suppose, {{for the convenience of}} passengers when making the toilette of travel. In it I could see myself reflected, so, having nothing better to do, in view of contingencies which of a sudden had become possible, I amused myself by taking count of my personal appearance. On the whole in those days it was not unsatisfactory. In build, I was tall and slight, with thin, nervous hands. My colouring and hair were dark, and I had soft and rather large brown eyes. The best part of my face was my forehead, which was ample, and the worst my mouth, which was somewhat weak. I do not think, however, that any one would have guessed by looking at me as I then appeared at the age of seven and twenty, that I was an exceedingly hard-working man with extraordinary powers of observation and a really retentive memory.|$|R
50|$|She {{came from}} Liverpool and in 1786 was {{employed}} in London as a servant {{in the house}} of Joseph and Frances Shetley. On the afternoon of Sunday, 12 February 1786, while her employers were out of the house, Dawson collected a large quantity of clothing, jewellery, and money, and left the house. Mrs Shetley returned home and found the house in disorder and the young servant girl missing. She sent for Mr Shetley, who set out to follow Dawson that evening. Knowing she came from the Liverpool area, he asked after her at the Golden Cross at Charing Cross and was told that a girl of her description had boarded the coach for Chester in the north at 7.00 p.m. Mr Shetley took a postchaise with a Mr Lowe, and overtook the coach at St Albans. Dawson was found on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach,</b> apprehended, and taken into a local Inn where she handed over the stolen goods from her pockets and two boxes. The goods were recognised by Mr Shetley, the only item missing being a guinea coin which she had used to pay for the coach. When asked if she had acted with an accomplice or was travelling with anyone, she said she wasn't. Dawson was then taken back to London and Mrs Shetley identified the items of clothing.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} in the evening when Mr. Pickwick and his companions, {{assisted}} by Sam, dismounted from the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the Eatanswill <b>coach.</b> Large blue silk flags were flying from the windows of the Town Arms Inn, and bills were posted in every sash, intimating, in gigantic letters, that the Honourable Samuel Slumkey's committee sat there daily. A crowd of idlers were assembled in the road, looking at a hoarse man in the balcony, who was apparently talking himself very red in the face in Mr. Slumkey's behalf; but the force and point of whose arguments were somewhat impaired by the perpetual beating of four large drums which Mr. Fizkin's committee had stationed at the street corner. There was a busy little man beside him, though, who took off his hat at intervals and motioned to the people to cheer, which they regularly did, most enthusiastically; and as the red-faced gentleman went on talking till he was redder in the face than ever, it seemed to answer his purpose quite as well as if anybody had heard him.|$|R
5000|$|The {{diligence}} ( [...] for short), a solidly built {{coach with}} {{four or more}} horses, was the French analogue for public conveyance, especially in France, with minor varieties in Germany such as the Stellwagen and Eilwagen. The diligence from Le Havre to Paris was described by a fastidious English visitor of 1803 with a thoroughness that distinguished it from its English contemporary, the stage coach.A more uncouth clumsy machine can scarcely be imagined. In the front is a cabriolet fixed to the body <b>of</b> the <b>coach,</b> for the accommodation of three passengers, who are protected from the rain above, by the projecting <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach,</b> and in front by two heavy curtains of leather, well oiled, and smelling somewhat offensively, fastened to the roof. The inside, which is capacious, and lofty, and will hold six people in great comfort is lined with leather padded, and surrounded with little pockets, in which travellers deposit their bread, snuff, night caps, and pocket handkerchiefs, which generally enjoy each others company, in the same delicate depository. From the roof depends a large net work which is generally crouded with hats, swords, and band boxes, the whole is convenient, and when all parties are seated and arranged, the accommodations {{are by no means}} unpleasant.Upon the roof, on the outside, is the imperial, which is generally filled with six or seven persons more, and a heap of luggage, which latter also occupies the basket, and generally presents a pile, half as high again as the coach, which is secured by ropes and chains, tightened by a large iron windlass, which also constitutes another appendage of this moving mass. The body of the carriage rests upon large thongs of leather, fastened to heavy blocks of wood, instead of springs, and the whole is drawn by seven horses.|$|R
60|$|For {{many minutes}} {{there had been}} no sound but the {{monotonous}} drumming of the rain on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coach,</b> the swishing <b>of</b> wheels through the gravelly mud, and the momentary clatter of hoofs upon some rocky outcrop in the road. Conversation had ceased; the light-hearted young editor in the front seat, more than suspected of dangerous levity, had relapsed into silence since the heavy man in the middle seat had taken to regarding the ceiling with ostentatious resignation, and the thin female beside him had averted her respectable bonnet. An occasional lurch <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> brought down a fringe of raindrops from its eaves that filmed the windows and shut out the sodden prospect already darkening into night. There had been a momentary relief in their hurried dash through Summit Springs, and the spectacle of certain newly arrived County Delegates crowding the veranda of its one hotel; but that was now three miles behind. The young editor's sole resource was to occasionally steal a glance at the face of the one passenger who seemed to be in sympathy with him, but who was too far away for easy conversation. It was the half-amused, half-perplexed face of a young man who had been for some time regarding him from a remote corner <b>of</b> the <b>coach</b> with an odd mingling of admiring yet cogitating interest, which, however, had never extended to any further encouragement than a faint sad smile. Even this at last faded out in the growing darkness; the powerful coach lamps on either side that flashed on the wayside objects gave no light to the interior. Everybody was slowly falling asleep. Suddenly everybody woke up to find that the coach was apparently standing still! When it had stopped no one knew! The young editor lowered his window. The coach lamp on that side was missing, but nothing was to be seen. In the distance there appeared to be a faint splashing.|$|R

5000|$|When the Berlin Wall {{was erected}} on 13 August 1961, {{it had a}} {{profound}} effect on rail services in and around the city, and on the S-Bahn and U-Bahn in particular. Essentially both were divided into two systems, with lines being physically severed where they crossed the border between East Berlin and West Berlin. In most cases trains on either side would simply run as far as the last stop before the border and then reverse back. The S-Bahn North-South Link saw a more bizarre - though not unique - state of affairs. This line, plus two U-Bahn lines elsewhere in the city, suffered from a quirk of geography in that they briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. This gave rise to the infamous [...] "Geisterbahnhöfe" [...] (ghost stations), those unfortunate ones on the eastern side that were sealed off from the outside world and which trains ran straight through without stopping. (One exception was the station Bahnhof Friedrichstraße, where passengers could change trains to the western part of the East-West-S-Bahn and one line of the U-Bahn (today U6). This station also served as a border checkpoint for people entering East Berlin.) Trains would generally slow down, however, affording passengers the strange sight of dusty, dimly lit platforms patrolled by armed guards, there to prevent any East Berliners from trying to escape to the West by train. At the points where the lines passed directly beneath the actual border, concrete [...] "collars" [...] were constructed within the tunnels with just the minimum clearance for trains, to prevent people clinging to the sides or <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coaches.</b> Anhalter Bahnhof station itself remained open; being in West Berlin, it was the last stop for northbound trains before they entered the [...] "restricted section", and the first stop for southbound trains after they had left the section. However, of its four platforms just two (sometimes only one) saw regular use, and the station appeared to receive only a minimum of cleaning and maintenance.|$|R
