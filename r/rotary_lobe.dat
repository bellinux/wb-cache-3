50|$|Because <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> pumps need to {{maintain}} a clearance between the lobes, a single stage Roots blower can pump gas across only a limited pressure differential. If the pump is used outside its specification, the compression of the gas generates so much heat that the lobes expand {{to the point that}} they jam, damaging the pump.|$|E
50|$|Stothert & Pitt {{commenced}} <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> pump manufacture with a licence in 1919. Molasses {{and other}} viscous liquids were handled in heated pumps. Up until 1937, installed lobe pumps {{were still in}} use unloading molasses tank ships.A further licence to make twin screw pumps was acquired from Houttuin pumps of Utrecht, the Netherlands in 1935, with manufacturing starting in 1936. Just {{a few years later}} about 1100 twin screw pumps were supplied to the RAF for use in RAF stations all over the world during World War II.Stotherts were the leading in multiphase pump technology in the 1980s but the R&D expenditure did not lead to many pump sales and Stothert & Pitt, a company quoted on the London Stock Exchange, lost its independence and shut in 1989.In 1999 Albany took over the manufacture of Stothert & Pitt Twin Screw, Centrifugal and Lobe pumps.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{performance}} results {{and analysis of}} a novel <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander device. This {{is part of a}} larger research effort into the analysis and design of a small-scale solar system that would compete with available distributed technologies for heat and electricity generation. To choose an appropriate working fluid and components for a distributed concentrating solar combined heat and power (DCS-CHP) system, we compared many different working fluids, collectors, and expander choices. Of the expanders analyzed, including piston expanders, radial inflow turbines, Tesla turbines, screw expanders, and scroll expanders, the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander shows the greatest promise in small-scale power applications due to its high efficiency in expanding fluids over large pressure ratios and its low cost to manufacture. This article focuses on testing of a prototype small-scale expander that was chosen because, to date, no suitable commercial product of less than 10 kW has been found for this application. Initial testing was completed with air to get results that should be indicative of future testing with steam. The test system consists of a compressed air expander (a prototype designed by Katrix, Inc. of Australia) connected to an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive (VFD) that enables expander testing at varying shaft speeds. Results of the expander testing are reported isentropic efficiencies of 22 – 25 %, thermomechanical efficiencies of 80 – 95 %, and pressure ratios of 6 – 11 at the tested speeds. Despite mixed results from this particular expander, future refinements could lead to a new class of expanders with low cost and high performance for use in solar combined heat and power and waste-heat recovery...|$|E
40|$|The {{result of}} several years of {{analysis}} of Distributed Concentrating Solar Combined Heat and Power (DCS-CHP) systems is a design that is predicted to convert sunlight to heat at 8 - 10 % solar-electric efficiency while simultaneously capturing ~ 60 % of that initial sunlight as usable heat (at 100 ºC). In contrast to similarly sized photovoltaic systems in the U. S. that cost ~$ 7. 90 /Watt of generator rated peak electrical output, in mass production the proposed collector and generator system sized at 1 - 10 kW would cost ~$ 3. 20 /Watt electricity and ~$ 0. 40 /Watt-thermal, allowing adjustment of heat and electrical output on demand. The proposed system would revolutionize distributed energy generation in several ways: 1) by enabling rapid dissemination via avoidance of production limitations of photovoltaics such as expensive and limited materials, 2) by efficient local production of both heat and power to offset more greenhouse gases {{at a lower cost}} than other renewable energy technologies, and 3) by democratizing the means of electricity production; putting the {{power in the hands of}} the consumer instead of large utilities. With over 5. 4 GW of photovoltaics added globally in 2008 and 20 GW of solar thermal, there is a large proven market for solar energy. With widespread market penetration, this system would reduce greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from electricity generation and heating for a significant portion of the developed and developing world, including those in remote locations with no connection to an electric grid. Chapter 1 begins with analysis of the relative demand for electricity and heat in California, showing that, on average, demand matches production of a theoretical solar CHP system. Then, we explore the economic and technological impetus for a solar powered combined heat and power Rankine cycle, showing cost and performance modeling in comparison to photovoltaics across varying conditions, and concluding that solar CHP generated electricity is comparable to PV electricity in terms of cost "per peak watt". Chapter 2 shows results of a life cycle analysis of DCS-CHP in comparison to other renewable and non-renewable energy systems including its global warming potential (80 gCO 2 eq/kWh electric and 10 gCO 2 eq/kWh thermal), levelized electric and thermal energy cost ($ 0. 25 /kWh electric and $ 0. 03 /kWh thermal), and cost of solar water purification/desalination ($ 1. 40 /m 3). Additionally the utilization of water for this technology is shown to be much less than fossil-fuel based thermal power plants. Chapter 3 explores the expander as an enabling technology for small solar Rankine cycles and presents results of physical testing and characterization of a <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander prototype developed by a small Australian company, Katrix, Inc. Testing of this expander using compressed air yields an impressive isentropic efficiency of 80 - 95 % at pressure ratios of 6 - 11 making the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander a leading choice for DCS-CHP systems, if operation on steam is successful and reliability issues can be addressed. Chapter 4 concludes with a description and analysis of a DCS-CHP system using simulation software developed in Matlab for the purpose of system analysis and optimization. This chapter focuses on the selection of an appropriate expander and collectors, the two key enabling technologies for DCS-CHP. In addition to discussion of the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander, we present a novel collector device appropriate for solar CHP systems that eliminates high pressure articulate joints, a typical failure point of solar concentrating systems. Given the results of the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander testing, comparison to previous expander modeling work, and comparison of the predicted cost and efficiency of the collectors analyzed, an appropriate technology version of the DCS-CHP system is selected and overall system performance is predicted across 1020 sites in the US...|$|E
