5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E

5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to <b>reduce</b> <b>it.</b> Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for {{a major part of}} the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.|$|E

5|$|The Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is {{the head}} of the {{executive}} branch of Kentucky's state government, and serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws; the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Kentucky Legislature; the power to convene the legislature; and the power to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment. He or she is also empowered to reorganize the state government or <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> in size.

5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cost-saving}} move, {{effective on}} July 1, 1934, the Georgia Board of Regents transferred {{control of the}} relatively large Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia and moved the small civil engineering program at UGA to Tech. The move was controversial, and both students and faculty protested against it, fearing that the Board of Regents would remove other programs from Georgia Tech and <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> to an engineering department of the University of Georgia. Brittain suggested {{that the lack of}} Georgia Tech alumni on the Board of Regents contributed to their decision. Despite the pressure, the Board of Regents held its ground. The Depression also {{had a significant impact on}} the athletic program, as most athletes were in the commerce school, and resulted in the elimination of athletic scholarships, which were replaced by a loan program. Plans for an industrial management department to replace and supersede the Evening School of Commerce were first made in fall 1934. The department was established in 1935, and evolved into Tech's College of Management.|$|E

5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To <b>reduce</b> <b>it,</b> the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to <b>reduce</b> <b>it.</b> This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E
5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using X-ray scattering techniques pointed to a density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got hold of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between this theory and Jeremy Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the panopticon), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, {{it would be very}} easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> until 5%, difficult to <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> under 3% and nearly impossible to <b>reduce</b> <b>it</b> to zero (a feat which would cost the supermarket so much in surveillance, etc., that it would outweigh the benefits).
