40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} {{an increase}} in plasma concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> as a non-invasive biochemical test of reperfusion after thrombolysis and to investigate {{the relation between the}} inflammatory response after acute myocardial infarction and the production of the substances. METHODS [...] Venous samples were taken from 19 patients receiving thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction before the start of therapy and every hour afterwards up to 5 hours and then at 24 and 48 hours and the concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> measured. These substances are markers of lipid peroxidation induced by free oxygen radicals. Early reperfusion was judged by regression of ST elevation and late coronary artery patency from the results of coronary angiography 24 - 72 hours after thrombolysis. RESULTS [...] The concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> increased in only 6 out of 14 patients with signs of early reperfusion. In patients with late coronary artery patency the corresponding number was 6 out of 15. However, {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> was found for the whole group 24 and 48 hours after treatment. The change in concentration in serum correlated significantly with that of C reactive protein [...] an acute phase reactant (r = 0. 62, P < 0. 01) [...] but not to the serum activities of markers of infarct size such as creatine kinase B and lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS [...] The fluorimetric assay used in this study to measure the concentration of thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> seems to be an insensitive method of detecting reperfusion after thrombolysis for myocardial infarction. The increase in concentrations found 24 and 48 hours after treatment correlated with C reactive protein concentrations but not with those of markers of infarct size...|$|R

50|$|Hexafluoroacetone is a <b>reactive</b> <b>substance,</b> acting {{primarily}} as an electrophile. In water, hexafluoroacetone is highly reactive as its equilibrium sharply favors (~106) forming a geminal diol hydrate, unlike the identical unfavorable equilibrium with acetone (10−3).

Hexafluoroacetone-hydrates are acidic and react with most metals to generate hydrogen. Hexafluoroacetone violently reacts in the presence of alkali. Related to its tendency to hydrate, (CF3)2CO adds ammonia to give (CF3)2C(OH)(NH2) which can be dehydrated with phosphoryl chloride to give (CF3)2CNH.|$|E
50|$|Most toxic {{substances}} exert their toxicity through some interaction (e.g., covalent bonding, oxidation) with cellular macromolecules like proteins or DNA.

40|$|In vitro {{studies with}} tumor cells have {{demonstrated}} that oxygen free radicals {{are involved in the}} development of skin cancers and that variations in the body's defense mechanisms can modify the course of the disease. To assess the validity of this hypothesis in spontaneous tumors, we determined glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, reduced and oxidized glutathione, and thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> in healthy whole skin (n = 95), dermis (n = 73), and epidermis (n = 69). The values were compared with those obtained in three types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma (n = 16), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 6), and melanoma (n = 33). In healthy skin, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione were higher in epidermis than in dermis, whereas thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> were higher in dermis than in epidermis; whole skin had intermediate values. These results suggest that there is an induction of some anti-oxygen free radicals mechanisms in epidermis as a result of increased oxygen free radicals production. Glutathione S-transferase and thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> were higher in all types of tumor than in healthy epidermis but oxidized glutathione was lower. Reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity were lower in basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma samples. Glutathione S-transferase increased, whereas superoxide dismutase and thiobarbituric acid <b>reactive</b> <b>substances</b> decreased in melanoma samples in direct relation to the Clark levels. Higher glutathione S-transferase activity, particularly in the most invasive forms of melanoma, indicates that this type of cancer is more malignant. Similarly, a decrease in superoxide dismutase activity can also encourage progression of the tumor. These results are in accord with those from tumor cell cultures and could suggest new strategies (gene therapy) for managing skin cancer...|$|R
