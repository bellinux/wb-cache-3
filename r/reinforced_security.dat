40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to <b>reinforce</b> <b>security</b> of the {{conventional}} ATM model. We have posited a new concept that enhances the overall experience, usability and convenience of the transaction at the ATM. Features like face recognition and One-Time Password (OTP) are used for the enhancement of security of accounts and privacy of users. Face recognition technology helps the machine to identify each and every user uniquely thus making face as a key. This completely eliminates the chances of fraud due to theft and duplicity of the ATM cards. Moreover, the randomly generated OTP frees the user from remembering PINs as it itself acts as a PIN...|$|R

This legal research was conducted to find out and analyze whether or not the acceleration of such registration has <b>reinforced</b> legal <b>security</b> based on the Instruction of Minister of Agrarian Affairs No. 2 of 1999 over the area of Gunungkidul District. This is an empirical legal research using a qualitative analysis and an inductive method of study to draw conclusions. The results of study showed that the service of registration of transfer of right of ownership as a result of selling and buying at the Land Registry Office of Gunungkidul District had been completed in the period of 2 weeks after the registration application. Since the publication of land certificate there was no third party submitting any objection. This finding has <b>reinforced</b> legal <b>security</b> based on the Instruction of Minister of Agrarian Affairs No. 2 of 1999.

30|$|First, {{employment}} law provides frameworks of employment rights and limits to them. During at least democratic periods, {{the main purpose}} of labour law has been {{to protect the rights of}} employees against employers who are regarded as being prima facie more powerful than they are (Davies and Freedland 2007; Knegt 2008). Labour law has therefore <b>reinforced</b> <b>security,</b> in some cases at the expense of flexibility. As such, it has come under sustained criticism from economists and others during recent years when employment sustainability has been seen to depend on increasing flexibility. The aim of much of this criticism has been to encourage labour law to accept a role in achieving a balance between security and flexibility. This is sometimes expressed in terms of degrees of deregulation, but deregulation nearly always requires some re-regulation, as maintenance of the market order itself requires a framework of rules (Majone 1990). A key development here in at least some countries has been the introduction of “reflexive regulation”, or legally induced “voluntary” regulation to induce reductions in standards of protection, matching attempts in collective bargaining for derogations from sector standards by company-level negotiators.|$|E
