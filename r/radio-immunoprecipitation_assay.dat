METHODS: Sera of 50 ACA and anti-topo I-negative SSc patients, and, as control group, sera of 122 patients (42 with SSc, ACA or anti-topo I-positive, 40 with systemic lupus erythematosus and 40 with rheumatoid arthritis) were studied. RESULT: Using the cutoff proposed by the manufacturer (10 AU/mL), sensitivity and specificity were: for AFA, 22...|$|E

30|$|Total protein was {{extracted}} from the treated cells using <b>Radio-Immunoprecipitation</b> <b>Assay</b> (RIPA) lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 % Nonidet-P 40, 0.5 % Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS). The extraction and isolation of nuclear protein were performed according to the instructions in the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime, China). Equal amounts (30 – 50 μg) of protein {{extracted from}} cells were boiled at 100 °C in 1 × SDS loading buffer for 10 min and then were loaded and separated by sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), blocked by 5 % nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween- 20. The membranes were incubated with antibodies against PKM 2 (Cell Signaling), CK 19 (Abcam), and EpCAM (Abcam). Signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), which was developed and quantified using an imaging system (Tanon, China).|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] prevalence of humoral antibodies to human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I) was investigated in different ethnic groups and in non-human primates in South Africa. Serum antibody levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using either disrupted whole HTLV-I or purified p 24 core protein (p 24 HTLV-I) as antigens. ELISA was complemented by direct <b>radio-immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> using either purified iodinated p 24 HTLV-I or radiolabelled lysates of an HTLV-producing cell line as antigen followed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates, and by immunofluorescence using the HTLV-I-producing cell line HUT- 102 as antigen. Antibodies were demonstrated in 3, 5 % of Asians, 3, 5 % of blacks and 4, 1 % of coloureds, but not in whites, and also in 29 % of vervet monkeys and 33 % of baboons. We conclude that HTLV-I or closely related viruses cause widespread infection in non-human primates in South Africa and in a lower percentage of humans, including apparently healthy blood donors. We are currently isolating retroviruses from seropositive reactors and investigating the possible relevance to disease in South Africa. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} autoantibodies in sera of Saudi diabetic patients including Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Apart from data on the prevalence of islet-cell antibodies in patients in Ryhadh (Al-Attas et al. Freqency of islet cell antibodies in adult newly diagnosed diabetic patients. Ann Saudi Med 1990; 10 : 369 - 373) immunological markers of autoimmune diabetes have not been explored in Saudi Arabians. Methods: Autoantibodies to GAD 65 (GADA) and IA- 2 (IA- 2 A) were determined using <b>radio-immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays.</b> Results: In Type 1 DM patients, 54 were GADA+ and 27 were IA- 2 A+. A greater negative effect of disease duration was noted for IA- 2 A than for GADA positivity. Autoantibodies were more prevalent with younger age of onset. GADA were slightly more common in female Type 1 DM patients. In Type 2 DM, 8 / 99 patients were GADA+, and three of these patients with shorter disease duration were also IA- 2 A+. GADA, and particularly IA- 2 A, were associated with a younger age of onset of Type 2 DM and all the autoantibody-positive Type 2 DM patients were insulin-treated. GADA were detected in 2. 2 of GDM patients, {{but none of these}} patients possessed IA- 2 A. Conclusions: The prevalence and associations of autoantibodies in Saudi diabetic patients are very similar to those reported for diabetic patients in other ethnic groups. © 2005 Diabetes UK...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the molecular {{basis for the}} ability of antibodies encoded by the human VH 26 heavy-chain variable region gene to react with diverse antigens, we have generated 34 hybridomas secreting chimaeric monoclonal antibodies (human mu heavy chain/mouse light chains) from transgenic mice. The transgenic mice carry an immunoglobulin minilocus containing the human VH 26 gene, human DH and JH gene segments, and genes encoding the human C mu region. The minilocus in these animals undergoes functional rearrangement resulting {{in the production of}} chimaeric antibodies in which human mu heavy chains utilizing the VH 26 gene are paired with mouse kappa or lambda light chains. The hybridomas described in this study were generated from naïve animals and were selected {{solely on the basis of}} human mu-chain expression. The antibodies described have covalently attached mouse light chains and are multimeric in structure. The binding properties of the antibodies were examined using a panel of both self- and foreign antigens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent <b>assays,</b> agglutination or <b>radio-immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assays</b> and immunofluorescence. Chimaeric immunoglobulins from 21 of the 34 hybridoma clones (61. 7 %) reacted with one or more antigens, of which 13 (38. 2 %) reacted with more than two antigens. These studies demonstrate that the VH 26 gene, in combination with human DH and JH gene segments, and mouse light-chain genes, is able to encode antibodies with a wide range of ligand-binding specificities. These findings have important implications in the context of the possible origins of autoantibodies encoded by VH 26 which may play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune conditions...|$|R
40|$|Canine hypoadrenocorticism likely {{arises from}} immune-mediated {{destruction}} of adrenocor-tical tissue, leading to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency. In humans with autoimmune Addison’s disease (AAD) or autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS), cir-culating autoantibodies {{have been demonstrated}} against enzymes associated with adrenal steroid synthesis. The current study investigates autoantibodies against steroid synthesis enzymes in dogs with spontaneous hypoadrenocorticism. Coding regions of canine CYP 21 A 2 (21 -hydroxylase; 21 -OH), CYP 17 A 1 (17 -hydroxylase; 17 -OH), CYP 11 A 1 (P 450 side-chain cleavage enzyme; P 450 scc) and HSD 3 B 2 (3 β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 3 βHSD) were amplified, cloned and expressed as 35 S-methionine radiolabelled recombi-nant protein. In a pilot study, serum samples from 20 dogs with hypoadrenocorticism and four unaffected control dogs were screened by <b>radio-immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay.</b> There {{was no evidence of}} reactivity against 21 -OH, 17 -OH or 3 βHSD, but five dogs with hypoadre-nocorticism showed immunoreactivity to P 450 scc compared with controls.

Cellular uptake was stopped by removing incubation media from the cells and washing the wells twice with ice-cold PBS buffer (1  mL). Surface-bound radioactivity {{was removed from the}} cells through incubating the cells twice with 0.5  mL glycine-HCl in PBS (50  mM, pH 2.5) for 5  min at 37  °C. Cells were washed again with ice-cold PBS before the addition of <b>radio-immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay</b> (RIPA) buffer (400  μL) to lyse the cells. Cells were returned into the incubator for 10  min, and cell lysates were collected for counting. Radioactivity of surface-bound and internalized fraction was measured in a WIZARD 2 Automatic gamma counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Total protein concentration in the samples was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA; Pierce, Thermo Scientific 23227) using bovine serum albumin (800, 600, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50  μg/mL, blank) as protein standard.

40|$|Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{affecting the}} neuromuscular junction. Muscle specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies {{are found in}} a variable proportion of patients with generalised disease who are acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody negative. Typically these patients have more prominent ocular, facial, bulbar, neck and respiratory weakness and often require long term immunosuppressive therapy. We document the clinical course of two such patients who have been under long term follow up at our centre. We correlated this with their MuSK antibody titres using the standard <b>radio-immunoprecipitation</b> <b>assay.</b> We examined the IgG subclasses and ability to activate complement (C 3 /Membrane Attack Complex) in vitro at several time points during their disease using a cell based assay. Finally we analysed the functional effects of the IgG antibodies on cultured C 2 C 12 muscle cells. The MuSK antibodies in both patients were mainly of the IgG 4 subclass although IgG 2 and IgG 1 antibodies were also seen later in the disease course. We found that the MuSK antibodies {{have the ability to}} activate complement in vitro, although the role of complement in vivo remains unclear. We also demonstrate that MuSK antibodies from these patients have variable ability to cause dispersal of acetylcholine receptor clusters in fully differentiated C 2 C 12 muscle cells. These studies show that MuSK antibodies cause instability of preformed AChR clusters which has potential to disrupt neuromuscular transmission in vivo. Furthermore, IgG subclass switching and increased ability to activate complement in vitro may be responsible for fluctuations during the disease course...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} step in the proteomics of solid tumors, including breast cancer, consists of efficiently extracting most of proteins in the tumor specimen.

RIPA buffer's rapid and highly efficient cell lysis and good solubilization {{of a wide range}} of proteins is further augmented by its compatibility with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, ability to minimize non-specific protein binding leading to a lower background in immunoprecipitation, and its suitability for protein quantitation. Results In this work, the insoluble matter left after RIPA buffer extraction of proteins from breast tumors are subjected to another extraction step, using a urea-based buffer. It is shown that RIPA and urea lysis buffers fractionate breast tissue proteins primarily on the basis of molecular weights. The average molecular weight of proteins that dissolve exclusively in urea buffer is up to 60 % higher than in RIPA. Gene Ontology (GO) and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) are used to map the collective biological and biophysical attributes of the RIPA and urea proteomes. The Cellular Component and Molecular Function annotations reveal protein solubilization preferences of the buffers, especially the compartmentalization and functional distributions. It is shown that nearly all extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) in the breast tumors and matched normal tissues are found, nearly exclusively, in the urea fraction, while they are mostly insoluble in RIPA buffer. Additionally, it is demonstrated that cytoskeletal and extracellular region proteins are more soluble in urea than in RIPA, whereas for nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins, RIPA buffer is preferred. Extracellular matrix proteins are highly implicated in cancer, including their proteinase-mediated degradation and remodelling, tumor development, progression, adhesion and metastasis. Thus, if they are not efficiently extracted by RIPA buffer, important information may be missed in cancer research. Conclusion For proteomics of solid tumors, a two-step extraction process is recommended. First, proteins in the tumor specimen should be extracted with RIPA buffer. Second, the RIPA-insoluble material should be extracted with the urea-based buffer employed in this work. </p...|$|E
