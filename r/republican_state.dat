The threshold for making the ballot is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts <b>Republican</b> <b>State</b> Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E

50|$|One {{can work}} through this same {{issue in the}} {{opposite}} political direction—where it actually was a concern of Democrats in the 2004 election. In the 2004 presidential election, votepair.org matched Democratic Party supporters of John Kerry in staunchly <b>Republican</b> <b>states</b> with third-party supporters in swing states (including Ralph Nader supporters, Libertarian Party supporters of Michael Badnarik, or Green Party supporters of David Cobb). A common question was whether Republican supporters of George W. Bush could manipulate the election by posing as John Kerry supporters or as third-party supporters. However, if such people had posed as third-party supporters in swing states, all they could do is trick John Kerry supporters in staunchly <b>Republican</b> <b>states</b> {{to vote for a}} third-party candidate—which wouldn't change the outcome of the election (since George W. Bush would win those states anyway). Similarly if such people had posed as John Kerry supporters in staunchly <b>Republican</b> <b>states,</b> all they could do is trick third-party supporters in swing states to vote for John Kerry—which would have politically hurt George W.

5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus {{restored}} the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including supreme military command, and those of tribune and censor. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally <b>republican</b> <b>state</b> could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate, {{the first phase of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E

During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, Prussian and Austrian coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw.

After Wallace, his law partner, was elected as county clerk in 1860, Harrison established a new firm with William Fishback that was named Fishback and Harrison.

On July 8, 1916, after a close, multiballot contest, with several contenders, the <b>Republican</b> <b>State</b> Committee elected McNary to be the chair.

Dummit had replaced his campaign manager from the primary election, and when the ousted manager turned against him in the general election, it sounded the death knell for his campaign. Clements won the election by a vote of 387,795 to 287,756. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House to accept the governorship.|$|E

The defunct Viceroyalty had shattered into several separate nations following the Argentine War of Independence {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century. To achieve reunification, the Argentine government needed to annex the three neighboring countries - Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay, as well as to incorporate a portion of the southern region of Brazil. Rosas first had to gather allies across the region who shared his vision. In some instances, this meant that he had to become involved in the internal politics of neighboring countries, backing those sympathetic to union with Argentina, and occasionally even financing rebellions and wars.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{purchasing}} the Star, Harding {{turned his attention}} to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was part of the war generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator John Sherman, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a two-party system, but had only contempt for those who bolted the Republican Party to join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the <b>Republican</b> <b>state</b> convention in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president.|$|E
