40|$|The {{study of}} <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> theory {{concerns}} questions about {{cause and effect}} relationships, and the utilisation of random noise in nuclear reactor systems. The diversity of <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> theory arises from the variety of noise sources, the various mathematical treatments applied and the various practical purposes. The neutron noise in zero-energy systems arises from the fluctuations {{in the number of}} neutrons per fission, the time between nuclear events, and the type of reactions. It can be used to evaluate system parameters. The mathematical treatment is based on the master equation of stochastic branching processes. The noise in power reactor systems is given rise by random processes of technological origin such as vibration of mechanical parts, boiling of the coolant, fluctuations of temperature and pressure. It can be used to monitor the reactor behaviour with the possibility of detecting malfunctions at an early stage. The mathematical treatment is based on the Langevin equation. The unity of <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> theory arises {{from the fact that the}} useful information from noise is embedded in the second moments of random variables, which lends the possibility of building up a unified mathematical description and analysis of the various <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> sources. Exploring such possibilities is the main subject among the three major topics reported in this thesis. The first subject is within the zero power noise in steady media, and we reported on the extension of the existing theory to more general cases. In Paper I, by use of the master equation approach, we have derived the most general Feynman- and Rossi-alpha formulae so far by taking the full joint statistics of the prompt and all the six groups of delayed neutron precursors, and a multiple emission source into account. The involved problems are solved with a combination of effective analytical techniques and symbolic algebra codes (Mathematica). Paper II gives a numerical evaluation of these formulae. An assessment of the contribution of the terms that are novel as compared to the traditional formulae has been made. The second subject treats a problem in power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> with the Langevin formalism. With a very few exceptions, in all previous work the diffusion approximation was used. In order to extend the treatment to transport theory, in Paper III, we introduced a novel method, i. e. Pade approximation via Lanczos algorithm to calculate the transfer function of a finite slab reactor described by one-group transport equation. It was found that the local-global decomposition of the neutron noise, formerly only reproduced in at least 2 -group theory, can be reconstructed. We have also showed the existence of a boundary layer of the neutron noise close to the boundary. Finally, we have explored the possibility of building up a unified theory to account for the coexistence of zero power and power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> in a system. In Paper IV, a unified description of the neutron noise is given by the use of backward master equations in a model where the cross section fluctuations are given as a simple binary pseudorandom process. The general solution contains both the zero power and power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> concurrently, and they can be extracted individually as limiting cases of the general solution. It justified the separate treatments of zero power and power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise.</b> The result was extended to the case including one group of delayed neutron precursors in Paper V...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{fluctuations}} {{in a constant}} multiplying medium (zero power noise) and those in a fluctuating medium (power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise)</b> have been traditionally considered as two separate disciplines that exist in two opposing limiting areas of operation (low and high power, respectively). They have also been treated by different mathematical methods, i. e., master equations and Langevin equation, respectively. In this paper we develop a theory of neutron {{fluctuations in}} a medium randomly varying in time, based on a forward-type master equation approach. This method accounts for both the zero power and the power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> simultaneously. Factorial moments and related quantities (variance, power spectrum, etc.) {{of the number of}} the neutrons are calculated in subcritical systems with a stationary external source. It is shown that the pure zero power and power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> results can be reconstructed in the cases of vanishing system fluctuations and high power, respectively, the latter being a nontrivial result. Further, it is shown that the effect of system fluctuations on the zero power noise is retained even in the limit of vanishing neutron number (reactor power). The results have thus even practical significance for low-power systems with fluctuating properties. The results also have a bearing on other types of branching processes such as evolution of biological systems, germ colonies, epidemics, etc., which take place in a time-varying environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{evolution of the}} distribution of the number of neutrons in a time-varying multiplying system, producing only prompt neutrons, was treated recently with the master equation technique by some of the present authors. Such a treatment gives account of both the so-called zero power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> and the power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> simultaneously. In particular, the first two moments of the neutron number, as well as the concept of criticality for time-varying systems, were investigated and discussed. The present paper extends these investigations to the case when delayed neutrons are also taken into account. Due to the complexity of the description, only the expectation of the neutron number is calculated. The concept of criticality of a time-varying system is also generalized to systems with delayed neutrons.

From the commissioning of the Hungarian Paks NPP units, <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> {{research has}} been focussed on the power plant reactors. From that time we have dealt with all aspects of the field, signal conditioning, data acquisition, evaluation and interpretation. We have also taken part in the development of different software and hardware systems to support these activities. Recently we started an upgrading process of all systems. At first we have planned a data acquisition system by a new concept. This new system should consist of four autonomous facilities at the four reactor units. Each facility consists of a 352 channel signal conditioning unit with separate channels for all signals, two 352 channel fast multiplexing assemblies, which feed separate data acquisition modules and a server PC. Fast multiplexing channels are doubled, because input signals are separated into DC and AC components. The system capacity can easily be extended up to 512 signals.

40|$|<b>Reactor</b> <b>noise</b> analysis, {{based upon}} the {{monitoring}} of the deviations of typically the neutron flux from its mean value, has for objectives a) the early detection of anomalies before they have any inadvertent effect on plant safety and availability and b) the determination of dynamical core parameters. Because noise analysis is a non-intrusive technique, {{it can be used}} on-line while the reactor is running at nominal full power conditions. One of the challenges of noise diagnostics is nevertheless to be able to recover from very few neutron detector signals the nature and characteristics of the driving perturbation, localize it, and classify the severity of the anomaly. This requires competences in many areas, such as reactor physics and dynamics, reactor modelling, stochastic processes, signal analysis, and measurement techniques.

The code developed yields the space-dependence of the fluctuations of the neutron flux induced by fluctuating properties of the medium in the 2 -group diffusion approximation and in a two-dimensional representation of heterogeneous systems, for both critical systems and non-critical systems with an external source. Some applications of these tools to power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> analysis are then described, including the unfolding of the parameters of the noise source from the induced neutron noise, measured at a few discrete locations throughout the core.

40|$|A {{discussion}} {{of the problem of}} sodium vapor bubble collapse is presented. The physics of vapor collapse is presented in light of the work by Peppler et al. Theoretical estimates of the sound source level based on the work by Rayleigh and Judd are compared to an approximate pressure-volume work approach and recent experimental observations. <b>Reactor</b> ambient <b>noise</b> and transmission loss considerations are presented in regard to their impact on this detection problem. A methodology is proposed which considers the importance of the sound source level, ambient noise, transmission loss and a detection threshold and provides a means by which the feasibility of sodium vapor bubble collapse detection in an operating LMFBR may be assessed. The interrelationships between the detection threshold and the probability of detection and false alarm are discussed and applied to a standard acoustic square law detection system. This analysis clearly illustrates that the feasibility of such a detection system is strongly dependent on the knowledge of sound source levels, ambient noise levels and the transmission loss between the source and receiver. Furthermore, requirements of a high degree of probability of detection and a low probability of false alarm were found to require a high signal to noise ratio for a single sensor system but that the probability of false alarm requirement could be relaxed for systems multiple independent sensors. Finally, the need for additional experimental and theoretical information is presented in terms of sound source levels, ambient noise and a means for determining transmission loss. (auth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of localising a noise source of the type &DPRIME; absorber of variable strength&DPRIME; (or reactor oscillator) from as few as five neutron detectors evenly distributed throughout {{the core of a}} commercial nuclear reactor. The novelty of this investigation lies {{with the fact that the}} calculations are performed for a realistic 2 -D heterogeneous reactor in the 2 -group diffusion approximation, via the prior determination of the corresponding reactor transfer function. It is first demonstrated that the response of such a reactor to a localized perturbation deviates significantly from point-kinetics. The space-dependence of the induced neutron noise thus carries enough information about the location of the noise source, which makes it possible to determine its position from a few detector readings. The identification of the type of noise source is easily performed from the in-phase behaviour of the induced neutron noise. Different unfolding techniques are finally tested. All these techniques rely on the use of the reactor transfer function. One of these techniques is based on the comparison between the actual measured neutron noise and the neutron noise calculated for every possible location of the noise source. This technique is very reliable and almost insensitive to the contamination of the detector signals by background noise, but also extremely CPU consuming. Another technique, based on the piece-wise inversion of the reactor transfer function and requiring little CPU effort, was developed. Although this technique is much less reliable when background noise is present, this technique is useful to indicate a region of the <b>reactor</b> where a <b>noise</b> source is likely to be located...|$|R

40|$|The zero-power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> {{theory in}} a steady neutron {{multiplying}} medium was extended recently to a medium randomly varying in time to bridge the fields of the zero-power and the power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise.</b> For a time-varying medium in which the transition probability randomly fluctuates, only {{the use of the}} probability generating function technique based on the forward master equation approach is practical. However, with the forward master equation approach, the treatment of the joint moments of the neutron number and the medium state leads to a closure problem. Recently, the capability of the moment calculation technique for such cases was extended such that the closure problem could be solved exactly. The present paper describes and demonstrates this closure-free moment calculation technique in a time-varying binary multiplying medium, in which the medium state has two possible realizations. In addition to the first two moments of the neutron number N alone (irrespective of the medium state η), the joint moments of Nn and ηm, i. e.,, were also obtained in a compact form for n = 1, 2 and arbitrary values of m, without a closure assumption. It was found that, for even m values, the asymptotic values of Nn and ηm are uncorrelated, whereas, for odd m values, they are negatively correlated, namely, their covariance is less than zero. The first two moments of the neutron number theoretically obtained were verified by the Monte Carlo technique. A perfect agreement was found between the Monte Carlo and the theoretical solutions. The closure-free moment calculation technique demonstrated in the present paper is expected to be applicable to various other problems related to the birth-and-death process with fluctuations of the transition probability, in which a closure problem occurs...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{thermometry}} {{has been}} developed and tested as a measuring method for precise and reliable temperature measurements in nuclear reactors. In contrast to the thermometers which have been used up to now (thermocauples, resistance thermometers, etc.), the noise thermometer is independent of all envirenmental influences, such as reactor radiation er atmosphere. It is independent of its previousthermal and mechanical treatment and of the material used. Consequently, the noise thermometer retains its initial precision even after anly length of application time. Thisproperty {{is important for the}} applieation in nuclear reactors requiring Jong periods of exposure. Noise thermometry is based an the Nyquist theorem of thermal noise. Avcording to this theorem, a statistically fluctuating voltage, the mein square of which is proportional to the absolute temperature, is generated aeross the terminals of a passive unloaded network. The amplitude of the noise voltage lies in the range of 10 $^{- 7 }$ and 10 $^{- 6 }$ V. In order to avoid the difficulties of an absolute measurement of these 1 ow voltages, a comparison method is being used, which, at the same time, {{has been developed}} as Zero method. The noise voltages of two resistors, one being at the unknown temperature and the other at a reference temperature, are being compared, Tf the noise voltages of both resistors are equal, the quotient of the resistance determines the quotient of the absolute temperatures. []wring the firnt noise temperature measurements in the laboratory, the electronic measuring equipment was tested. Nereby, an accuracy of 0. 1 % could be reached in the range of 300 K and 1200 K. Noise temperature measurement were carried out in fuel element positions in the FRJ- 2, and it was experimentally proved that even an intense reactor radiation does not influence the function of the noise thermometer. Pur these measurements, a fuliy transistorized measuring equipment had been used, in which the noise of the amplifier was eliminated by Gross correlation. The measuring sensor was heated up by the gamma radiation of the reactor, and the temperature could be varied within certain Limits by the gas supply of the measuring rig. The thermal neutron flux at theux sensor position amounted to 6 x 10 $^{ 13 }$ nv and the gamma fl amounted to 2, 5. 10 $^{ 8 }$ R/h. A series of measurements was carried out in the range of 300 K and 500 K where all the noise temperatures were within the range of a calibration accuracy of 0. 5 % of the referencethermocouples. At the end of the experiment (duration : 3 <b>reactor</b> periods), the <b>noise</b> thermometer had been expnsed to an integral thermal, neutron flox of 3 x 10 $^{ 20 }$ nvt,and the noise resistance had changed by 6 %. The operating capacity of the noise thermometer had, of course, not been impaired in any way by this process. The experiment has also shown that the noise thermometer is applicable even at long distances between thermometer and amplifier (in our Gase 15 m} and in an environment with intense electro-magnetic interference fields. Noise thermometry can therefore be used as a measuring method under rough conditions in nuclear reactors...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the neutron noise arising in power reactor systems. Generally, it {{can be divided into}} two major parts: first, neutron noise diagnostics, or more specifically, novel methods and {{algorithms}} to monitor nuclear industrial reactors; and second, contributions to neutron noise theory as applied to power <b>reactor</b> systems. Neutron <b>noise</b> diagnostics is presented by two topics. The first one is a theoretical study on the possibility to use a newly proposed current-flux (C/F) detector in Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR) for the localisation of anomalies. The second topic concerns various methods to detect guide tube impacting in Boiling Water Reactors (BWR). The significance of these problems comes from the operational experience. The thesis describes a novel method to localise vibrating control rods in a PWR by using only one C/F detector. Another novel method, based on wavelet analysis, is put forward to detect impacting guide tubes in a BWR. Neutron noise theory is developed for both Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and traditional reactors. By design the accelerator-driven systems would operate in a subcritical mode with a strong external source. This calls for a revision of many concepts and methods that have been developed for traditional reactors and also it poses a number of new problems. As for the latter, the thesis investigates the space-dependent neutron noise caused by a fluctuating source. It is shown that the frequency-dependent spatial behaviour exhibits some new properties that are different from those known in traditional critical systems. On the other hand, various reactor physics approximations (point kinetic, adiabatic etc.) have not been defined yet for the subcritical systems. In this respect the thesis presents a systematic formulation of the above mentioned approximations as well as investigations of their properties. Another important problem in neutron noise theory is the treatment of moving boundaries. In this case one needs to redefine such common methods in reactor physics as point kinetic and adiabatic approximations because various functions involved have different regions of definition. The thesis presents one possible line of developing the general theory of linear kinetics as applied to systems with varying size. It also develops further the Green's function technique in two ways. First, the Green's function method is used to obtain an analytical solution for the one-group model with constant parameters. Mathematically, the model is described by an equation with inhomogeneous boundary condition. In addition, the absorber model is proposed, which happens to be very useful in deriving, for example, the point reactor and adiabatic approximation for the neutron noise due to oscillating boundaries. Second, the Green's function method is developed to derive another analytical solution for the general multi-group model with space-dependent parameters. This leads further to the generalised multi-group absorber model, which, in turn, gives a generalisation of the point reactor and adiabatic approximation for the multi-group model. Moreover, the general absober model allows to develop further the adjoint function method to represent the neutron noise induced by fluctuating boundaries in the multi-group diffusion theory. Finally, the thesis investigates monotonicity properties of the effective multiplication factor, k eff, in particular it gives a formal proof to the nesting hypothesis, which states that k eff can only increase (or stay constant) in case of nesting, i. e. when adding extra volume to the system...|$|R

Both the HEU design by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the alternative LEU design by ANL have the same fuel lifetime(50 days) and the same neutron flux performance (8 x 10 {sup 14 } n/cm{sup 2 }-s in the reflector). LEU silicide fuel with 4. 5 g/cm{sup 3 } has been thoroughly tested and is fully-qualified, licensable, and available now {{for use in a}} high flux reactor such as the FRM-II. Several issues that were raised by TUM have been addressed in Refs. 1 - 3. The conclusions of these analyses are summarized below. This paper addresses four additional issues that have been raised in several forums, including Ref 4 : heat generation in the cold neutron source (CNS), the gamma and fast neutron fluxes which are components of the <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> in neutron scattering experiments in the experiment hall of the reactor, a fuel cycle length difference, and the reactivity worth of the beam tubes and other experiment facilities. The results show that: (a) for the same thermal neutron flux, the neutron and gamma heating in the CNS is smaller in the LEU design than in the HEU design, and cold neutron fluxes as good or better than those of the HEU design can be obtained with the LEU desin; (b) the gamma and fast neutron components of the <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> in the experiment hall are about the same in both designs; (c) the fuel cycle length is 50 days for both designs; and (d) the absolute value of the reactivity worth of the beam tubes and other experiment facilities is smaller in the LEU design, allowing its fuel cycle length to be increased to 53 or 54 days. Based on the excellent results for the Alternative LEU Design that were obtained in all analyses, the RERTR Program reiterates its conclusion that there are no major technical issues regarding use of LEU fuel instead of HEU fuel in the FRM-II and that it is definitely feasible to use LEU fuel in the FRM-II without compromising the safety or performance of the facility...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{fluctuations}} in both low power systems and power reactors carry important {{information about the}} system. The origin of the fluctuations is different in these two regimes; at low power it is the branching (multiple generation of several neutrons in fission) and in power reactors it is the technological processes of random character, such as boiling of the coolant, vibration of mechanical structures etc., which induce the neutron noise. Both the mathematical description and the fields of application differ for these two cases.

40|$|The zero-power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> {{theory in}} a steady neutron {{multiplying}} medium was extended recently to a medium randomly varying in time. However, it was found that, for a time-varying medium where the transition probability randomly fluctuates, {{the treatment of the}} joint moments of the neutron number N and the medium state η by the forward master equation approach leads to a closure problem. The present paper describes and demonstrates a moment calculation technique that can solve this closure problem exactly in a time-varying binary multiplying medium where η has two possible realizations. In addition to the first and the second moments of N alone, the asymptotic values of the joint moments of N n and η m in the time-varying multiplying medium were also obtained in a compact form for n = 1, 2 and an arbitrary value of m, without closure assumptions. It was found that, for even m values, the asymptotic values of the moments of N n and η m are uncorrelated, whereas for odd m values, they are negatively correlated, i. e., their covariance is less than zero. Furthermore, a perfect agreement was found between the Monte Carlo solutions and the theoretical expressions derived...|$|E

This numerical technique can be used in the nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> analysis field for identifying and locating vibrating reactor core components;The mathematical equations were developed and two types of solutions were obtained. The first solution was a modification of a three-dimensional nodal model developed to handle multigroup neutron diffusion equations. In this model, the Fourier transformed fluxes were expanded in the Legendre polynomial form. The second is an analytical procedure developed for a simple geometry and material composition. In the analytical model, the frequency-dependent flux was expanded in the eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz equation which yielded a series form solution. This solution was used to verify the validity of the nodal numerical technique;The nodal computer code was tested for 8, 64, and 216 node problems. Moreover, it was examined for frequencies inside and outside the plateau region of the zero power reactor transfer function. Frequencies considered were. 05, 10, 200 and 1000 rad/s where the plateau region extends from 0. 1 to 527 rad/s. The comparison between the results obtained showed that the nodal computer code can be used to calculate the frequency-dependent fluxes provided the reactor core is simulated by a large number of nodes and that the source is reduced in size so that it can represent point perturbations...|$|E

The measured noise response indicated a lifetime of (5. 25 plus or minus 0. 7) x 10 /sup - 4 / sec. Both measured values are {{in agreement with the}} calculated value of 5 x 10 /sup - 4 / sec. Four experiments utilizing the noise analysis technique were performed to determine the prompt neutron lifetime of the KEWB.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master´s {{thesis is}} to {{investigate}} if {{it is possible to}} extract more dynamic information out of physical signals from nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> measurements than what is possible today. This was achieved by investigating methods to examine and determine the process signal quality, and studying the corresponding transfer function. Accurate measurements of for example the core stability and the control system interference are required for detailed process diagnostics. By analysing real reactor signals, (here neutron flux and reactor pressure), it is observed that they are correlated. Becuase the structure of the real system is not perfectly known, two hypothesis have been made regarding the real system. Identification of the transfer function of the two simulated systems have been done using Matlab with process noise added to the system, with measurement noise added to the system, and with feedback added to the system. The identification models ARX (Auto Regression Moving Average), AR (a special case of ARX) and BJ (Box-Jenkin) have been used. From the results, it follows difficult to adapt a good transfer function using the ARX model to data. This is because of bad coherence. When identifying the transfer function using a spectrum, an AR model, a good approximation was seen, since the approximation does agree well with the spectral estimate. Here the input is not used. When identifying using an uncorrelated noise vector as input, we get a bias in the approximation, since the output can not be fully explained by the input signal...|$|E
40|$|Reactivity is {{probably}} the most important parameter related to the state of the nuclear reactor and, therefore, reactivity measurement methods have been investigated since long time ago because of their clear safety relevance. The purpose of this master’s thesis is to study new reactivity measurement techniques different from the ones that are nowadays carried out at VR- 1 reactor and also to see the feasibility of these methods in terms of deployment at VR- 1 reactor. For this purpose four reactivity measurement methods have been analyzed: the Feynman- 1 ̆ 007 d 9, the Rossi- 1 ̆ 007 d 9, the power spectral density and the reactivity meter methods. The first three techniques are based on the statistical fluctuations that delayed neutrons emitted in a fission reaction obey, so-called <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> phenomena. The Feynman- 1 ̆ 007 d 9 and Rossi- 1 ̆ 007 d 9 methods (also known as time-domain techniques) analyze the distribution of neutron detection counts within a constant gate time. On the other hand, the frequency-domain techniques (as the power spectral density method) are used to study general random variables by applying ordinary analysis techniques to the detector current output. The reactivity meter method is related to a reactivity measurement instrumentation that can constantly measure reactivity during reactor operation or experiments. For that reason it is worth to study them although they are not very useful in terms of education because reactivity is obtained directly. The outline of this master’s thesis is as follows: Chapter 1 is a technical description of the main features of the VR- 1 reactor. In Chapter 2 the most important parameters and set of equations related to reactivity are explained for {{a better understanding of the}} following chapters. Then, in Chapter 3, the three reactivity measurement techniques performed at VR- 1 reactor (Source-Jerk, Rod-Drop and Positive Period methods) are analyzed. Chapter 4 presents the new reactivity measurement methods mentioned before. Furthermore, in Chapter 5, the viability of these techniques at VR- 1 reactor is analyzed according to two requirements. Finally, in Chapter 6, the conclusions are made...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{problems}} in <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> diagnostics have been investigated {{within the framework of}} the present thesis. The six papers presented cover three relatively different areas, namely the use of analytical calculations of the neutron noise in simple reactor models, some aspects of boiling water reactor (BWR) stability and diagnostics of core barrel motion in pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The noise induced by small vibrations of a strong absorber has been the subject of several previous investigations. For a conventional -function source model, the equations can not be linearized in the traditional manner. Thus, a new source model, which is called the model, was developed. The correct solution has been derived in the model for both 1 -D and 2 -D reactor models. Recently, several reactor diagnostic problems have occurred which include a control rod partially inserted into the reactor core. In order to study such problems, we have developed an analytically solvable, axially non-homogenous, 2 -D reactor model. This model has also been used to study the noise induced by a rod manoeuvring experiment. Comparisons of the noise with the results of different reactor kinetic approximations have yielded information on the validity of the approximations in this relatively realistic model. In case of an instability event in a BWR, the noise may consist of one or several co-existing modes of oscillation and besides the fundamental mode, a regional first azimuthal mode has been observed in e. g. the Swedish BWR Ringhals- 1. In order to determine the different stability characteristics of the different modes separately, it is important to be able to decompose the noise into its mode constituents. A separation method based on factorisation of the flux has been attempted previously, but without success. The reason for the failure of the factorisation method is the presence of the local component of the noise and its axial correlation properties. In the paper presented here, we elaborate a modified and successful factorisation technique that takes the noise structure and the approximations performed into account. Due to an unseated fuel element, a local density wave oscillation appeared in the Swedish BWR Forsmark- 1 in 1996. It is of great practical importance to locate the responsible element as soon as possible. We have developed a method for the localisation of such a thermohydraulic channel instability. The localisation method was tested on simulated data and then applied to a measurement taken in Forsmark- 1 in early 1997. The results demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the method. The noise present in the Ringhals PWRs has been investigated and in the course of this work, we have developed a new strategy towards the analysis of core barrel vibrations (CBM). This new approach unites the CBM analysis in the time and frequency domains. We have also developed and applied a new model for the determination of vibration properties such as the amplitude, amount of anisotropy and the preferred direction of the vibrations. This method is quantitative and suitable for long-term trend analysis of CBM vibrations...|$|E

The present report is based on work performed by Carl Sunde, Christophe Demazière, Berit Dahl, Larisa Mileshina and Imre Pázsit, with the latter being the project leader. This report describes the results obtained during Stage 11 and 12 of a long-term research and development program concerning the development of diagnostics and monitoring methods for nuclear reactors. The long-term goals are elaborated in more detail in e. g. the Final Reports of stage 1 and 2. A brief proposal for the continuation of this program in Stage 13 is also given {{at the end of the}} report. The program executed in Stage 11 and 12 consists of fiveparts and the work performed in each part is summarized below. Development of core calculational methods for calculating higher eigenvalues and eigenfunctions Higher order eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the diffusion equation, describing a static core, have lost their significance when doing calculations in realistic systems, since there are usually made by nodal methods or other direct numerical techniques. However, there are situations when knowledge of the higher order modes is still useful. Such case is the separation of the global and regional flux oscillations in the case of BWR instability. Another case is the investigation of the stability properties of large inhomogeneous cores, which is usually quantified with the so-called eigenvalue separation, ES= 1 /k 1 - 1 /k 0 where k 0 and k 1 are the fundamental and first higher order eigenvalues, respectively. Numerical codes used for ICMF calculations usually do not have the option of calculating the higher order eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In idealised systems, these can be calculated with semi-analytical methods (the eigenvalue is determined numerically from a transcendental equation, but the eigenfunctions are simple trigonometric or hyperbolic functions). In order to get insight into the characteristics of the higher order eigenmodes of the neutron flux and the adjoint, these were calculated in a reflected homogeneous system with two-group theory. The adjoint eigenmodes are necessary if an orthogonality property needs to be used, such as the separation of the modes from a flux shape which is a sum of several eigenmodes. At the same time, the so-called numerical noise simulator, developed at the Department, was extended such that it became suitable for the calculation of the higher order eigenmodes, both direct and adjoint ones. This simulator can treat real inhomogeneous cores, with an input deck compatible with that of SIMULATE. It had a static module from the beginning, because it is essential that the algorithm for the dynamic part works with data that belong to a critical core. This static module was now developed further such that it can calculate higher eigenmodes. The simulator was used to calculate the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in the same model system as the ones in which the semi-analytical calculations were made. Excellent agreement was found between the two methods. Calculations were made in a large and a small system, and the decay of the higher eigenvalues with the order number could be compared. Since the benchmark showed the correct functioning of the simulator, it can be used in the continuation for treating real inhomogeneous systems. Investigation of reactor kinetics and dynamics in a reflected 2 -groups system The validity and applicability of the point kinetic approximation in noise diagnostic applications was investigated thoroughly in the past. However, most of these investigations were performed in one-group theory and homogeneous, non-reflected systems. It is clear that in such systems the dynamical properties depend on the neutronic coupling in the core through the neutron chains. On the other hand, the conclusions drawn from such models are not necessarily valid in all situations. This is especially the case then the detector is situated in the reflector, where no neutron multiplication takes place, and the dynamics is not determined by the fission process. For example when measuring the reactivity in a core under loading, an extra detector can only be put outside the fuel assemblies already in place. The difference between the core behaviour and the detection in the reflector was observed for instance in the recently finished EU 5 th Framework Program MUSE, which showed that the results of pulsed neutron measurements with detectors situated in the reflector could not be interpreted by the conventional theory, based on homogeneous system. It is therefore interesting to investigate the behaviour of reflected systems in two-group theory, and to compare it with the point kinetic behaviour. The investigations of such cases was hindered in the past by the fact that the analytical treatment is cumbersome even in a homogeneous reflected core, and prohibitively complicated in non-homogeneous cores. However, the noise simulator, mentioned above, is a very suitable tool to investigate this question. It was thus used in a 2 -dimensional model of a realistic reactor, supposed to run in a subcritical state, driven by a source. It was meant to simulate a core under loading. For the sake of comparison, a small system was also investigated. The full space-frequency response of the system to fluctuations of the source strength were calculated, and compared to the point kinetic response, also calculated by the simulator. The so-called break frequency method of determining the reactivity was also investigated. It was found that the system behaviour deviated from the point kinetic one quite markedly even in the small system, and that the break frequency method showed a relatively large error, that depended on the position of the detector used. Development of the theory of neutron fluctuations in a system varying randomly in time with the master equation approach Zero power noise and power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> are two different branches of the field of neutron noise. They depend on different underlying physical processes (branching in a static system, and fluctuations of the cross sections in the reactor, respectively); they are dominating in two different power regimes (low or "zero" power and high power, respectively); and last, but not least, they are treated with two completely different methods. The case of neutron noise in static low power systems is described by the master or Chapman-Kolmogorov equations for the probability distribution of the neutron number, whereas power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise,</b> induced by the fluctuations of the reactor material at high power, is treated by the Langevin technique, for the neutron flux as a stochastic process. For both the completeness of the description, and to describe the co-existence of zero power and power <b>reactor</b> <b>noise</b> in intermediate power systems, a model system with fluctuating parameters was treated by the master equation method. The first and second moments of the neutron distribution were calculated both for chains started by one single neutron, and by a stationary source. A number of new results were obtained, that are described in Section 3. First of all it was shown that the backward equation treatment is not applicable in systems with fluctuating parameters. The concept of criticality had to be generalised to "criticality in the mean", and it was shown that a system whose state fluctuates between a subcritical and a supercritical state, can be made critical with a given special combination of the system properties in the two states and the frequency of system state changes. For systems critical in the mean, the variance diverges exponentially, as opposed to the known linear divergence in static systems. It was also shown that in the case of low power, the fluctuations of the system parameters gives a contribution to the zero power noise, whereas at high power, the zero power noise component, arising from the branching (fission process) is indeed negligible and for small system changes (weak perturbations) the result obtained from the master equation approach agrees with that from the Langevin technique. Simulations of Feynman- or Rossi-alpha-methods for reactivity measurements of fissile material using MCNP-PoliMi Simulation of pulse trains of neutrons coming from a multiplying sample, or trains of detector counts caused by such particles, is very useful for studying stochastic reactivity measurement methods, such as the Feymnan- or Rossi-alpha methods, or problems in nuclear material control (safeguards). Such simulations can though not performed by the traditional Monte Carlo codes, since these do not sample the neutron histories with their full statistics. Besides, to speed up the calculations of the mean value, they use variance reduction techniques, which change the properties of the higher order moments, which are needed to the reactivity measurement or safeguards methods. Recently some Monte Carlo codes were extended with the possibility of performing simulations that reconstruct the full statistics of the neutron generation and transport. We have obtained and installed the code MCNP-PoliMi, which has the most general stochastic capability for doing time-dependent calculations for both neutrons and photons. The first application of the code was its use in a safeguards benchmark exercise. In the work performed in Stage 12, pulse trains were generated in systems close to criticality, such that the obtained pulse train was suitable for simulating a Feynman-alpha or Rossi-alpha experiment. This consisted of two steps. First a system had to be designed that was slightly subcritical. For this, the traditional MCNP had to be run, because there is no option of calculating keff with MCNP-PoliMi. In the second stage MCNP-PoliMi was run to generate the pulse train of detector counts. It was shown that with this method, both the Feynman- and Rossi-alpha curves can be reconstructed from a simulation. Hence the code will be used in the next Stage for the study of the accuracy of the Feynman- and Rossi-alpha methods in real inhomogeneous reactors. Pilot experiment in a moderator with a Cf- 252 source in order to test the Feynman- or the Rossi-alpha method We have obtained, relatively recently, two so-called Cf- 252 detectors from Japan. These are actually neutron sources, but constructed in such a way that the californium, whose spontaneous fission generates the neutrons, is put on the surface of one electrode of an ionisation chamber. The ionized fission products give a signal in the detector at each time, indicating thereby the neutron emission times. Such a source/detector is very suitable for neutron coincidence measurements in multiplying systems, such as for reactivity measurements, because one signal (the start signal) is obtained without the consumption of a neutron. Hence one of the detectors was transported to the Belgian nuclear research institute SCK. CEN, for reactivity measurement experiments. These will be described in a later Stage of the research project. The californium source was used in a pilot experiment to measure the time spectrum of neutrons measured in a pure moderator system. The signal from the detector was used as a start signal, and the detected neutron used as the stop signal. This way, the time decay of a neutron pulse in a pure moderator or absorbing material can be measured. Measurements were made with and without a moderator between the source and the detector, and a clear difference in the time spectrum was found...|$|E
