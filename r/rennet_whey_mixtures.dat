The dipstick performance was evaluated in a collaborative trial using skim milk powder and raw, pasteurized and UHT milk. The suitability of the dipstick was demonstrated in comparison with gel permeation-high performance liquid chromotography and a colorimetric method, by analysing 60 raw milk samples collected from farms in Brazil. The dipstick results correlated well with the HPLC results and were more reliable than those obtained with the colorimetric method.

40|$|Biacore biosensors (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) {{have proven}} to be robust {{analytical}} tools for the automated immunochemical detection of different adulterants and contaminants in milk and milk powder. However, the significant cost of the instruments is a disincentive for their wide application in food control laboratories. Therefore, a low-cost alternative optical biosensor (Spreeta¿, Texas Instruments, Attleboro, MA) was built into an affordable liquid handling system. Using this prototype biosensor, an inhibition immunoassay for bovine ¿-casein was evaluated for the detection of cow's milk in ewe's and goat's milk and for the detection of bovine <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> powder in milk powder. Comparable sensitivities were obtained for both adulterants in the Spreeta-based prototype biosensor and a Biacore 3000 instrument.

40|$|Synthetic {{microporous}} membranes with functional groups covalently attached {{were used}} to selectively separate beta-lactoglobulin, BSA, and alpha-lactalbumin from <b>rennet</b> <b>whey.</b> The selectivity and membrane performance of strong (quaternary ammonium) and weak (diethylamine) ion-exchange membranes were studied using breakthrough curves, measurement of binding capacity, and protein composition of the elution fraction to determine the binding behavior of each membrane. When the weak and strong anion exchange membranes were saturated with whey, they were both selective primarily for beta-lactoglobulin with less than 1 % of the eluate consisting of alpha-lactalbumin or BSA. The binding capacity of a pure alpha-lactoglobulin solution was in excess of 1. 5 mg/cm(2) of membrane. This binding capacity was reduced to approximately 1. 2 mg/cm(2) when using a <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> solution (pH 6. 4). This reduction in protein binding capacity {{can be explained by}} both the competitive effects of other whey proteins and the effect of ions present in whey. Using binary solution breakthrough curves and <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> breakthrough curves, it was shown that alpha-lactalbumin and BSA were displaced from the strong and weak anion exchange membranes by beta-lactoglobulin. Finally, the effect of ionic strength on the binding capacity of individual proteins for each membrane was determined by comparing model protein solutions in milk permeate (pH 6. 4) and a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6. 4). Binding capacities of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, and BSA in milk permeate were reduced by as much as 50 %.

40|$|Milk serum {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown by other workers to be partially protected from heat denaturation {{by the presence of}} milk solids (8, 15, 16) and whole caseinate (14). This study revealed that some serum proteins (B-lactoglobulin), as shown by the Harland-Ashworth test (14, 17), were more readily denatured in skimmilk than in <b>rennet</b> <b>whey.</b> A comparison of the heat denaturation rate of serum proteins in whey as opposed to those in whey containing 2. 5 percent isoelectric casein was also studied. A striking protection of serum proteins seemed apparent in the presence of isoelectric casein. However, it was learned that isoelectric casein interferes with results of the Harland-Ashworth test, and by taking this interference into account, that isoelectric casein has no affect on the heat denaturation rate of serum proteins. Some proteins are more sensitive to heat in the presence of miceller casein than in the presence of isoelectric casein or no casein at all. The addition of sulfhydryl-group blocking agents (P-chloromercuribenzoic acid and N-ethylmaleimide) inhibited serum protein denaturization in both skimmilk and <b>rennet</b> <b>whey.</b> Reactions of sulfhydryl groups following their liberation by heat resulted in much of the physical instability measured by the Harland-Ashworth test.

In previous work [1], we determined the state diagram for <b>whey</b> protein <b>mixtures</b> that were heated for 10 h at pH 2 at 80 °C. Under these conditions, the major whey protein, ß-lactoglobulin (ß-lg), forms fibrils. When <b>whey</b> protein <b>mixtures</b> are heated at protein concentrations in the liquid solution regime of the state diagram, cold-set gels can be formed by adding Ca 2 + ions at pH 7. We studied the rheological behaviour of cold-set gels for various sample compositions for <b>whey</b> protein <b>mixtures.</b> When keeping the total whey protein concentration constant, the elastic modulus, G¿, for the cold-set gels decreased for increasing a-lactalbumin and bovine serum albumin ratios, because less material (blg fibrils) was available to form a gel network. In the cold-set gels the interactions between the ß-lg fibrils induced by the calcium ions are dominant.

Whey proteins are a rich source of ACE inhibitory peptides and have shown a blood pressure reduction effect i. e. antihypertensive activity. The aim of this work was to develop a simplified process using a combination of adsorption and microfiltration steps for the production of hydrolysates from whey with high ACE inhibitory activity and potency; the latter was measured as the IC 50, which is the peptide concentration required to reduce ACE activity by half. This process integrates the selective separation of β-lactoglobulin and casein derived peptides (CDP) from <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> and their hydrolysis, which results in partially pure, less complex hydrolysates with high bioactive potency. Hydrolysis was carried out with protease N ‘Amano’ in a thermostatically controlled membrane reactor operated in a batch mode. By applying the integrative approach it was possible to produce from the same feedstock two different hydrolysates that exhibited high ACE inhibition. One hydrolysate was mainly composed of casein-derived peptides with IC 50 = 285 μg/mL. In this hydrolysate we identified the well known potent ACE-I and anti-hypertensive tri-peptide Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and another novel octa-peptide Gln-Asp-Lys-Thr-Glu-Ile-Pro-Thr (QDKTEIPT). The second hydrolysate was mainly composed of β-lactoglobulin derived peptides with IC 50 = 128 µg/mL. This hydrolysate contained a tetra-peptide (Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu) IIAE as one of the two major peptides.

The preparation of sufficient quantities of selected protein groups for functionality studies and food application tests requires considerable amounts of starting material, particularly in the case of whey-based constituents. Adequate amounts of membrane filtration surface area are, therefore, needed in order to expedite processing time, limit conditions for microbial growth and increase productivity from a product development point of view. With this objective in mind, a series of large pilot plant membrane separation systems based on microfiltration, ultrafiltration and electrodialysis were recently installed and commissioned. Rapid ultrafiltration of whey for the generation of high protein concentrates under a wide variety of conditions, including 'cold' filtration, is facilitated by a MemtechTM spiral wound membrane plant with a maximum surface area of 144 m^ 2 that is accommodated within 3 modules mounted in parallel.

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} buffalo and cows' milk and factors affecting the rheological and microstructural properties of Mozzarella type curd made from buffalo and cows' milk were investigated. Although {{there have been}} many studies on the rheological and microstructural properties of rennet curd made from cows' milk. There is no detailed information available in the scientific literature on Mozzarella type curd made from buffalo milk, and the effect of factors such as pH, acidification, gelation temperature and freezing thereon. Cheese and yoghurt are made from buffalo and cows' on a commercial scale without considering differences in their chemical composition, physical, mechanical and microstructural properties. Buffalo milk contains 40 - 60 % more fat, protein and calcium than cows' milk. Due to the higher total solids content of buffalo milk, it would be expected to have greater curd strength (G'), curd yield, curd moisture and fat retention than cows' milk. Mozzarella curd had a better texture and overall quality made from buffalo milk than cows' milk. The factors affecting the overall quality of Mozzarella type curd made from cows' milk were more pronounced than those made from buffalo milk. In frozen buffalo milk, pH, ionic calcium and dynamic moduli (G', G") of resulting curds were reduced when compared to unfrozen milk. This may be due to precipitation of calcium phosphate during freezing. Hence, the concentration of ionic calcium would decrease giving a final reduction in pH. For both species, the effects of acidification on the physicochemical and rheological properties were qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. Buffalo milk displayed a curd structure and rheology different from that of cows' milk, and the casein-bound calcium, as well as the contents of fat, protein and calcium, was also higher. Due to these higher amounts of casein-bound calcium, the overall curd strength of buffalo milk (as indicated by the dynamic moduli) was higher, at similar pH values, than those of equivalent gels produced from cows' milk. The degree of solubilization of calcium in buffalo milk during acidification was quite different from that observed in cows' milk with a lower proportion of the calcium being solubilized in the former. The effects of gelation temperature were found to be more pronounced in cows' curd than buffalo curd. The maximum curd strength i (G') was obtained at a gelation temperature of 34 °C in both types of milk. The maximum yield stress was obtained at the gelation temperatures of 34 °C and 28 °C in buffalo and cows' curd, respectively. The cryo-SEM and CLSM micrographs showed that minimum porosity was observed at the gelation temperature of 34 °C in both types of milk. Buffalo curd showed minimum porosity at similar gelation temperature when compared to cows' curd. The curd yield 50 % was higher in buffalo milk as compared to cows' milk. This was due to differences in chemical composition of both milks. The fat (50 %) and protein (30 %) were higher in buffalo milk than cows' milk. The minimum losses of fat and protein in <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> occurred at a gelation temperature of 34 °C in both milk samples. The different cutting times had a small effect on the yield and overall quality of curds made from both milk types. The curd rheology and microstructure of cows' curd was found to be different, even at equivalent protein/total solids to buffalo milk using ultrafiltration. This may have been due differences in fat globule or casein micelles size or different proportions of casein fractions. The curd yield on both dry & wet basis, curd moisture and curd fat retention were found to be higher in UF cows' milk than for buffalo and cows' milk.

40|$|A <b>whey</b> salts <b>mixture</b> {{was used}} as a partial {{substitute}} for sodium chloride to provide a modified Na:K ratio (1 : 3. 4) in the manufacture of white salted cheese using ultrafiltration. Reduction of chymosin addition from 20 to 8 mu L kg(- 1) of cheese was also investigated. Variation of salt and chymosin levels did not result in any significant differences in composition and physicochemical properties. The rates of proteolysis in terms of water-soluble nitrogen (WSN) and nitrogen soluble in 12 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA-SN) were affected by chymosin levels but not by salt treatment. Urea-PAGE electrophoretic analysis of caseins from the cheeses manufactured using three levels of chymosin and two salt types showed that the hydrolysis of alpha(s 1) -casein was higher than for beta-caseins but the differences between the cheeses were not significant (P > 0. 05). The chymosin level did not have a significant effect (P > 0. 05) on hardness and fracturability, suggesting that any variation in hardness due to the initial hydrolysis was being confounded by other variables. Cheeses including the whey salts product were harder and more fracturable (P 0. 05). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{thermal denaturation}} studies of whey protein and maltodextrin mixture. Different compositions of <b>whey</b> protein–maltodextrin <b>mixture</b> {{were exposed to}} various temperature and holding time. The main protein contents, i. e., β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-lac) before and after heat exposures were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Significant decreases in protein contents were found as temperature and holding time increases. Addition of maltodextrin to whey protein solution reduces the protein denaturation significantly. Formulation of 9 : 1 WPI to maltodextrin ratio was shown to reduce α-lac denaturation by up to 15. 1 % and even higher reduction for β-lg which is up to 74. 6 % after 20 min at 70 °C. Results from UPLC analysis of the residual native protein suggests that the thermal sensitivity of β-lg was higher compared with α-lac. Over 97 % of β-lg was denatured after 20 min as opposed to about 60 % for α-lac at 80 °C. Protein denaturation was also observed to increase proportionally with temperature. Results from this work {{may be useful to}} preserve the protein content in milk during processing involving thermal exposure...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{recovery}} and fractionation of whey proteins from a {{whey protein concentrate}} (80 %, w/w) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography is proposed. Standard proteins and WPC 80 dissolved in phosphate buffer with ammonium sulfate 1 M were loaded in a HiPrep Octyl Sepharose FF column coupled to a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system and eluted by decreasing the ionic strength of the buffer using a salt gradient. The {{results showed that the}} most hydrophobic protein from whey is -lactalbumin and the less hydrophobic is lactoferrin. It was possible to recover 45. 2 % of -lactoglobulin using the HiPrep Octyl Sepharose FF column from the <b>whey</b> protein concentrate <b>mixture</b> with 99. 6 % purity on total protein basi...|$|R
40|$|Hydrostatic {{pressure}} {{effects on}} <b>whey</b> protein/lactose <b>mixtures</b> were recorded with subsequent {{analysis of their}} structural, molecular and glass transition properties in comparison to thermal effects at atmospheric pressure. Experimental techniques used were small deformation dynamic oscillation in shear, modulated differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical modelling of glass transition phenomena. Levels of solids ranged from 30 to 80 % (w/w) in formulations with a protein/co-solute ratio of four-to-one. Addition of lactose protects the secondary conformation of the protein under application of high hydrostatic pressure. Nevertheless, pressurized protein systems are able to form three-dimensional structures due to the reduction in polymeric free volume {{and the development of}} an efficient friction coefficient amongst tightly packed particles. Systems can be seen as developing a &# 039;molten globular state&# 039;, where the structural knots of pressure-treated networks remain in the native conformation but achieve intermolecular cross-linking owing to frictional contact. Furthermore, pressure treated assemblies of condensed whey protein preparations could match the viscoelasticity of the thermally treated counterparts upon cooling below ambient temperatures. That allowed examination of the physical state and morphology of a condensed preparation at 80 % solids by the combined framework of reduced variables and free volume theory thus affording derivation of glass transition temperatures for pressurized and atmospheric samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{study found}} that milk whey is a {{suitable}} growing medium for the kefir grain (KG) biomass. Growth conditions were evaluated according {{to the increase in}} the kefir grain biomass. The content of lactic acid bacteria was determined by the limited dilution method. To determine yeast content the plate method was used. The mesophylic lactic acid bacteria accounted for the major of the curd whey microflora after cultivation of KG. By applying an API 50 CH commercial system of identification, 3 pure cultures were separated from the curd whey. However, none of the cultures could be attributed to any known lactic acid bacteria listed in the identification system. The growth of the kefir grain biomass in natural curd whey, partly evaporated <b>whey</b> and their <b>mixtures</b> is a process of short duration (1 – 4 days). It is possible to prolong this process by renewing KG nutrition medium, i. e. by regularly (every 1 – 4 days) adding fresh <b>whey</b> or its <b>mixtures</b> to the cultivation medium. It should be noted that kefir grain when cultivated in the natural or partly evaporated curd whey retains the quality of its main of microflora, i. e. lactic acid bacteria and kefir yeasts. The highest increase in the kefir grain biomass (21. 47 – 23. 13 %) was observed in the natural curd whey after 3 days cultivation. The biomass of KG increased after a long cultivation period (35 days) using a multiple transplantation method. The cultivation of KG in natural curd whey resulted in a sufficiently high content of lactic acid bacteria (107 /ml). Compared to cheese whey, curd whey has been found to contain a higher content of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts (after cultivation of KG) therefore it is considered a better medium for the growth of the kefir grain biomass {{as well as for the}} production of the microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to verify and {{evaluate}} the possibilities of FT NIR spectroscopy usage in dairy industry. The quantitative calibrations were developed to determinate concentration or physical parameter of sheep and goat milk, ice cream, Olomouc curd-cheese, dry sweet <b>whey,</b> <b>rennet</b> and made curds. Moisture content or dryness (for {{the nature of the}} product), fat, protein, lactose etc. as well as some other minority components such as fatty acid or physical properties (pH and titrable acidity) were established as the reference methods of the major components. All samples were measured by the spectrophotometer FT NIR Antaris. The calibration models for each component were created by using Partial least squares (PLS) algorithm and Discriminant analysis. Very good results were obtained for almost all the calibrations where all the correlation coefficients were between 0. 858 to 0. 999. By using discriminant analysis in order to obtain qualitative evaluation of products we were verifying the ability of FT NIR spectrophotometer to classify analyzed spectrum in to pre-defined classes and thus to determine differences by Olomouc curd-cheese, rennet and courds. The results of this thesis confirm the suitability of FT NIR spectroscopy for quantitative and also qualitative properties of raw materials, intermediate products, as well as final products...|$|R
