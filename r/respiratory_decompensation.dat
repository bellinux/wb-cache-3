40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{key role}} of noninvasive {{positive}} pressure ventilation (NPPV) {{is well documented}} in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) since it may avoid endotrachal intubation in w 50 % of cases when used as the initial treatment. However, currently only minimal data is available to assess usefulness of NPPV in COPD patients on a long-term basis. Even if such studies are difficult to manage, there is clearly a need for prospective studies comparing long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and NPPV in the most severe COPD in a large amount of patients and on a real long-term basis of several years. Two randomized prospective studies are being completed in Europe and the first preliminary results show that NPPV is associated with a reduction of hospitalization for chronic <b>respiratory</b> failure <b>decompensation.</b> The main beneficial effect of long-term mechanical ventilation in COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure implies a correction of nocturnal hypoventilation that could persist beyond the ventilation period because of a temporary improvement in carbon dioxide sensitivity that is often blunted in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether using a sitting-type car safety seats for preterm infants is advisable. Patients and methods: A total of 65 preterm infants underwent polysomnography in the supine and sitting positions. The infants with &# 60; 95 % of SpO 2 {{were assigned to}} the desaturation (DS) group. Their backgrounds, breathing patterns, and breathing types were analyzed.

Of the 18 DS cases, 15 were included in the non-obstructive group (8, periodic breathing; 6, tachypnea; 1, irregular breathing). Conclusions: Immaturity of the <b>respiratory</b> center and <b>decompensation</b> for the <b>respiratory</b> changes caused by the sitting position were suspected to cause DS in infants. Sitting-type car safety seats should be used with caution for preterm infants, and all preterm infants need to be screened by polysomnographic examination in the sitting position. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to look at changes in peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) prior to {{emergency}} department visits for decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It was designed as a prospective, double-blind study at the Albuquerque Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Twelve patients with an irreversible component of airflow obstruction on pulmonary function tests were assessed. At entry, all subjects were instructed in the use of a mini-Wright peak flow meter with electronic data storage. They then entered a 6 -month monitoring phase in which they recorded PEFR twice daily, before and after bronchodilators. The meter displays were disabled so that the patients and their physicians were blinded to all values. Medical care was provided in the customary manner. Patients were considered to have <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> if they required treatment for airflow obstruction in the Emergency Department (ED) and no other causes of dyspnea could be identified. Simple linear regression was used to model changes in PEFR over time. The 12 subjects had 22 episodes of <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> during 1741 patient-days of observation. Two episodes could not be analysed because of missing values. Ten episodes in seven subjects were characterized by a significant linear decline in at least one peak flow parameter prior to presentation. The mean rates of change for the four daily parameters varied from 0 · 22 % to 0 · 27 % predicted per day (or 1 · 19 to 1 · 44 1 min− 1 day− 1). The average decrement in these parameters ranged from 30 · 0 to 33 · 8 1 min− 1 (or 18 sd 6 %– 25 · 9 % of their baseline values). No temporal trends were found for the 10 episodes occurring in the other five subjects. We concluded that <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> is characterized by a gradual decline in PEFR in about half of cases. Future studies should be done to elucidate the mechanisms of respiratory distress in the other cases...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: Acute {{exacerbation}} {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leads to increased morbidity, mortality and requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). The {{aim of this}} study was to identify predictors of need of MV in these patients. Materials and Methods: Clinical symptomatology, demographic profile, biochemical parameters including renal functions, liver functions and acid base parameters, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score at the time of admission were recorded in 100 patients of COPD exacerbation. Various parameters were compared between patients in whom MV was required with those managed with medical therapy. Results: MV was required in 73 % of the patients. Parameters found to be independent predictors of need of MV were: Admission APACHE-II score ≥ 11. 5 {adjusted odds ratio (OR) [95 % confidence interval (CI) ]: 1. 42 [1. 08 - 1. 86]; P = 0. 012 }, first day pH ≤ 7. 28 (adjusted OR [95 % CI]: 1. 09 [1. 02 - 1. 15]; P = 0. 008), first day PaCO 2 ≥ 68. 6 mmHg (adjusted OR [95 % CI]: 1. 09 [1. 02 - 1. 15]; P = 0. 004) and worse premorbid functional status (adjusted OR [95 % CI]: 17. 01 [1. 95 - 148. 68]; P = 0. 01).

40|$|Exacerbations {{of chronic}} obstructive {{respiratory}} disease (ECOPD) are acute events characterized by worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnoea, leading to change in medical treatment and/or hospitalisation. AECOP are considered respiratory diseases, {{with reference to the}} respiratory nature of symptoms and to the involvement of airways and lung. Indeed respiratory infections and/or air pollution are the main causes of ECOPD. They cause an acute inflammation of the airways and the lung on top of the chronic inflammation that is associated with COPD. This acute inflammation is responsible of the development of acute respiratory symptoms (in these cases the term ECOPD is appropriate). However, the acute inflammation caused by infections/pollutants is almost associated with systemic inflammation, that may cause acute <b>respiratory</b> symptoms through <b>decompensation</b> of concomitant chronic diseases (eg acute heart failure, thromboembolism, etc) almost invariably associated with COPD. Most concomitant chronic diseases share with COPD not only the underlying chronic inflammation of the target organs (i. e. lungs, myocardium, vessels, adipose tissue), but also clinical manifestations like fatigue and dyspnoea. For this reason, in patients with multi-morbidity (eg COPD with chronic heart failure and hypertension, etc), the exacerbation of respiratory symptoms may be particularly difficult to investigate, as it may be caused by exacerbation of COPD and/or ≥ comorbidity, (e. g. decompensated heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolisms) without necessarily involving the airways and lung. In these cases the term ECOPD is inappropriate and misleading...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{usefulness}} of spiral computed tomographic (CT) scans {{of the chest}} with three dimensional imaging (3 D-CT) of intrathoracic structures in the diagnosis and management of paediatric intrathoracic airway obstruction was assessed. METHODS: A retrospective review was made of five consecutive cases (age range six months to four years) admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit and paediatric radiology division of a tertiary care children's hospital with severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> suspected of being caused by intrathoracic large airway obstruction. Under adequate sedation, the patients underwent high speed spiral CT scanning of the thorax. Non-ionic contrast solution was injected in two patients to demonstrate the anatomical relationship between the airway and the intrathoracic large vessels. Using computer software, three-dimensional images of intrathoracic structures were then reconstructed by the radiologist. RESULTS: In all five patients the imaging results were useful in directing the physician to the correct diagnosis and appropriate management. In one patient, who had undergone repair of tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve, the 3 D-CT image showed bilateral disruptions in {{the integrity of the}} tracheobronchial tree due to compression by a dilated pulmonary artery. This patient underwent pulmonary artery aneurysmorrhaphy and required continued home mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. In three other patients with symptoms of lower airway obstruction the 3 D-CT images showed significant stenosis in segments of the tracheobronchial tree in two of them, and subsequent bronchoscopy established a diagnosis of segmental bronchomalacia. These two patients required mechanical ventilation and distending pressure to relieve their bronchospasm. In another patient who had undergone surgical repair of intrathoracic tracheal stenosis three years prior to admission the 3 D-CT scan ruled out restenosis as the reason for her acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation.</b> CONCLUSIONS: 3 D-CT scanning is a useful additional diagnostic tool for intrathoracic airway obstruction in paediatric patients...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that low dose dopamine (< 5 micro g/kg/min) may have renal protective effects. There are, however, no randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies to support these observations. The contribution of improvements in cardiac output (due to beta(1) -adrenergic stimulation) to increases in renal blood flow, independent of changes in renal vasodilation, are unclear. There is little evidence to support any dopamine induced clinically significant improvement in renal function in the presence of diuretics. Given the limited evidence of benefits of low dose dopamine, potential adverse effects need to be recognized, particularly in patients with heart failure. Low dose dopamine induces hypoxemia in patients with heart failure by impairing both gas exchange and ventilatory responses and thus could precipitate <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> in patients being weaned from ventilators. Sleep disordered breathing is highly prevalent in heart failure patients-the effects of dopamine induced chemoreflex inhibition may prove deleterious in this condition. We therefore believe that current knowledge of the risk/benefit ratio of the use of "renal doses" of dopamine does not support its widespread use in patients with heart failure, particularly in those patients in whom respiratory function is compromised.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine a safe vertical musculo-fascial plication distance in abdominoplasty operation {{in order to avoid the}} risk of developing respiratory distress during the post operative period. Abdominoplasty is a surgical procedure that removes excess abdominal skin and fat (panneculectomy), and tightens lax anterior abdominal wall muscle; in which musculo-fascial plication is a major component of abdominoplasty in patient with significant divaricating of the recti muscles. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> may occur as a result of undue plication which reduces the intra abdominal volume with diaphragmatic excursion leading to abdominal compartmental syndrome. Fifty six patients for abdominoplasty were selected prospectively, during the period from June 1998 to February 2004, male to female ratio 1 : 13, mean age 39. 5, mean weight 95. 2 kilogram. To determine a safe plication distance (PD). The difference between two pre-operative measurements of the abdominal circumference was measured, before (BB) and after (AB) application of abdominal binder. The safe plication distance (PD) in centimeters = (BB) - (AB). The mean plication distance is 13. 5 cm. The changes in the pulmonary functions test before and after surgery were clinically insignificant. Pre-operative determination of safe plication distance is simple and convenient method which reduces the risk of developing respiratory distress in patients undergoing abdominoplasty in the post-operative period...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIdiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive parenchymal lung disease of unknown etiology and poor prognosis; effective therapy has remained elusive and the pathogenesis enigmatic. It has become clearer that a marked heterogeneity in disease progression exists in IPF patients. The factors affecting {{the prognosis of}} patients with IPF are poorly understood. Poor prognosis has been associated with older age, male gender, lower FVC, lower diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), desaturation during exercise, and the extent of fibrosis seen on imaging studies. Data from placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that deterioration in the conditions of IPF patients over time may not be linear. These data have highlighted the concept and importance of acute exacerbations. Rapid <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> may be more important than previously appreciated. The development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with {{pulmonary fibrosis}} is well recognized. The six-minute-walk test has emerged as an important addition to prognostic evaluation, with significant oxygen desaturation identifying a subgroup of patients with a much higher mortality. It is not yet known whether this observation denotes incipient pulmonary hypertension, itself a malignant prognostic determinant. It appears that the six-minute-walk test might have particular utility as a basis for prioritizing lung transplantation...|$|E
30|$|Finally, the {{greatest}} risk in using HFNC, as for any noninvasive ventilation (NIV) strategy, is that recourse to more invasive management may be delayed in cases of <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation.</b> Some authors have thus suggested that the failure of NIV, because it delays the recourse to mechanical ventilation, may actually increase mortality/morbidity. Up to now, this observation was been confined to the adult population [25]. In children, the risk of HFNC failure, defined as intubation requirement, ranges from 8 % to 19 % [15],[26]-[29] and reaches nearly 30 % when escalation in respiratory support is also taken into consideration [4]. In children younger than 2 years, HFNC failure may occur within 7 to 14 h [28],[29], whereas with other NIV strategies, failure was usually observed in the first 2 h following initiation [30]. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, {{it is impossible to}} determine whether this difference is due to the characteristics of the population, the variability in disease progression, or the respiratory support itself. HFNC should therefore be initiated in an emergency department or a pediatric ICU that has sufficient staff to closely monitor the patient’s clinical course and that is well trained to recognize the early signs of failure. After several hours of stability, the infant may be transferred to a conventional ward, depending on hospital policy.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dexmedetomidine is a {{selective}} alpha- 2 adrenergic receptor agonist that exhibits sedative, analgesic, anxiolytic, and sympatholytic effects without respiratory-drive depression. We prospectively evaluated {{the use of}} dexmedetomidine to facilitate the withdrawal of mechanical ventilation and extubation in 5 trauma/surgical intensive-care-unit patients who had failed previous weaning attempts due to agitation and hyperdynamic cardiopulmonary response. METHODS: Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine commenced at 0. 5 or 0. 7 mu g/kg/h without a loading dose. Background sedation and analgesia with propofol, benzodiazepines, and opiates was discontinued or reduced as tolerated. Dexmedetomidine infusion was titrated between 0. 2 and 0. 7 mu g/kg/h to maintain a stable cardiopulmonary response and modified Ramsay Sedation Score between 2 and 4. RESULTS: Following dexmedetomidine administration, propofol infusion was weaned and discontinued in 4 patients. In the fifth patient, benzodiazepine and opiate infusions were reduced. Ventilatory support in all patients could be weaned to continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H 2 O without agitation, hemodynamic instability, or <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation.</b> All patients were extubated while receiving dexmedetomidine infusion (mean dose of 0. 32 +/- 0. 08 mu g/kg/h). One patient required reintubation for upper-airway obstruction.

METHODS: With 6 stable {{patients with}} restrictive chronic respiratory failure who were being treated with home NIV we conducted a 5 -step study: (1) The subject underwent an in-hospital baseline sleep study while on NIV, then next-morning pulmonary function tests. (2) At home, on consecutive nights, the subject underwent the same sleep-study measurements while not using NIV, until the patient had what we defined as <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> (oxygen saturation measured via pulse oximetry [SpO 2] 50 mm Hg, with or without headaches, fatigue, or worsening dyspnea).

Thirty one children had primary and 19 secondary immune deficiency, 14 {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS), and three AIDS related complex. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed during fibreoptic bronchoscopy, under local anaesthesia in all but two. One or more infective agents was found in eight of 11 patients with severe acute pneumonia and in 26 of 62 patients with interstitial pneumonitis. In interstitial pneumonitis, the most frequently encountered agents were Pneumocystis carinii (12), cytomegalovirus (8), and Aspergillus fumigatus (3). The yield {{was related to the}} severity of interstitial pneumonitis. The mean cellular count and cytological profile in lavage returns from patients with varying infective agents or underlying pathological conditions showed no significant difference, except in those children with AIDS and AIDS related complex who had appreciable lymphocytosis (mean percentage of lymphocytes 28 (SD 17]. In children with AIDS and chronic interstitial pneumonitis lymphocytosis without pneumocystis infection was observed in eight of nine bronchoalveolar lavage returns and was suggestive of pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia.

40|$|PurposeTo compare {{percutaneous}} radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) {{in terms}} of tolerance, efficacy, and survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Materials and Methods Forty patients with ALS (17 men; mean age, 66. 1 years; range, 39 – 83 y) underwent 21 PEG and 22 PRG attempts (including three unsuccessful PEG attempts) from 1999 to 2005. To assess tolerance and efficacy, a successful and well tolerated placement was defined as any successful placement with no major or minor local complications or pain requiring opioid analgesic agents. Univariate analysis was performed for all recorded parameters, followed by multivariate analysis for successful and well tolerated placement, 6 -month mortality rate, and survival. Results General success rates were 85. 7 % for PEG and 100 % for PRG. Pain was more frequent in PRGs (81. 8 % vs 52. 4 %; P =. 05). Successful and well tolerated placement was seen in 81. 8 % of PRGs and 57. 1 % of PEGs (P = 0. 1). Advanced age (P =. 02) and PRG (P =. 07) were predictive of successful and well tolerated placement. The interval from diagnosis to placement (P =. 001) and ability to perform spirometry (P =. 002) were predictive of survival. Oximetry measurements (P =. 007) and interval from diagnosis to placement (P =. 02) were predictive of mortality at 6 months. Conclusions PRG is more efficacious and better tolerated than PEG, essentially because it avoids the <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> that may occur in PEG. Therefore, PRG should be preferred in cases of ALS. Survival is linked to ALS evolution {{and not to the}} choice of PRG or PEG placement...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : Although {{neonatal}} pulmonary hemorrhage is rare, it {{is associated}} with high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with pulmonary hemorrhage in preterm infants and to describe the clinical course, including neonatal morbidity, of infants who developed pulmonary hemorrhage. Methods : We performed a retrospective case-control study of 117 newborn infants aged less than 37 gestational weeks admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Daegu Fatima Hospital between January 1995 and December 2008. Control group infants without pulmonary hemorrhage were matched according to the gestational age, duration of mechanical ventilation, and birth weight range (?# 177; 00 g). Pulmonary hemorrhage {{was defined as the}} presence of hemorrhagic fluid in the trachea and severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation.</b> Results : Pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 17 cases of very low birth weight infants (VLBW&# 59; birth weight &# 38;amp&# 59;lt&# 59; 1, 500 g&# 59; median age, 3 days) and 22 cases of low birth weight infants (LBW&# 59; 1, 500 g ?# 160;birth weight &# 38;amp&# 59;lt&# 59; 2, 500 g&# 59; median age, 1 day). Antenatal maternal glucocorticoid treatment significantly reduced the incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage in VLBW infants. Low APGAR score (?# 179; at 1 min) and acidosis at birth were associated with significantly high incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage in LBW infants. Conclusion : Antecedent factors and timing of pulmonary hemorrhage of LBW infants were different from those of VLBW infants. The mortality rates of VLBW and LBW infants were 88. 2 &# 37; and 45. 5 &# 37;, respectively.

Both patients developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and died soon after. Because COPD itself is rarely associated with lethal pulmonary aspergillosis, both cases were reviewed, and a retrospective investigation was conducted. Both patients had repeated sputum cultures while on the medical ward before their admission to the ICU; none of the sample grew Aspergillus spp. A. fumigatus was found in tracheal aspirates of both patients from the first day of their intubation while in the ICU. The pulmonary condition of both patients worsened, and invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage. Despite therapy with amphotericin B, the patients died 16 and 22 d after intubation, respectively. Both deaths were attributed to pulmonary aspergillosis; autopsy confirmed a massive pneumonia of the five lobes due to A. fumigatus in one patient. Investigation revealed that an air filter had been replaced 30 h before the first patient was admitted to the room. Experimental air filter replacement performed 12 d after the second patient died revealed the presence of A. fumigatus {{on the surface of the}} filters as well as a 10 -fold increase in room air fungal counts during the procedure. This study shows that exposure to high concentrations of airborne Aspergillus spp. related to air filter change was associated with fatal invasive aspergillosis in two mechanically ventilated patients.

With mechanical ventilation, however, long-term survival has been reported from numerous international centres. We aimed to characterize physician attitudes to {{the various forms of}} ventilatory support for children with SMA 1. We surveyed neurologists, respiratory physicians, clinical geneticists and intensivists from all major paediatric hospitals in Australia and New Zealand regarding their views on ventilatory management of SMA 1. Ninety-two of the 157 (59 %) physicians surveyed replied. Respondents included 16 clinical geneticists, 19 intensive care physicians, 28 neurologists and 29 respiratory physicians. Almost half (47 %) opposed invasive ventilation of children with SMA 1 and respiratory failure precipitated by intercurrent illness. The majority (76 %) opposed invasive ventilatory support for chronic respiratory failure in SMA 1. In contrast, non-invasive ventilation was felt by 85 % to be appropriate for acute respiratory deteriorations, with 49 % supporting long-term non-invasive ventilatory support. Most physicians felt that decisions regarding ventilation should be made jointly by parents and doctors, and that hospital Clinical Ethics Committees should be involved in the event of discordant opinion regarding further management. A majority felt that a defined hospital policy would be valuable in guiding management of SMA 1. Respiratory support in SMA 1 is an important issue with significant ethical, financial and resource management implications.

ResultsMedian OS was 25. 7 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 20. 9 – 30. 5) and varied significantly between Child-Pugh A and B (28. 7 mo vs 13. 4 mo, P 1 treatments, and CR of all tumors at 6 months. TTP was 9. 1 months (95 % CI, 6. 9 – 11. 3). PFS was 8. 4 months (95 % CI, 7. 1 – 9. 7). CR occurred in 69. 1 % (159 / 230) of lesions and 48. 9 % (88 / 180) of patients at 6 months. Any one symptom of the postembolization syndrome of grade 2 severity occurred in < 22 % (41 / 186) of patients. No treatment-related hepatitis or death occurred within 30 days. Transient <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> occurred in three patients (1. 6 % [3 / 186]), and alcoholic intoxication occurred in one patient (0. 5 % [1 / 186]).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{congenital}} myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a {{group of}} genetic disorders of neuromuscular transmission causing fatigable weakness. Symptoms may be present from birth, but diagnosis is often delayed for several years, notably in post-synaptic CMS due to mutations in the DOK 7 gene. Recently, we noted a subgroup of children with CMS in whom congenital stridor and bilateral vocal cord palsy predated other symptoms. All had mutations in the DOK 7 gene. The {{purpose of this study}} was to review our population of DOK 7 CMS patients with congenital stridor and assess whether there were other phenotypic features which might raise suspicion of a diagnosis of CMS in the neonatal period, in the absence of limb weakness and ptosis and prompt earlier referral for neurophysiological investigation, genetic diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHODS: A retrospective case review of 11 DOK 7 CMS patients at a tertiary referral centre. RESULTS: Six patients were identified with DOK 7 mutations and congenital stridor, four requiring intubation soon after birth. Four patients had a diagnosis of bilateral vocal cord palsy and three required tracheostomy, successfully decannulated in one after 3 years. All six patients had difficulty with feeding, with weak suck and swallow necessitating nasogastric feeding in five, two of whom required gastrostomy. Despite all six children having had neonatal symptoms, the mean age at CMS diagnosis was 5 years and 9 months. CONCLUSION: CMS, particularly caused by mutations in the DOK 7 gene, is a rare but treatable cause of congenital stridor in the neonate. A combination of congenital stridor, especially with an apparently idiopathic bilateral vocal cord palsy and weak suck and swallow should alert the clinician to the possibility of CMS and prompt early referral for neurophysiology and genetic investigations. Confirmation of a CMS diagnosis enables treatment to be initiated, informed management of the VCP and anticipation of myasthenic symptoms, particularly life-threatening <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation.</b> Treatment may allow early decannulation or possible avoidance of tracheostomy. At least 12 genes are known to cause CMS; the presence of congenital stridor may help target genetic diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: For percutaneously tracheostomized {{patients}} with prolonged weaning and persisting respiratory failure, the adequate time point for safe decannulation and switch to noninvasive ventilation {{is an important}} clinical issue. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a tracheostomy retainer (TR) and the predictors of successful decannulation. Methods: We studied 166 of 384 {{patients with}} prolonged weaning in whom a TR was inserted into a tracheostoma. Patients were analyzed with regard to successful decannulation and characterized by blood gas values, the duration of previous spontaneous breathing, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and laboratory parameters. Results: In 47 patients (28. 3 %) recannulation was necessary, mostly due to <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation</b> and aspiration. Overall, 80. 6 % of the patients could be liberated from a tracheostomy {{with the help of}} a TR. The need for recannulation was associated with a shorter duration of spontaneous breathing within the last 24 / 48 h (p < 0. 01 each), lower arterial oxygen tension (p = 0. 025), greater age (p = 0. 025), and a higher creatinine level (p = 0. 003) and SAPS (p < 0. 001). The risk for recannulation was 9. 5 % when patients breathed spontaneously for 19 - 24 h within the 24 h prior to decannulation, but 75. 0 % when patients breathed for only 0 - 6 h without ventilatory support (p < 0. 001). According to ROC analysis, the SAPS best predicted successful decannulation {[}AUC 0. 725 (95 % CI: 0. 634 - 0. 815), p < 0. 001]. Recannulated patients had longer durations of intubation (p = 0. 046), tracheostomy (p = 0. 003) and hospital stay (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: In percutaneously tracheostomized patients with prolonged weaning, the use of a TR seems to facilitate and improve the weaning process considerably. The duration of spontaneous breathing prior to decannulation, age and oxygenation describe the risk for recannulation in these patients. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Nine {{consecutive}} end-stage {{patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF) awaiting lung transplantation were {{admitted to the}} pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in <b>respiratory</b> <b>decompensation.</b> They all received noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support and were evaluated {{to determine whether or}} not it improved their oxygenation and provided them with long-term respira-tory stability. BIPAP was applied to all patients after a brief period of assessment of their respiratory status. Inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP, EPAP) were initially set at 8 and 4 cm H 20 respectively. IPAP was increased by increments of 2 cm H 20 and EPAP was increased by 1 cm H 20 increments until respiratory comfort was achieved and substantiated by noninvasive monitoring. Patients were observed in the PICU for 48 to 72 hours and then discharged to home with instructions to apply BIPAP during night sleep and whenever subjectively required. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled through the hospital-based CF clinic. The patients ' final IPAP and EPAP settings ranged from 14 to 18 cm H 20 and 4 to 8 cm H 20, respectively. All nine patients showed a marked improvement in their respiratory status with nocturnal use of BIPAP at the time of discharge from the PICU. Their oxygen requirement dropped from a mean of 4. 6 ± 1. 1 L/min to 2. 3 ± 1. 5 L/min (P< 0. 05). Their mean respiratory rate decreased from 34 ± 4 to 28 ± 5 breaths per minute (P< 0. 05). The oxygen saturation of hemoglobin measured by pulse oximetry, significantly increased from a mean of 80 % ± 15 % to 91 % ± 5 % (P< 0. 05). The patients have been followed up for a period of 2 to 43 months and have all tolerated the use of home nocturnal BIPAP without any reported discomfort. Six patients underwent successful lung transplantation after having utilize...|$|E
