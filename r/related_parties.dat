This study aimed to analyze the determinants affecting <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions’ intensity in companies in the business groups in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The determinants were ultimate shareholders, good corporate governance (with independent commissioner and the Big Four public accounting firms as proxies), debt to equity ratio, and period of crisis. This study used panel data with quarterly time period from 2006 to 2013. Samples were determined by purposive sampling focusing on companies’ typology, namely companies in the three business groups representing the market capitalization’s three layers. The results showed that ultimate shareholders insignificantly had positive effect on <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions’ intensity. Independent commisioners and debt to equity ratio significantly had positive effect on <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions’ intensity.

30|$|Through <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions, {{cash and}} profits can be {{diverted}} away from firms either to controlling shareholders or to assist troubled firms {{within the group}} (Jian and Wong [2004]). For example, controlling shareholders loot their own firms during the emerging market crisis of 1997 to 1998. Firms in developed markets also use <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions to transfer assets and profits out of firms {{for the benefit of}} controlling shareholders (Johnson et al. [2000]). <b>Related</b> <b>party</b> transactions have also been under the limelight in a number of recent US and European accounting scandals, such as transactions between Enron and its special-purpose entities. <b>Related</b> <b>party</b> transaction is prevalent in China due to the corporate structures, economic institutions and the legal system. According to the 2001 annual reports of Chinese listed firms, 90 % of them are involved in different degrees of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions (Jian and Wong [2004]). State-owned groups are usually formed out of a number of related large-scale SOEs. Because of their planned economy tradition, SOEs tend to have more <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions within the group than non-SOEs. As such, <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions are more prevalent in CSOEs than in other listed firms.|$|R
3000|$|According to the {{contract}} {{theory and the}} agency theory (Jensen and Meckling [1976]), various stakeholders take part in corporate contracts with different interests and asymmetric information (Grossman and Hart [1986]). <b>Related</b> <b>party</b> transactions {{can be used by}} controlling shareholders and/or top executives for their own private benefits at the cost of deteriorating corporate value. Internal control is designed to help the organization accomplish specific goals, one of which is improving operational outcomes to achieve the strategic objective. A healthy and effective internal control system can prevent insiders tunnelling the firm (Kohlbeck and Mayhew [2004]). Of course, not all the <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions are value-destroying. Fair <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions are efficient and cost-saving. Due to information asymmetry, outsiders cannot distinguish the quality of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions. Companies that really need to engage in fair <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions may suffer from stakeholders' criticism. The most important stakeholder of CSOEs is SASAC because of its influence on important decisions of CSOEs including <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions despite the fact that SASAC cannot make any direct influence through multiple agency relationships.

To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there is no empirical research on whether and how internal control has any impact on <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions, especially in CSOEs, although some papers study the relationship between corporate governance and <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine whether <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions listed Chinese companies conducted with their controlling shareholders destroy value for minority shareholders. In addition, this thesis seeks to identify corporate governance characteristics that could have a mitigating effect on the occurrence of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions. The sample includes 1126 public announcements of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions with controlling shareholders disclosed by 577 Chinese companies listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2010 in accordance with regulatory requirements, the source of which is Shanghai Stock Exchange's website. Stock price data and key financial information for all the 894 listed companies are from Thomson Reuters One. In addition, the 2010 annual reports of all the listed companies are used to get data on corporate governance and information disclosure. The market-adjusted and mean-adjusted approaches are used to calculate short-horizon abnormal stock returns whereas simulation with bootstrapping is used to get long-horizon abnormal stock returns in relation to several benchmark portfolios. Ordinary Least Squares regressions and logit regressions are {{used to test the}} hypotheses. The main results of this thesis are: there is inconclusive evidence to suggest that <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions with controlling shareholders are particularly value-destroying for minority shareholders in the period studied, especially when it turns out that a prior detrimental types of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions are not necessarily associated with ex post negative cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). Concentrated ownership and poor information disclosure quality are related to a higher probability of the occurrence of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions, while the establishment of a dedicated <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transaction control committee and the engagement of one of the Big 4 auditors by the listed companies are related to a lower probability of the occurrence of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions...|$|R

This paper attempts to provide large sample evidence of these transactions in China where the corporate structure, economic institutions and weak legal system are conducive to the <b>related</b> <b>party</b> dealings. Using a sample of 131 Chinese listed firms in the basic materials industries such as mining, lumber, chemicals and building materials, we have found that firms that are controlled by a corporate group engage in more <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions than firms that are not. Among the group-controlled listed firms, the results show that they report abnormally high levels of <b>related</b> <b>party</b> sales, mainly to their controlling shareholders and other member firms in the group, when they have incentives to inflate earnings to avoid being delisted or prior to issuing new equity. Once the group-controlled listed firms have generated more free cash flows, they divert resources back to the group through providing other member firms generous trade credits. Our stock return results also confirm the conjectures that {{at least part of the}} <b>related</b> <b>party</b> transactions is perceived by the market as opportunistic.
