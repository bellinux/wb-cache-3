50|$|Flat roofs {{tend to be}} {{sensitive}} to human traffic. Anything which produces a crack or puncture in the waterproofing membrane can quite readily lead to leaks. Flat roofs can fail, for example; when subsequent work is carried out on the roof, when new through-roof service pipes/cables are installed or when plant such as air conditioning units are installed. A good roofer should be called to make sure the roof is left properly watertight before it is left. In trafficked areas, proper advisory/warning signs should be put up and walkways of <b>rubber</b> <b>matting,</b> wooden or plastic duck-boarding etc. should be installed to protect the roof membrane. On some membranes, even stone or concrete paving can be fitted. For one-off works, old carpet or smooth wooden planks for workers to walk or stand on will usually provide reasonable protection.|$|E
5000|$|If {{this is not}} practical, certain {{alterations}} to stable routine may be effective. The aim is to minimise {{dust and}} maximise air quality in the stable.

5000|$|The {{standout}} performers {{this season}} were North Hobart, who swept all before them winning sixteen {{out of their}} eighteen roster matches and finished on top.Glenorchy, Clarence and Hobart all performed very well throughout the season, all vying for top-two positions at various stages.1986 Grand Finalists Sandy Bay, {{with the loss of}} as many as ten senior players from the previous year's team, performed poorly under Andy Bennett and slid to second last on the ladder by season's end.Burnie Hawks, Devonport and the much-improved South Launceston all strived for the final spot in the top-five, Burnie Hawks managing to cling to fifth {{at the end of the}} roster series, six games (24 points) behind Hobart in fourth.Devonport, whose history in the NWFU over the previous fifty years had been one of considerable under-achievement, having only won one flag since 1938 were looking in fine form midway through the season and were also challenging for a top-three spot, but fell in a heap at the latter end of the season dropping its final seven matches to miss the five by 10.70%, whilst South Launceston, who had performed very well at the latter end of the season needed to beat the rampaging North Hobart at Youngtown in the final round to make the finals but were demolished by 121-points.New Norfolk, still sorting out their considerable financial problems stemming back to their 1982 TANFL Premiership year, weren't able to produce consistent football and remained in the bottom three.North Launceston under coach Tony [...] "Chang" [...] Young struggled again to make an impact and finished on the bottom, however the club had earmarked some major changes to its playing list and coaching staff over the next eighteen months to become a power club once again.Glenorchy and Clarence would again do battle in the finals, the Magpies winning a classic contest in the Qualifying Final after trailing for most of the first half, only winning in the closing minutes by 13-points.The following day, Hobart and the Burnie Hawks met in the Elimination Final at KGV Football Park to an unusual sight in TFL Football, a thunderstorm just prior to the opening bounce.The weather failed to dampen the Tigers spirits as they raced away after quarter-time to take a 51-point victory and earn a shot at Clarence in the First Semi Final.The Second Semi Final between North Hobart and Glenorchy at North Hobart Oval was pretty much a one-sided contest after quarter-time as the Demons pegged back a slender Magpie lead and raced away with the match to win by 41-points, their followers were jubilant at the chance of seeing their Red & Blue heroes break a long premiership hoodoo.At KGV Football Park the following day, Hobart and Clarence staged an epic First Semi Final.The Roos held sway for much of the day including an 11-point three-quarter time lead, but Hobart struck back and 29-minutes into the final quarter, Hobart's Alistair Lynch marked 30-metres out from goal and was felled heavily by Clarence centre half-back Greg Farquahar (who was subsequently suspended for five matches over the incident), Lynch was stretchered from the ground.Burly Tiger full-forward Wayne Fox took the kick to win the game for Hobart, but field umpire Haydyn Nielsen failed to pay the mandatory 15-metre penalty to Fox after reporting Farquahar, Fox's shot missed narrowly and the Roos were able to hold on for the final few seconds to win by four points.Glenorchy and Clarence again met in the Preliminary Final at North Hobart Oval before an expectant crowd of almost 7,000 and the match did not disappoint.The two bitterest rivals in Tasmanian football were neck and neck all day with many lead-changes but the Magpies held sway at all three changes, eventually holding out the Roos by twelve points to play in another Grand Final.The Grand Final saw North Hobart hoping to end a premiership drought extending back to 1974, Glenorchy aiming for a hat-trick of TFL premierships.The match was eerily similar to the Second Semi Final clash between the same two sides with Glenorchy getting out a fast start and North Hobart reeling them in and racing away with match.North Hobart booted a Grand Final record 11.3 (69) in the second quarter to go into half-time 19-points to the good of the Magpies, then inflicting further damage in the third quarter by racing out a 56-point lead at the final change.North Hobart fans celebrated wildly as their team broke its 13-year premiership drought in emphatic fashion by 52-points.At North Hobart Oval, works commenced on the building of the $1.25 million Doug Plaister Stand, after the 1923-built Letitia Street Stand was destroyed by a mid-morning fire on Sunday, 31 May.The stand, which had had works carried out on it in recent years by the Hobart City Council after ABC-Television engineers raised safety concerns over the structure in 1980 and had later been condemned in 1981, was destroyed when <b>rubber</b> <b>matting</b> was deliberately set on fire in a store-room at the rear of the structure, two youths were questioned by police over the fire but no charges were laid, the damage was estimated at $50,000 and the structure was demolished by the Hobart City Council that same day due to safety concerns.|$|E

40|$|Materials that {{increase}} floor friction forces in absorption of foot pressure {{could reduce the}} risk of slipping, i. e. promote walking safety. The effects of fouled rubber mat floor conditions on the gait of 10 pigs walking in a curve, using kinematics and kinetics to record gait parameters and slip frequency are described and compared with clean conditions. Pigs adapted to fouled floor condition through reduced walking speed (10 %), prolonged swing and stance time and a higher number of 3 -limb support phases, but kept stride length and diagonality constant. This adaption produced a threefold reduction in lateral horizontal forces and kept braking and propulsion forces constant, resulting in a constant peak utilised coefficient of friction (UCOF) level in fore limbs but a 31 % reduction in UCOF in hind limbs. The better traction for pigs walking on <b>rubber</b> <b>matting</b> compared with concrete is due to a more effective transmission of forces from the limb to the elastomer, dissipating the forces into energy within the material, and thus impeding the effect of centripetal force, with less displacement of body centre of gravity and less forward and backward slip. Pig forward slip frequency on fouled <b>rubber</b> <b>matting</b> was 65 and 51 % lower for fore and hind limbs respectively compared with pigs walking a curve on fouled concrete. The soft flooring material improved gait adaption and could thus improve walking safety...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to assess the effect of cacao bean husk as bedding material in free-stall barn on the behavior, productivity, and udder health of dairy cattle, and on the ammonia concentrations in the barn. Methods Four different stall surfaces (no bedding, cacao bean husk, sawdust, and chopped wheat straw) were each continuously tested for a period of 1 week to determine their effects on nine lactating Holstein cows housed in the free-stall barn with <b>rubber</b> <b>matting.</b> The lying time and the milk yield were measured between d 4 and d 7. Blood samples for plasma cortisol concentration and teat swabs for bacterial counts were obtained prior to morning milking on d 7. The time-averaged gas-phase ammonia concentrations in the barn were measured between d 2 and d 7. Results The cows spent approximately 2 h more per day lying in the stalls when bedding was available than without bedding. The milk yield increased in the experimental periods when cows had access to bedding materials as compared to the period without bedding. The lying time was positively correlated with the milk yield. Bacterial counts on the teat ends recorded for cows housed on cacao bean husk were significantly lower than those recorded for cows housed without bedding. Ammonia concentration under cacao bean husk bedding decreased by 6 %, 15 %, and 21 % as compared to no bedding, sawdust, and chopped wheat straw, respectively. The cortisol concentration was lowest in the period when cacao bean husk bedding was used. We observed a positive correlation between the ammonia concentrations in the barn and the plasma cortisol concentrations. Conclusion Cacao bean husk is a potential alternative of conventional bedding material, such as sawdust or chopped wheat straw, with beneficial effects on udder health and ammonia concentrations in the barns...|$|E
40|$|Furnished cages for {{laying hens}} {{exist in a}} wide variety of sizes and designs and should be {{equipped}} to allow hens to express some of their behavioural priorities. European Council Directive 1999 / 74 /EC stipulates that litter must be provided for pecking and scratching but the type of litter and the pad where litter is delivered are not defined. In the same way, neither the maximum nor the optimum number of birds per cage has been defined. Two successive experiments were carried out to analyse pecking, scratching (PS) and dustbathing (DB) behaviours performed in different furnished cages with different designs. Three group sizes of ISA brown laying hens (20, 40 or 60 hens, with the same density in all the cages), with or without additional feed distribution as litter substrate, were compared in the first experiment. The second experiment focussed on DB behaviour and compared two pecking and scratching pads (artificial turf or rubber mats), with or without wheat bran distribution as litter substrate, in groups of 60 hens per cage. Irrespective of litter presence, group size, and type of pad, DB and PS were mainly performed in the pecking and scratching area, showing the attractiveness of this area. In the first experiment, feed–litter provision in pecking and scratching area increased PS and DB behaviours, while group size did not affect them. In the second experiment, hens performed more DB in the pecking and scratching area when wheat-bran litter was present than when it was absent. <b>Rubber</b> <b>matting</b> was more attractive to hens for DB than artificial turf matting. Durations of DB bouts were not affected by the presence or absence of wheat-bran litter or the choice of pecking and scratching pad. In furnished cages, hens clearly seek out pads and litter to perform PS, and providing litter (feed or wheat bran) or rubber in pecking and scratching area is attractive for hens to DB in it. However, the cage design could be improved to promote more DB activity, for instance by increasing space of pecking and scratching area in the cage...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a field study, a laboratory study and two animal studies evaluating {{the production of}} timothy grass grown under New Zealand conditions, the composition of a commercially prepared ensiled lucerne and timothy mix (FiberEzy®: a 50 : 50 timothy lucerne mix) and ensiled timothy grass;, the stability of FiberEzy® during 12 months of storage; and also the digestibility and voluntary feed intake of FiberEzy®, ensiled timothy grass and Rye-clover hay when fed to Thoroughbred horses. For the field study, grass samples were collected from a representative section (6 m x 16 m) of a field in Reporoa, (Waikato, New Zealand) sown with timothy grass (Phleum pratense L.) on the 10 th of March 2010 at Longitude 176 ° 34 ’E, Latitude 38 ° 39 ’S. The samples were collected at regular intervals to investigate changes in the dry matter (DM), acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and lignin content of the crop over the growing season. There was an increase (17. 7 to 35. 89 %) in the dry matter content and lignin content (3. 0 to 6. 3 %) of timothy grass over time as the grass matured. Once harvested and ensiled, a sample of timothy grass and FiberEzy® were analysed for total DM, percentages of: crude protein; crude fat; crude fibre; ash; gross energy; hot water soluble carbohydrates; pectin, (NDF), (ADF), lignin, and vitamin E content. Lab analysis showed that FiberEzy® had higher levels of crude protein, pectin, lignin, ash and vitamin E (p 3 % of the body weight. The horses were again stalled individually in loose boxes (4 x 4 m) lined with <b>rubber</b> <b>matting.</b> Voluntary feed intake was measured over 17 days. Day 1 to 8 was the adaptation phase and from day 9 - 17 of the study the horses were scan sampled and videoed for two hours every morning(9 : 30 - 11 : 30 am) after feeding and two hours in the evening (4 : 30 - 6 : 30 pm) after feeding. There were significant differences in VFI between time periods (24. 3 ± 0. 9 vs 17. 8 ± 0. 4 kg DM /day, p< 0. 05) and between feeds (FiberEzy®: 24. 3 ± 0. 4 vs. Rye-clover hay: 17. 8 ± 0. 7 kg DM /day) but not an interaction. Behaviours were typical of loose box housed horses and differences in feeding behaviour observed correlated with the differences in VFI measured between feeds. The results of this thesis suggest that FiberEzy® is a suitable alternative to concentrate-based supplementary feed...|$|E
