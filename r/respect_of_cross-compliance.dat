40|$|The {{primary sector}} {{has always had}} a {{fundamental}} role in human activities. In recent years, major industrialised and developed countries increased demand for the positive externalities generated by the agriculture, while they reduced the importance of the sector in terms of production of food. The evolution of public intervention followed the change of the role of agriculture and has tried to propose instruments able to consider and balance both private and public interests. It is especially with the Mid Term Review (MTR) that policy maker has tried to implement a system of subsidies that bound the farmer to a series of activities related either directly or indirectly with the collective welfare. Moving from coupled aid to decoupled one linked to the <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> means changing the concept of public intervention. In this context, a useful evaluation tool should be able to analyse and to catch the changes in farmers behaviour by considering also the territory in order to locate the effects. The territory, as a matter of fact, is not only the place where the effects passively fall, but it is capable of interfering directly in the farmers decision-making process. Therefore, the development of specific methodologies able to analyze farmers’ behaviours and specific instruments linked to the territorial analysis could represent an important tool to assess agricultural policies effects both on enterprises and territory. In this framework a methodology based on the Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) and on the implementation of a Geographic Information System (GIS) seems to answer the several questions about the policies’ assessment and land-use planning. The present research integrates this two methodologies. PMP is used in a territorial model and {{it is based on the}} optimization of an objective function representing a farm gross margin while GIS allows to analyze territorial aspects and to locate the effects of the policy. This tool has been tested in a specific case study in order to analyse the effects of the CAP Reform (in particular decoupling, cross-compliance and modulation) on the primary sector and on farm land use potential changes. The innovative aspect of the research is the attempt to study the impact of agricultural policy through an optimization model that considers among its variables also the specific localization of farms. The final result is represented by the creation of georeferred maps in which the land use changes are evaluated and interpreted under the framework of multifunctionality, in terms of quantitative analysis regarding landscape and, abandonment risk and cattle distribution.

40|$|The {{benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> can be maximised only {{by taking}} into account the trade-off between economic costs due to cross-compliance prescriptions and environmental benefits produced. Both can, however, be strongly differentiated between different areas/farms. In addition, the effects <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> are conditioned by the ability to design appropriate incentives to compliance for farmers. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> under asymmetric information when the differentiation of the compliance cost function is explicitly taken into account. This is accomplished by the development from the public regulator of a mathematical model <b>of</b> optimal <b>cross-compliance</b> design under asymmetric information about compliance. The methodology is applied to a case study represented by the municipality of Argenta in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy). Empirical insights show the potential loss of net social benefits from cross-compliance when undifferentiated policies are implemented in cases with relevant differences in the value of costs of compliance. The analysis demonstrates that when the net social benefits of prescription have differentiated values, optimal policy design requires a differentiation of prescriptions and monitoring intensity. This is primarily addressed in this paper through the consideration of differentiated compliance costs. However, the same would apply to provide appropriate incentives to farmers, {{taking into account}} differentiated environmental benefits produced and Single Farm Payment endowments...|$|R

Usually, it will be more efficient to decouple social and environmental policy. The strong support for cross-compliance by the Swiss population is explained by a perceived unfairness in the distribution of property rights between farmers and society. If property rights would be redistributed, there probably would be no more need for cross-compliance. Agricultural policy, Tinbergen rule, transaction costs...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{and using}} the concept of 'cross compliance' this report {{provides}} {{an examination of the}} primary and secondary effects <b>of</b> agri-environmental policies. <b>Cross-compliance</b> is applied to a number of agri-environmental policies; CAP reform, the 'accompanying measures' of CAP reform and a selection of member state agri-environmental policies. The development of the concept of cross compliance provides a useful tool to perform evaluation on the effectiveness and efficiency of general policy instruments, but specifically policy scenarios designed to reduce nitrate pollution of groundwater due to agriculture and goes some way to help answer policy questions on which mechanism may achieve a wide range <b>of</b> performance criteria. <b>Cross-compliance</b> can be applied at different levels of the policy and can be used to categorise policies into a number of sets according to specified criteria. CAP reform policies designed to control supply, although having positive environmental effects, are not as successful at achieving environmental objectives in comparison to the 'accompanying measures' elements of CAP reform. However a number of the policies from the accompanying measures package, for example the protection of rare breeds and the shelter planting, have very specific and narrow aims and so do not achieve large positive cross compliance for reductions in nitrate pollution. The analysis also deals with a number of other policies, some agricultural in basis, such as the Less Favoured Areas policy, which scored highly in achieving income redistribution to the targeted group but failed in achieving positive environmental effects. A number of useful trends have been identified and these may be useful for formulating future agri-environmental policy in terms of achieving higher degrees <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance.</b> It is recognised that this technique would be usefully expanded and that it warrants further investigation in order that a quantitative valuation of positive and negative cross-compliance could eventually be attached to each policy. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper's aim is {{to assess}} {{effectiveness}} of the implementation of nature conservation measures in Polish agriculture. Environmental regulations influence main groups of Common Agricultural Policy instruments. In the I pillar of the policy, it refers to cross-compliance, in the II pillar it refers to agri-environmental programmes, the Natura 2000 payments and organic farming support. In Poland they are ineffectively implemented and insufficiently directed to nature conservation. This refers both to domestic environmental and agricultural policy. In some aspects they are not coordinated. This is connected with delay in construction of protection plans which are necessary for proper policy in the Natura 2000 network. Consequently, the specialized payments for farmers in the Natura 2000 network have not been implemented yet while the extent in which agri-environmental measures have been implemented is too small. Moreover, the system of control and certification in organic farming does not involve requirements referring to biodiversity. There are some deficiencies in biodiversity protection standards within domestic regulations <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance.</b> In this situation, Polish agriculture could contribute to degradation of biological diversity in rural areas...|$|R

Within the EU this has been enshrined within the specific “Protocol on Protection and Welfare of Animals” of theEC Treaty, obliging Member States and the EU Institutions to pay full regard {{to the welfare of}} animals when formulating and implementing Community policies. There is a growing body of EU legislation on thisissue, founded on clear scientific principles, taking account of public concerns, stakeholder input and possible socioeconomicimplications. Recent Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms also testify to animal welfare’s growing stature in policy-making, with the introduction of the principle <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> regardingeligibility for direct payments and additional financial incentives for producers to achieve higher welfare standards. Animal welfare isbeing increasingly perceived as an integral element of overall food quality, having important implications for animal health andfood safety.
