50|$|The {{building}} has an entrance in {{the centre of}} both the George Street and William Street elevations. Each entrance is marked with a broken segmental pediment. Behind the upper colonnades {{there is a long}} <b>recessed</b> <b>balcony.</b> The use of fine wrought iron detail to balustrades, railings and gates compliments the masonry detail.|$|E
50|$|Reverie Cove is set {{near the}} end of Harbor Lane, {{overlooking}} Frenchman Bay and eastward toward the village center of Bar Harbor. It is a large frame house 2-1/2 stories in front and 3-1/2 in back, with a complex hip roof, three brick chimneys, wooden shingle siding, and a granite foundation. The main facade faces west (away from the water), and is five bays wide, with projecting portico-like sections at both ends. Stylistically identical, one shelters the main entrance, while the other is a covered porch. Both are topped by <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies,</b> and are supported by paired large square columns. Between these porticos are a band of four diamond-pane sash windows, with a large round-arch diamond-pane window at the second level. Between this large window and the <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies</b> there are small half-round windows. At the outer corners of the facade are slightly projecting sections topped by hip-roof sections with eyebrow dormers. The half-story between these projections also has a low-profile hip-roof dormer. The eastern facade, facing the water, is also elaborate, with <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies</b> under arches {{at the center of the}} third level, and projecting semi-circular balconies at the second.|$|R
5000|$|... 1905-7: Two-storey Edwardian Baroque front {{added to}} {{building}} providing postmaster’s quarters at first floor, effectively burying the original building. This included two <b>recessed</b> upstairs <b>balconies</b> and two arched openings {{providing access to}} the central postal hall. It would appear that these alterations also included an additional bay along the north side elevation and the reconstruction of {{part of the original}} roof directly behind the new two-storied section and over the north bay to create a lantern over a new mail room (now post shop). The new upstairs component, quite shallow in plan, was delineated by two open, but <b>recessed,</b> <b>balconies</b> and a domestically figured central upper window (the balconies were filled in around the 1940s). It was connected to the ground floor by a square stairwell placed where the front entry had previously been.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house is}} notable {{for being the}} first {{building}} in Israel to use elongated <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies,</b> an adaptation of Le Corbusier's strip windows. [...] Horizontality is emphasized by the narrow intervals between the building's parapet and overhang; {{not only does this}} have the design impact of emphasizing the horizontal style, it has the practical effect of screening out the heat of the Mediterranean sun. [...] The timbered pergola, a design element frequently seen in Jerusalem, is unusual in Tel Aviv.|$|R
50|$|The Shields Street {{elevation}} has {{a corner}} section {{similar to the}} Abbott Street elevation, but with a narrower portico forming a secondary entry and smaller arched windows to either side. The southern elevation, fronting the park, is similar again, but the ground floor portico is enclosed with an arched window, and the first floor has a <b>recessed</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thomas Galbraith Herbert House, {{also known}} as the Shealy House, is a {{historic}} home located at Batesburg-Leesville, Lexington County, South Carolina. It was built in 1878, and is a 1 1/2-half story Victorian Eclectic style dwelling. It is sheathed in weatherboard and has a raised seam, metal, multi-gabled roof.

Also on the property is a contributing fanciful, polygonal well house.|$|E
5000|$|Prahran Arcade - Built in 1889 on Chapel Street, is {{a richly}} {{detailed}} building both externally and internally. Retains the original arcade, but decorative roof was removed in the 1950s. Also {{known locally as}} [...] "Birdland" [...] due to pigeons which once bred in the <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies</b> {{of the building and}} the large eagles which adorn the facade, but are now screened by chicken wire. Was a Dan Murphy's cellar for many years, but currently a JB HiFi store. Now heritage registered.|$|R
50|$|Dronningegården is characterised by a Functionalist {{design that}} {{balances}} monumentality with local tradition. The four L-shaped buildings are 9 storeys tall and are built in red machine-moulded brick with detailing in yellow brick. Bricks are {{laid in the}} English bond with recessed joints. The west and east sides of the complex, which run parallel to Adelgade, are broken up by alternating gabled sections with open, <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies,</b> and inter-connecting sections decorated with cross motifs in yellow brick. The interior sides of balconies and entrances are clad in yellow brick.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{proposed}} at 32 floors rising 370 feet, {{the building}} has since been scaled back due to a neighborhood petition of 1,100 signatories. Above grade parking within {{the building has}} been scaled back from 8 to 4 floors {{in light of the}} reduction in residential units. The number of units has been scaled back from 227 to 182 mostly two bedroom condominiums. The facade design was changed before construction from a poured concrete exposed system to a masonry cladding with <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies.</b> The Architect is Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates.|$|R

50|$|The Britannia Adelphi Liverpool is {{constructed}} in Portland stone. It has seven stories, and its entrance front contains eleven bays. The central three bays {{of the ground}} floor comprise the entrance, which is enhanced by columns. The windows {{on the first floor}} are round-headed; the rest of the windows are rectangular. In the central three bays of the fourth and fifth floors is a <b>recessed</b> <b>balcony</b> with Ionic columns. There are similar columns on these floors in the second and tenth bays. Above the sixth floor is a cornice with a balustrade.|$|E
50|$|The {{buildings}} {{are faced with}} gray Indiana limestone in an ashlar motif. A cornice decorates the building above the first floor. The three-story courthouse building sits on a raised basement. The main facade of {{the second and third}} stories are decorated with a colonnade of eighteen free-standing Ionic order columns. Two-story modern windows are found between the columns, except above the main entrance. The entrance instead has a <b>recessed</b> <b>balcony</b> with round-arched windows and a balustrade. The three-story jail features similar windows, although these are original to the building.|$|E
5000|$|The 1970 {{report by}} the Landmarks Preservation Commission {{emphasized}} the building's [...] "superb Roman brick masonry, particularly in its use of rowlock arches and lintels above the openings." [...] Another feature deemed of particular interest was [...] "the use of <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies,</b> created by setting the walls and windows behind them, instead of projecting them out from {{the wall in the}} usual manner." [...] The report concluded that [...] "It is features such as these, which, in addition to the masterful use of materials, signalize the unusual work of Frank Freeman." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Albert Lammers House is a two-and-a-half-story wood-frame {{building}} on a prominent corner lot. [...] Queen Anne architectural elements include the massing, turrets, wraparound porch, woodworking detail on the gables, ornamented roofline, and surface texturing. [...] The house boasts an octagonal turret on the south and a round turret on the northeast corner. The complex front façade has <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies</b> on both the second and attic levels. The lower balcony has a latticework frieze while the upper has a seashell motif in its shape and flanking cartouches. [...] Much of the detailed woodworking was done by Scandinavian carpenters, which may explain the Viking-style ornamentation on the roofline.|$|R

50|$|The James C. Twiss House is a {{historic}} house located at 298 N. Page St. in Aviston, Illinois. The house was built in 1907 for James C. Twiss, a prominent Clinton County farmer. Architect George Franklin Barber, known nationally for his mail-order house designs, designed {{the plans for the}} house, which Twiss selected from a catalog. The Queen Anne house is two-and-one-half stories tall with wood siding and a limestone foundation. A hexagonal tower and a large gable with patterned woodwork mark the front facade of the house. The house's wraparound front porch is supported by Tuscan columns; a small gable, also with patterned woodwork, tops the porch at the entrance. A <b>recessed</b> <b>balcony</b> with Tuscan columns is located on the second floor above the entrance.|$|E
50|$|What {{appears to}} be the district’s most recent building, the Community Funeral Home at 909 Fifth Street (118-5318-0040) is {{actually}} a historic building with a modern shell. The right-hand portion of the building was constructed in 1922 as a two-story, two-part commercial block brick building with two storefronts separated by a doorway that led to a stairway to the second floor. The second floor façade contained an unusual central space that may have been a large window or perhaps a <b>recessed</b> <b>balcony</b> (period photographs do not clearly show this space due to shadows created by a cloth awning overhead). In 1976, Lynchburg architect J. Everette Fauber, Jr. created two design options for an upgrade and expansion of the building. The first option involved reconfiguring the left storefront of the building to include Gothic-style arched chapel windows, with a modern addition to the left (south) of the building. The second option, which is what was chosen, covered the entire façade of the historic building with a blank canvas of running bond brick, and joined to it a one-story addition with a striking, recessed angular entry. Whileobscuring the historic façade, Fauber’s second design achieved its purpose of marrying the two buildings and creating a cohesive architectural statement.|$|E

2500|$|Brighton's {{earliest}} council houses {{date from}} the 19th century. [...] Two landowners donated land around the present St Helen's Road in 1897, and simple polychromatic brick cottages were built to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Much council building {{took place in the}} 1960s and 1970s, often in the form of tower blocks. In Hove, the Conway Redevelopment Scheme lasted from April 1966 until July 1967. [...] Hundreds of slum houses were replaced by five towers with between 54 and 72 flats each; the ten-storey Conway Court is the tallest. [...] Dark red and buff brickwork, small areas of blue plastic panelling and <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies</b> characterise the buildings. About £2 million was spent. In 1976–77, old council houses in the Ingram Crescent area off Portland Road were replaced by low-rise flats in a modern style with varied architectural features such as weatherboarding-style timber, dark brickwork and catslide roofs. No council houses have been built since the 1980s, but in July 2010 the council announced plans to demolish Ainsworth House, a 1960s low-rise block in the Elm Grove area, and build a higher-density high-rise [...] "family complex". Planning permission was granted in April 2011, and the 15-home development called Balchin Court was opened in September 2013. In November 2011 squatters occupied the building, which was in a dangerous condition because it contained asbestos.|$|R
50|$|The first {{post office}} in Port Pirie opened in 1873, {{at a time}} of {{economic}} growth and development which in turn was a consequence of agricultural expansion in this area of South Australia, with the town fulfilling the need for a port to serve the agricultural region. Money order facilities were also established and a telegraph office opened in 1874. Tenders were called {{for the construction of a}} new post office building in 1880. The tender was awarded to J Fitzpatrick on 27 May 1880, who completed the building in December of that year. The town of Port Pirie then underwent new development after the opening of a lead smelter by BHP in 1889; this was later further expanded until, by 1934, it was the largest single-unit lead-smelting works in the world. Alterations were also carried out in 1898-9 to the post office, with the addition of two lobbies, one for telegraph purposes and the other for money order and savings bank business. Photos from c. 1905 and 1907 also show the addition of a new two-storied front in this period which effectively buried the 1880 design; the new addition had Edwardian Baroque detailing. The residential quarters were moved upstairs, indicated by two <b>recessed</b> <b>balconies</b> on either side of a central breakfront. Based on historic photographs, these were probably glassed in after the 1930s. A verandah canopy was added in 1920 and removed in 1945. (Warmington and Ward; SA State Heritage Register assessment) In the 1950s Port Pirie was proclaimed as South Australia’s first provincial city.|$|R
