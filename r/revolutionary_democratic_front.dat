25|$|In 1989, the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF) {{merged with}} other ethnically based {{opposition}} movements {{to form the}} Ethiopian Peoples' <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF), and eventually managed to overthrow Mengistu's dictatorial regime in 1991. A transitional government, composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution, was then set up. The first free and democratic election took place later in 1995, when Ethiopia's longest-serving Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was elected to office. As with other nations in the Horn region, Ethiopia maintained its historically close relations with countries in the Middle East {{during this period of}} change. Zenawi died in 2012, but his Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF) party remains the ruling political coalition in Ethiopia.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of Ethiopia's 547-member constituent assembly {{was held in}} June 1994. This assembly adopted {{the constitution of the}} Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in December 1994. The elections for Ethiopia's first popularly chosen national parliament and regional legislatures were held in May and June 1995. Most opposition parties chose to boycott these elections. There was a landslide victory for the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF). International and non-governmental observers concluded that opposition parties {{would have been able to}} participate had they chosen to do so.|$|E
25|$|The regime's {{collapse}} was hastened by droughts and a famine, which affected around 8 {{million people}} and left 1 million dead, {{as well as by}} insurrections, particularly in the northern regions of Tigray and Eritrea. The regime also conducted a brutal campaign of resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia in the 1980s. In 1989, the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the Ethiopian Peoples' <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF). In May 1991, EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa. Mengistu fled the country to asylum in Zimbabwe, where he still resides.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, a new {{constitution}} was written that formed a bicameral legislature and a judicial system. A general election in 1995 to elect the Parliament also elected Meles Zenawi as prime minister and Negasso Gidada as president. Ethiopia's second multiparty election was held in 2000 and Meles was re-elected as prime minister. In October 2001, Lieutenant Girma Wolde-Giorgis was elected president.

50|$|The Afar <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unity <b>Front</b> (ARDUF) {{was founded}} in 1993, through the merging of three Afar rebel groups, the Afar <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unity Union, the Afar Ummatah Demokrasiyyoh Focca (AUDF), and the Afar Revolutionary Forces (ARF). The three groups were united under the goal of {{creating}} an independent state in the Afar Region. The group operates within Ethiopia, allegedly receiving Eritrean support. In 1995, ARDUF perpetrated its first attack, kidnapping an Italian tourist. The victim was later released unharmed.|$|R
25|$|During the Ethiopian Civil War, May 1988 the 603rd corp of the Third Revolutionary Army (TLA) {{made its}} {{headquarters}} at Bahir Dar. On 3–4 March 1990, the TLA abandoned Bahir Dar in disarray, blowing up the nearby bridge with several hundred soldiers which stopped the TPLF/EPRDF forces from occupying the city. However, the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF) claimed they had too few effectives {{in the area}} to capture the town at that time, and the Derg army reoccupied Bahir Dar a few days later. The EPRDF gained permanent control of the city around 1810 hours on 23 February 1991, as one of the objectives of Operation Tewodros.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} government {{was on the}} verge of collapse as three rebel groups were obliterating its rule of the country. The Oromo Liberation Front, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front had differing alliances with each other, the TPLF and EPLF had a strong alliance and they both had limited coordinations with the OLF. In 1990, the TPLF formed several other ethnic based political groups from prisoners it had released and put them all under an umberalla organization called the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front.</b> The Oromo group in the EPRDF was the Oromo People's Democratic Organization and its creation was seen as an attempt to undermine the OLF.|$|E
25|$|The war {{went on for}} 30 {{years until}} 1991, when the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) {{defeated}} the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea, and the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF), {{with the help of}} the EPLF, took control of Ethiopia and removed the Marxist–Leninist People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. In April 1993, in a referendum supported by Ethiopia, the Eritrean people voted almost unanimously in favour of independence. Formal international recognition of an independent, sovereign Eritrea followed later the same year. The two main rebel groups, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) and the EPLF, fought the two Eritrean Civil Wars during the war of liberation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{reported}} that the ANDP {{was created in the}} latter half of 1999 from a merger of the Afar Liberation Front (ALF) and the Afar People's Democratic Organization with three smaller organizations—the Afar National Liberation <b>Front,</b> the Afar <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unity <b>Front</b> (ARDUF) and the Afar National Democratic Movement. However, there have been more recent reports indicating that the ALF and ARDUF still operate as independent organizations.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{this early}} {{commercial}} contact, neither side showed {{much interest in}} diplomatic activity with one another until the twentieth century. China {{was one of only}} five governments which refused to recognize Italy's conquest of Ethiopia. Relations were poor during the Haile Selassie era, when Ethiopia was allied with the western powers in the Cold War. Chinese support for the Eritrean People's Liberation Front contributed to tension between the countries from 1967. However, the two countries established diplomatic relations on 1 December 1970 when China agreed to recognize Eritrea as Ethiopian, in exchange for Haile Selassie's recognition of Taiwan as Chinese. Relations improved for a short period after the Ethiopian revolution of 1974, but became strained as the Ethiopian military junta developed increasingly close ties with the Soviet Union. After the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> took power in 1991, relations have steadily improved, with increasing diplomatic contacts and growing trade and Chinese investment in the Ethiopian economy.|$|E
25|$|In the {{meantime}} the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front and the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front overthrew the Ethiopian Derg dictatorship, {{leading to a}} period of political instability. The Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> assumed power by creating a coalition of ethno-nationalist movements from across the country, choosing the previously marginalised Ogaden National Liberation Front as its ally in Ogaden. ONLF's previously exiled leadership returned from exile, gaining the support of local population. Eritrea attained independence {{in the aftermath of}} the Eritrean War of Independence, inspiring ONLF to pursue a similar goal for Ogaden. In January 1993, ONLF candidate Abdillahi Mohammed Sadi was elected Somali Regional president by receiving 70% of the votes, Sadi was however sacked by Tigray People’s Liberation Front officials seven months later creating a power vacuum. Tensions between the TPLF and ONLF escalated in 1994, as ONLF split into a moderate wing willing to cooperate with TPLF and a radical secessionist wing led by Ibrahim Abdallah Mah that initiated armed struggle.|$|E
25|$|OLF {{says that}} {{the root cause of}} {{political}} problems in Ethiopia is the policy of oppression by the former Imperial state of Ethiopia and refusal by the state to respect the rights of oppressed peoples to self-determination. The current Ethiopian government recognizes the right of self-determination of all states in its constitution, but it is accused of placing limitations imposed on the exercise of that right. OLF believes that there is an imperial domination that must be brought to an end in order to bring genuine peace and stability. Thus there is currently a policy of shelving political problems which must cease. The OLF says that it is ready to contribute towards any meaningful effort to reach at a comprehensive settlement to bring peace to all peoples. In the view of the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF) another issue with the OLF movement has been the movement's treatment of Oromos who don't support OLF's ideologies. This {{is part of the reason}} the EPRDF helped to form an organization called the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization. OLF has stated that they do not resent Oromos for being members of the OPDO.|$|E
50|$|It is {{reported}} that {{in the latter half}} of 1999 the ALF and the APDO merged with three other Afar political parties - the Afar National Liberation <b>Front,</b> the Afar <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unity <b>Front</b> and the Afar National Democratic Movement - to create a new party called the Afar National Democratic Party. Despite this announcement, Radio Ethiopia reported on 25 September 2000 that the leader of the ALF, Sultan Alimireh Hanfareh, returned from exile to meet with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to discuss political, economic and social issues affecting the Afar region.|$|R

5000|$|Not much {{is known}} about Erta Ale and the {{surrounding}} terrain {{is some of the}} most inhospitable on Earth making travel difficult and dangerous. The Afar region also experiences intermittent ethnic violence due to unification struggles by the native Afar people. On January 16, 2012, a group of European tourists and academics was attacked at Erta Ale. Five tourists were killed, two taken as hostages and seven others wounded. The Afar <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unity <b>Front</b> (ARDUF) claimed responsibility for the attack and released the two kidnapped tourists in March 2012. One travel guide recommends hiring [...] "one or maybe two armed guards or police" [...] as guides to visit Erta Ale.

25|$|Some of {{the oldest}} {{skeletal}} evidence for anatomically modern humans {{has been found in}} Ethiopia. It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond. According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era. Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia's governmental system was a monarchy for most of its history. In the first centuries AD, the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region, followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137. During the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia was one of the nations to retain its sovereignty and the only territory in Africa to defeat a European colonial power. Many newly-independent nations on the continent subsequently adopted its flag colours. Ethiopia was also the first independent member from Africa of the 20th-century League of Nations and the United Nations. In 1974, the Ethiopian monarchy under Haile Selassie was overthrown by the Derg, a communist military government backed by the Soviet Union. In 1987, the Derg established the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, but it was overthrown in 1991 by the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front,</b> which has been the ruling political coalition since.|$|E
2500|$|Ethiopia: In the General Elections held on 15 May, the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF) won a {{majority}} of 327 out of the 547 total seats in the House of People's Representatives.

2500|$|By 1990, the Soviet Union had all {{but ended}} its support for Mengistu's regime. In a bid to buy more time, Mengistu renounced Communism in 1990 and began taking steps toward opening the economy. However, it only served to buy his regime little more than another year of life. In May 1991, the Ethiopian People's <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (EPRDF) forces {{advanced}} on Addis Ababa from all sides, and Mengistu fled the country with 50 family and Derg members. He was granted asylum in Zimbabwe as an official guest of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} the UNDP visited, they {{observed}} two major socio-political issues in the Zone. The first was a smoldering conflict between the Afar <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> Unity <b>Front</b> (ARDUF) and government forces. The ARDUF conducted sporadic attacks on government military forces and officials and competed {{for control of the}} salt trade. In response, the military closed markets at Berhale, Garamoyti, Gaharta, ‘Ala, Mergis and Dande, and schools in at least three woredas. The second was the continued influx of rural Afar, primarily nomads, from Eritrea. These new arrivals claimed to be fleeing the Eritrean government’s recent enforcement of its National Service programme and a parallel agenda of disarmament. Despite a lack of external assistance, these refugees were given assistance and shelter due to clan ties between them and the locals.|$|R
5|$|The hostage-takers {{were members}} of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA), Iranian Arabs protesting for the {{establishment}} of an autonomous Arab state in the southern region of the Iranian province of Khūzestān (also known as Arabistan) which is home to an Arabic-speaking minority. The oil-rich area had become the source of much of Iran's wealth, having been developed by multi-national companies during the reign of the Shah.|$|R
50|$|The Ahwaz Liberation Organisation (ALO), {{based in}} Maastricht in the Netherlands, was formed {{out of the}} {{remnants}} of three Iraqi-backed groups - the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA), People's Front for Liberation of Arabistan (PFLA) and the Arab Front for the Liberation of Al-Ahwaz (AFLA).
