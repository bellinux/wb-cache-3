500|$|The first MGM [...] "Lassie" [...] {{film was}} planned as a low budget, {{black and white}} children's film. Pal was among 1,500 dogs who auditioned for the title role, but was {{rejected}} because he was male, his eyes were too big, his head too flat, and a white blaze <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> forehead. A female prize-winning show collie was hired to play the title character. Weatherwax was hired to train the star, and Pal {{was hired as a}} stunt dog.|$|E
500|$|They {{passed a}} week that saw no action in Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds, hearing on 20 July that the Council in London had {{declared}} for Mary. Staying at Cambridge, Northumberland himself proclaimed Mary Tudor as queen at the market place. Warwick was {{with him as he}} threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> cheeks for grief." [...] The city that had welcomed the Duke splendidly was nervous to please the new queen. A large group of townsmen and university scholars surrounded King's College to arrest the Duke, who was with his son lodged on the premises. In contrast to his father, Warwick resisted arrest. A letter from the Council arrived that everyman could go his way, so the Duke asked to be set free, [...] "and so continued they all night [...] ". At dawn the Earl of Warwick [...] "was booted ready to have ridden in the morning", and escape. It was too late, however, as the Earl of Arundel arrived to again arrest the Duke and his entourage. The prisoners returned riding side by side through London, the guards having difficulties protecting them against the hostile populace.|$|E
500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> cheeks for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he caught sight of him.|$|E

2500|$|Berlin rose as a {{songwriter}} in Tin Pan Alley and on Broadway. In 1911, Emma Carus introduced his first world-famous hit, [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band,", {{followed by a}} performance from Berlin himself at the Friars' Frolic of 1911. He became an instant celebrity, and the featured performer later that year at Oscar Hammerstein's vaudeville house, where he introduced dozens of other songs. The New York Telegraph described how two hundred of his street friends came to see [...] "their boy" [...] on stage: [...] "All the little writer could do was to finger the buttons on his coat while tears <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> cheeks—in a vaudeville house!" ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{very poor}} {{data on the}} {{practice}} of Honor killing (also known as honor violence) {{due to the fact}} that many do not get reported or happen in remote areas or are classified as a different form of crime. This is the situation for the international data and American data, but for American data, no national or state agency collects data on honor violence. However, the practice of honor killings do occur with the family committing acts of honor killing believing that the daughter has become too Westernized and/or after she has refused to follow traditional customs such as arranged marriages. For example, in Phoenix, Arizona, the police arrested a man for murder after he <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> 20-year-old daughter for refusing to accept an arranged marriage to a man in the family's native country of Iraq. The prosecution of such crimes are carried out in the United States, but the crimes are not identified as honor killings under a form of law. It has been argued that the lack of using the label [...] "honor killings" [...] and instead using the all-encompassing label of [...] "domestic violence" [...] prevents the public from seeing the key differences between honor killings and domestic violence and also prevents any policies limiting and ultimately, putting an end, to the honor killings.|$|E

60|$|It by {{no means}} follows, that because the buyer is foolish, the seller must be so too; that because the buyer has a never-ceasing tongue, the seller must rattle as fast as she; that because she tells a hundred lies to <b>run</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> goods, he must tell another hundred to run them up; and that because she belies the goods one way, he must do the same the other way.|$|R
