5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> backs {{of their heads}} on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling {{the skin of the}} throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E

25|$|All but 53 of {{the more}} than 900 moai known to date were carved from tuff (a {{compressed}} volcanic ash) from Rano Raraku, where 394 moai in varying states of completion are still visible today.

They should be grown in well-drained soil with full sun. The climate can be cool.|$|E

30|$|<b>Rubbing</b> {{fastness}} of <b>the</b> dyed samples {{was determined}} using automatic Crockmeter. The method adopted is from ISO 105 X 12 evaluation procedure [22]. Both dry rubbing and wet <b>rubbing</b> of <b>the</b> dyed fabric were assessed. Suitable testing device {{for determining the}} colour fastness to rubbing consists of a reciprocating straight line rubbing motion and a <b>rubbing</b> finger. <b>The</b> <b>rubbing</b> finger shall exert a downward force of 9  ±  0.2  N moving to and fro 20 times, 10 times in each direction {{in a straight line}} along a path of 10  ±  3  cm track. A bleached white fabric is attached to <b>the</b> <b>rubbing</b> finger and is <b>rubbed</b> against <b>the</b> dyed sample. While assessing wet <b>rubbing</b> fastness, <b>the</b> fabric is moistened with water and then <b>rubbed.</b> <b>The</b> staining of <b>the</b> cotton <b>rubbing</b> cloths is assessed with the grey scale for staining.|$|R
25|$|The species lacks {{distinct}} sexual dimorphism, but mature male monitors on Guam {{have been}} reported to be three times the mass of mature females. Males fight for females, and in one observation, after mounting the female, the male used his chin to <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> dorsum of the female's head and forequarters. While mounted and oriented head to head, the male and female slowly rotated in a clockwise direction through 360°, with the male remaining superior.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to Gutenberg {{printing}}, {{which allowed}} printing {{on both sides}} of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed. Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art {{galleries}} at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began to <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.|$|E
25|$|A {{specially}} constructed pavilion is erected on {{a courtyard}} between the Phaisan Thaksin and Chakkraphat Phiman Halls. Once {{the king is}} seated inside the pavilion, some of the water {{will be given to}} him in a small golden bowl. The king will dip his hand into this water and <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> top of his head with it. A rope will then be pulled, which releases a shower of water from a canopy above. The king will be offered the water in small bowls by members of the Buddhist clergy, the royal family, government ministers, and other officials as an act of blessing.|$|E

25|$|Ink is {{made from}} {{lampblack}} (soot) and binders, and comes in inksticks which must be rubbed with water on an inkstone until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks {{are more prone to}} bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> ink {{is an essential part of}} calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy teachers use a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students' work.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} {{and have to be}} replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E

500|$|Many species also emit various foul-smelling liquid {{secretions}} through microscopic holes called ozopores (the openings of [...] "odoriferous" [...] or [...] "repugnatorial glands"), {{along the}} sides of their bodies as a secondary defence. Among the many irritant and toxic chemicals found in these secretions are alkaloids, benzoquinones, phenols, terpenoids, and hydrogen cyanide. Some of these substances are caustic and can burn the exoskeleton of ants and other insect predators, and the skin and eyes of larger predators. Primates such as capuchin monkeys and lemurs have been observed intentionally irritating millipedes in order to <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> chemicals on themselves to repel mosquitoes. Some of these defensive compounds also show antifungal activity.|$|E
500|$|... b [...] The Ros is a {{ceremony}} {{similar to the}} Tel ceremony performed by the Goan Hindus. The Tel is an auspicious ceremony during which the Hindu bride wears a yellow sari, while ladies from the family would <b>rub</b> <b>the</b> body with turmeric and oil. They would apply it {{with the help of}} two leaves of a mango tree over the forehead, neck, chest, shoulder arms and legs of the bride. A similar pattern was followed wherein the Christian bride was smeared with turmeric paste, coconut milk, rice flour with the leaves of ambolim to make the skin smooth, fair and prepare the bride for marriage. In 1736, this practice was banned by the Holy Inquisition in Goa.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

[...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is going to respond to that, we can only wait and see." [...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake and eat it too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E
