5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and <b>removed</b> <b>parts.</b> Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the cabal's formation, the other team members started {{detailed}} game development, and within another month, began playtesting through Sierra. The cabal were intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting, as to take the player's feedback, including any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzle, into action items to be fixed on the next iteration of a game. Later, {{with most of the}} main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to further fine-tune levels. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for Half-Lifes success, and was reused for Team Fortress 2 from the start.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that night}} at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the {{cemetery}} crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.|$|E

25|$|A {{commission}} {{was appointed to}} investigate the accident. Representatives from the Royal Norwegian Air Force and de Havilland inspected the wreckage on 11 November, concluding that the aircraft was a write-off. That day {{there was a large}} stream of people who came {{to have a look at}} the accident site. By then all personal properties had been <b>removed.</b> <b>Parts</b> from the plane were afterwards used to rebuild another two Herons: LN-NPI, after it was damaged on 26 January 1957, and LN-SUL. The commission published a preliminary investigation report on 20 November and the final report was published on 9 May 1957 and had the same conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Hessilhead in its later {{days was}} {{occupied}} by the family of Lord Glasgow, and after they left, the proprietor, a Mr. Macmichael, about the year 1776, took off the roof and allowed {{the place to go}} to ruin. Circa 1887 - 92 it is described as being enclosed as a garden. Dobie records the despoiler of Hessilhead as a Mr. Carmichael, who sold the materials from the castle and also <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> of the walls, as well as cutting down and selling an impressive old Yew tree. In the 1960s the remains of the castle were blown up on the instructions of Howie of Dunlop.|$|E
25|$|The River Mole flows nearby. As {{its name}} suggests, {{the river in}} places goes {{underground}} due to the chalk bed being dissolved, forming swallow holes (sinkholes). Ian Middleton tells of his father, sometime in the 1950s, the village police officer P.C. Middleton, looking past his bathroom mirror one morning whilst shaving to see a mature oak tree disappear into the ground. It {{turned out that the}} river flowing underground had been gradually wearing away the supporting ground under the tree, forming a giant such hole which had collapsed. The subsequent pit was not filled in until about 1968 approx when it was still 30ft deep and 30ft across. P.C. Middleton also reportedly <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> from an unexploded V2 rocket which fell in the village during World War II.|$|E

25|$|In {{an early}} {{preview of the}} game's demo Episode Duscae, GameSpot's Alexa Ray Corriae praised the {{interactions}} between Noctis and his companions, citing them as {{a good example of}} deep platonic love between men. In a review of Brotherhoods first episode, Meghan Sullivan from IGN also praised the interactions between the main characters, particularly finding comical how Noctis <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> from his hamburger and this being discussed by his friends as {{whether or not they were}} spoiling him. Similarly, Destructoid's Chris Carter became attached to Noctis and his friends ever since the Brotherhood series and expects more from the video game. A fragrance was created in the character's image. There has been an internet meme focused on Noctis and his friends in the Regalia looking at photoshopped images. Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto found it comical and motivated fans to produce more in order to increase people's interest in Final Fantasy XV.|$|E
25|$|The Dox Formation {{consists}} of a heterogeneous mixture of light-tan to greenish brown, siliceous quartz sandstone; calcareous lithic and arkosic sandstone; dark-brown-to-green shale and mudstone; red mudstone, siltstone, and quartz sandstone; sandy argillite; micaceous mudstone; and red quartzose, silty sandstone. In ascending order, these sediments have been subdivided into the Escalante Creek, Solomon Temple, Comanche Point, and Ochoa Point Members. Stromatolites have been reported from the Comanche Point Member. The Dox Formation locally interfingers with, and is baked by, basalt lava flows of the overlying Cardenas Basalt. Within the central Grand Canyon, pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion has <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> of the Unkar Group above {{the level of the}} middle part of the Dox Formation. The missing part of the Dox Formation and overlying Cardenas Basalt and Chuar Group {{can be found in a}} prominent syncline and fault block in the eastern Grand Canyon. The Dox Formation accumulated in a variety of marine, coastal, estuarine, and fluvial environments.|$|E
25|$|After another {{crossing}} {{under the}} railway, the river skirts {{the eastern edge}} of Bramford and circles a hill, on top of which is Sproughton Manor, a grade II listed house built for Col Henry Phillipps in 1863 by the architect William Eden Nesfield. Sproughton Lock and mill are {{at the bottom of the}} hill. The mill is built in red brick and dates from the late eighteenth century. The mill race passes below the mill, which was operational until 1947, but all the machinery has been <b>removed.</b> <b>Parts</b> of the adjacent mill house date from around 1600. After passing under the A14 road, the river briefly heads north-east, through Chantry Cut, where Chantry Lock is situated, to pass under the railway. There are two bridges, as the railway line forks on the south side of the river. A flood barrier has been installed below the first bridge. Now passing through Ipswich, the river also forks, with the eastern branch being the River Gipping, and the western branch forming the start of the River Orwell. A modern sluice is located on the Orwell just below the junction. A final weir marks the position of Handford Sea Lock, below which the two channels rejoin. An outfall is situated below the junction, beyond which the river is tidal.|$|E

500|$|The {{censorship}} drew strong {{criticism of}} Comedy Central. Critics {{said that the}} network's action would encourage further threats from radical groups.

In most places the episode [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] was shown instead of episode 201. In the United Kingdom, some parts were removed, and a short on-screen message appears, stating the outline of the <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> and [...] "MTV (on Viva)" [...] or [...] "Comedy Central" [...] "...has refused to air an image of Muhammad on their network". According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.5 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night.|$|E
500|$|For the American {{release in}} 1962, {{the film was}} cut. It was given an English-language dub, and re-titled The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus. Edits in the Dr. Faustus version <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> of the heterografting scene as well as scenes showing Doctor Génessier's more human side such his loving care for a small child at his clinic. The {{distributors}} recognized the artistic merit of the film and played up that element in promotion with an advertisement quoting the London Observers positive statements about the film and noting its showing at the Edinburgh Film Festival. This {{is in contrast to}} presentation of the secondary feature, The Manster (1962), which mainly focused on the carnie-show aspect with its [...] "two-headed monster" [...] and [...] "Invasion from outer space by two-headed creature killer". Eyes Without a Face had a very limited initial run and there was little reception from the American mainstream press.|$|E

500|$|The {{first draft}} was very {{different}} from what was eventually published because he <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> he felt were too sensational or dramatized. In the first draft, the story was told entirely {{from the point of view}} of Elmer, an intelligent chicken who is also an actor. Influenced by David Beauchard’s Epileptic and David Mazzucchelli’s City of Glass, Alanguilan altered the story's structure to focus on Elmer's son, Jake. Alanguilan also drew on an event from his teenage years, when he found his father's diary and read about the death of Gerry's uncle Dennis. The new format turned the story into one about Alanguilan, his parents, and his [...] "fears of losing them as they get older." [...] The original opening scene was a human attacking a chicken before being revealed as a film production. Alanguilan believed the scene was too much of a gimmick and moved it to the middle of the book.|$|E
2500|$|Pushkin {{intended}} {{to write a}} chapter called [...] "Onegin's Journey", which occurred between the events of chapters 7 and 8, and in fact {{was supposed to be}} the eighth chapter. Fragments of this incomplete chapter were published, in the same way that parts of each chapter had been published in magazines before each chapter was first published in its first separate edition. When Pushkin first completed chapter 8 he published it as the final chapter and included within its denouement the line nine cantos I have written still intending to complete this missing chapter.

2500|$|Ford {{imported}} all of {{its first}} generation Transit Connect models as passenger vehicles by including rear windows, rear seats, and rear seatbelts. The vehicles are exported from Turkey on cargo ships owned by Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics (WWL), arrive in Baltimore, and are converted back into light trucks at WWL's Vehicle Services Americas Inc. facility by replacing rear windows with metal panels and removing the rear seats and seatbelts. The <b>removed</b> <b>parts</b> are not shipped back to Turkey for reuse, but shredded and recycled in Ohio. The process exploits the loophole in the customs definition of a light truck: as cargo does not need seats with seat belts or rear windows, presence of those items automatically qualifies the vehicle as a passenger vehicle and exempts the vehicle from light truck status. The process costs Ford hundreds of dollars per van but saves thousands in taxes. Chrysler has announced it will introduce the Ram ProMaster City, an Americanised version of the Fiat Doblò, in 2015 [...] building the vehicle at the Tofaş plant in Turkey, importing only passenger configurations and subsequently converting cargo configurations.|$|E
