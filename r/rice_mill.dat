With considering this point that Iran is one of biggest of rice importers we need to self sufficiency of rice production. Using a suitable <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> system with low loss and reasonable costs is very important in this aim. Therefore, it is necessary to select the proper <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> system considering all the effective parameters in the efficiency of <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> systems. For this aim a proper technical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) was used to select the most proper <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> system. The optimization process was accomplished using multiple criteria decision making system compensatory (TOPSIS). Several aspects, the percentage of white rice breakage, the market appeal of final production, energy consumption, the capacity of systems and system’s costs were considered as <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> attributes. 3 kinds of traditional and modern <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> systems were defined as <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> candidate alternatives. The TOPSIS technique indicated that the percentage of white rice breakage by 0. 01 score is the most important decision making factor in selecting <b>rice</b> <b>milling</b> system and system’s costs with 0. 88 score is less important parameter.

In October 1943, arrests started and the camp opened, staffed primarily by German and Ukrainian members of the SS under the command of SS-Sturmbannführer Christian Wirth, former commander of Belzec extermination camp. Wirth was killed by Yugoslav Partisans in Opatija, on 26 May 1944. He was replaced by Wirth's former deputy in Lublin and successor in Belzec, SS-Hauptsturmführer Gottlieb Hering.
