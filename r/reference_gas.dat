40|$|Methods are {{described}} for measuring changes in atmospheric O 2 concentration {{with emphasis on}} gas handling procedures. Cryogenically dried air samples are collected in 5 L glass flasks at ambient pressure and analyzed against <b>reference</b> <b>gases</b> derived from high-pressure aluminum tanks. Fractionation effects are minimized by avoiding pressure and flow variations throughout the gas-handling system. The overall external reproducibility is approximately +/- 3. 3 per meg, with systematic errors associated with collecting samples and with storing them for 1 year reduced {{to the level of}} 3 per meg or smaller. The demonstrated short-term reproducibly of air delivered from high-presure tanks is +/- 1. 5 per meg, with the composition changing by at most 5 per meg by surface desorption reactions as the tank is depleted to below 3500 kPa. A 9 -year survey of a suite of six <b>reference</b> <b>gases</b> showed no systematic long-term trends in relative O 2 concentrations to the level of 5 per meg. Results are presented from samples collected at Cape Grim (41 degrees S), Macquarie Island (54 degrees S) and the South Pole Station (90 degrees S). From measurements spanning 1991 - 1995 it is found that the O 2 concentrations at the South Pole are on average 3. 6 +/- 1. 2 per meg higher than at Cape Grim. This result runs contrary to the expectation that the air at high southern latitudes should be depleted in O 2 as a result of O 2 uptake from the Southern Ocean and may require the existence of unknown O 2 sources near Antarctica or unexpected atmospheric transport patterns...|$|R

The denominator contains the corresponding quantities for the <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> (i.e. [...] ). The radiative efficiencies ax and ar are not necessarily constant over time. While the absorption of infrared radiation by many greenhouse gases varies linearly with their abundance, a few important ones display non-linear behaviour for current and likely future abundances (e.g., CO2, CH4, and N2O). For those gases, the relative radiative forcing will depend upon abundance and hence upon the future scenario adopted.|$|E

Observations of these variations may provide useful constraints on large-scale fluxes of heat across the air-sea interface. A mass spectrometer system is described that incorporates a magnet with a wide exit face, allowing a large mass spread, and incorporates an inlet with rapid (5 s) switching of sources gases through a single capillary, thus achieving high precision in the comparison of sample and <b>reference</b> <b>gases.</b> The system allows simultaneous measurement of Ar/N 2, O 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /N 2 ratios. The system achieves a short-term precision in Ar/N 2 of 10 per meg for a 10 -second integration, which can be averaged to achieve an internal precision of a few per meg in the comparison of <b>reference</b> <b>gases.</b> Results for Ar/N 2 are reported from flasks samples collected from 9 stations in a north-to-south global network over about a 1 year period. The imprecision on an individual flask, as estimated from replicate agreement, is ± 11 per meg. This imprecision is dominated by real variability between samples {{at the time of}} analysis. Seasonal cycles are marginally resolved at the extra-tropical stations with amplitudes of 5 to 15 per meg. Annual-mean values are constant between stations to within ± 5 per meg. The results are compared to a numerical simulation of the cycles and gradients in Ar/N 2 based on the TM 2 tracer transport model in combination with air-sea Ar and N 2 fluxes derived from climatological air-sea heat fluxes.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} Phase 1 of the ''Air Force Hydrazine Detector Characterization and Calibration Project''. A method for calibrating model MDA 7100 hydrazine detectors in the United States Air Force (AF) inventory has been developed. The calibration system consists of a Kintek 491 <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> generation system, a humidifier/mixer system which combines the dry reference hydrazine gas with humidified diluent or carrier gas to generate the required humidified reference for calibrations, and a gas sampling interface. The Kintek <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> generation system itself is periodically calibrated using an ORNL-constructed coulometric titration system to verify the hydrazine concentration of the sample atmosphere in the interface module. The Kintek <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> is then used to calibrate the hydrazine monitors. Thus, coulometric titration is only used to periodically assess {{the performance of the}} Kintek <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> generation system, and is not required for hydrazine monitor calibrations. One advantage of using coulometric titration for verifying the concentration of the <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> {{is that it is a}} primary standard (if used for simple solutions), thereby guaranteeing, in principle, that measurements will be traceable to SI units (i. e., to the mole). The effect of humidity of the <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> was characterized by using the results of concentrations determined by coulometric titration to develop a humidity correction graph for the Kintek 491 <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> generation system. Using this calibration method, calibration uncertainty has been reduced by 50 % compared to the current method used to calibrate hydrazine monitors in the Air Force inventory and calibration time has also been reduced by more than 20 %. Significant findings from studies documented in this report are the following: (1) The Kintek 491 <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> generation system (generator, humidifier and interface module) can be used to calibrate hydrazine detectors. (2) The Kintek system output concentration is less than the calculated output of the generator alone but can be calibrated as a system by using coulometric titration of gas samples collected with impingers. (3) The calibrated Kintek system output concentration is reproducible even after having been disassembled and moved and reassembled. (4) The uncertainty of the <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> concentration generated by the Kintek system is less than half the uncertainty of the Zellweger Analytics' (ZA) <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> concentration and can be easily lowered to one third or less of the ZA method by using lower-uncertainty flow rate or total flow measuring instruments. (5) The largest sources of uncertainty in the current ORNL calibration system are the permeation rate of the permeation tubes and the flow rate of the impinger sampling pump used to collect gas samples for calibrating the Kintek system. Upgrading the measurement equipment, as stated in (4), can reduce both of these. (6) The coulometric titration technique can be used to periodically assess the performance of the Kintek system and determine a suitable recalibration interval. (7) The Kintek system has been used to calibrate two MDA 7100 s and an Interscan 4187 in less than one workday. The system can be upgraded (e. g., by automating it) to provide more calibrations per day. (8) The humidity of both the <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> and the environment of the Chemcassette affect the MDA 7100 hydrazine detector's readings. However, ORNL believes that the environmental effect is less significant than the effect of the <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> humidity. (9) The ORNL calibration method based on the Kintek 491 M-B gas standard can correct for the effect of the humidity of the <b>reference</b> <b>gas</b> to produce the same calibration as that of ZA's. Zellweger Analytics calibrations are typically performed at 45 %- 55 % relative humidity. (10) Tests using the Interscan 4187 showed that the instrument was not accurate in its lower (0 - 100 ppb) range. Subsequent discussions with Kennedy Space Center (KSC) personnel also indicated that the Interscan units were not reproducible when new sensors were used. KSC had discovered that the Interscan units read incorrectly on the low range because of the presence of carbon dioxide. ORNL did not test the carbon dioxide effect, but it was found that the units did not read zero when a test gas containing no hydrazine was sampled. According to the KSC personnel that ORNL had these discussions with, NASA is phasing out the use of these Interscan detectors...|$|E
