2500|$|Supply-side {{economics}} {{is a school}} of macroeconomic thought that argues that overall economic well-being is maximized by lowering the barriers to producing goods and services (the [...] "Supply Side" [...] of the economy). By lowering such barriers, consumers are thought to benefit from a greater supply {{of goods and services}} at lower prices. Typical supply-side policy would advocate generally lower income tax and capital gains tax rates (to increase the supply of labor and capital), smaller government and a lower <b>regulatory</b> <b>burden</b> on enterprises (to lower costs). Although tax policy is often mentioned in relation to supply-side economics, supply-side economists are concerned with all impediments to the supply of goods and services and not just taxation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the general}} election, Symington was {{challenged}} by Democratic nominee Eddie Basha, {{who was known}} in {{the state as a}} grocery store magnate as CEO and Chairman of Bashas'. Prior to the general election, Basha had led Symington in opinion polls by 15 to 20 points. However, the midterm elections of 1994 were a landslide for Republicans, which likely benefited Symington as well, despite his vulnerability due to the controversies that had emerged during his first term in office. Symington defeated Basha, winning 52% of the vote to Basha's 44%. Basha had refused to resort to negative campaigning until {{the final days of the}} campaign when it was likely too late, which political analysts pointed to as the reason for his loss. In addition, Symington had highlighted Basha's statement during a debate hosted by the League of Women Voters that the public school system [...] "can be the surrogate family to help children and parents," [...] which led Symington to declare that Basha believed the [...] "state can take the place of the family." [...] After defeating Basha, Symington, in his election night victory speech, pledged to try to further reduce state income taxes during the course of his second term, as well as continue to eliminate <b>regulatory</b> <b>burden</b> on businesses, and also to [...] "get tough on crime." [...] Symington also declared his upset victory a [...] "miracle" [...] and a [...] "revolution," [...] saying the people [...] "want their country back and they want their taxes lowered. Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan started all this and God bless them." ...|$|E

Previous research indicates that a rigid regulatory environment hampers income performance.

Simulations are conducted to quantify potential impacts of deregulation and greater transparency on income performance. Results show that sizeable income gains can result from deregulation. ...|$|R

40|$|The Productivity Commission's {{report on}} ‘Annual Review of <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Burdens</b> on Business: Manufacturing and Distributive Trades’, {{identifies}} {{a number of}} ways the Australian Government can strip out unnecessary <b>regulatory</b> <b>burdens</b> on manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing businesses. A common concern of businesses consulted by the Commission was poor communication with regulators. Information from regulators was often found to be difficult to access, inconsistently communicated or costly to interpret. Small businesses, in particular, could be disadvantaged by such poor communications. The Commission identified a number of areas requiring action, including - increasing the national consistency in the implementation and enforcement of food regulation across all jurisdictions; - changing governance arrangements for food regulations to improve the timeliness and transparency of decision making; - reducing the time and cost, and improving the transparency, of assessment processes by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA); - removing the TGA's monopoly on assessment for Australian manufacturers of medical devices by allowing manufacturers to choose a certification body approved by the TGA. <b>regulatory</b> <b>burdens,</b> manufacturing, wholesaling, retail businesses, distributive trades, food regulation, Therapeutic Goods Administration...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} theory and {{evidence}} on the links between product market regulations that curb competitive pressures, the efficiency of resource allocation and productivity growth. We show that product market regulations differ across countries and industries and have evolved differently over time. We argue that differences in regulation have {{played an important role}} in driving resource allocation and productivity outcomes. Countries and industries where direct and indirect <b>regulatory</b> <b>burdens</b> are lighter have generally experienced the highest GDP per capita and productivity growth rates. Moreover, where <b>regulatory</b> <b>burdens</b> are lighter, the reallocation of resources towards the highest-productivity firms is stronger. The impacts of inappropriate regulations on aggregate and firm-level productivity performance are estimated to be quantitatively important and thus, reforming such regulations can provide a significant boost to potential growth in OECD economies...|$|R
