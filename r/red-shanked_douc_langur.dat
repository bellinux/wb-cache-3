The <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> selected various parts from 152 species of plants in 2 national parks, but there {{did not appear to be}} favorite species that were heavily selected over others. In both the wet and dry seasons, the black-shanked <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> ate mostly leaves, but the diversity of plants consumed increased and the proportion of fruit eaten almost doubled in the wet season.

50|$|The grey-shanked <b>douc</b> <b>langur</b> {{communicates}} using touch, visual communication, and sound. Growls {{are used}} to show aggression. They {{can be used as}} a threat or warning toward other individuals. A soft, twitter sound is used when being submissive.|$|R
50|$|All doucs {{are native}} to Southeast Asia, {{specifically}} the countries Cambodia, China, Laos and Vietnam. The <b>red-shanked</b> <b>douc</b> {{is thought to}} be found only in north and central Vietnam and Laos. Before 1967, the douc was completely unstudied.

50|$|This monkey {{communicates}} using facial expressions. It has {{a specific}} play {{face with the}} mouth open, teeth partially bared and chin thrust forward. Sometimes, it closes its eyes and paws blindly towards another douc with remarkable disregard for the hazards of doing this when up a tree. A fixed stare is a threat display. A grimace with the mouth open and the teeth exposed is a submissive gesture given {{in response to a}} stare. It is also used to initiate grooming or play. The <b>red-shanked</b> <b>douc</b> has a low-pitched growl that is given as a threat, and a short, harsh distress squeal.|$|R
50|$|When {{the group}} is untroubled, the <b>red-shanked</b> <b>douc</b> will move noisily from branch to branch through the forest, {{crashing}} through foliage, swinging under branches and leaping with two feet together, displaying its remarkable sense of balance. But when a group is disturbed, by either a predator or other dangers, it can flee soundlessly through the trees, away from danger. If it is startled, it may give loud barks and rush around the trees slapping branches with its hands and feet. In contrast to their noisy travel, doucs {{spend most of their}} time quietly eating, digesting their bulky food, dozing and grooming each other's fur.|$|R
50|$|The grey-shanked <b>douc</b> <b>langur</b> (Pygathrix cinerea) is a douc species {{native to}} the Vietnamese provinces of Quảng Nam, Quảng Ngãi, Bình Định, Kon Tum, and Gia Lai.

The primate gastrointestinal (GI) tract {{is home to}} trillions of bacteria that play major roles in digestion and metabolism, immune system development, and pathogen resistance, among other important aspects of host health and behavior. In 2009, the Human Microbiome Project was established {{with the goal of}} better understanding the role microbial communities play in health and disease. While the research community has made substantial progress in understanding the role microbial communities play in human health and disease, much less attention has been given to host-associated microbiomes in nonhuman primates (NHPs). My research is focused on developing {{a better understanding of the}} link between primate microbial communities and the establishment and maintenance of health. I have begun exploring host-associated microbiomes in NHPs, including <b>red-shanked</b> <b>doucs</b> (Pygathrix nemaeus) and mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata), among other species. Some primate species, such as the <b>red-shanked</b> <b>douc,</b> fail to thrive in captivity due to health issues (e. g., gastrointestinal disease). Maintenance of many primate species in captive settings is hindered by critical gaps in our understanding of their natural diet and the enteric microbial adaptations that facilitate the digestive process. By comparing wild and captive animals within the same species, I hope to determine whether shifts in gut microbiota are linked with health in captivity. Microbes can act as indicators for health of the host, thus broad primate microbiome surveys may allow for the development of predictive biomarkers to improve nonhuman primate health and management...|$|R

50|$|The <b>red-shanked</b> <b>douc</b> is diurnal {{and eats}} and sleeps {{in the trees}} of the forest. Its diet {{consists}} mostly of leaves high in fibers. Belonging to the subfamily Colobinae, or leaf-eating monkeys, it has a large stomach which is divided into sacs containing bacteria that break down the cellulose in the leaves through fermentation, giving the douc its pot-bellied look. This also makes it burp frequently from the resulting gas. It prefers to eat small, young and tender leaves, but will also eat fruit like figs, buds, petioles, flowers, bamboo shoots and seeds. It gets all the liquid and protein it needs from the food it eats and doesn't need to descend to the ground to drink. This monkey eats 50 different plant species but no animal prey. It is a messy and chaotic feeder, dropping much of its food onto the forest floor: old leaves, under-ripe or over-ripe fruits. It eats peacefully together, not quarreling over food, and {{has been known to}} share it with others. Often, it will share the same clump of foliage and may even break pieces off and hand them to each other, a type of active generosity that is rare among Old World monkeys. It does not have cheek pouches. This diet provides them with adequate protein and fluids.|$|R
50|$|Uhlenbroek {{introduces}} the second episode from amongst gelada baboons in the Simien Mountains of Ethiopia, demonstrating how monkeys are athletic, adaptable and social animals. The smallest monkeys are the marmosets and tamarins of South America and are unusual amongst primate because the fathers {{do most of}} the parenting. The pygmy marmoset and tassle-eared marmoset are shown. Other New World species are shown: spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys and black howler monkeys. Uhlenbroek calls to the howlers and ascends into the canopy to view them at close quarters. Monkeys originated in the Old World, and it is here that the greatest diversity of species are found. The black-and-white colobus of East Africa are leaf-eaters. Leaves contain many toxins, but the red colobus of Zanzibar have found an antidote in the form of charcoal. Diana monkeys belong to the guenons, a shy group of monkeys from the West African jungles. The patchwork jungle has led to many different species of guenon evolving. In South East Asia, the proboscis monkey eats tough mangrove leaves which it digests by fermentation. The langurs are another leaf-eating group: silvered monkeys from Malaysia, <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> from Vietnam and the rare golden monkeys of central China are all shown. Back in Africa, Uhlenbroek explains that it is the monkeys that have come out of the forest to live on the ground that are the most intelligent and have the most sophisticated societies as shown by the patas monkey and olive baboon.|$|R
