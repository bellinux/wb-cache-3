30|$|Although {{performance}} is often considered an isolated quality attribute, <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> can be different. This difference {{is reflected in}} our table, and {{it is interesting to}} analyse the performance quality attribute as a whole with the data presented in the table. Most NoSQL databases polarize on performance characteristics, either having high ratings on <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> (Cassandra, Couchbase, HBase and MongoDB), but there are some exceptions. Aerospike provides a balance between <b>write</b> and <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> without reaching the “Great” rating in either of these quality attributes. On the other hand, Voldemort provides high <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> (“Great”) and good read performance (“Good”), while Couchbase offers good <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> (“Good”), but high read performance (“Great”). This implies that software engineers can look to Voldemort, Couchbase and Aerospike as “balanced” systems in terms of performance, with Voldemort and Couchbase tending slightly towards more specific <b>write</b> or <b>read</b> scenarios, respectively.|$|R

They concluded that both databases scale linearly with different <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>performances.</b> They {{also provided a}} more in-depth analysis at Cassandra’s scalability, noticing how performing horizontal scalability with this platform leads to less performance hassles than performing vertical scalability.|$|R

30|$|For {{measuring}} the random <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>performance,</b> the benchmark tool iozone v 3.430 was used. The {{results show that}} all tested SD cards provide even for record size 4  kB a random read performance of 3 - 5  MB/s (see Table  5). Increasing the record size increases the data rate until the performance of sequential read is reached.|$|R
30|$|Measuring the {{sequential}} <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> is a procedure, {{which is}} quite common for benchmark purposes, but its significance for practical applications is limited because <b>reading</b> and <b>writing</b> large amounts of data in row is carried out quite seldom on many systems. Use cases are e.g. streaming media and the up- and download of objects, which are at least several MB in size. More common in root file systems and during operation of e.g. HTTP servers and database systems are random <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> operations.|$|R

Data analysis revealed that self-efficacy and outcome expectancy beliefs are significant predictors of <b>reading</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>performance.</b> If persons experience <b>reading</b> and <b>writing</b> as important behaviors related to desired life goals both for themselves and for others, they {{will be more likely to}} engage in <b>reading</b> or <b>writing</b> activities and to persist in <b>reading</b> or <b>writing</b> tasks.

50|$|NAND flash {{is used as}} the {{non-volatile}} memory inside SSDs. It has faster random <b>read</b> than random <b>write</b> <b>performance,</b> since its <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> is delayed {{by the need to}} perform garbage collection to free space for writing. However, since NAND flash has no moving parts, the SSD achieves much higher IOPS than a HDD.|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} benefit is {{the support for}} multiple databases, {{commonly referred to as}} database interoperability or cross-database and polyglot persistence [13, 15]. Cross-database persistence facilitates the use of multiple NoSQL technologies, each potentially optimised for specific requirements such as fast <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> <b>performance.</b> For example, static data such as logs can be stored in a database that provides very fast <b>write</b> <b>performance,</b> while cached data can be stored in an in-memory key-value database. Implementing such scenarios without an object-database mapper comes at the cost of increased application complexity.|$|R

40|$|Processes of naturalistic <b>reading</b> and <b>writing</b> {{are based}} on complex {{linguistic}} input, stretch-out over time, and rely on an integrated performance of multiple perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes.

However, instead of being just complications {{for the analysis of}} such data, they are also informative about cognitive change, fluency, and <b>reading</b> or <b>writing</b> skill.

In this article I introduce Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) as a tool to capture such dynamic structure. After a conceptual introduction of the analysis, I present a step-by-step tutorial on how to run RQA using R. Guidance is given with regard to common issues and best practices using this time-series analysis technique.

30|$|Another {{point of}} {{interest}} that becomes clear with the summary table is that while some quality attributes {{do not have a}} “Great” rating, there are others for which no “Bad” rating is given: availability, consistency, maintainability, reliability, scalability, <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>performance.</b> Some of these quality attributes, such as consistency and scalability, are actually found to have generally high ratings. This implies that these quality attributes are among the key attributes offered by NoSQL databases.

50|$|Another factor {{performance}} factor {{should be}} considered is the location of metadata. A file consists of actual data and metadata. Actual data is the content of a file, while metadata includes file attributes, permissions and so on. When a file is created, modified, or deleted, metadata information shall be modified, which means a file is processed by reading both file data and metadata. Usually, large file is <b>read</b> and <b>written</b> continuously, while metadata shall be read by moving magnetic-disc head to other location. For the disk, its <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> mode {{is much higher than}} randomness degree. If the data and metadata are memorized in the same disk (mode of the most file systems), the randomness degree of large file will be enhanced accordingly to reduce <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> <b>performance.</b> For this reason, BWFS file system memorizes metadata in different disk or volume in layout, so that the continuous file <b>reading</b> and <b>writing</b> is separated with the randomness of metadata. They are not mutually influenced, so as to provide higher IO bandwidth as much as possible.|$|R

40|$|High-density NAND {{flash storage}} has become {{relatively}} inexpensive {{due to the}} popularity of various consumer electronics. Recently, several manufacturers have released IDE-compatible NAND flash-based drives in sizes up to 64 GB at reasonable (sub-$ 1000) prices.
