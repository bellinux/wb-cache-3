25|$|Marconi {{began to}} build high-powered {{stations}} {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, a commercial service was established to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907 between Clifden, Ireland and Glace Bay, but even after this the company struggled for many years to provide <b>reliable</b> <b>communication</b> to others.|$|E
25|$|In telecommunication, a Hamming code is {{a linear}} error-correcting code. Hamming codes can detect {{up to two}} {{simultaneous}} bit errors, and correct single-bit errors; thus, <b>reliable</b> <b>communication</b> is possible when the Hamming distance between the transmitted and received bit patterns is {{less than or equal}} to one. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can only detect an odd number of errors. Hamming codes are of fundamental importance in coding theory and remain of practical use in modern computer design. Hamming codes were invented in 1950 by Richard Hamming at Bell Labs.|$|E

The term [...] "auxiliary" [...] in Bahá'í scripture means that the international language will be taught in addition to first languages and that it will be secondary to those.

2500|$|Information {{theory is}} based on {{probability}} theory and statistics. [...] Information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables. Important quantities of information are entropy, a measure of information in a single random variable, and mutual information, a measure of information in common between two random variables. [...] The former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on {{the rate at which}} data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably compressed. The latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables, and is the maximum rate of <b>reliable</b> <b>communication</b> across a noisy channel in the limit of long block lengths, when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution.|$|E

40|$|CD-Rom included; A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the MSc in Computer ScienceIn this thesis, we propose an approach to enable distributed transaction handling cap ability within a lightweight container without necessitating its deployment in a fully-fledged J 2 EE application server (or in a servlet container). This distributed transaction handling capability is facilitated by leveraging a <b>reliable</b> group <b>communication</b> framework. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach a prototype implementation, Mahatittha was developed using the Spring Framework as the lightweight container and JavaGroups [9] as the underlying <b>reliable</b> group <b>communication</b> framework. The Mahatittha execution model is asynchronous and hence exploits parallelism to a great extent. The virtual synchrony and reliable multicast provided by the underlying <b>reliable</b> group <b>communication</b> framework, are used to simplify the standard algorithms used in distributed transaction management within the Mahatittha implementation...|$|R
