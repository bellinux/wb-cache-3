5|$|Although issue #7 sold out, Image Comics PR & Marketing Director Jennifer deGuzman {{announced}} in a December 12, 2012 letter to <b>retailers</b> {{that it would}} not reprint select comics, such as that issue. DeGuzman explained the move as a result of decreasing orders on well-performing titles like Saga, despite critical acclaim and consistently selling out at a distributor level, and pointed to orders on Saga #8, which decreased 4% from orders on issue #7. Rather than invest in second printings, deGuzman explained, Image would instead focus its attention on ensuring that the first printing garners the sales desired. This move displeased some <b>retailers,</b> which prompted Image Publisher Eric Stephenson to announce the following day that Image would indeed publish a second printing of issue #7 at a considerable discount, but cautioned that the publisher {{would not be able to}} reprint every issue of the series indefinitely, and implored <b>retailers</b> not to under-order the series.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} trust {{issue in a}} two-echelon supply chain {{information}} sharing process. In a supply chain, the <b>retailer</b> reports the forecasted demand to the supplier. Traditionally, the supplier’s trust in the <b>retailer’s</b> reported information {{is based on the}} <b>retailer’s</b> reputation. However, this paper considers that trust is random and is also affected by the reputation and the demand gap. The supplier and <b>retailer</b> have been shown to have different evaluations regarding the degree of trust. Furthermore, distrust is inherently linked to perceived risk. To mitigate perceived risk, a two-stage decision process with an unpayback deposit contract is proposed. At the first stage, the supplier and the <b>retailer</b> negotiate the deposit contract. At the second stage, a Stackelberg game is used to determine the <b>retailer’s</b> reported demand and the supplier’s production quantity. We show that the deposits from the <b>retailer’s</b> and supplier’s perspectives are different. When the <b>retailer’s</b> reported demand is equal to the supplier’s forecasted demand, the <b>retailer’s</b> evaluation of the deposit is more than that of supplier’s. When the <b>retailer’s</b> reported demand is equal to the <b>retailer’s</b> forecasted demand, the deposit from the <b>retailer’s</b> perspective is at the lowest level...|$|R

Interestingly, competitive <b>retailer</b> prices account for less than 10 % of the over-time variation in retail prices. Instead, pricing history, wholesale price, and brand demand are the main drivers of retail-price variation over time. Moreover, the influence of these price drivers on <b>retailer</b> pricing tactics is linked to <b>retailer</b> category margin. We find that demand-based pricing and category-management considerations are associated with higher <b>retailer</b> margins.
