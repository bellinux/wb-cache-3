This Bureau of Mines report examines the coal mine roof damage potential of stimulation treatments. Twenty-two Government-sponsored stimulation treatments have been mined through to determine the effects on the coalbed and roof strata. Vertical fractures in the coalbed were discernible for most treatments and horizontal fractures were present for about half of the stimulations. Sand-propped vertical fractures were usually short in lateral extent. Evidence of stimulation fluid movement could generally be traced beyond the maximum extent of sand-filled fractures when fluorescent paint was added to the treatment fluids. The maximum lateral extent for a sand-filled vertical fracture was 416 ft and a paint-coated vertical fracture extended 630 ft. Horizontal fractures were generally found within bedding planes, most commonly on top of the coalbed. The maximum lateral extent for a horizontal fracture was 265 ft at a coalbed depth of 630 ft. Horizontal fractures have been found to occur as deep as 1, 145 ft. Penetration of strata overlying coalbeds was observed in nearly half of the treatments intercepted.

40|$|Observations of {{globular}} clusters {{show that they}} contain much too little gas or dust, compared to what should be present due to the mass-losing stars in the cluster. Many authors have been intrigued by {{the fate of the}} gas in {{globular clusters}}. They have suggested various mechanisms by which the gas could escape from the cluster, such as stellar UV radiation, cluster winds driven by X-ray bursters, novae, or flare-stars, relativistic winds from millisecond pulsars, condensation into stars, accretion processes drawing upon a central gas reservoir, continuous sweeping of the cluster gas by the gaseous medium of the Galactic halo dots. Recent results also show that globular cluster stars show many abundance anomalies. Accretion of interstellar gas by the cluster stars has been suggested as a plausible mechanism to explain these anomalies. It is also a major ingredient of the EASE scenario linking halo field stars to globular clusters, which we have recently developed to explain strong r-and s-elements correlations in halo field dwarf stars. Here we will briefly review the status of gas and dust detection in globular clusters, as well as the possible gas removal mechanisms. We will explore in more details the gas and dust accretion processes onto main sequence stars. In particular, we will study the efficiency of this mechanism in <b>removing</b> <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the globular clusters interstellar medium...|$|E
40|$|Star {{formation}} {{cannot proceed}} without {{the existence of}} an extensive gas reservoir. In particular, the supply of gas to form stars in dwarf galaxies and star clusters requires overcoming a variety of difficulties - namely, the effectiveness of different feedback mechanisms in <b>removing</b> <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> these shallow gravitational potentials. In addition, the supply of external gas to these systems is determined by the large scale galactic structure in which they reside. This thesis employs computational hydrodynamics coupled with physically realistic subgrid feedback prescriptions to resolve the interplay between the small scale feedback mechanisms and larger scale gas flows to determine the amount of gas a shallow potential can accumulate. First, we consider the flow of gas external to dwarf galaxies and star clusters into their cores as a generalized accretion process. Second, we explore the enhancement of gas accretion rates onto the compact members of young star clusters when the flow of external gas into the cluster cores is large. Third, we discuss how external gas flows initiated by the presence of a massive nuclear star cluster can enhance central massive black hole accretion rates during galaxy mergers. Fourth, we change our focus to exploring internal stellar wind retention in proto-globular clusters as a mechanism to supply gas for multiple episodes of star formation. Finally, the implications of stellar wind retention on the current gas reservoir in globular clusters is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first mid-IR study of galaxy {{groups in the}} nearby Universe based on Spitzer MIPS {{observations}} of a sample of nine redshift-selected groups from the XMM-IMACS (XI) project, at z= 0. 06. We find that on average the star-forming (SF) galaxy fraction in the groups is about 30 % lower than the value {{in the field and}} 30 % higher than in clusters. The SF fractions do not show any systematic dependence on group velocity dispersion, total stellar mass, or the presence of an X-ray emitting intragroup medium, but a weak anti-correlation is seen between SF fraction and projected galaxy density. However, even in the densest regions, the SF fraction in groups is still higher than that in cluster outskirts, suggesting that preprocessing of galaxies in group environments is not sufficient to explain the much lower SF fraction in clusters. The typical specific star formation rates (SFR/M*) of SF galaxies in groups are similar to those in the field across a wide range of stellar mass (M*> 10 ^ 9. 6 msun), favoring a quickly acting mechanism that suppresses star formation to explain the overall smaller fraction of SF galaxies in groups. If galaxy-galaxy interactions are responsible, then the extremely low starburst galaxy fraction ( 10 ^ 10 Msun), possibly as a consequence of ram pressure stripping being less efficient in <b>removing</b> <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> more massive galaxies.

40|$|Most stars [...] {{and hence}} most solar systems [...] form within groups or clusters. This {{contribution}} discusses how these star forming environments affect the planetary systems forming within them. The discussion {{starts with the}} dynamical evolution of young stellar clusters with N= 100 - 1000 members. We use N-body simulations to explore how evolution depends on system size N and the initial conditions. Motivated by recent observations, this study compares subvirial and virial starting states. Multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100 simulations per case) are used {{to build up a}} robust statistical description of these systems, e. g. distributions of closest approaches and distributions of radial locations. These results provide a framework from which to assess the effects of clusters on planet formation. The distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with far ultraviolet (FUV) luminosity distributions to determine the radiation exposure of circumstellar disks. Photoevaporation calculations then determine the efficacy of radiation in <b>removing</b> <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the systems (resulting in loss of planet forming potential). The distributions of closest approaches are used in conjunction with scattering cross-sections (calculated from 100 000 numerical experiments) to determine the probability of solar system disruption. Our main result is that clusters in this size range can {{have a significant effect on}} forming planetary systems, and we have quantified the size of these effects. For example, in modest-sized clusters, FUV radiation typically leads to disk photoevaporation down to outer disk radii of 30 - 50 AU. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} of galaxies in a cluster at z= 0. 35 show that their integrated gas-phase metallicities increase with decreasing cluster-centric distance. To test if ram pressure stripping (RPS) is the underlying cause, {{we use a}} semi-analytic model to quantify the "observational bias" that RPS introduces into the aperture-based metallicity measurements. We take integral field spectroscopy of local galaxies, remove gas from their outer galactic disks via RPS, and then conduct mock slit {{observations of}} cluster galaxies at z= 0. 35. Our RPS model predicts a typical cluster-scale metallicity gradient of - 0. 03 dex/Mpc. By <b>removing</b> <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the outer galactic disks, RPS introduces a mean metallicity enhancement of + 0. 02 dex at a fixed stellar mass. This gas removal and subsequent quenching of star formation preferentially removes low mass cluster galaxies from the observed star-forming population. As only the more massive star-forming galaxies survive to reach the cluster core, RPS produces a cluster-scale stellar mass gradient of - 0. 05 log(M_*/M_sun) /Mpc. This mass segregation drives the predicted cluster-scale metallicity gradient of - 0. 03 dex/Mpc. However, the effects of RPS alone can not explain the higher metallicities measured in cluster galaxies at z= 0. 35. We hypothesize that additional mechanisms including steep internal metallicity gradients and self-enrichment due to gas strangulation are needed to reproduce our observations at z= 0. 35.

We measure the torques exerted on accreting SMBH binaries, using 2 D, isothermal, moving-mesh, viscous hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary accretion discs. Our computational domain includes the entire inner region of the circumbinary disk with the individual black holes (BHs) included as point masses on the grid and a sink prescription to model accretion onto each BH. The BHs each acquire their own well-resolved accretion discs ("minidiscs"). We explore a range of mass removal rates for the sink prescription <b>removing</b> <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the central regions of the minidiscs. We find that the torque exerted on the binary is primarily gravitational, and dominated by the gas orbiting close behind and ahead of the individual BHs. The torques from the distorted circumbinary disc farther out and from the direct accretion of angular momentum are subdominant. The torques {{are sensitive to the}} sink prescription: slower sinks result in more gas accumulating near the BHs and more negative torques, driving the binary to merger more rapidly. For faster sinks, the torques are less negative and eventually turn positive (for unphysically fast sinks). When the minidiscs are modeled as standard alpha discs, our results are insensitive to the choice of sink radius. Scaling the simulations to a binary orbital period tbin = 1 yr and background disc accretion rate Mdot = 0. 3 MEdd in Eddington units, the binary inspirals on a timescale of 3 X 10 ^ 6 years, irrespective of the SMBH masses.
