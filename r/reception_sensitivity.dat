40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of transmission field B(1) (+) and <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps is important in high-field (>= 3 T) human magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for several reasons: these include post-acquisition correction of intensity inhomogeneities, which may {{affect the quality of}} images; modeling and design of radiofrequency (RF) coils and pulses; validating theoretical models for electromagnetic field calculations; testing the compatibility with MR environment of biomedical implants. Moreover, inhomogeneities in the RF field are an essential source of error for quantitative MR spectroscopy. Recent studies have also shown that B(1) (+) and <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps can be used for direct calculation of tissue electrical parameters and for estimating the local specific absorption rate (SAR) in vivo. Several B(1) (+) mapping techniques have been introduced {{in the past few years}} based on actual flip angle (FA) mapping, but, to date, none has emerged as a standard. For <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity</b> calculation, the signal intensity equation can be used where the nominal FA distribution must be replaced with the actual FA distribution calculated by one of the B(1) (+) mapping techniques. This study introduces a quantitative comparison between two known methods for B(1) (+) /actual FA and <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity</b> mapping: the double-angle method (DAM) and the fitting (FIT) method. Experimental data obtained using DAM and FIT methods are also compared with numerical simulation results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|To {{ensure the}} safe {{operation}} of many safety critical {{structures such as}} nuclear plants, aircraft and oil pipelines, non-destructive imaging is employed using piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers. These sensors typically operate at a single frequency due to the restrictions imposed on its resonant behaviour {{by the use of}} a single length scale in its design. To allow these transducers to transmit and receive more complex signals it would seem logical to use a range of length scales in the design so that a wide range of resonating frequencies will result. In this article we derive a mathematical model to predict the dynamics of an ultrasound transducer that achieves this range of length scales by adopting a fractal architecture. In fact, the device is modelled as a graph where the nodes represent segments of the piezoelectric and polymer materials. The electrical and mechanical fields that are contained within this graph are then expressed in terms of a finite element basis.

40|$|This article {{considers}} a theoretical model of an electrostatic transducer with resonating conduits {{connected to the}} cavities in the backplate. A 1 D (in space) model is proposed so that the inverse problem of optimizing the design parameters of the device for a desired output is not computationally prohibitive. The mathematical model is described based on matching the acoustic impedances at each interface of the device. The resulting ordinary differential equation is solved to give the frequency domain response {{of the system and}} the pressure output at the membrane. Derivation of the electrical impedance, transmission voltage response and reception force response is also provided. The model is implemented to compare a standard device (no conduits coming from the cavity) with a device with one conduit coming from the cavity. The model output is collated with experimental data and then used to analyse the maximum pressure output for various cavity and conduit dimensions. The results show a significant dependence of the device performance on the cavity and conduit dimensions.

Here, the MR signal is modeled as a sum of contributions of all the tissues present in the object. For sake of generality, each pixel is assumed to contain an unknown proportion of each tissue, so that the usually adopted segmentation based approach is not valid in the present context. The number of tissues composing the object as well as the MR characteristics of each tissue are required. Several images with different acquisition parameter values are also needed.

Currently, manufactured transducers operate effectively over narrow bandwidths {{as a result of their}} regular structures which incorporate a single length scale.

To accompany the growing body of research based on fractal-inspired transducers, this paper offers the first sensor design based on a three-dimensional fractal.

This calls for new approaches to RF coil design for ultra-high field MR systems. A remotely placed capacitively tunable patch antenna, which can easily be adjusted to different loading conditions, was used to generate a relatively homogeneous excitation field covering a large imaging volume with a transversal profile similar to that of a birdcage coil.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of composite piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers is typically regular and periodic with one dominant length scale. In many applications there is motivation to design transducers that operate {{over a wide}} bandwidth so that, for example, signals containing a broad frequency content can be received. The device's length scale will dictate the central operating frequency of the device and so, in order to construct a wide bandwidth device, it would seem natural to design a device that contains a range of length scales.

40|$|Capacitive micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducers (CMUTs) featuring piston-shaped membranes (piston CMUTs) {{were developed}} to improve device performance in terms of transmission efficiency, <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and fractional bandwidth (FBW). A piston CMUT has a relatively flat active moving surface whose membrane motion is closer to ideal piston-type motion compared with a CMUT with uniformly thick membranes (classical CMUT). Piston CMUTs with a more uniform surface displacement profile can achieve high output pressure with a relatively small electrode separation. The improved device capacitance and gap uniformity also enhance detection sensitivity. By adding a center mass to the membrane, a large ratio of second-order resonant frequency to first-order resonant frequency was achieved. This improved the FBW. Piston CMUTs featuring membranes of different geometric shapes were designed and fabricated using wafer bonding. Fabricating piston CMUTs is a more complex process than fabricating CMUTs with uniformly thick membranes. However, no yield loss was observed. These devices achieved ~ 100 % improvement in transduction performance (transmission and reception) over classical CMUTs. For CMUTs with square and rectangular membranes, the FBW increased from ~ 110 % to ~ 150 % and from ~ 140 % to ~ 175 %, respectively, compared with classical CMUTs. The new devices produced a maximum output pressure exceeding 1 MPa at the transducer surface.

The materials used are often lossy, and indeed loss can be used to enhance the operational characteristics of these designs. Motivated by these needs, this paper extends the one-dimensional linear systems model to incorporate frequency dependent elastic loss. The <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> electrical impedance and electromechanical coupling coefficient of a 1 - 3 composite transducer, with frequency dependent loss in the polymer filler, are investigated. By plotting these operating characteristics as a function of the volume fraction of piezoelectric ceramic an optimum design is obtained. A device with a non-standard, high shear attenuation polymer is also simulated and this leads to an increase in the electromechanical coupling coefficient. A comparison with finite element simulations is then performed. This shows that the two methods are in reasonable agreement in their electrical impedance profiles in all the cases considered. The plots are almost identical away from the main resonant peak where the frequency location of the peaks are comparable but there is in some cases a 20 % discrepancy in the magnitude of the peak value and in its bandwidth.

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) {{can provide}} in vivo {{metabolite}} concentrations in standard concentration units if a reliable reference signal is available. For 1 H MRS {{in the human}} brain, typically the signal from the tissue water is used as the (internal) reference signal. However, a concentration determination based on the tissue water signal most often requires a reliable estimate of the water concentration present in the investigated tissue. Especially in clinically interesting cases, this estimation might be difficult. To avoid assumptions about {{the water in the}} investigated tissue, the Electric REference To access In vivo Concentrations (ERETIC) method has been proposed. In this approach, the metabolite signal is compared with a reference signal acquired in a phantom and potential coil-loading differences are corrected using a synthetic reference signal. The aim of this study, conducted with a transceiver quadrature head coil, was to increase the accuracy of the ERETIC method by correcting the influence of spatial B 1 inhomogeneities and to simplify the quantification with ERETIC by incorporating an automatic phase correction for the ERETIC signal. Transmit field (B 1 +) differences are minimized with a volume-selective power optimization, whereas <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity</b> changes are corrected using contrast-minimized images of the brain and by adapting the voxel location in the phantom measurement closely to the position measured in vivo. By applying the proposed B 1 correction scheme, the mean metabolite concentrations determined with ERETIC in 21 healthy subjects at three different positions agree with concentrations derived with the tissue water signal as reference. In addition, brain water concentrations determined with ERETIC were in agreement with estimations derived using tissue segmentation and literature values for relative water densities. Based on the results, the ERETIC method presented here is a valid tool to derive in vivo metabolite concentration, with potential advantages compared with internal water referencing in diseased tissue...|$|E

The rules imposed the cellular carriers to integrate a technology into their networks so that the mobile device location can be transferred once a 9 - 1 - 1 call is made. One of the chosen technologies was the Global Positioning System (GPS). The solution suggests integrating a GPS receiver into every cellular device. But the GPS receiver, as a stand alone solution, has some major performance limitations in regards to the Wireless Enhanced 911 requirements.

Morphine (21. 0 mumol/kg) or M 6 G (21. 7 mumol/kg) were administered s. c. to young adult and aged male Hooded-Wistar rats. Antinociceptive effect was measured by the tail-flick method at various times up to 2. 5 h or 6. 5 h after morphine or M 6 G administration, respectively, and concentrations of morphine, morphine- 3 beta-glucuronide (M 3 G) and M 6 G in plasma and brain were determined by HPLC. Creatinine clearance was significantly lower by 33 % or 21 % in aged compared to young adult rats receiving morphine or M 6 G, respectively. After morphine administration, the areas under the (i) antinociceptive effect-time curve, (ii) plasma morphine concentration-time curve, and (iii) brain morphine concentration-time curve were not different between young adult and aged rats. However, the AUC for plasma M 3 G was five-fold higher in the aged relative to young adult rats, which could not be accounted for by only a 33 % lower creatinine clearance. M 6 G was not detected in any plasma or brain sample from rats administered morphine and no M 3 G was detected in brain. For M 6 G administration, the areas under the (i) antinociceptive effect-time curve, and (ii) plasma M 6 G concentration-time curve were 1. 8 - and 1. 6 -fold higher in aged compared to young adult rats, respectively. Concentrations of M 6 G in brain were below the limit of quantification. No morphine or M 3 G was detected in any of the plasma or brain samples of rats administered M 6 G. The results demonstrate no change in morphine antinociception and pharmacokinetics with age, and suggest that blood-brain barrier permeability and <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to morphine are not altered in aged rats. Accumulation of M 3 G in plasma of aged rats is probably due to diminished renal clearance of M 3 G in addition to a reduction in the biliary excretion of M 3 G.

These devices are capable of estimating location with the accuracy of a few meters error margin in the open fields. However, indoor area accuracy is not reliable enough when you need location estimation of the personal or industrial devices. Indoor location estimation {{has been one of}} the significant subjects of the researches with the contribution of the rise in the use of personal devices and autonomous self-driving industrial vehicles. Taking into consideration the superiority of the developed systems from each other, it is possible to generate the best need-based results via various technologies. Thus several technologies have been observed and the most convenient case-oriented result is submitted. Several solutions are provided by GPS, RFID/NFC, WiFi and Bluetooth LE. It may offer different solutions for varied needs. Thus, these 4 technologies have been evaluated according to coverage, cost, sensitivity, accessibility and security criteria. After analyzing, Bluetooth Low Energy infrastructure and location estimation technique via RSSI were found suitable for use, and an algorithm have been developed considering standard deviation of the RSSI value. By these preferences, 2 types of mobile hardware and 1 type of fixed hardware have been developed. 1 directional and 1 omni-directional need-oriented antenna have been designed. PIFA topology for omni-directional antenna, and LOOP technology for directional antenna were preferred. In this study, Cambrigde Silicon Radio CSR 1010 is used for all BLE hardware blocks. It has a wide input voltage range from 1. 8 V up to 3. 6 V, and 900 nA sleep mode current 16 mA maximum communication current. With these features, it is suitable for use with a battery. It also has 12 digital inputs and outputs, 10 -bit ADC, 4 PWM module, UART, I 2 C and SPI, 64 KB of ROM and 64 KB RAM with a built-in processor. It has also has good RF features: 7 dbm output power and - 92. 5 dbm <b>reception</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> 50 Ω RF antenna connection with built-in balun.   Mobile node design has a 33 mm* 50 mm* 20. 3 mm container, a CR 2032 battery could fit into the container. Mobile E-ink node has low power BLE and E-ink technology together. With this combination, light-weight and very low power design could be performed for personal ID tag. Fixed node has an BLE and Ethernet interface, and also optional 3 G interface. It gathers data from mobile nodes via BLE and sends data to central software via Ethernet. Communication with mobile nodes and central software are managed by micro controller unit STM 32 F 101 RCT 6. This device is not suitable for battery powered usage because of the large signalling traffic. Therefore, fixed nodes also contains AC/DC converter. According to usage purpose and locations of the device, directional or omni-directional antenna could be used for BLE communication. Omni-directional antenna has a center frequency of 2. 45 GHz, providing the required 7 % band width and 10 dB return loss. Directional loop antenna has 2. 45 GHz center frequency with 7 % band width, 13 dB return loss, 5. 8 dB gain and 120 ˚ orientation angle. For this study, a unique BLE profile has been developed. Including location information, a system has been created by using environmental informations and local databases of the devices.   In similar studies in this area, ideal condition in an ideal environment have been chosen for distance measurement in meter units. For closer results to ideal environment,  maximum RSSI values of the gathered information is used. In this study, instead of maximum of RSSI values, the mean value and standard deviation is taken into account in the implemented system.   RSSI value is affected by environment and moving object. Thus, distance measurement via RSSI value is not a robust solution. In this study, RSSI values are filtered with an algorithm that uses mean value and standard deviation of gathered RSSI values. Instead of calculating distance between fixed node and mobile node, location information of mobile node is determined with zones in the region. In addition to the location information, an advance system have been developed via using environmental conditions and information in the local database of nodes. Fixed node locations have been determined for the system which was performed in the office environment and either directional or omni-directional antennas have been preferred. The data generated from fixed nodes had been processed with computer interface; by controlling mobile node locations and conditions periodically, zone variance and estimated locations had been analyzed. The developed system was compared to the other systems according to power consumption, coverage, cost, sensitivity, accessibility and security a. Consequently, a strong system in the aspects of power consumption, security, accessibility and cost which is capable of sensitively performing zone assignment and border detection has been developed. The system performed in an office environment, the positions of fixed nodes determined. Two directional antennas and three omni-directional antennas are used for five fixed nodes. Collected periodical data from mobile nodes are processed by fixed nodes and location changes, entries to restricted areas and environmetal changes are  reported to the central software by fixed nodes. The system is suitable for improvement and could be used for various purposes in various fields.   BLE technology was developed to meet the needs of low-power and do not require high data transfer applications. Has expanded rapidly since 2010. Low-power and low-data rate applications are increasing rapidly with personal devices, machine to machine communication (M 2 M), Internet of  Things (IoT) applications with new ideas to reach all electronic devices. Location-based services are also needed for in-door applications. Navigation for indoor locations with a large area, caring in the field of life of patients, following the daily activities of athletes, inventory safety for high cost devices in hospitals and lobatories, monitoring the status of autonomous devices in the production line, examining the product of the process steps, knowing last position cases and boxes in logistics network, estimating working hours of stuff,  preventing the entry of visitors to the forbidden zones,studing of consumer behavior in stores and shopping centers could be applications with BLE for location-base services.
