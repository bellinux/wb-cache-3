5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{has been referred to}} as Syria's most radical government in history. He initiated rash and radical policies internally and externally, and tried to overturn Syrian society from the top to the bottom. While Assad and Jadid agreed ideologically, they did not agree on how to implement these beliefs in practice. The Military Committee, which had been the officers' key decision-making process during 1963–66, lost its central institutional authority under Jadid because the fight against the Aflaqites was over – the key reason for the committee's existence in the first place. While Jadid never acquired, or took the offices of Prime Minister or President, instead opting to rule through the office of Assistant Secretary of the Regional Command, he was the undisputed ruler of Syria from 1966 to 1970. Before the 1966 coup, Jadid had controlled the Syrian armed forces through his post as Head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, but from 1966 onwards Jadid became absorbed with <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and in his place, Assad was given the task of controlling the armed forces. This would later prove to be a mistake, and lead to Jadid's downfall in the 1970 Corrective Revolution.|$|E

25|$|The play {{begins with}} the funeral of Henry V, who has died {{unexpectedly}} in his prime. As his brothers, the Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester, and his uncle, the Duke of Exeter, lament his passing and express doubt as to whether his son (the as yet uncrowned heir apparent Henry VI) is capable of <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> in such tumultuous times, word arrives of military setbacks in France. A rebellion, led by the Dauphin Charles, is gaining momentum, and several major towns have already been lost. Additionally, Lord Talbot, Constable of France, has been captured. Realising a critical time is at hand, Bedford immediately prepares himself to head to France and take command of the army, Gloucester remains in charge in England, and Exeter sets out to prepare young Henry for his forthcoming coronation.|$|E

25|$|On 5 November, South Vietnam's new Foreign Minister sent {{a message}} to the Embassy officially informing Lodge of the change of government, and expressing the hope that {{relations}} between the two countries would continue and be strengthened. The State Department approved Lodge's proposed reply of recognition the following day, and under the pressure of other governments and the media, announced its intention to recognize the junta on 7 November in Washington. The recognition was delivered on 8 November, when Lodge called on the new Foreign Minister, Lắm, who, claiming to be insufficient for the job he had been given, asked for Lodge's advice. The main impression reported to Washington was that the new government would be heavily dependent on US advice and support, not only for the counter insurgency, but also in the day to day problems of <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 21, 2000, during {{demonstrations in}} Quito by {{indigenous}} groups, {{the military and}} police refused to enforce public order, beginning {{what became known as}} the 2000 Ecuadorean coup d'état. Demonstrators entered the National Assembly building and declared, in a move that resembled the coups d'état endemic to Ecuadorean history, a three-person junta in charge of the country. Field-grade military officers declared their support for the concept. During a night of confusion and failed negotiations President Mahuad was forced to flee the presidential palace for his own safety. Vice President Gustavo Noboa took charge by vice-presidential decree; Mahuad went on national television in the morning to endorse Noboa as his successor. The military triumvirate that was effectively <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> also endorsed Noboa. The Ecuadorean Congress then met in an emergency session in Guayaquil on the same day, January 22, and ratified Noboa as President of the Republic in constitutional succession to Mahuad.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, Stevie Wonder {{had become}} one of the most popular figures in R and pop music, not only in the U.S., but worldwide. Within a short space of time, the albums Talking Book, Innervisions and Fulfillingness' First Finale were all {{back-to-back}} top five successes, with the latter two winning Grammy Award for Album of the Year, in 1974 and 1975, respectively. By the end of 1975, Wonder became serious about quitting the music industry and emigrating to Ghana to work with handicapped children. He had expressed his anger with the way that the U.S. government was <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> A farewell concert was being considered as the best way to bring down the curtain on his career. Wonder changed his decision, when he signed a new contract with Motown on August 5, 1975, thinking he was better off making the most of his career. At the time, rivals such as Arista and Epic were also interested in him. The contract was laid out as a seven-year, seven LP, $37 million deal and gave him full artistic control, making this the largest deal made with a recording star up to that point. Almost at the beginning Wonder took a year off from the music market, with a project for a double album to be released in 1976.|$|E

500|$|In 1696 Marlborough, {{together}} with Godolphin, Russell and Shrewsbury, was yet again implicated in a treasonous plot with JamesII, this time instigated by the Jacobite militant John Fenwick. The accusations were eventually {{dismissed as a}} fabrication and Fenwick executed – the King himself had remained incredulous – {{but it was not}} until 1698, a year after the Treaty of Ryswick brought an end to the Nine Years' War, that the corner was finally turned in William's and Marlborough's relationship. On the recommendation of Lord Sunderland (whose wife was a close friend of Lady Marlborough), William eventually offered Marlborough the post of governor to the Duke of Gloucester, Anne's eldest son; he was also restored to the Privy Council, {{together with}} his military rank. When William left for Holland in July Marlborough was one of the Lords Justices left <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> in his absence; but striving to reconcile his close Tory connections with that of the dutiful royal servant was difficult, leading Marlborough to complain – [...] "The King's coldness to me still continues".|$|E
500|$|His {{first major}} {{activity}} on the king's behalf was in France with the king's uncle, the duke of Gloucester in June–July 1436, which had the goal of relieving Calais, in a short, sharp campaign; albeit using the largest English army seen on French soil since Henry V's campaign. He briefly reinforced the Duke of York in Normandy, but all returned to England in late July 1437. For this service he was granted the county of Boulogne in reward; he was not, however, to ever return, even though the earl of Warwick had named {{him as one of}} the preferred nobles to accompany him back to France that year to relieve York. On 5 January the following year (by now a 'prominent Household servant,' according to Ralph Griffiths) he was made steward of the Duchy of Lancaster and steward of Leicester, Castle Donington, and Higham Ferrers. In 1439 he was sworn onto the king's council, which was effectively <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> during the king's minority, and in 1446 he was 'intimately involved' in peace negotiations with the French. [...] In 1445, he was appointed Constable of England, an envoy to France that same year beginning those negotiations, and five years later, to the Scots.|$|E

500|$|The {{provisional}} government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in it quickly losing control. Minh {{was criticized for}} being lethargic and uninterested in <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged {{in the wake of}} Diệm's deposal, partly due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Diệm. The incidence of Viet Cong attacks continued to increase as it had done during 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification and inflation of military statistics by Diệm's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm's death. Khánh claimed that [...] "After the November coup, there was much relaxation, wining and dining, and little prosecution of the war effort." [...] Khánh claimed that he had built up intelligence infrastructure to weed out the Viet Cong under Diệm's rule, but that the other generals had disbanded it and released communist prisoners.|$|E

The freeze on US economic aid, the suspension of the Commercial Import Program and various capital works initiatives were lifted, and Thơ and Minh were recognised. The first order of the new regime was Provisional Constitutional Act No. 1, signed by Minh, formally suspending the 1956 constitution created by Diệm. Minh was said to have preferred playing mah-jongg, playing tennis at the elite Cercle Sportif, tending to his garden and giving tea parties to fighting the Viet Cong or <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> He was criticised for being lethargic and uninterested. Stanley Karnow said [...] "He was a model of lethargy, lacking both the skill and the inclination to govern". According to Karnow, Minh lamented to him that because of his role as the junta head, he [...] "didn't have enough time to grow his orchids or play tennis".|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{disagreed}} with European culture and thinking, he studied it closely and {{was known for}} his scholarly nature. Ming Mạng was keen in Western technologies, namely mechanics, weaponry and navigation which he attempted to introduce into Vietnam. Upon hearing of the vaccination against smallpox, he organised for a French surgeon to live in a palatial residence and vaccinate the royal family against the disease. He was learned in Eastern philosophy and was regarded as an intellectually oriented monarch. [...] He was also known for his writings as a poet.

As a result, he was held in high-regard for his devotion to <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> When Minh Mạng died, he left the throne to his son, Emperor Thiệu Trị, who was more rigidly Confucianist and anti-imperialist than his father. During Thiệu Trị's reign, diplomatic standoffs precipitated by aspiring European imperial powers on the pretext of the [...] "treatment" [...] of Catholic priests gave them an excuse to use gunboat diplomacy on Vietnam, and led to increasing raids and the eventual colonisation of Vietnam by France.
