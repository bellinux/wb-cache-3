40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the compression stroke in <b>rotary</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors,</b> following an innovative approach. Both a theoretical study and an experimental activity have been carried out to achieve the results. The rotary compressors are positive displacement machines in which compression and displacement are affected by the positive action of rotating elements. Currently, these machines are successfully employed in many applications, such as refrigeration, heat pumps and supercharged automotive engines. The first step of the activity presented in this paper has been the analysis (also in terms of bibliographical research) of the well-known theory behind the operation of the rotary compressors, in order to clarify the correct ideal working process. The main finding has been the evaluation that the use of the classical “pV representation” to calculate the ideal specific work leads to a numerical error in the result. In order to overcome the miscalculation, the authors have proposed a different representation of the process, introducing a new approach and a consistent model. Starting from the new pV representation, a more detailed equation has been achieved to calculate a more exact value of the ideal specific work. After the theoretical analysis, a test bench has been set up, in order to compare the developed model with experimental data: particularly, the machine object of test has been a scroll compressor. The specific work has been evaluated for the scroll compressor, tested under different working conditions, (for example, at different compression ratios) : the values have been successfully compared with the theoretical ones, previously calculated by the new equation. An optimistic conclusion is represented by the good agreement of the new proposed model with the experimental data, while it is still simple, adaptable, and theoretically strict...|$|E
40|$|Many papers {{exist in}} {{literature}} which {{deal with the}} twin screw compressor; this usually has two different rotors, a male and a female, and is commonly used to produce compressed gas for industrial uses. However, {{a different type of}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>compressor</b> with two screws is sometimes used; one of its typical applications is in car engine supercharging. Present paper deals with the latter type, which is defined as a two screw blower. This blower has two identical helical rotors, each with three lobes. The kinematics and the geometry of the rotors are analysed here, and a complete mathematical model for the rotor is defined. Moreover different possible shapes of the rotors, depending on the design parameters, are analysed and the limitations in the choice of the design parameters are presented. Finally an analysis of the theoretical specific slipping of the rotors is presented, showing which zones of the profile are the most stressed. This model will be useful for further studies on rotor pressure loads and blower dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Thermodynamic {{models to}} {{simulate}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are well known}} for a few decades already and can describe the compressor performance quite well. One {{of the most complex}} part of the simulation process however is the positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> geometry simulation. In the current context, under geometry simulation, values of working compressor volumes, as well as cross-sections of port openings, at different shaft (rotor) angles are considered. In the current paper, as an example, the Greene formula approach was applied to a geometry simulation of a single screw compressor. Working chamber geometry was defined by “cutting “ it with the gate rotor blade; flute volume was computed using Greene formula; suction and discharge ports were intersected with this volume so that port opening contours were defined and their respective cross sectional areas were calculated. The results of this geometry simulation were applied for a thermodynamic model of a single screw compressor. Experimental investigation of a single screw working process using pressure transducers has been conducted. Geometry simulation data was applied to calculate compression work from experimental pressure traces. Pressure-volume diagrams obtained experimentally were compared to the simulated ones. Also, indicator work obtained from simulation and experiment, was compared to the power input to the shaft, and demonstrated good correlation...|$|R
