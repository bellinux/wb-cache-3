40|$|In {{this case}} note, Peter J. Kurshan {{analyzes}} Daniel v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 410 F. Supp. 541 (N. D. Ill. 1976), appeal docketed, No. 76 - 1855 (7 th Cir. April 29, 1976). Plaintiff union member John Daniel was denied the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> receive union <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> after working for twenty-two and one half years. The {{trustees of the}} Local 705 Fund denied the benefits because Daniel 2 ̆ 7 s employment was not continuous. They contended that Daniel {{did not meet the}} conditions of the union pension plan, since he had been laid off involuntarily for several months. As a result, Daniel brought a class action under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws on behalf of all present and past Teamster members against the trustees of Local 705 pension plan, Local 705, certain Local officers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Daniel alleged that defendants had violated section 17 a of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and section 10 b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), in the offer and sale of interests in their pension fund. The district court in Daniel v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters agreed with plaintiff that an investment in a pension fund constitutes the sale of a security as defined by the securities laws, and that a private cause of action can be successfully litigated under the antifraud provisions of those laws. The court conceded that the securities laws provide no explicit answer to whether involuntary and noncontributory pension plans involve the sale of a security, but it found no statutory language prohibiting the application of these laws <b>to</b> <b>pension</b> funds...|$|R

Therefore, any analysis that tries to understand the impact of immigrant workers on the overall system has to take into account the decisions and events these individuals face throughout their lives, as well as the use of the government programs they are entitled to. We propose a life-cycle Overlapping Generations (OLG) model in a general equilibrium framework of legal and undocumented immigrants' decisions regarding consumption, savings, labor supply, and program participation to analyze their role in the financial sustainability of the system. Our analysis of the effects of potential policy changes, such as giving some undocumented immigrants legal status, shows increases in capital stock, output, consumption, labor productivity, and overall welfare. The effects are relatively small in percentage terms but considerable given the size of our economy.

As a result, a 1990 cohort individual would have a larger risk-adjusted pension plus social security benefit if some of the tax subsidy currently provided <b>to</b> <b>pension</b> <b>benefits</b> was reduced and the resulting tax revenue was used to finance scheduled social security benefits, rather than leaving the pension tax subsidy in place and receiving the lower social security benefits that are payable given current trust-fund revenue sources...|$|R
