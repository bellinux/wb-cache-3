After retelling {{the events of the}} previous two films to Amanda, Amanda tells her that Victor Crowley is a <b>repeater,</b> <b>set</b> to relive the night he died, looking for his father and that he will keep coming back unless he gets what he wants: his father. She tells Marybeth that her father, Sampson Dunston, was the one that {{came up with the idea}} to start the fire many years ago and tried to get him to deliver Thomas Crowley's ashes to Victor over the past several years, only to be dismissed numerous times. Since he's dead and she's Sampson's bloodline, only she can put an end to Victor Crowley. Marybeth doesn't believe her, continuously declaring that she killed Victor Crowley the night before.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the above}} example the AV Receiver must report {{whether it has}} {{downstream}} devices or not using the REPEATER bit. E.g. when the TV is turned on, the AV Receiver should set REPEATER=TRUE, and when TV is turned off it sets REPEATER=FALSE. Since there is no proper way to notify on REPEATER status change, the AV Receiver must reset the connection with the Source. In order to avoid this redundant reset cycles on the connections, which has annoying user-experience, HDCP v1.x allows devices that are potentially <b>Repeater</b> to <b>set</b> the <b>REPEATER</b> all the time, even when no downstream devices are connected (e.g. while the TV is off). In HDCP v2.x that smart has been lost and the Repeater must not keep the <b>REPEATER</b> flag <b>set</b> once it has no downstream devices.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Repeater</b> {{frequency}} <b>sets</b> {{are known}} as [...] "repeater pairs", and in the ham radio community most follow ad hoc standards for {{the difference between the}} two frequencies, commonly called the offset. In the USA two-meter band, the standard offset is 600 kHz (0.6 MHz), but sometimes unusual offsets, referred to as oddball splits, are used. The actual frequency pair used is assigned by a local frequency coordinating council.|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of self-harm is increasing in the United Kingdom, {{accounting for the}} highest number of acute medical admissions for women. The medical and nursing response to <b>repeaters,</b> <b>set</b> within a climate of dwindling emergency and accident resources, has been one of impatience, frustration, and hostile care. The author undertook a correspondence study with 6 women who regularly self-harmed. The women claimed that medical and nursing professionals viewed their self-harm as irrational and illogical. However, a qualitative examination of the motivations and interests of all parties reveals that self-harm acts possess situated internal logic, whereas professionals tend to use rational logic in attempting to understand them. THE BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY Self-harm (or deliberate self-harm, as the medical literature defines it) has only recently achieved recognition within research literature as a set of practices that are distinct from suicidal acts (Giddens, 1971, p. xiv) or parasuicidal acts (Favazza, 1987, p. 270). Indeed, the process of establishing that the motivations behind acts of self-harm do not unproblematically form part of either of the latter fields has onl...|$|R

According to the measurements, the pilot coverage planning threshold of about − 80 [*]dBm ensures a 2500 [*]kbps throughput for shared HSDPA connections. Improving the coverage above − 80 [*]dBm seems to provide only small advantage in HSDPA throughput. Of course, the pilot planning thresholds may change if different channel power allocations are used.

50|$|In 1988, WWCP {{converted}} WWPC to {{a separate}} station (with new calls WATM-TV) which then took the ABC affiliation. That station was soon sold-off {{to a separate}} licensee in order to comply with FCC regulations on station ownership but the commission allowed WWCP to continue to control that channel under a local marketing agreement. WWCP successfully contended that if operated separately, both stations {{may have been in}} danger of going dark. For a time, a <b>repeater</b> was <b>set</b> up that allowed WWCP to be received on UHF channel 57 in the Altoona area. This was not effective, however, because the transmitter was twenty miles away near Martinsburg. Altoona viewers who did not possess a high-powered antenna could not receive this signal. Throughout most of the city, viewers only saw a picture with no sound.|$|R

Lumiere TV was originally available on the NOVA Cyprus platform but following a financial dispute, it moved over to rival Athina Sat. As of March 3, 2008, LTV is once again available through NOVA Cyprus following a new agreement that was signed between the two companies. The channel is no longer available through Athina Sat, which has ceased operations in March 2008. It was also available through IPTV providers CytaVision & PrimeTel until its final closure and liquidation in August 2014.|$|R
40|$|A {{very high}} {{frequency}} (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF) network is used in Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for communication purposes within the company. This network is specially used in the field activities such as in breakdowns & projects. This network is fully owned by the CEB and it is maintained by the company itself. This network is used four bands of frequency called VHF low band (LB), VHF mid band (MB), VHF high band (HB) and UHF band. Also there are four different types of radio equipment in the network called <b>repeaters,</b> fixed <b>sets,</b> mobile sets and hand held <b>sets.</b> <b>Repeater</b> station is used as an amplifier station for long distance communication. Radio sets which are installed in the office places like project offices and customer service centers are called fix sets. Radio sets are installed in vehicles which works {{in the field are}} called mobile sets. There were 34 numbers of repeaters, 1000 fixed and mobile sets, 814 hand held sets and 13 other radio equipment at the end of 2010. Presently, this network is not used by most of the uses because of its drawbacks and alternatives. Lots of breakdowns are being reported. It can be a because of an equipment fault, a DC supply fault, a battery fault or an antenna fault. There are several reasons for these breakdowns such as carelessness of uses, oldness of equipment, less knowledge of the network, coverage issues, lightning and corrosion issues. Mobile telephones are widely used as a communication medium in field activities without using existing VHF/UHF network. For the year 2010, around 18. 5 million Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) have been expended by the CEB as the operational and maintenance (O&M) cost of VHF and UHF network. When considering the economic benefits of using a mobile operator as an alternative solution to maintain this VHF and UHF network, it is profitable. But non economical benefits of VHF and UHF networks such as broadcast facility, security and fast response are very critical in the power system. So maintaining this network for optimum use is essential. As a first step, all existing drawbacks have to be avoided. There should be a proper maintenance plan and all users have to be educated about the system and its usefulness. Also the network planning system has to be optimized. A network expansion model was derived for future expansions of the network. When this network expansion is used, most of parameters which have to be considered when planning the network can be optimized. They are frequency band, antenna type, transmission power, antenna location and antenna height. Parameters which calculated from this model can be verified using software tools. In addition to that in all installation works, good practices have to be followed to reduce losses and improve the availability of the network. When there is a properly maintain and widely covered network, the communication media within the company will so powerful than before. Then power system reliability will be improved. Finally this will improve the quality of the Sri Lankan power system. However, it is to be studied about the VHF and UHF communication systems before starting this challenging business...|$|R
