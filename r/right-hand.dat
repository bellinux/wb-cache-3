5|$|Although he {{also played}} swing and R, Powell {{was known as}} a bebop player. This {{included}} using <b>right-hand</b> single-note lines. In his playing with Brown and Roach, he was fond of inserting musical quotes, including from nursery rhymes and opera.|$|E
5|$|At another point, Voss {{was caught}} in a crossfire by at least five of his attackers but seemed unhurt. At about this point, Maybery withdrew with his aircraft's upper <b>right-hand</b> {{longeron}} holed in several places.|$|E
5|$|He finds new {{rivals in}} Tusk, who seeks to {{maintain}} his position as Walker's <b>right-hand</b> adviser against Underwood's intrusion, and his former communications director, Remy Danton (Mahershala Ali), {{who is now a}} lobbyist working with Tusk.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, all 24,091 C3 Picassos in the UK were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} modification, following complaints and {{an investigation by}} BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog into brakes that could be activated {{on the passenger side}} of the <b>right-hand</b> drive vehicles.|$|E

5|$|A {{member of}} the Red Triangle Circus Gang and The Penguin's <b>right-hand</b> man. He carries an organ grinder as his main weapon. He survives all three attacks on Gotham City, but is {{captured}} and presumably interrogated by Batman during the Penguin's final attempt to take over Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on <b>right-hand</b> flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the <b>right-hand</b> post.|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the <b>right-hand</b> seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the <b>right-hand</b> side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces. Orledge observes that the <b>right-hand</b> figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to {{that at the end of}} Chopin's Waltz in E minor. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first {{significant}} chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen on the <b>right-hand</b> side of the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on the <b>right-hand</b> side of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received {{the ball in the}} Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{was paid}} $750,000 in 1968 {{for the war}} epic Where Eagles Dare, about a World War II squad {{parachuting}} into a Gestapo stronghold in the alpine mountains. Richard Burton played the squad's commander, with Eastwood as his <b>right-hand</b> man. Eastwood was also cast as Two-Face in the Batman television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe {{stepped up}} {{to take the first}} spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near <b>right-hand</b> corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the {{left-hand}} post and bounced off the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed the ball in the <b>right-hand</b> corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed the goal, near the centre of the goal to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray. Arsenal's only hope now was Vieira, but the midfielder missed and hit the crossbar instead. Popescu then stepped up, and netted with a powerful shot, as Galatasaray won the penalty shoot-out 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area for winter {{climbing}} in the Lake District. The steep headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped buttress on the <b>right-hand</b> side of the face, known to climbers as Viking Buttress, and {{in a couple of}} gullies which lead to the summit.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the <b>right-hand</b> side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the <b>right-hand</b> running plate.|$|E
5|$|In {{charge of}} these Serbian {{military}} conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević, his <b>right-hand</b> man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and the spy Rade Malobabić. Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were {{given access to}} the same clandestine network of safe-houses and agents that Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hatcher plans {{secretly}} {{to isolate}} the central London area because of the infection. However, an infected man breaks {{into his office and}} tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Michael Canaris, Hatcher's <b>right-hand</b> man, quarantines him and takes his place as de facto Prime Minister. Hatcher later commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying <b>right-hand</b> wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a <b>right-hand</b> wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E
5|$|Preparation of Atlantis {{itself for}} mission STS-74 {{began with the}} {{replacement}} of three thrusters in Atlantiss <b>right-hand</b> Orbital Maneuvering System pod in bay 2 of the Orbiter Processing Facility on 25 August 1995. Installation of the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) on Atlantis was completed on 5 September 1995, as were closeout operations on the Russian docking module.|$|E
5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the <b>right-hand</b> side, {{it must also}} divide the {{left-hand}} side, v. This result is known as Euclid's lemma. Specifically, if a prime number divides L, then it must divide at least one factor of L. Conversely, if a number w is coprime to each {{of a series of}} numbers a1, a2, …, a'n, then w is also coprime to their product, a1×a2×…×a'n.|$|E
5|$|The barrel was of {{one-piece}} forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, <b>right-hand</b> twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The breech end of {{the barrel}} was screwed into a breech ring. The breech mechanism was of vertical sliding-block type. The barrel was fitted with a hydrospring recoil system.|$|E
5|$|Through violence, Djoekri (Tan Tjeng Bok) {{is able to}} {{gain control}} of his brother Mardjoeki's (Bissoe) wealth and plantation, Soemberwaras. The latter disappears, leaving behind his adult son Mochtar (Mohamad Mochtar). At the plantation, the young man is treated as a servant and often beaten by Djoekri and his <b>right-hand</b> man, Hasan. Djoekri's son Joesoef (Mohamad Sani), however, leads a life of plenty.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} long facade with its two wings of {{contrasting}} architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval {{windows of the}} left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean balustrade was repeated above the Gothic <b>right-hand</b> wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use castellations instead of a balustrade on the <b>right-hand</b> side. Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The {{focal point of the}} facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting to the ceiling of the passage leading, not to a great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).|$|E
5|$|After the I-95 interchange, Route 37 widens {{to three}} lanes in each direction. The freeway crosses Jefferson Boulevard and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor {{railroad}} on twin-span bridges and passes {{to the north}} of the Lincoln Park Cemetery before interchanging with US 1 at exits 5A-B. The freeway terminates at a trumpet interchange with US 1, with the two left-hand lanes defaulting onto US 1 north and the <b>right-hand</b> lane serving US 1 south, which connects to T. F. Green Airport.|$|E
5|$|After {{working as}} Lavochkin's <b>right-hand</b> man during World War II, Semyon Alekseyev was {{appointed}} as Chief Designer of OKB-21 (design bureau) at Gor'kiy. The Council of the People's Commissars directed Alekseyev and other designers to develop jet fighters using more powerful engines than the captured German Jumo 004 and the BMW 003 and their Soviet-built copies. The result of Alekseyev's efforts was the I-21 (Russian: istrebitel (fighter)), which was {{planned to be}} produced in several variants.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper <b>right-hand</b> wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
5|$|As a {{minister}} of finance, Banza directed {{much of his}} energy and time into lifting the country out of bankruptcy. Banza was also successful {{in his efforts to}} build the government's reputation abroad, all the while establishing himself as a respected and well-liked leader. Many believed that the natural-born leader would not remain as Bokassa's <b>right-hand</b> man for much longer. After Banza was promoted from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel in 1965, Bokassa realized that his greatest political threat wasn't from the remaining group of Dacko supporters, but from Banza himself.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton {{to see what}} can be done to stem the losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's <b>right-hand</b> man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and <b>right-hand</b> man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
