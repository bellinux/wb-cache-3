Besides deriving the framework, {{we focus on}} making the connection and contrast between the ML-based algorithm and popular steered response power (SRP) SSL algorithms such as phase transform (SRP-PHAT). We also show under our ML framework how challenging conditions such as directional microphone arrays and reverberations can be handled.

40|$|Abstract — Sequential Monte Carlo {{methods have}} been {{recently}} proposed {{to deal with the}} problem of acoustic source localisation and tracking using an array of microphones. Previous implementations make use of the basic bootstrap particle filter, whereas a more general approach involves the concept of importance sampling. In this paper, we develop a new particle filter for acoustic source localisation using importance sampling, and compare its tracking ability with that of a bootstrap algorithm proposed previously in the literature. Experimental results obtained with simulated reverberant samples and real audio recordings demonstrate that the new algorithm is more suitable for practical applications due to its reinitialisation capabilities, despite showing a slightly lower average tracking accuracy. A real-time implementation of the algorithm also shows that the proposed particle filter can reliably track a person talking in real reverberant <b>rooms.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — acoustic source localisation and tracking, microphone array, Bayesian filtering, particle filter, importance sampling.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to mapping for mobile robots that exploits user interaction to semiautonomously create a labelled map of the environment. The robot autonomously follows the user and is provided with a verbal commentary on the current location with phrases such as “Robot, {{we are in the}} office”. At the same time, a metric feature map is generated using fusion of laser and advanced sonar measurements in a Kalman filter based SLAM framework, which is later used for localization. When mapping is complete, the robot generates an occupancy grid for use in global task planning. The occupancy grid is created using a novel laser scan registration scheme that relies on storing the path of the robot along with associated local SLAM features during mapping, and later recovering the path by matching the associated local features to the final SLAM map. The occupancy grid is segmented into labelled rooms using an algorithm based on watershed segmentation and integration of the verbal commentary. Experimental results demonstrate our mobile robot creating SLAM and segmented occupancy grid maps of rooms along a 70 metre corridor, and then using these maps to navigate between <b>rooms.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — SLAM, advanced sonar, laser, occupancy map, room segmentatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{acoustic}} source localization algorithms {{attempt to find}} the current location of the {{acoustic source}} using data collected at an array of sensors at the current time only. In the presence of strong multipath, these traditional algorithms often erroneously locate a multipath reflection rather than the true source location. A recently proposed approach that appears promising in overcoming this drawback of traditional algorithms, is a statespace approach using particle filtering. In this paper we formulate a general framework for acoustic source localization using particle filters. We discuss four specific algorithms that fit within this framework, and demonstrate their performance using both simulated reverberant data and data recorded in a moderately reverberant office room (with a measured reverberation time of 0. 39 seconds).

40|$|Abstract—Microphone arrays often {{operate in}} the near field, which complicates the problem of {{determining}} a source location from time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements typically derived from generalized cross-correlation functions. Each TDOA satisfies the equation of a hyperboloid in space and methods {{have been developed to}} either solve for intersecting hyperboloids or make some approximation to them, keeping source-location determination a nonlinear, somewhat complex problem. We introduce a closed-form, analytic solution for the problem (the GS algorithm). It is so simple that we were surprised that, until very recently, there have been no other solutions similar to ours. The method uses a minimum of five microphones in three dimensions, one more than other solutions, but, for nonsingular layouts of the microphones, it is very fast and accurate. First, the new method is compared to other closed-form methods for accuracy and sensitivity to noise using simulated data. Then, several variants of GS are compared to two other real-time algorithms, LEMSalg and SRP-PHAT, using real, human-talker data from a large array in a noisy <b>room.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Localization, microphone arrays, sensor arrays.

40|$|In {{listening}} room compensation, {{the aim is}} to compensate for the degradations that are rendered to an audio signal by transmission in a closed room. Due to multiple reflections of the soundwaves, the listener receives a superposition of delayed and attenuated versions of the source signal. A filter is designed so that the convolution of the room impulse response and the equalizer contains better acoustic properties than the original acoustic channel. Common approaches for dereverberation optimize only the time-domain representation of the overall impulse response and may introduce distortions in the frequency domain. Equalization of the frequency response, on the other hand, often does not consider the time-domain behavior in an ideal way. In this paper, we propose a novel method to jointly consider both the time- and frequency-domain behavior. It outperforms the methods known from literature in terms of dereverberation and equalization performance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multichannel echo control algorithm that learns {{a model of}} the room while tracking its changes. Using the history of echo path estimates, the algorithm grad-ually infers an eccentric ellipsoid as the space for echo paths (impulse responses). The directions of skewness of the ellip-soid form a basis for a low dimensional affine space (linear manifold) containing the principle components of echo paths. Assigning a high priority to the principle components, the al-gorithm reduces the dimension of the search space to combat the non-uniqueness problem. We implemented the algorithm on a real-time software platform running on a Xeon 3. 4 GHz processor at a sampling rate of 44. 1 KHz. In tested practi-cal setups, once the model was mature, the algorithm demon-strated high stability and accuracy without the need to uncor-relate the excitation signals.

40|$|Abstract — We have {{initiated}} a long-term robotics project {{based on our}} previous work on metacognition as a powerful tool that can synergistically play machine learning and commonsense reasoning off one another. The new project involves a mobile robot that lives {{in a room and}} learns about the room and about itself. The robot is initially set up to have a standard set of facilities (vision, IR, limb, wheels, planners, learning modules, some modest NLP, a reasoner, etc.) but it does not know much about its capabilities or how to properly use them. It has a prime directive: to learn. This paper will focus on one of the first major questions of this project: can we use Growing Neural Gas (GNG) to discover the physical structure of an environment and, if so, what are the limits of its use? To answer this question, we have devised an experiment to test whether our robot can distinguish between two identical objects using only GNG.

40|$|Abstract—Digital {{waveguide}} mesh (DWM) models offer a simple, accurate, time-domain, {{numerical solution}} of the wave equation. A specific case where such accurate and computationally simple solutions are needed is the acoustical modeling of open or closed volumes. It is possible to model 3 -D propagation of waves in enclosures such as rooms using DWM models. Generally, idealized omnidirectional sources are used for obtaining the im-pulse response in the DWM. However, real-life sound sources are never completely isotropic, causing wavefronts with directional properties. This paper presents two methods to simulate analytical and empirical directivities in 3 -D DWM models in the far-field. The first method {{is based on the}} direct excitation of the mesh with the velocity component of the directional source and is used to simulate analytical sources. The second method is based on the weighting of velocity components generated by an omnidirectional source at different octave-bands and is used to simulate sources with frequency-dependent empirical directivity functions. A simple interpolation method for obtaining a closed-form descrip-tion of the directivity function from incomplete directivity data is also proposed.
