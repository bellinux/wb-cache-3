25|$|A {{statue of}} George Orwell, sculpted by the British {{sculptor}} Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, {{the headquarters of}} the BBC. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> people what {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E
500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because I feel that the more Islam that we get in our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty means anything at all, it means the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> people what they don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} and writers initially formed a general {{plan for the}} show {{through the end of}} a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films. In May 2016, Chloe Bennet likened {{the end of the third}} season to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] She elaborated that [...] "the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show" [...] moving forward. The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to [...] "skew a little darker because of" [...] this change, with Loeb adding that [...] "It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [...] I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making Deadpool anytime soon on [...]" [...] Marvel [...] "had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak" [...] in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of Ghost Rider in the season over one of Marvel's Netflix series, because Marvel felt [...] "that this character was <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> [...] stories right now" [...] and having him on S.H.I.E.L.D. aided that because [...] "it was so unexpected". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.|$|E
2500|$|On January 1, {{ahead of}} the caucuses, Gingrich stated that Romney would [...] "buy an {{election}} if he could." [...] In {{the final days of}} the campaign and immediately after the results came in, Gingrich expressed anger toward Romney and the negative [...] "Restore Our Future" [...] campaign, stating that in the future [...] "We are not going to go out and run nasty ads, but I do reserve the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth...If the truth seems negative, that may be more a comment on his [...] record than the nature of politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, Palin {{expressed}} {{her support}} {{for the expansion of}} Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories, a position contrary to that of every U.S. Presidential administration in the past 40 years. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin stated, [...] "I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon, because that population of Israel is going to grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel {{in the days and weeks}} and months ahead. And I don't think that the Obama administration has any <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Israel that the Jewish settlements cannot expand." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{apportionment}} case of Baker v. Carr, Frankfurter's {{position was}} that the federal courts {{did not have the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> sovereign state governments how to apportion their legislatures; he thought the Supreme Court should not get involved in political questions, whether federal or local. Frankfurter's view had won out in the 1946 case preceding Baker, Colegrove v. Green– there, a 4–3 majority decided that the case was non-justiciable, and the federal courts had no right to become involved in state politics, no matter how unequal district populations had become. But, in the Baker case, the majority of justices ruled to settle the matter– saying that the drawing of state legislative districts was within the purview of federal judges, despite Frankfurter's warnings that the Court should avoid entering [...] "the political thicket." ...|$|E
