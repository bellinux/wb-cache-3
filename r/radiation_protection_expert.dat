40|$|International audienceThe Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) {{approach}} {{consists of}} retrieving solutions from similar past problems and adapting them to new problems. Interpolation tools {{can easily be}} used as adaptation tools in CBR-systems. The accuracies of interpolated results depend {{on the set of}} known solved problems with which the interpolation tools are previously trained. EquiVox is a CBR-based system designed for retrieving and adapting three-dimensional numerical representations of human organs called phantoms. EquiVox uses an interpolation tool as an adaptation process. These phantoms are used by <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> <b>experts</b> to establish dosimetric reports in case of accidental overexposure to radiation. In addition, medical physicians need these phantoms to compute and control exposure to radiation used to treat diseases such as cancerous tumors in hospitals. The present work aims at proposing a distributed architecture for EquiVox so that a user may find a solution as quickly as possible based on the most recent available knowledge of a given community. We have designed a distributed architecture based on a multiagent paradigm and studied the theoretical performance of the new version. These results prove that this distributed version of EquiVox will be a satisfying solution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Joint Research Centre of Ispra, {{one of the}} {{research}} Sites belonging to the European Commission, Directorate General JRC, {{was created in the}} late ¿ 50 s, in order to steer European research on nuclear industry. It hosts numerous nuclear facilities, some of which are maintained in operation, while others were shutdown in past years, namely: two research nuclear reactors, hot cells facilities, radiochemical laboratories, one Cyclotron (still in operation), facilities for studies on fissile material (in operation), and some facilities for the treatment and storage of liquid and solid waste (in operation). The JRC accounts for 16 nuclear licences, 14 Controlled Zones and 12 main Surveilled Zones, on its Ispra Site. The <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> Sector employs the services of some internal laboratories for the assessment of external and internal doses: the ¿Dosimetry¿ Laboratory (for personal and ambient TLDs), the Whole Body Count Laboratory, the Radiotoxicological Laboratory (for analyses on excreta), the <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> Sector itself (for ambient dose and contamination reporting, and electronic personal dosimeters readings). Some of these Services are open also to the external market, and JRC-Ispra is among the few being able to provide, in Italy, either for internal and external dosimetric services to Customers. The paper will discuss the organization and the structure of the Dosimetry and the Whole Body Count Laboratories, and their functions in the management of daily <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> tasks at the JRC. Moreover, in order to follow-up and control Personnel radiation doses, the <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> Sector has developed and put in place, in 2007, the ¿Unified Dosimetry System¿, a wide and flexible database centralizing all dosimetric data and making them on-line available to JRC <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>experts</b> and to the JRC Qualified Expert.

40|$|During the operation, maintenance, and {{dismantling}} {{periods of}} the ATLAS Experiment, the traceability of all detector equipment must be guaranteed for logistic and safety matters. The {{running of the}} Large Hadron Collider will expose the ATLAS detector to radiation. Therefore, CERN must follow specific regulations from both the French and Swiss authorities for equipment removal, transport, repair, and disposal. GLANCE Traceability, implemented in C++ and Java/Java 3 D, has been developed to fulfill the requirements. The system registers and associates each equipment part to either a functional position in the detector or a zone outside the underground area through a 3 D graphical user interface. Radiation control of the equipment is performed using a radiation monitor connected to the system: the local background gets stored and the threshold is automatically calculated. The system classifies the equipment as non radioactive if its radiation dose does not exceed that limit value. History for both location traceability and radiation measurements is ensured, as well as simultaneous management of multiples equipment.

The handbooks are aimed at national and local authorities, central government departments and agencies, emergency services, <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> <b>experts,</b> the agriculture and food production sectors, industry and others who may be affected. The handbooks include management options for application in the different phases of an incident. Sources of contamination considered in the handbooks include nuclear accidents and radiological dispersion devices; the most relevant radionuclides are included. The handbooks are divided into several sections which provide supporting scientific and technical information; an analysis of the factors influencing recovery; compendia of comprehensive, state-of-the-art datasheets for around 100 management options and guidance on planning in advance. A decision-aiding framework comprising colour coded selection tables, look-up tables and decision trees and several worked examples are also included. The handbooks can be used as a preparatory tool, under non-crisis conditions, to engage stakeholders and to develop local and regional plans. The handbooks can also be applied as part of the decision-aiding process to develop a recovery strategy following an incident. In addition, the handbooks are useful for training purposes and during emergency exercises.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{information required}} to estimate, at least qualitatively, the potential impacts of reducing occupational dose limits below those given in 10 CFR 20 (Revised). For this study, a questionnaire {{was developed and}} widely distributed to the <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> community. The resulting data together with data from existing surveys and sources were used to estimate the impact of three dose-limit options; 10 mSv yr{sup {minus} 1 } (1 rem yr{sup {minus} 1 }), 20 mSv yr{sup {minus} 1 } (2 rem yr{sup {minus} 1 }), and a combination of an annual limit of 50 mSv yr{sup {minus} 1 } (5 rem yr{sup {minus} 1 }) coupled with a cumulative limit, in rem, equal to age in years. Due to the somewhat small number of responses {{and the lack of}} data in some specific areas, a working committee of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> <b>experts</b> from a variety of licensees was employed to ensure the exposure data were representative. The following overall conclusions were reached: (1) although 10 mSv yr{sup {minus} 1 } is a reasonable limit for many licensees, such a limit could be extraordinarily difficult to achieve and potentially destructive to the continued operation of some licensees, such as nuclear power, fuel fabrication, and medicine; (2) twenty mSv yr{sup {minus} 1 } as a limit is possible for some of these groups, but for others it would prove difficult. (3) fifty mSv yr{sup {minus} 1 } and age in 10 s of mSv appear reasonable for all licensees, both in terms of the lifetime risk of cancer and severe genetic effects to the most highly exposed workers, and the practicality of operation...|$|R
40|$|A {{stakeholder}} needs assessment, {{carried out}} under the EU-EURAC and EU-ENEN-II projects, clearly showed that, at the European level, there are a significant and constant need for post-graduates with skills in radiochemistry, radioecology, radiation dosimetry and environmental modelling and a smaller, but still important, demand for radiobiologists and bio-modellers. Most of these needs are from government organizations. If only the nuclear industry is considered, then the largest demand is for radio chemists and <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> dosimetry <b>experts.</b> Given this spectrum of need and existing capacity {{in the areas of}} radiobiology it was concluded that the needs identified would be most efficiently met by three new degree programs: • European MSc <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection,</b> • European MSc Analytical Radiochemistry, • European MSc Radioecology. All three master programs would be developed using the framework provided by the Bologna Convention and the lecturing could be shared among specialist Scientists within a network of collaborating universities. Therefore, educational plans have been developed for the above MSc degrees. These plans envisage each degree comprising three modules that are common to all the degrees (3 × 10 ECTS credits), three specialist modules (3 × 10 ECTS credits) and a research project (1 × 60 ECTS credits). The courses should be aimed, not only to fill the identified European post-graduate education gap in radiological sciences, but also to provide a modular structure that is easily accessed by stakeholders for CPD training. It is anticipated that the European Masters will meet the academic training requirements of qualified experts”, as defined by the European Commission and the IAEA.
