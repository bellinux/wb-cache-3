25|$|A third design, {{for a small}} {{unmanned}} version {{powered by}} a single Gnome <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> engine, was constructed in 1918. It was intended to carry meteorological (weather) instruments or radio antennas aloft, {{but it is not}} known whether it ever flew.|$|E
25|$|The PKZ-2 was {{developed}} by Žurovec in parallel with the PKZ-1, but wholly independently. Zurovec acknowledged the support only of Petróczy, although later reports have mistakenly attributed the entire design to Kármán. The aircraft was built by Dr Liptak & Co AG under Žurovek's direction. It had three radiating arms, each housing a <b>rotary</b> <b>piston</b> engine. These engines were coupled together to drive a central pair of co-axial, contra-rotating two-bladed wooden propellers or rotors, of 6m diameter, mounted above the airframe. A round cockpit for the aircrew was fixed centrally, {{on top of the}} rotor mast. Landing gear again comprised rubber-fabric cushions, one large central one and three smaller ones {{at the end of each}} arm.|$|E

Combination offers thermodynamic efficiency of Stirling cycle, relatively low vibration, and automatic adjustment of operating parameters to suit changing load on generator. Rotary Stirling cycle engine converts heat to power via compression {{and expansion of}} working gas between three pairs of <b>rotary</b> <b>pistons</b> on three concentric shafts in phased motion. Three motor/generators each connected to one of concentric shafts, can alternately move and be moved by pistons. Microprocessor coordinates their operation, including switching between motor and generator modes at appropriate times during each cycle...|$|R

40|$|In {{relation}} to the industrial need and to the progress of technology, Laboratoire National de M´etrologie et d’Essais (LNE) would like to improve the measurement of its primary pressure standards, spherical and flick standards. The spherical and flick standards are, respectively, used to calibrate the spindle motion error and the probe, which equip commercial conventional cylindricity-measuring machines. The primary pressure standards are obtained using pressure balances equipped with <b>rotary</b> <b>pistons.</b> To reach a relative uncertainty of 10 − 6 in the pressure measurement, {{it is necessary to}} know the diameters of both the piston and the cylinder with an uncertainty of 5 nm for a piston diameter of 10 mm. Conventional machines are not able to reach such an uncertainty level. That is why {{the development of a new}} machine is necessary. The purpose of this paper is to present the concepts and the architecture adopted in the development of the new equipment dedicated to cylindricity measurement at a nanometric level of a accuracy. The choice of these concepts is based on the analysis of the uncertainty sources encountered in conventional architectures. The architecture of the new ultra-high equipment as well as the associated calibration procedures will be described and detailed. Thèse CIFR...|$|R

50|$|In 1818 the German makers Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blümel {{patented}} {{the first}} valved horn, using <b>rotary</b> valves. <b>Piston</b> valves {{were introduced in}} France about 1839 by François Périnet. Valves were initially intended to overcome problems associated with changing crooks during a performance. Valves' unreliability, musical taste, and players' distrust, among other reasons, slowed their adoption into mainstream. Many traditional conservatories and players refused to use them at first, claiming that the valveless horn, or natural horn, was a better instrument. Some musicians, specializing in period instruments, still use a natural horn when playing in original performance styles, seeking to recapture the sound and tenor in which an older piece was written.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{relation}} to the industrial need and to the progress of technology, LNE would like to improve the measurement of its primary pressure, spherical and flick standards. The spherical and flick standards are respectively used to calibrate the spindle motion error and the probe which equips commercial conventional cylindricity measuring machines. The primary pressure standards are obtained using pressure balances equipped with <b>rotary</b> <b>pistons</b> with an uncertainty of 5 nm for a piston diameter of 10 mm. Conventional machines {{are not able to}} reach such an uncertainty level. That is why {{the development of a new}} machine is necessary. To ensure such a level of uncertainty, both stability and performance of the machine are not sufficient and the data processing should also be done with an accuracy less than the nanometre. In this paper, the new method based on the Small Displacement Screw (SDS) model is proposed. A first validation of this method is proposed on a theoretical dataset published by the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) in report n° 3327. Then, an experiment is prepared in order to validate the new method on real datasets. Specific environment conditions are taken into account and many precautions are considered. The new method is applied to analyze the least squares circle, minimum zone circle, maximum inscribed circle and minimum circumscribed circle. The results are compared to those done by the reference Chebyshev best-fit method and reveal a perfect agreement. The sensibility of SDS and Chebyshev methodologies are investigated, and it is revealed that results remain unchanged when the value of the diameter exceeds 700 times the form error. ...|$|R
