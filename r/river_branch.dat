5|$|Several of the area's coastal {{settlements}} have {{facilities for}} small boats, but generally only fishing and holiday craft use them; no regular passenger or freight-boat service {{runs to the}} Catlins. A railway line, the Catlins <b>River</b> <b>Branch,</b> linked the area with the South Island Main Trunk Line from the late 19th century. Construction of this line began in 1879, {{but it did not}} reach Owaka until 1896. Construction progressed slowly due to the difficult terrain, and the final terminus of the line at Tahakopa was not completed until 1915.|$|E

25|$|The Fall River Railroad {{had been}} formed on August 8, 1845 with {{consolidation}} of three companies; the Fall <b>River</b> <b>Branch</b> Railroad, the Randolph and Bridgewater Railroad and the Middleborough Railroad. The Fall River Railroad {{was led by}} Richard Borden, a prominent mill owner in Fall River who wanted a direct route from his city to Boston, which did not require use of the Boston and Providence Railroad lines. The line from South Braintree to Myricks {{in the town of}} Berkley opened on December 16, 1846 {{as an extension of the}} Fall <b>River</b> <b>Branch</b> Railroad which had been completed in 1845.|$|E

25|$|The most {{successful}} {{of the experimental}} and early railcars was the Edison battery-electric railcar, which provided a popular twice-daily service on the Little <b>River</b> <b>Branch</b> line in Canterbury. It may have been expanded into a full fleet of railcars had the economic difficulties of the Great Depression not intervened, and it was destroyed by a depot fire in 1934 and not replaced.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 1911, NH began {{electric}} {{service on}} its Harlem <b>River</b> <b>Branch,</b> a suburban branch {{that would become}} a main line with {{the completion of the}} New York Connecting Railroad and its Hell Gate Bridge.

25|$|The Brookline Branch {{split from}} the main line in the west part of Boston's Back Bay, running {{southwest}} for 1.55mi (2.5km) to Brookline (the current location of Brookline Village station).

In Summer 1852 the Charles <b>River</b> <b>Branch</b> Railroad extended the line to Newton Upper Falls; this would eventually {{become part of the}} New England Railroad, an alternate route to New York.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, {{additional}} service from the New Haven Line will be provided to New York Penn Station over the Hell Gate Line of the Northeast Corridor, owned by Amtrak.

25|$|After a brief {{concurrency}} with SR9 {{around the}} courthouse in Dawsonville, SR53 continues to the southeast, intersecting US19/SR400 southeast of Dawsonville. SR53 continues southeast into Forsyth County, {{then turns to}} the northeast near the eastern terminus of SR306. After running northeast into Hall County and crossing the Chestatee <b>River</b> <b>branch</b> of Lake Lanier, the route again turns to the southeast, then crosses over the Chattahoochee <b>River</b> <b>branch</b> of Lake Lanier. West of Gainesville, SR53 turns to the southwest, then turns sharply to the southeast near the community of Oakwood, and continues southeast, intersecting I-985. The route continues to head southeast, briefly becoming co-signed with SR211, then crosses into Jackson County and intersects I-85 in Braselton. This section of the route passes by both Road Atlanta and Lanier National Speedway. Crossing into Barrow County, SR53 becomes co-signed with SR11 and SR211 in the northern portion of Winder. The three routes continue south into downtown Winder. There, SR211 departs to the northwest, and SR11 and SR53 continue southeast, now also co-signed with US29 Bus and SR8. Southeast of downtown Winder, SR11 departs, and US29 Bus/SR8/SR53 continue to the junction with US29 and SR316, where US29 Bus terminates, SR8 continues east, and SR53 continues southeast into Oconee County. After crossing US78, SR53 assumes an easterly routing, crossing US129/US441/SR24, before meeting its eastern terminus at US129 Bus./US441 Bus./SR15/SR24 Bus. in downtown Watkinsville.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} {{of being able to}} import bales of cotton and coal to fuel the steam engines to Fall River's deep water harbor, and ship out the finished goods also by water, made Fall River the choice of a series of cotton mill magnates. The first railroad line serving Fall River, The Fall <b>River</b> <b>Branch</b> Railroad, was incorporated in 1844 and opened in 1845. Two years later, in 1847, the first regular steamboat service to New York City began. The Fall River Line as it came to be known operated until 1937, and for many years, was the preferred way to travel between Boston and Manhattan. The Old Colony Railroad and Fall River Railroad merged in 1854, forming the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Franchises {{required}} the NYW to operate trains {{at a minimum}} frequency of two per hour, and it ran up to three times that frequency during rush hours. Trains were from one to six cars in length. Traffic grew from 2.9 million passengers per year in 1913 to 14.1 million in 1928. The completion of the Port Chester branch in 1929 allowed the New Haven to terminate passenger service on its Harlem <b>River</b> <b>branch</b> in 1930. Freight traffic on the line was very limited. The cost savings of not paying {{the high costs of}} using GCT were offset by the lower fares that the NYW charged. In no year of its operation was it able to cover the interest on its bonds, which had been guaranteed by the NH.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of J. P. Morgan in 1913 {{competition}} between the NH and NYC became less restrained. The NYW's White Plains line ran about two miles (3km) east of the Harlem Division of the NYC. The Harlem Division served the settled towns and villages along the Bronx River and its commuter trains enjoyed the advantage of running directly into Manhattan. The Port Chester line was adjacent to NH rails {{for more than half}} of its length and was only two miles west of NH's Harlem <b>River</b> <b>Branch</b> for the balance. Although NH's Harlem Branch trains also terminated at the Harlem River terminal, regular NH commuter trains ran into Grand Central. When NH's bankruptcy led to the separation of ownership of the NYW from the New Haven, the NH's trustee was able to terminate the NYW's lease of its right of way from New Rochelle to Portchester.|$|E

25|$|The Long Island City and Manhattan Beach Railroad built a {{connection}} from the South Side (now the Montauk Branch) at Fresh Pond {{south to the}} New York and Manhattan Beach at Cooper Avenue in 1883, connecting the Manhattan Beach line with Long Island City. The New York, Woodhaven and Rockaway Railroad opened in 1880 from Glendale on the South Side line (Montauk Branch) south to Rockaway Park. Corbin bought it at bankruptcy in 1887 and reorganized it as the New York and Rockaway Beach Railway, but operated it separately until the LIRR leased it on July 1, 1904.The current Oyster Bay Branch was extended from Locust Valley to Oyster Bay in 1889.The New York Bay Extension Railroad opened as a branch from the South Side at Valley Stream northeast to Hempstead in 1893.The Wading <b>River</b> <b>Branch</b> opened from Port Jefferson east to Wading River in 1895.|$|E
