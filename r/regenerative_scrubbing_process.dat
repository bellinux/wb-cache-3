40|$|A {{continuous}} gas {{and liquid}} flow, <b>regenerative</b> <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> for CO{sub 2 } capture was demonstrated at the bench-scale level. An aqueous ammonia-based solution captures CO{sub 2 } from simulated flue gas in an absorber and releases a nearly pure stream of CO{sub 2 } in the regenerator. After the regeneration, {{the solution of}} ammonium compounds is recycled to the absorber. The design of a continuous flow unit was based on earlier exploratory results from a semi-batch reactor, where a CO{sub 2 } and N{sub 2 } simulated flue gas mixture flowed through a well-mixed batch of ammonia-based solution. During the semi-batch tests, the solution was cycled between absorption and regeneration steps to measure the carrying capacity of the solution at various initial ammonia concentrations and temperatures. Consequentially, {{a series of tests}} were conducted on the continuous unit to observe the effect of various parameters on CO{sub 2 } removal efficiency and regenerator effectiveness within the flow system. The parameters that were studied included absorber temperature, regenerator temperature, initial NH{sub 3 } concentration, simulated flue gas flow rate, liquid solvent inventory in the flow system, and height of the packed-bed absorber. From this testing and subsequent testing, ammonia losses from both the absorption and regeneration steps were quantified, and attempts were made to maintain steady state during operations. Implications of experimental results with respect to process design are discussed...|$|E

30|$|To avoid {{ammonium}} inhibition {{and thus}} to ensure a higher biogas yield, it is therefore appropriate to remove the ammonium prior to the digestion process. The stripping and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> provides {{an efficient way to}} achieve this removal and recovery. The related benefits of implementing the stripping and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> are threefold: (1) after the application of an advanced oxidation process (AOP), denitrification of nitrite/nitrate will not occur because these nitrogenous components cannot be formed anymore or at least in much lower concentrations; (2) reduction of the ammonium content in the digestate is favourable in view of the inhibitory effect of this component and (3) the removed ammonium is recovered as (NH 4) 2 SO 4, which can be used as an N–S fertilizer.|$|R
3000|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of {{seawater}} on NO removal of NaClO 2 solution has been investigated in a cyclic scrubbing mode. Compared with NaClO 2 freshwater solution, NaClO 2 seawater solution exhibits much longer breakthrough time for NO absorption. The result of blank experiment and acidic titration demonstrates that the extension of breakthrough time for NaClO 2 seawater might be ascribed to the buffering ability of seawater, which could suppress the acidic decomposition of NaClO 2 into ClO 2. The reduction of ClO 2 escape may be {{the main reason for}} the enhancement of NO removal for NaClO 2 seawater during the cyclic <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process.</b> The analysis of liquid reaction products indicated that NaClO 2 has been consumed completely during the cyclic <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> and turned into Cl [...]...|$|R
30|$|When the {{concentration}} of NaClO 2 in the scrubbing solution is 5  mM, a complete removal of NO from the flue gas {{can not be achieved}} during the whole <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process,</b> so the breakthrough time is zero for 5  mM NaClO 2 solution. From Fig.  3, one can see that, the breakthrough times for NaClO 2 seawater solution have been enhanced obviously compared with those for freshwater solution of the same concentration of NaClO 2 oxidant. When {{the concentration}} of NaClO 2 is 15  mM, the breakthrough time for seawater can be improved by 34.3  % compared with that for freshwater. Since the breakthrough time for NO absorption during the cyclic <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> represents the ability of NO absorption for the scrubbing solution, NaClO 2 seawater exhibits much higher NO absorption potential than NaClO 2 freshwater.|$|R

30|$|In {{our present}} study, which is {{actually}} a continuation of our previous research [23], it was examined if such a stripping and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> {{can be applied to}} selectively remove and recover the TAN present in the thermophilic digestate from a potato processor. For this purpose, a self-developed laboratory setup is built, which initially used Vigreux columns, a commonly used laboratory fractionating column. To create an intense contact between the gas and liquid phases during stripping and scrubbing, the digestate and the acid solution, respectively, were recirculated over Vigreux columns, while an airstream was used to transport the ammonia from the stripping to the scrubbing part of the installation. Comparing treated (ammonium removed via stripping) and untreated digestate (no ammonium removal) allowed us to verify if the ammonium present in this particular digestate really exerts an inhibitory effect on the biogas production or not. In a next phase, the stripping and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> was further investigated by testing different combinations of a Vigreux column and a Dufton column, the latter being another type of fractionating column.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of a spray tower for CO 2 capture instead of a packed absorber column promises substantial advantages, such as reduction of investment and operating costs due to the omission of expensive packing and an insignificant pressure drop. Additionally, a spray <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> offers the opportunity to use precipitating solvents. Moreover, a much higher flexibility of the process towards load changes is expected, {{because there is no}} packing that has to be permanently wetted, and no close fluid-dynamical limitations exist for the gas and liquid flow rate. In order to demonstrate the applicability of a spray <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> for CO 2 capture and to investigate the most important process and design parameters, a two-way experimental approach was chosen. In laboratory scale experiments, the kinetics of CO 2 absorption by single solvent droplets was measured for variations of the process parameters CO 2 partial pressure, solvent loading and droplet size. Additionally, a prototype spray scrubber plant designed for treating upto 150 m 3 N/h raw gas was put into operation for testing the closed loop absorption – desorption process...|$|R

30|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is generally}} considered {{as one of the}} most sustainable technologies for the production of renewable energy. The main bottleneck of the digestion process is the rather low conversion efficiency of organic material which is partly due to the accumulation of ammonia/ammonium. This nitrogen issue can thus be avoided by removing the ammonium present in the digestate by means of a stripping and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process.</b> In this study, a self-developed laboratory-scale setup for stripping and scrubbing was developed and applied on a thermophilic digestate from a potato processor. This easily built system can be used to study stripping and scrubbing of any digestate. Our digestion experiments have demonstrated that after 8  days of incubation, the biogas yield is 36 % higher after removal of the ammonium from the digestate compared to the untreated digestate. This proves the inhibitory effect of ammonium at a concentration of 2.3  g L− 1 NH 4 +–N for this particular digestate. In addition, the stripping and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> ensures that ammonium is removed from the digestate and recovered in the form of (NH 4) 2 SO 4, which can act as nitrogen fertilizer. The stripping and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> was investigated with three different combinations of two types of commonly used laboratory fractionating columns, namely a Vigreux column and a Dufton column for their gas–liquid partition potential. Without optimizing for ammonium removal, the column combination Vigreux (for the stripping part)—Dufton (for the scrubbing part) could remove 87 % of the ammonium from the supernatant (obtained after centrifugation of the digestate), while simultaneously 90 % of the stripped ammonium was recovered as (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The overall efficiency for the nitrogen recovery is thus almost 80 %.|$|R

5000|$|Various <b>scrubbing</b> <b>processes</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} to remove CO2 from the air, or from flue gases. These usually involve using {{a variant of the}} Kraft <b>process.</b> <b>Scrubbing</b> <b>processes</b> may be based on sodium hydroxide. [...] The CO2 is absorbed into solution, transferred to lime via a process called causticization and released in a kiln. With some modifications to the existing processes, mainly an oxygen-fired kiln, the end result is a concentrated stream of CO2 ready for storage or use in fuels. An alternative to this thermo-chemical process is an electrical one in which a nominal voltage is applied across the carbonate solution to release the CO2. While simpler, this electrical process consumes more energy as it splits water at the same time. Since it depends on electricity, the electricity needs to be renewable, like PV. Otherwise the CO2 produced during electricity production has to be taken into account. Early incarnations of air capture used electricity as the energy source; hence, were dependent on a carbon-free source. Thermal air capture systems use heat generated on-site, which reduces the inefficiencies associated with off-site electricity production, but of course it still needs a source of (carbon-free) heat. Concentrated solar power is an example of such a source.|$|R

40|$|One of {{characteristics}} of the rising cloud storage technology is low-cost and high reliability. A distinct benefit of disk scanning or scrubbing operation is identifying the potential failure sectors as early as possible, thus providing high reliability. Obviously, the higher the scrubbing frequency is, the higher the system reliability is. However, {{it may take a}} few hours for a scanning process to check the whole disk. In other words, the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> may result in a downtime or a lower system performance. Furthermore, the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> consumes energy.

Thus it is essential to design a good scrubbing scheme in a large scale storage system over long time horizons. In this paper, we present a novel scrubbing scheme to solve the challenge. In this scheme, an optimum scrubbing cycle is decided by keeping a balance between data loss cost, scrubbing cost, and disk failure rate. Our research shows how the data price and the scrubbing cost affect scrubbing frequency, and the scrubbing scheme is applicable for storage with inexpensive data.

40|$|A {{process is}} under {{consideration}} that achieves treatment and regeneration of spent scrubber {{water from a}} NOx wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>process</b> using a mixed-culture bioreactor. Preliminary prototype bioreactor operation suggests that, {{in addition to other}} desired reactions, a small concentration of dissolved sulfide (less than 5 mg/l) can be generated and maintained in the reactive process water. Presence of dissolved sulfide will allow precipitation of oxidized mercury that has passed from the flue gas into the scrubber solution. In addition, iron monosulfide precipitate in the reactive process stream will contribute to dissolved mercury removal as a result of rapid displacement of ferrous iron to form the more stable mercury sulfide. Metal sulfide would then be separated from bulk solution in a relatively small and concentrated stream using available solid/liquid separation technology. Concerns remain with regard to potential for methylation of mercury in the anoxic/anaerobic bioreactor. It is hypothesized that this can be avoided by prompt removal and pasteurization of metal sulfide precipitate. Further investigation of this phenomenon will be required.
