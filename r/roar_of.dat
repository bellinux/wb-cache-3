5|$|The song {{features}} an acoustic and electric guitar sound. The song {{starts with a}} hushed acoustic ballad before building into a <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> an electric guitar and soaring with vocals. The song also includes an uptempo metronomic drumming rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound {{is similar to that}} of the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E

60|$|With {{the coming}} of night there arose {{throughout}} the jungle {{the cries of the}} great cats, the voice of Numa blended with that of Sheeta, and the thunderous <b>roars</b> <b>of</b> the great males reverberated through the forest until the earth trembled, and from within the city came the answering <b>roars</b> <b>of</b> other lions.|$|R

5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} coast of Scotland, the Cailleach ushers in winter by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: féileadh mòr) in the Gulf of Corryvreckan (Gaelic: Coire Bhreacain - 'cauldron of the plaid'). This process is said to take three days, during which the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the coming tempest is heard as far away as twenty miles (32km) inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
60|$|For {{half an hour}} all was quiet, {{save the}} <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> the winter wind.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} {{absolutely}} still {{save for the}} <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> the Sloths in the distance.|$|R

5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
5|$|The second {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: Belle's Quest and is an action {{platformer}} for the Sega Genesis. Developed by Software Creations, the game was released in North America in 1993. It {{is one of two}} video games based on the film that Sunsoft published for the Genesis, the other being Beauty & The Beast: <b>Roar</b> <b>of</b> the Beast. Characters from the film like Gaston can help the player past tricky situations. As Belle, the player must reach the Beast's castle and break the spell to live happily ever after. To succeed, she must explore the village, forest, castle, and snowy forest to solve puzzles and mini-games while ducking or jumping over enemies. Belle's health is represented by a stack of blue books, which diminishes when she touches bats, rats, and other hazards in the game. Extra lives, keys and other items are hidden throughout the levels. While there is no continue or game saving ability, players can use a code to start the game at any of the seven levels.|$|E
5|$|The third {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: <b>Roar</b> <b>of</b> the Beast and is a side-scrolling video game for the Genesis. As the Beast, the player must {{successfully}} complete several levels, based on scenes from the film, {{in order to protect}} the castle from invading villagers and forest animals and rescue Belle from Gaston. The fourth video game based on the film was titled Disney's Beauty and the Beast and is an action platformer for the SNES. It was developed by Probe Entertainment and published by Hudson Soft in North America in July 1994 and in Europe on February 23, 1995. The game was published by Virgin Interactive in Japan on July 8, 1994. The entire game is played through the perspective of the Beast. As the Beast, the player must get Belle to fall in love so that the curse cast upon him and his castle will be broken. The final boss of the game is Gaston. The Beast can walk, jump, swipe, stomp, super stomp, and roar, the last of which is used to both damage enemies and reveal hidden objects.|$|E

25|$|The {{pendulum}} is withdrawn {{into the}} ceiling, {{and the walls}} become red-hot and start to move inwards, forcing him slowly {{toward the center of}} the room and the pit. As he loses his last foothold and begins to topple in, he hears a <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> voices and trumpets, the walls retract, and an arm pulls him to safety. The French Army has captured the city of Toledo and the Inquisition has fallen into its enemies' hands.|$|E

25|$|At 08:35 on 24 November, {{the seven}} battalions of the {{artillery}} group {{opened fire on}} the Japanese positions {{in front of the}} 3rd Marine Regiment. The <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the cannon fire and the sharp blasts of the explosions in the jungle ahead merged into a near-deafening thunder for more than 20 minutes, with more than 5,600 shells from 75mm and 105mm howitzers fired at the Japanese positions. Smoke shells were also fired into the hills east of the Torokina River to reduce the ability of the Japanese to observe the Marine positions.|$|E
25|$|A {{feature film}} version of the serial was shot in eleven days in December 1973 in colour on 16mm film and then blown up to 35mm. The film {{features}} nearly all the show's regular cast {{as well as more}} revealing nudity than was allowed on TV at the time. A gay kiss between Don and Simon was mysteriously cut from the movie after its Sydney season. Critics were not kind but even Mike Harris from The Australian had to admit he had never been in a cinema before where every character's first appearance got a <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> approval from the crowd.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, von Furst {{is aware}} that his wife still has strong {{feelings}} for Gibby. He sabotages the aircraft Gibby is to fly for a dangerous stunt, secretly applying acid to a control wire, not only out of jealousy, but also {{to add to the}} realism of his film with a real crash. However, unbeknownst to him, Woody decides to do the stunt in Gibby's place. Red sees von Furst tampering with the wires and alerts Gibby. Gibby takes off in another aircraft and catches up to Woody, but cannot make himself understood over the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> their engines. The cable breaks, and Woody crashes and is killed.|$|E

25|$|Early rocket-engine-testing {{began in}} the Arroyo Seco in 1936 and {{this led to the}} {{establishment}} of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) {{at the mouth of the}} Arroyo Seco by the California Institute of Technology. During the 1950s, JPL was heavily involved in rocket testing, and the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> rocket engines could be heard emanating from the Arroyo Seco area for miles. These rocket projects were terminated at the facility by 1958. By the mid-1960s, JPL had become instrumental in the development, launching, and tracking of a number of unmanned near-Earth and deep-space space probes for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. One notable project was the Mars Rover, which has returned a number of panoramic photos of the Martian surface.|$|E
25|$|The final {{orders for}} the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs on Friday 3 December 1971. The first {{formations}} were in flight and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on Pakistan Rangers' outposts by regular troops of the Indian army, which the Indian Air Force was providing support to. The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front. However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the strike aircraft over their airfields, while in Delhi, the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East-Pakistan situation, that something was going on.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the biblical}} {{account of the}} giving of the {{instructions}} and teachings of both the Written and the Oral Torah, Sinai was enveloped in a cloud, it quaked and was filled with smoke, while lightning-flashes shot forth, and the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> thunder mingled with the blasts of a trumpet; the account later adds that fire was seen burning at {{the summit of the}} mountain. In the biblical account, the fire and clouds are a direct consequence of the arrival of God upon the mountain. According to the biblical story, Moses departed to the mountain and stayed there for 40 days and nights in order to receive the Ten Commandments, the Written and the Oral Torah, and he did so twice because he broke the first set of the tablets of stone after returning from the mountain for the first time.|$|E
