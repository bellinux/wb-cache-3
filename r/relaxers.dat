40|$|High-performance {{concurrent}} libraries, such as lock-free data {{structures and}} custom synchronization primitives, are notoriously difficult to write correctly. Such code is often implemented without locks, instead using plain loads and stores and low-level operations like atomic compare-and-swaps and explicit memory fences. Such code must run correctly despite the relaxed memory {{model of the}} underlying compiler, virtual machine, and/or hardware. These memory models may reorder the reads and writes issued by a thread, greatly complicating parallel reasoning. We propose <b>RELAXER,</b> a combination of predictive dynamic analysis and software testing, to help programmers write correct, highly-concurrent programs. Our technique works in two phases. First, <b>RELAXER</b> examines a sequentially-consistent run of a program under test and dynamically detects potential data races. These races are used to predict possible violations of sequential consistency under alternate executions on a relaxed memory model. In the second phase, <b>RELAXER</b> re-executes the program with a biased random scheduler and with a conservative simulation of a relaxed memory model {{in order to create}} with high probability a predicted sequential consistency violation. These executions can be used to test whether or not a program works as expected when the underlying memory model is not sequentially consistent. We have implemented <b>RELAXER</b> for C and have evaluated it on several synchronization algorithms, concurrent data structures, and parallel applications. <b>RELAXER</b> generates many executions of these benchmarks with violations of sequential consistency, highlighting a number of bugs under relaxed memory models...|$|R

25|$|The {{popularity}} of natural hair has waxed and waned. In the early 21st century, {{a significant percentage}} of African-American women still straighten their hair with <b>relaxers</b> of some kind (either heat- or chemical-based). This is done despite the fact that prolonged application of such chemicals (or heat) can result in overprocessing, breakage and thinning of the hair. Rooks (1996) argues that hair-care products designed to straighten hair, which have been marketed by white-owned companies in African American publications since the 1830s, represent unrealistic and unattainable standards of beauty.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{straightening}} the hair often involved applying caustic substances, such as <b>relaxers</b> containing lye, which {{needed to be}} applied by an experienced hairstylist {{so as to avoid}} burning the scalp and ears. In the late 1890s/early 1900s, Madam C. J. Walker also popularized the use of the hot comb in the United States. Those who chose not to artificially treat their hair would often opt to style it into tight braids or cornrows. With all of these hairstyling methods, one ran the risk of damaging the hair shaft, sometimes resulting in hair loss.|$|E
25|$|After Phil {{is treated}} at a clinic, Alan confesses {{that he had}} drugged some of the marshmallows from the {{previous}} night with muscle <b>relaxers</b> and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him. Phil breaks it up and tells them {{that they have to}} stick together. They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password by the next morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey (who had the code given to him and put inside his jacket for safe-keeping by Chow) back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured. After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is.|$|E
2500|$|Sales of <b>relaxers</b> took a great fall among African-American {{women from}} 2010 to 2015. Many African-American women gave up <b>relaxers</b> {{to go back}} to their natural roots. Celebrities like Esperanza Spalding, Janelle Monáe and Solange Knowles have played with natural hair looks. During the same time period, the number of natural-hair support groups has increased.

2500|$|Cheryl Thompson writes, [...] "In 15th-century Africa, hairstyles {{were used}} to {{indicate}} a person's marital status, age, religion, ethnic identity, wealth and rank within the community (see Byrd & Tharps, 2001; Jacobs-Huey, 2006; Mercer, 1994; Patton, 2006; Rooks, 1996). For young black girls, Thompson says, [...] "hair is not just something to play with" [...] – {{it is something that}} sends a message, not only to the outside public but also a message on how they see themselves. [...] "In the 1800s and early 1900s, nappy, kinky, curly hair was deemed inferior, ugly and unkempt in comparison to the flowing, bouncy hair of people from other cultures," [...] says Marcia Wade Talbert in Black Enterprise. Chemical <b>relaxers</b> increased in demand throughout the 1800s and 1900s. These <b>relaxers</b> often contained sodium hydroxide (lye) or guanidine hydroxide which result in hair breakage, thinning of the hair, slowing of hair growth, scalp damage and even hair loss, according to Gheni Platenurg in the article, [...] "Black Women Returning to Their Natural Hair Roots." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{although}} GHB can {{be detected}} in hair. Hair testing can be a useful tool in court cases or for the victim's own information. Over-the-counter urine test kits only test for date rape drugs that are benzodiazepines, and GHB is not a benzodiazepine. To detect GHB in urine, the sample must be taken within four hours of GHB ingestion, and cannot be tested at home. GHB {{can be detected}} in hair for months after GHB ingestion. Other drugs, such as muscle <b>relaxers</b> (Carisoprodol for example), are sometimes mixed with GHB. Therefore, it can be beneficial to request that the hair sample be tested for multiple drugs.|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{increasing}} {{awareness of the}} potential dangers of sodium hydroxide found in traditional relaxer formulas, many women have begun abandoning them. [...] "No-lye" [...] <b>relaxers</b> have become increasingly popular. [...] "No-lye" [...] <b>relaxers</b> are of three main types. One type operates on the same general principle as lye <b>relaxers</b> but uses a slightly weaker alkaline agent, such as potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, or guanidine hydroxide. The last of these is not pre-formulated, but rather is generated {{at the time of}} use by combining a cream containing calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) with an [...] "activating solution" [...] of guanidine carbonate.|$|E
50|$|Guanidinium {{hydroxide}} is {{the active}} ingredient in some non-lye hair <b>relaxers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thio <b>relaxers</b> use ATG, or {{ammonium}} thioglycolate, {{which is}} also used in permanent waving, but {{at a much higher}} pH and concentration than used in permanent waves. It is usually higher than a pH of 10. These <b>relaxers</b> are also thicker with a higher viscosity, or thickness, which makes for an easier relaxer application. Thio <b>relaxers</b> break the disulfide bonds in hair, similar to the permanent waving process. When enough of the disulfide bonds in the hair are broken, the relaxer is rinsed from the hair and the hair is towel dried. After towel drying, a neutralizer of some sort is applied to the hair.|$|E
5000|$|During the discussion, Rock {{noted that}} many women used hair <b>relaxers</b> to {{straighten}} their hair.

He said that sodium hydroxide, the active ingredient in <b>relaxers,</b> {{is strong enough to}} burn through a soda can if left in the solution for long enough. It can damage women's hair or scalps. Rock pleaded with parents to stop exposing their young daughters to <b>relaxers.</b> He argued they should {{not have to worry about}} such styling questions before becoming teenagers.|$|E

50|$|Other common {{causes of}} hair damage {{include the use}} of <b>relaxers</b> and other harsh chemicals; use of a razor to cut curly hair, which weakens the hair cuticle and {{promotes}} frizz; and harsh shampoos that strip the hair of its natural oils.|$|E
5000|$|Chemicals. A {{condition}} {{known as}} CCCA (central cicatricial centrifugal alopecia), seen {{almost exclusively in}} African American women, can cause extensive hair loss.

Examples of hazardous chemicals found in common treatments (e.g. hair coloring, straightening, perms, <b>relaxers,</b> keratin treatments, Brazilian Blowouts, and nail treatments) include dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde, lye (sodium hydroxide), ammonia, and coal tar. Allergies and dermatitis have forced approximately 20% of hairdressers to stop practicing their profession.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, in most <b>relaxers</b> {{sold for}} home use, the active agents are {{ammonium}} sulfite and ammonium bisulfite (the two compounds are interchangeable, {{depending on the}} surrounding pH).
