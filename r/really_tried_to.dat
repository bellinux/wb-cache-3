Pinkett Smith published her first children's book, Girls Hold Up This World, in 2004. [...] "I wrote the book for Willow and for her friends {{and for all the}} little girls in the world who need affirmation about being female in this pretty much masculine world. I <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> capture different sides of femininity. I want girls in the world to feel powerful, to know they have the power to change the world in any way they wish." ...|$|E

Davies commented in an interview with The New York Times, [...] "It was obvious that this case was going to be controversial pretty much from the start. What we have done is we've <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make sure that we have not directed our fire at anyone in particular." [...] He noted there was a recurring pattern of disputed editing on controversial topics, [...] "One of the problems we keep bumping into is what I call core belief issues — politics, religion, nationalism. Fringe faiths, fringe nationalities." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960, the RAF {{contacted}} Stanley and {{the idea}} of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him: [...] "I didn't immediately want to come. I felt that there would be some sort of... trauma. I'm trying to forget this, you know, I tried so hard... It took years really to eliminate the memories and fears... the long drawn out experience and really waiting for death over three and a half years, it's long time to expect death. And I <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> forget... But of course I was never able to do that." ...|$|E

I don't <b>really</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write songs so much as they just come <b>to</b> me, I <b>really</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write in metaphors, for example, there are songs on the album where the meanings are quite hidden in the metaphors." ...|$|R
500|$|Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear {{began to}} pitch The Rocketeer in 1986 {{to the major}} film studios but were turned down. [...] "This was 1986, long before Batman or Dick Tracy or {{anything}} similar", Stevens explained. [...] "In those days, no studio was interested at all in an expensive comic book movie. We got there about three years too early for our own good!" [...] Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit {{them to make a}} trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, [...] "immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All they really wanted {{at the end of the}} day, was the name".|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E
500|$|It Was Written {{has been}} credited, along with Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995), with helping usher {{in the era}} of the mafioso rap. According to writer Sam Chennault, while the hip hop subgenre would [...] "run out of steam quickly, this release is a gem." [...] Chennault also {{discussed}} the significance of It Was Written during the period of its release, stating [...] "after mastering stark street corner realism on Illmatic, Nas delivered a loose concept album that was, at the time, groundbreaking in its scope, approach and execution." [...] According to rapper Young Noble, a close friend of Tupac Shakur, the song [...] "I Gave You Power" [...] served as the main inspiration for Shakur's [...] "" [...] (1996). American hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco has cited It Was Written as his favorite album and his primary source of inspiration. Fiasco has stated that he based his debut album Food & Liquor (2006) on the conceptual style and [...] "moods" [...] of It Was Written. When asked of his musical influences in an interview with AllHipHop.com, Fiasco stated [...] "You know I <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> go back and recreate [...] It Was Written, you know what I'm saying like that? [...] It Was Written and then I would play my album, and it was like, ‘Do we got [...] record, do we got that record?’" [...] When asked in an interview with NobodySmiling.com about why he is comfortable admitting the album as a source of inspiration, Fiasco stated: ...|$|E

500|$|Supervising {{animator}} Glen Keane designed Rapunzel {{under the}} tutelage of veteran animator Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. Johnston advised Keane to attempt to capture what Rapunzel is thinking as opposed to simply animating what the character is doing after reviewing one of his early pencil tests. Keane compared receiving this advice to receiving a [...] "slap that I never forgot, so when I was drawing over people's work, I <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get into the head of the thinking of the character". Co-director Byron Howard was inspired by the appearance of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), a character who was also animated by Keane. Howard elaborated that [...] "Ariel was the first character that I ever thought there was a soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to". Meanwhile, Keane observed that Ariel and Rapunzel also share [...] "irrepressible" [...] spirits while encountering barriers that prevent them from pursuing their dreams. Keane was inspired by a book about the idea of feminine beauty; the book cited [...] "strangeness" [...] as [...] "the key to beauty ... in a woman's face." [...] Taking this into consideration, Keane maintained a sense of asymmetry while drawing Rapunzel, incorporating into her face several subtle imperfections, specifically her bucked teeth. The character was also drawn with freckles, making her the first Disney princess to have this feature. Keane designed Rapunzel with large eyes in order to convey her [...] "irrepressible quality", a trait her also discovered in Mandy Moore's voice. The animators created nine different versions of Rapunzel before finally settling on a design with which they were satisfied. Although Moore has observed some physical similairites between the character and herself, she maintains that Rapunzel's appearance was developed long before she became involved with the project, dismissing any similarities as [...] "coincidental".|$|E
500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> be faithful to." ...|$|E

[...] For the first time, Mazur {{was included in the}} songwriting process, having not been in the band yet while Gravity was being written. [...] "On this record we <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> write together," [...] Maida says. [...] "It’s easy for me to come in with a song, say here it is, lets go record it and it’ll be done in a couple of days. But when you have to sit in your rehearsal hall and you wait for that magic to happen, well, it doesn’t always happen right away, but that was the M.O. for this record and it worked." ...|$|E

[...] Patrick Fitzgerald responded to this assertion by telling the jury, [...] "You know what? [...] said something here that we're trying to put a cloud on the vice president. We'll talk straight. There is a cloud over the vice president. He sent Libby off to [...] Judith Miller at the St. Regis Hotel. At that meeting, the two-hour meeting, the defendant talked about the wife [...] We didn't put that cloud there. That cloud remains because the defendant obstructed justice and lied about what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stalin was ethnically Georgian, and {{had grown}} up {{speaking}} the Georgian language, only learning Russian when aged eight or nine. Stalin remained proud of his Georgian identity and culture, and throughout his life, he retained his Georgian accent when speaking Russian. According to Montefiore, his adoption of Russian culture has been exaggerated, and he was profoundly Georgian in his lifestyle and personality, spending much of his final years in his homeland. Montefiore was of the view that [...] "after 1917, he became quadri-national: Georgian by nationality, Russian by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship." [...] Service stated that Stalin [...] "would never be Russian", could not credibly pass as one and contrary {{to what has been}} previously suggested, he never <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> be one. Stalin was described as [...] "Asiatic" [...] by his colleagues, and told a Japanese journalist, [...] "I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian". He first adopted the pseudonym [...] "Stalin" [...] in 1912; being based on the Russian word for [...] "steel" [...] it has often been translated as [...] "Man of Steel". Prior nicknames included [...] "Koba", [...] "Soselo", [...] "Ivanov" [...] and many others.|$|E
