25|$|Periodic {{explicit}} object packing: Git stores each {{newly created}} object {{as a separate}} file. Although individually compressed, this takes {{a great deal of}} space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of packs that store a large number of objects in one file (or network byte stream) called packfile, delta-compressed among themselves. Packs are compressed using the heuristic that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (newly added history) are still stored singly, and periodic <b>repacking</b> is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose, but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic <b>repacking</b> automatically but manual <b>repacking</b> is also possible with the git gc command. For data integrity, both packfile and its index have SHA-1 checksum inside, and also the file name of packfile contains a SHA-1 checksum. To check integrity, run the git fsck command.|$|E

From this base, the battalion conducted combined operations with various French forces against the German Afrika Korps in Tunisia. A unit of French Algerian infantry, the 3rd Regiment of Zouaves, was present at Youk-les-Bains and awarded the American paratroopers their own regimental crest {{as a gesture of}} respect. This badge was awarded to the battalion commander on 15 November 1942 by the 3rd Zouaves' regimental commander, and is worn today by all members of the 509th Infantry.|$|E

25|$|P-glycoprotein is a well-studied protein {{associated}} with multi-drug resistance. It {{belongs to the}} human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family and {{is also known as}} ABCB1 or MDR1 Pgp. MDR1 consists of a functional monomer with two transmembrane domains (TMD) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD). This protein can transport mainly cationic or electrically neutral substrates as well as a broad spectrum of amphiphilic substrates. The structure of the full-size ABCB1 monomer was obtained in the presence and absence of nucleotide using electron cryo crystallography. Without the nucleotide, the TMDs are approximately parallel and form a barrel surrounding a central pore, with the opening facing towards the extracellular side of the membrane and closed at the intracellular face. In the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, the TMDs have a substantial reorganization with three clearly segregated domains. A central pore, which is enclosed between the TMDs, is slightly open towards the intracellular face with a gap between two domains allowing access of substrate from the lipid phase. Substantial <b>repacking</b> and possible rotation of the TM helices upon nucleotide binding suggests a helix rotation model for the transport mechanism.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Stephen" [...] was {{directed}} by the production team Skinny. The video was released on the deluxe <b>repacking</b> of her debut album Animal, under its re-release entitled Animal + Cannibal. It was later uploaded to the singer's Vevo account on April 4, 2011. The video is composed of still shots that show the singer [...] "going to some extreme lengths to show 'Stephen' how much she's feeling him." [...] The video opens with the singer looking through a scrapbook; following this the video then proceeds into depicting the singer's interactions with the protagonist. The video's first setting is located at a bar where the singer gets into a verbal altercation with the man's girlfriend. Kesha, who later leaves with the then unconscious man, takes him back to her house to takes pictures of him and later cuts off some of his hair for her shrine. The singer then duct-tapes the man and locks him in her closet; which he later escapes from. Following this, the singer is distraught and then builds another man out of a dummy, and using the hair she had clipped earlier, proceeds to bring the dummy to a bar, getting into another altercation with it and later leaving it in the street – ending the video.|$|E

2500|$|In 1801, David Hartley first {{postulated}} that dreaming altered the associative planetary links within the brain during dreaming periods of dreams. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable {{by the end}} of the 19th century. In ‘Peter and Wendy’, J.M. Barrie wrote [...] ‘It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, <b>repacking</b> into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. …When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.’ The stories of Peter Pan take place in a mental world and contain many allusions to aspects of cognitive psychology, some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Robert Christgau was more {{enthusiastic}} {{in his column}} for Billboard, impressed by Derulo's [...] "command of contemporary hookcraft", even though the songs were about sex gratifying enough to prompt marriage: [...] "I value both sex and matrimony too much to recommend this life strategy. But compared to the predatory Chris Brown of 'Loyal' or the chauvinistic Trey Songz of 'Foreign', he's so exuberant and playful he helps me get why guys and dolls fall for it—even share their thrills some, vicariously." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said that the album appears to be [...] "some post-traumatic stress therapy session mixed with a banging, ultra after-party." [...] Jeffries praised the album's <b>repacking</b> and total repurposing of Tattoos commending the new production on the album stating [...] " [...] gives the album a stripclub number in Ying Yang Twins style where everyone sounds like they're having the proper amount of fun". Christgau named it the sixth best album of 2014 in his year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review.|$|E

Cleaning out the closet becomes the show's plot, inventorying much of the contents along the way: a photo album, a rusty horseshoe, a ten-foot pole. After <b>repacking</b> the closet, Fibber realizes the dictionary has been put away too — and he opens the closet again, causing an avalanche. This episode also features a cameo by Gracie Allen, running for president on the Surprise Party ticket.

2500|$|ABC {{exporters}} have a {{transport mechanism}} {{that is consistent}} with both the alternating-access model and ATP-switch model. In the apo states of exporters, the conformation is inward-facing and the TMDs and NBDs are relatively far apart to accommodate amphiphilic or hydrophobic substrates. For MsbA, in particular, the size of the chamber is large enough to accommodate the sugar groups from lipopolysaccharides (LPS). As has been suggested by several groups, binding of substrate initiates the transport cycle. The [...] "power stroke", that is, ATP binding that induces NBD dimerization and formation of the ATP sandwich, drives the conformational changes in the TMDs. In MsbA, the sugar head groups are sequestered within the chamber during the [...] "power stroke". The cavity is lined with charged and polar residues that are likely solvated creating an energetically unfavorable environment for hydrophobic substrates and energetically favorable for polar moieties in amphiphilic compounds or sugar groups from LPS. Since the lipid cannot be stable {{for a long time in}} the chamber environment, lipid A and other hydrophobic molecules may [...] "flip" [...] into an energetically more favorable position within the outer membrane leaflet. The [...] "flipping" [...] may also be driven by the rigid-body shearing of the TMDs while the hydrophobic tails of the LPS are dragged through the lipid bilayer. <b>Repacking</b> of the helices switches the conformation into an outward-facing state. ATP hydrolysis may widen the periplasmic opening and push the substrate towards the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Hydrolysis of the second ATP molecule and release of Pi separates the NBDs followed by restoration of the resting state, opening the chamber towards the cytoplasm for another cycle.|$|E
