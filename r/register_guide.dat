40|$|Even though null {{definite}} {{objects are}} usually ungrammatical in English, they {{are widely used}} in certain special registers. This paper investigates object drop in the recipe and, to a lesser extent, match broadcasting registers in English, contributing an analysis of a substantial set of naturally occuring data, hence {{making it possible to}} verify observations from previous syntactic studies of the phenomenon, which were based on a restricted array of isolated sentences. Having shown that the data support the assumption that the unrealised object is syntactically active, I propose a novel analysis of missing objects in special <b>registers,</b> <b>guided</b> by recent developments in the generative linguistic theory. Null realisation of the object is considered as an issue of externalisation and intralinguistic variation is attributed to the rules operating at the SM interface which make it possible to extend the application of copy deletion, as assumed within the copy theory of movement...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{tools are}} {{incapable}} of preparing the curved articular surface geometry required during cartilage repair procedures. A novel curved surface preparation technique was proposed and tested to provide an accurate low-cost solution. Three shapes of samples, with flat, 30  mm radius and 60  mm radius surfaces, were manufactured from foam bone substitute for testing. <b>Registering</b> <b>guides</b> and cutting guides were designed and 3 -D printed to fit onto the foam samples. A rotational cutting tool with an adapter was used to prepare the surfaces following the guidance slots in the cutting guides. The accuracies of the positions and shapes of the prepared cavities were measured using a digital calliper, and the surface depth accuracy was measured using a 3 -D scanner. The mean shape and position errors were both approximately ±  0. 5  mm and the mean surface depth error ranged from 0 to 0. 3  mm, range −  0. 3 to +  0. 45  mm 95 % CI.

25|$|Kodiak bear {{research}} and habitat protection is done cooperatively by the ADF and Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. Bear hunting is {{managed by the}} ADF, and hunting regulations are established by the Alaska Board of Game. Currently, a finely tuned management system distributes hunters in 32 different areas during two seasons (spring: April 1 – May 15, and fall: October 25 – November 30). Each year, about 4,500 people apply for the 496 permits offered for Kodiak bear hunts (two-thirds to Alaska residents, one-third to nonresidents). Nonresidents are required to hire a <b>registered</b> <b>guide</b> who is authorized to hunt in a particular area, and this can cost from $10,000–$22,000. All hunters must come into the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office in Kodiak prior to going into the field for a brief orientation and must check out before they leave the island. Every bear that is legally killed on the archipelago must be inspected by an ADF wildlife biologist {{before it can be}} taken from the islands. Pelts receive a stamp from an ADF officer if the hunter and guide provide proper documentation to prove licensing. Pelts cannot be transported or legally preserved or sold without the official stamp. Hunting laws are strictly enforced by the ADF officers who often have the full support of the local community. Illegal hunting and fishing is frowned upon by the community which maintains a healthy respect for the island's environmental laws, as well. Stiff penalties accompany illegal hunting and fishing. The island's remote location makes trafficking in illegal pelts difficult for would-be poachers.|$|R
