50|$|Specific {{procedures}} allow IFR {{aircraft to}} transition safely through {{every stage of}} flight. These procedures specify how an IFR pilot should respond, even {{in the event of}} a complete <b>radio</b> <b>failure,</b> and loss of communications with ATC, including the expected aircraft course and altitude.|$|E
5000|$|Ident {{can also}} be used in case of a {{reported}} or suspected <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> to determine if the failure is only one way and whether the pilot can still transmit or receive, but not both, e.g., [...] "Cessna 123AB, if you read, squawk ident".|$|E

50|$|At {{airports}} {{equipped with}} radar, procedural approaches normally are used {{only in the}} event of an aircraft suffering a <b>radio</b> <b>failure,</b> or for training purposes. At non-radar airports or when radar is not available, these are the only means of IFR flights making approaches to the airport.|$|E
50|$|In North American aviation, a NORDO {{aircraft}} is {{an aircraft}} flying without a radio. While sometimes used to denote small general aviation aircraft {{that are not}} equipped with a radio, the term is more commonly applied to aircraft that have experienced a <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> while flying.|$|E
50|$|In-flight <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> may {{constitute}} an emergency, {{as determined by}} the pilot. Aircraft equipped with a transponder should indicate a NORDO situation by setting the appropriate transponder code: 7600 ("seven-six: hear nix"). NORDO aircraft declaring an emergency are given priority over other aircraft (providing a more serious emergency does not occur on another aircraft).|$|E
2500|$|During the approach, at 5400 meters, {{the course}} mode of the {{autopilot}} disconnected due to <b>radio</b> altimeter <b>failure,</b> but the pilots did not notify ATC about this. They have repeatedly tried to switch it back on, with [...] "increasing nervousness" [...] and cursing. When crossing 4200 meters, the {{flight control computer}} failed too.|$|R
30|$|The <b>radio</b> link <b>failure</b> ratio (RLF) is the {{probability}} that an existing call is dropped before it was finished, if the user moves out of coverage (SINR < - 10 dB for 1 s). It is calculated as {{the ratio of the}} number of RLFs to the number of calls that were accepted by the network.|$|R
25|$|Radio or <b>radio</b> {{navigational aid}} <b>failure</b> was not {{considered}} an issue as the aircraft was flying in daylight and the Azores {{would probably have been}} located without difficulty.|$|R
50|$|The weather at Anchorage is so poor, a United States Air Force ground-controlled {{approach}} specialist (Claude Akins) is called in. His radar shows a small aircraft with <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> that is approaching the same runway, but Flight 502 has too little fuel to go around. O'Hara sees the other aircraft {{at the last}} moment and manages to avoid a collision and land safely.|$|E
50|$|A note on safety: some 'park flyers' (especially small delta-wings) can fly at an appreciable speed. These {{can cause}} injury to passers-by in an accident. Pilots should {{consider}} {{what might happen}} if they lose control or have <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> and fly into a person/dog/car/building; therefore keep at an appropriate distance. The Academy of Model Aeronautics 'recommends' a minimum safe distance of at least 50 feet from any spectators other than the pilot.|$|E
50|$|On 17 December 1965, Douglas C-47B of Skyways Coach-Air (registration: G-AMWX) {{was written}} off when it made an {{emergency}} landing {{on the beach at}} Le Tréport, Seine-Maritime, France. The aircraft was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Beauvais to Gatwick, when it turned back to Beauvais due to <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> shortly before it was scheduled to land at Gatwick. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (three crew and 29 passengers) {{as a result of this}} incident.|$|E
50|$|Another {{case was}} BBC <b>Radio</b> 4's <b>failure</b> to {{broadcast}} Big Ben's midnight chimes on New Year's Day 2003; after the chimes were announced, a technical error caused {{the station to}} fall silent for a minute. This {{was caused by the}} correct feed not being faded up. The chimes were supposed to be coming via a new link which the BBC had installed to Westminster to avoid dead air.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceThe {{research}} in this dissertation involved investigating a novel physical-layer security problem wherein malicious base stations (MBSs) mislead mobile terminals (MTs) into being prematurely handed over to suboptimal target cells, resulting in <b>radio</b> link <b>failure</b> (RLF). The MBSs achieve this by spoofing the common reference signals of legitimate base stations (LBSs), which are used by MTs to measure signal strength...|$|R
50|$|If the <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> {{occurs in}} {{visual flight rules}} (VFR) {{conditions}} {{in an area where}} radio communication is required, the pilot is expected to continue under VFR and land when feasible. If flying under instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions, and VFR conditions exist or are encountered after the failure, the flight should be continued in VFR conditions and the pilot shall land as soon as practicable. If VFR conditions do not exist, the pilot will then continue the route last assigned by ATC. See FAR 91.185.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> or {{aircraft}} not equipped with a radio, or in {{the case of}} a deaf pilot, air traffic control may use a signal lamp to direct the aircraft. The signal lamp has a focused bright beam and is capable of emitting three different colours: red, white and green. These colors may be flashed or steady, and have different meanings to aircraft in flight or on the ground. Planes can acknowledge the instruction by rocking their wings, moving the ailerons if on the ground, or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during hours of darkness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next day}} Unwin claimed his first kill, a Henschel Hs 126. The German pilot had used his slow speed and high {{manoeuvrability}} {{to evade the}} attacks of two fellow pilots, while retreating into Belgian airspace. The order was given {{to give up and}} the squadron turned away. As they did so Unwin saw the German straighten out. Feigning <b>radio</b> <b>failure,</b> Unwin dived on the Hs 126 and [...] "pumped 240 rounds" [...] into it before it burst into flames and crashed. On 1 June Unwin claimed a Messerschmitt Bf 110 and a second as a probable. Unwin then claimed a Heinkel He 111 as a probable.|$|E
50|$|Landing {{lights are}} {{typically}} only useful as visibility aids to the pilots when the aircraft {{is very low}} and close to terrain, as during take-off and landing. Landing lights are usually extinguished in cruise flight, especially if atmospheric conditions are likely to make the lights reflect or glare back {{into the eyes of}} the pilots. However, the brightness of landing lights makes them useful for increasing the visibility of an aircraft to other pilots, and so pilots are often encouraged to keep their landing lights on while below certain altitudes or in crowded airspace. Some aircraft (especially business jets) have lights that— when not needed to directly illuminate the ground—can operate in a flashing mode to enhance visibility to other aircraft. One convention is for commercial aircraft to turn on their landing lights when changing flight levels. Landing lights are sometimes used in emergencies to communicate with ground personnel or other aircraft, especially if other means of communication are not available (<b>radio</b> <b>failures</b> and the like). Additionally, landing lights have at times been installed as a vehicle high beam in the hot rod scene, although this is not legal.|$|R
5000|$|... 27 August 1944: Lieutenant (jg) C. W. Bleicher and {{his crew}} were {{returning}} from a patrol and lost their bearings while en route to base due to <b>radio</b> compass <b>failure.</b> With {{only a few minutes}} of fuel left, the pilot set the Ventura down in shallow water off the beach approximately 70 mi south of Fortaleza, Brazil. Only one crew member was injured in the crash and all exited the aircraft safely. An Army B-25 spotted the wreckage 10 minutes later and the crew was eventually rescued.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{characterize}} {{the relation between}} handover failure and ping-pong rates in a 3 GPP heterogeneous network scenario {{as a function of}} relevant system parameters such as time-to-trigger, user equipment velocity, range expansion bias, etc. Under the assumptions that the picocell coverage and <b>radio</b> link <b>failure</b> areas are circular regions, and that users follow linear trajectories, handover failure and ping-pong rates are derived in closed-form expressions. Simulation results verify the accuracy of our analytical derivations, which shed new light on key aspects of the handover process in a heterogeneous network. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
5000|$|Aviation {{light signals}} {{are used in}} the case of a <b>radio</b> <b>failure,</b> an {{aircraft}} not equipped with a radio, or {{in the case of a}} hearing-impaired pilot. Air traffic controlers have long used signal light guns to direct such aircraft. The light gun's lamp has a focused bright beam capable of emitting three different colors: red, white and green. These colors may be flashing or steady, and provide different instructions to aircraft in flight or on the ground (for example, [...] "cleared to land" [...] or [...] "cleared for takeoff"). Pilots can acknowledge the instructions by wiggling their plane's wings, moving their ailerons if they are on the ground, or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during night time. Only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with Morse code.|$|E
50|$|If the Star Tiger's radio {{had failed}} shortly after 03:15, her captain and {{navigator}} {{would have been}} faced {{with the task of}} locating a small group of islands, measuring 22 mi from northeast to southwest covering a total area of 20 sq mi, and equipped with powerful lights that were visible from about 30 mi at the aircraft's assumed altitude. It was at that time about 340 mi from the islands with enough fuel for 3½ hours' flying time. Having received an accurate bearing, McMillan's task of making landfall was not in itself difficult, except that he was acutely {{aware of the fact that}} there was no alternative airport: the nearest point on the American mainland was Cape Hatteras, 580 mi to the west, and well beyond the Star Tiger's range. However, there was no evidence to suggest that <b>radio</b> <b>failure</b> or navigational error were responsible for the disaster.|$|E
50|$|The OPM {{technology}} {{is based on}} the cognitive networking principles that are advanced from traditional wireless networking by the opportunistic utilization of both spectrum bandwidth and mesh station/radio availability. Traditional wireless networking assumes that those resources can be predetermined, and the protocol stacks from wire-line networks can be re-used. For example, in the traditional stack, the MAC (Media Access Control) layer allocates spectrum resources to wireless links; and the network layer sets up a network routing path from source to destination based on the overall network topology. In large-scale wireless systems, the use of this stack results in a network that is unable to respond to volatile spectrum availability which can be typical in unlicensed bands where interference prevails. In addition, random station/radio availability is also often encountered due to the dynamic traffic load (congestion) and other factors such as <b>radio</b> <b>failure.</b> Bottlenecks along both wireless links and stations are created because the packet forwarding protocol cannot respond quickly to these changes.|$|E
50|$|When the FRT {{threshold}} is breached, the MS is in {{a situation}} where it is essential to relinquish (or abandon) the serving cell and obtain another of at least usable quality. That is to say, the mobile station is aware that the radio signal is decaying rapidly, and must cell reselect rapidly, before communications are terminated because of <b>radio</b> link <b>failure.</b> When the mobile station radio-signal breaches the minimum receive level, the radio is no longer in a position to maintain acceptable communications for the user, and the radio link is broken.|$|R
25|$|In December 2009 and February 2010, Telecom's new XT Mobile Network {{experienced}} high-profile failures {{for many}} customers in locations from Taupo south, {{due to a}} <b>Radio</b> Network Controller <b>failure</b> in Christchurch. As {{a result of the}} loss of service Telecom offered a five million dollar compensation package for its customers.|$|R
30|$|<b>Radio</b> link <b>failure</b> (RLF): The {{connection}} is momentarily lost {{due to the}} bad quality of the air interface during a specific time interval. Unlike call drop, during a RLF, the {{connection is}} not released despite {{the low level of}} SNIR but is saved by either the serving cell or any LTE neighbor throughout the reestablishment procedure [20]. As a consequence, the user experiences service and audio gaps since the RLF occurs until the connection is successfully re-established in any LTE cell. In this scenario, the LTE network is capable of autonomously recover the connection, maintaining the service in LTE.|$|R
