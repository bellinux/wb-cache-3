5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a <b>retrenchment</b> was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the <b>retrenchment</b> was built by the Arabs, {{it has been suggested that}} it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when the threat from the Arabs increased.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Social Plan Guidelines is to manage {{large-scale}} <b>retrenchments</b> and ameliorate their effects on employees. In this study a comprehensive literature review and two case studies were conducted to review the theoretical and practical application of the Social Plan. The research findings identified various challenges that inhibit the effective management of <b>retrenchments.</b> These challenges were analysed and interpreted and a new model to effectively manage <b>retrenchments</b> was developed. The new model is centred on a company’s business plan; the concept is a participative performance-driven governance approach between management and employees focusing on business results. The new model suggests that the employment relations management and corporate social investment of an organisation be utilised as vehicles to manage <b>retrenchments</b> effectively...|$|R

5|$|In 1841, Morehead {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1841 to March 3, 1847. There he was {{chairman}} of the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on <b>Retrenchment.</b> During his service in the Senate, he defended a federal bank bill and opposed the annexation of Texas, though he supported the U.S.-Mexican War after it began. He was also a staunch supporter of fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, the British built Fort Verdala and St. Clement's <b>Retrenchment</b> in the Cottonera area, while Lascaris Battery {{was built}} in Valletta. Later on in the 19th century, parts of the Cottonera Lines, Santa Margherita Lines and the fortifications of Senglea were {{demolished}} {{to make way for}} extensions of the Malta Dockyard. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the British built barracks {{in various parts of the}} island, such as Tigné Point and Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent <b>retrenchment</b> led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 {{government}} <b>retrenchments</b> {{forced him}} out of the civil service and he began work as a sharebroker in New Plymouth. The business was not successful, and he faced bankruptcy proceedings in December 1910 and January 1911 with debts of around £500.|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1980 s, {{economic}} crisis and political upheaval in South Africa generated strikes across the mining, metal, and textile industries, confronting black trade unions with large-scale <b>retrenchments</b> and dismissals.

40|$|A key {{question}} in debates over globalization is {{its effect on}} the welfare states in particular on welfare <b>retrenchments</b> : programmatic retractions of the scope and coverage of social programs. We conceptualize such <b>retrenchments</b> as discrete policy events; and we offer a comprehensive model of their occurrence that integrates domestic economic, political, and institutional factors as well as those related to the global economy. Our analysis of all such <b>retrenchments</b> in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations between 1978 and 1994 indicates that the effects of globalization are complex, with trade openness and financial liberalization clearly operating against such <b>retrenchments</b> but outward foreign direct investment perhaps pressuring for them. In addition, we uncover support for a dynamic of self-limiting immoderation : economic and demographic pressures for costly welfare expenditures provoke actions to roll back eligibility and benefit rates that link increasing numbers of unemployed and retired persons to increased social spending. In short, the same demographic pressures that gave often been noted to substantially drive welfare spending may trigger welfare cutbacks. Our thanks to A. A.

5|$|While Trikoupis {{followed}} {{a policy of}} <b>retrenchment</b> within the established borders of the Greek state, having learned a valuable lesson about the vicissitudes of the Great Powers, his main opponents, the Nationalist Party led by Theodoros Deligiannis, sought to inflame the anti-Turkish feelings of the Greeks at every opportunity. The next opportunity arose in 1885 when Bulgarians rose in revolt in Eastern Rumelia and united the province with Bulgaria. Deligiannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the Treaty of Berlin, so should the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of <b>retrenchment</b> of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E

50|$|Regarding the {{identity}} if the parties, section 197(6)(a) {{states that the}} agreement must be with the same bodies or persons with whom an employer has to consult about <b>retrenchments.</b> As far as the employer is concerned, either the old or the new employer may be the other party to the agreement.|$|R
50|$|The laws {{apply only}} to the {{organised}} sector. Chapter V-B, introduced by an amendment in 1976, requires firms employing 300 or more workers to obtain government permission for layoffs, <b>retrenchments</b> and closures. A further amendment in 1982 (which took effect in 1984) expanded its ambit by reducing the threshold to 100 workers.|$|R

50|$|If {{a bastion}} was {{successfully}} stormed, it {{could provide the}} attackers with a stronghold from which to launch further attacks. Some bastion designs attempted to minimise this problem.

50|$|Smith having {{foreseen}} {{where the}} French would attack had prepared internal defences against the impending assault. The 14 foot sheer drop inside the wall would trap the French from retreating and every house overlooking {{the area was}} loopholed and garrisoned, with <b>retrenchments</b> formed to trap the enemy. All debris was cleared from inside the wall, despite the grape being fired by the besiegers.|$|R
25|$|In 1869, {{he took a}} brief {{leave of}} absence from his {{position}} and returned to England (with his wife) and was present at the death of his brother Charles Sturt who had returned to live in England some 18 years earlier.

25|$|From {{the late}} 7th century onwards, the Mediterranean was being {{threatened}} by Muslim expansion. At this point, the Byzantines probably improved the defences of Malta, {{as can be}} seen by defensive walls built around the monastery at Tas-Silġ around the 8th century. The Byzantines might have also built the <b>retrenchment</b> which reduced Melite to one-third of its original size.|$|E

50|$|It seems {{a foregone}} {{conclusion}} {{that there will be}} further such <b>retrenchments</b> in the coming years, quite likely on a more widespread basis. With trends like these emerging in recent years, the role of the American Theological Library Association (founded 1947) has been of vital importance. The primary function of the association has been to offer coordination and support of theological library activity in the USA and Canada.|$|R
50|$|The present Imperial Palace {{encompasses}} the <b>retrenchments</b> {{of the former}} Edo Castle. The modern palace Kyūden (宮殿) designed for various imperial court functions and receptions {{is located in the}} old Nishinomaru section of the palace grounds. On a much more modest scale, the residence of the current Emperor and empress is located in the Fukiage Gardens. Designed by Japanese architect Shōzō Uchii the modern residence was completed in 1993.|$|R
