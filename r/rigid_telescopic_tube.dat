50|$|The {{launcher}} of the FGR-17 is {{made from}} lightweight fibreglass and resembles many features of its predecessor. It consists of a <b>telescopic</b> <b>tube,</b> much like the M72 LAW {{it is meant to}} replace, and the trigger and firing mechanism does not protrude from the launcher itself, with the trigger placed flush against the tube to allow the weapon to be stowed in a backpack more easily. Unlike the M72 LAW however, the tube does not extend back but forwards from the firing mechanism. Covers at the rear and front of the tube protects the missile from environmental effects such as moisture and dust. Only the rear cover needs to be removed before firing. The FGR-17 uses flip-down aperture sights for targeting, protected by a casing. As the missile tube is extended, the sights are released and flip up.|$|R

25|$|In {{motorcycles}} with <b>telescopic</b> fork <b>tubes,</b> fork offset can {{be implemented}} by either an offset in the triple tree, adding a triple tree rake (usually measured in degrees from 0) to the fork tubes as they mount into the triple tree, {{or a combination of}} the two.

50|$|Wire reticles are {{the oldest}} type of reticles and are {{made out of}} metal wire or thread. They are mounted in an {{optically}} appropriate position in the <b>telescopic</b> sight's <b>tube.</b> Etched reticles are images of the desired reticle layout that are etched on an optic element. This optical element (lens) with the etched reticle is then mounted in the <b>telescopic</b> sights <b>tube</b> as an integrated part of the optics chain of the sight. When backlit through the ocular, a wire reticle will reflect incoming light and not present a fully opaque (black) reticle with high contrast. An etched reticle will stay fully opaque (black) if backlit. Etched reticles are considered by most {{to be a more}} refined solution and offer greater reticle layout flexibility. Because of this, some manufacturers can provide client-designed custom reticles on special order. In the more expensive and high-end contemporary telescopic sights, etched reticles dominate the market. In cheaper telescopic sights, wire reticles are still often mounted to avoid a rather specialized and costly production step.|$|R

40|$|Preclinical {{magnetic}} resonance imaging often requires the entire body of an animal to be imaged with sufficient quality. This is usually performed by combining regions scanned with small coils with high sensitivity or long scans using large coils with low sensitivity. Here, a metamaterial-inspired design employing of a parallel array of wires operating {{on the principle of}} eigenmode hybridization is used to produce a small animal whole-body imaging coil. The coil field distribution responsible for the coil field of view and sensitivity is simulated in an electromagnetic simulation package and the coil geometrical parameters are optimized for the chosen application. A prototype coil is then manufactured and assembled using brass <b>telescopic</b> <b>tubes</b> and copper plates as distributed capacitance, its field distribution is measured experimentally using B 1 + mapping technique and found to be in close correspondence with simulated results. The coil field distribution is found to be suitable for whole-body small animal imaging and coil image quality is compared with a number of commercially available coils by whole-body living mice scanning. Signal to noise measurements in living mice show outstanding coil performance compared to commercially available coils with large receptive fields, and rivaling performance compared to small receptive field and high-sensitivity coils. The coil is deemed suitable for whole-body small animal preclinical applications. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures, 2 table...|$|R
40|$|Long booms or masts are {{frequently}} required on spacecraft {{for a variety}} of purposes, such as supports for solar arrays, as antennas, or to locate experiments remote from the spacecraft environment. Prior to, and during launch, the masts must be stored in a compact form on board the spacecraft. There may also be a need to retract and redeploy masts when in orbit, for example to minimize the angular momentum during changes in the attitude of the spacecraft. A variety of designs of extendable or foldable masts have been developed. Some are based on a series of <b>telescopic</b> <b>tubes,</b> others make use of the de Haviland tube principle consisting of a thin-walled tube of elastic material, split longitudinally, which is opened out flat and coiled for launch. When uncoiled, it reverts to a circular cross-section and in some designs, provision is made for the edges of the split to interlock mechanically to increase the rigidity. The Collapsible Tube Mast (CTM) is a closed tube of lenticular cross-section that can be flattened and then reeled on a drum for storage in a relatively small volume. Collapsible masts made from thin metal sheet were explored in the United States space programme in the 1960 's 1, 2, 3 and steel CTM's were used in the Viking Lander 1 and 2 spacecraft to collect soil samples on Mars in 19764.

25|$|The {{anterior}} median eyes (AME) {{have very}} good vision. This pair of eyes is built like a <b>telescopic</b> <b>tube</b> with a corneal lens {{in the front and}} a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of up to tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the ultraviolet range. As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have evolved a method called image defocus instead. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the first two closest to the surface contain ultraviolet-sensitive pigments while the two deepest contain green-sensitive pigments. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of defocus from the fuzzy layer, it is possible to calculate the distance to the objects in front of them. In addition to receptor cells, also red filters have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. It seems that all salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (for example, Cosmophasis umbratica) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling (Lim & Li, 2005). Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a re-evaluation {{of a case}} study of an instrumented test drift in the Kiirunavaara mine. A 20 m long section of the test drift, located at the 514 m level in the Kiirunavaara mine, was instrumented in 1983, with the objective of studying the interaction of grouted rock bolts and hard rock masses subjected to changes in stresses induced by mining. During the test a large rock wedge was observed in the footwall side of the drift. Borehole extensometers, distometers, <b>telescopic</b> <b>tube</b> extensometers and rockbolts with strain gauges recorded the movement of the rock mass during the whole field measurement time. However, the actual failure process of the large wedge was not addressed in the original study. In this paper, this case was re-evaluated with the aim of increasing knowledge regarding of failure process of a large wedge in terms of deformation. A global-local numerical modeling approach was employed to reproduce the in situ conditions using the finite element program Phase 2 and Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC) software. The global approach was used to calculate the stresses induced during sublevel caving in the mine. The stresses from the global model were applied to the local model which simulated the test drift behavior, and in which geological structures were explicitly modeled. The deformation experienced by the rock mass due to the wedge in the drift was calculated in the local model and compared to the measured deformation in the field. The field measurement results showed that a small fallout occurred at the same location as the large wedge acted as initiator of the large wedge movement. The numerical modeling results showed that the large wedge did not fall out. The large wedge was characterized by shear displacements.

40|$|The flower- or hoverflies (Syrphidae) and {{particularly}} the subfamily Eristalinae, are known by their importance as pollinators in both natural and agro-ecosystems. Similar to other saprophagous eristalines, the larvae of Eristalis Latreille, 1804 are characterized by an elongated anal segment and a <b>telescopic</b> breathing <b>tube.</b> These features have given them the common name of rat-tailed maggots {{and allow them to}} develop in liquid or semi-liquid media loaded with decaying organic material.

Morphological studies are presented based on cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). After comparison with all other known species of the genus Eristalis with described preimaginal morphology, we conclude that main diagnostic character of E. fratercula is the presence of long branched spicules located in the upper margin on the lateral lips. Finally, we provide an updated key that includes the 15 Eristalis species whose third larval stages have already been described...|$|R
60|$|One of this {{singular}} person's {{most remarkable}} peculiarities is his fondness for water, wherein he excels any temperance man whatever. His pleasure, {{it must be}} owned, {{is not so much}} to drink it (in which respect a very moderate quantity will answer his occasions) as to souse himself over head and ears wherever he may meet with it. Perhaps he is a merman, or born of a mermaid's marriage with a mortal, and thus amphibious by hereditary right, like the children which the old river deities, or nymphs of fountains, gave to earthly love. When no cleaner bathing-place happened to be at hand, I have seen the foolish fellow in a horse-pond. Some times he refreshes himself in the trough of a town-pump, without caring what the people think about him. Often, while carefully picking my way along the street after a heavy shower, I have been scandalized to see Monsieur du Miroir, in full dress, paddling from one mud-puddle to another, and plunging into the filthy depths of each. Seldom have I peeped into a well without discerning this ridiculous gentleman at the bottom, whence he gazes up, as through a long <b>telescopic</b> <b>tube,</b> and probably makes discoveries among the stars by daylight. Wandering along lonesome paths or in pathless forests, when I have come to virgin fountains of which it would have been pleasant to deem myself the first discoverer, I have started to find Monsieur du Miroir there before me. The solitude seemed lonelier for his presence. I have leaned from a precipice that frowns over Lake George, which the French call nature's font of sacramental water, and used it in their log-churches here and their cathedrals beyond the sea, and seen him far below in that pure element. At Niagara, too, where I would gladly have forgotten both myself and him, I could not help observing my companion in the smooth water on the very verge of the cataract just above the Table Rock. Were I to reach the sources of the Nile, I should expect to meet him there. Unless he be another Ladurlad, whose garments the depth of ocean could not moisten, it is difficult to conceive how he keeps himself in any decent pickle; though I am bound to confess that his clothes seem always as dry and comfortable as my own. But, as a friend, I could wish that he would not so often expose himself in liquor.|$|R
5000|$|THE OLYMPIA EXHIBITION.THE EXHIBITS.HAMBLE RIVER (HAMBLE RIVER, LUKE AND CO.).UNFORTUNATELY the {{seaplane}} exhibited on this stand was {{not completely}} finished {{at the opening of}} the Show, and the temporary wiring up of the machine was hurriedly done, so that it is to be feared that a great number of the visitors received an unfavourable impression of the quality of workmanship in it. This is much to be regretted since it is the first time the machine has been shown in public and the workmanship is really very good. When one or two minor alterations have been effected and the machine has been properly tuned up, there is little doubt but that it will give a good account of itself.In its general arrangement, the seaplane follows standard practice, being a biplane of the [...] "pusher" [...] type and having two main floats and two tail floats. The upper main plane is straight whilst the lower plane is set at a very pronounced dihedral angle in order to provide ample clearance when the machine is rolling.The two main floats are built up of two skins of cedar, the inner one of which is laid on diagonally over a framework of spruce and rock elm. The floats are divided into watertight compartments by double bulkheads, and a layer of canvas, soaked in varnish, is placed between the two skins. All the chassis struts carrying the floats are steel tubes, and it is intended, we understand, to provide springing of the floats by means of <b>telescopic</b> <b>tubes</b> and coil springs.The cigar-shaped nacelle is of similar construction to that of the floats, and provides accommodation for the pilot and passengers. The seats are arranged tandem fashion, and the pilot controls the machine by means of a single vertical lever and a pivoted foot-bar. In the rear of the nacelle is mounted the engine, a 150 h.p. British N.A.G., which drives directly a Normale propeller.The tail unit is carried on an outrigger consisting of four tail booms of spruce connected by struts of the samematerial. These booms, one gathers, will later be replaced by steel tubes in order to provide a more rigid structure. The undivided elevator is hinged to the trailing edge of a fixed, non-lifting, stabilising plane, under the ends of which are mounted the twin rudders. Two small metal floats support the tail planes when the machine is at rest.|$|R
