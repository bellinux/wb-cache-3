40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-agent system (MAS) to support partner selection in a sustainable supply chain network. With the {{growing awareness of}} environmental and social issues globally, governments and industry have recognized that they have vital roles in supporting and assuring sustainable development. In consideration of these concerns, companies worldwide have begun to adopt sustainability practices in the supply chain. An important issue of sustainability practices is to involve the sustainability considerations into organizational purchasing decision and long term relationships with suppliers. That is, {{in the selection of}} suppliers and outsourcing partners, enterprises should not only consider the general criteria, but also should consider the environmental and social impacts of their partners. Evaluation and selection of partners is a typical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem involving both qualitative and quantitative issues. For the implementation of supply chain sustainability, issues regarding environmental and social responsibility are to be included in partner evaluation, in addition to the conventional criteria such as price, quality, delivery, and service. In this paper, the MAS is established to integrate sustainability concerns into the supply chain partner evaluation and selection process. Autonomous agents are established to represent various parties and functions of the supply chain, for instance, a <b>buyer</b> agent <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> and <b>the</b> potential suppliers are represented by seller agents. <b>The</b> <b>buyer</b> agent has to exchange bids with the seller agents on the multiple criteria repeatedly. The MAS is equipped with suitable negotiation strategies and negotiation protocol to all agents. It supports multilateral negotiation, that is, <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> agent is able to interact with many seller agents concurrently in the bidding process. © IFAC. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Game-theoretic {{models of}} {{bargaining}} are typically {{based on the}} assumption that players have perfect rationality and that they always play an equilibrium strategy. In contrast research research in experimental economics shows that in bargaining between human subjects, participants do not always play the equilibrium strategy. Such agents are said to be boundedly rational. In playing a game against a boundedly rational opponent, a player’s most effective strategy is not the equilibrium strategy, but the one that is the best reply to the opponent’s actual strategy. Against this background, this paper studies the bargaining behaviour of boundedly rational agents byusing genetic algorithms. Since bargaining involves players with different utility functions, we have two subpopulations - one <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer,</b> and <b>the</b> other <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> seller (i. e., the population is asymmetric). We study the competitive co-evolution of strategies in the two subpopulations for an incomplete information setting, and compare the results with those prescribed by game theory. Our analysis leads to two main conclusions. Firstly, our study shows that although each agent in the game-theoretic model has a strategy that is dominant at every period at which it makes a move, the stable state of the evolutionary model does not always match the game-theoretic equilibrium outcome. secondly, as the players mutually adapt to each other’s strategy, the stable outcome depends on the initial population...|$|R
40|$|Until now {{the essence}} of the {{characteristics}} of cooperatives, looked at from various points of view, {{has been the subject of}} many disputes. Today, this situation results from the fact that the main part of the theorical characterization of cooperatives deals with the term "commercial capital". The "commercial capital" of cooperatives is understood to be a commission form of commercial capital, under the state monopoly capitalism. Upon investigating the background of this theory we found the following deficiencies in the methodology of approaches. First, the analysis of agriculture and fisheries commercial capital has been proven insufficient, so that the characterization of "commercial capital" could not be perfect. Secondly, the logic in the presentation of commercial capital's modernization was very little, also, the logic was not sufficient because the presentation of the commercial capital modernization has been explained only from the point of view of the modernization theory as applied to the urban wholesaler. From this study we drew the following conclusions. Under the state monopoly capitalism, the agriculture and fisheries commercial capital has all the modern characteristics of commercial capital. We have concluded that the modernization of the commercial capital of <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> at <b>the</b> landing place is realized by the economic development of small producers. The conclusions lead to the logic that the "commercial capital" of <b>the</b> cooperatives, <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> at <b>the</b> landing place, should be considered as a modern type of commercial capital. This study found that the "commercial capital" of cooperatives does not consist only of the commision merchant type of commercial capital. Finally it has been shown that the "commercial capital" of cooperatives can be viewed as self reliant commercial capital. 協同組合の性格規定,本質規定はこれまで様々な角度から試みられ,それらをめぐってその結果様々な論争がくりひろげられてきた. 今日主流をなしているのが協同組合「商業資本」説である. 協同組合「商業資本」は以下のように理解されている. すなわち,協同組合「商業資本」は"委託売買資本=手数料商人"であり,国独資のもとでは,この形態ゆえに社会的存立を認められているのであるという見解である. この見解が導き出された過程を検討すれば,以下の分析視角が欠落していたことが明らかになった. 一つは農水産物取扱商業資本の検討が十分にされておらず,それら商業資本の性格規定が不満足のものにおわっていることである. 今一つは,それら商業資本の近代化の論理が欠落している点であり,あるいはされている場合でも仲継卸売商業資本の近代化からの説明がなされているだけであり,十分なものではない. これら欠落している点を分析した結果,第一に現段階の農水産物取扱商業資本は近代的性格をもったものとして規定できることが明らかとなった. 第二に,収集卸売商業資本の近代化は小生産者の経済的発展によって成立することも明らかにした. したがって,収集卸売商業資本を代位する協同組合「商業資本」は近代的商業資本として社会的に存立しうるという論理が導かれる. このことは必ずしも協同組合「商業資本」 が全て手数料商人として存立することを意味しない. つまり協同組合「商業資本」は自立的商業資本として運動することもありうるということが理論的に提起されるのである...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper {{examines}} {{the competition between}} buying firms for the supplier’s competitive resources. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine how indirect capabilities – the ability to access external resources – can help in obtaining preferential resource allocation from suppliers. Design/methodology/approach Partial least squares structural equation modeling is used to analyze data of 163 buying firms that assess preferential resource allocation from suppliers. Findings Two indirect capabilities (a buying firm’s selection capability and relational capability) positively influence the firm’s competitive advantage. These relations are significantly mediated by preferential resource allocation of suppliers. The impact of preferential resource allocation appeared stronger for manufacturing firms than for service firms. Research limitations/implications This study’s data set <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer’s</b> assessment of suppliers’ resource allocation. Future research should aim for dyadic data for further validation. In addition, due to sample size limitations, this study’s data does not allow sector segmentation. A larger study that provides insights into segmentation is suggested for future research. Practical implications The results inform managers about the relevance of the competition for supplier resources with rival firms that share suppliers, and the influence of this competition on firm competitiveness. Managers should not only focus on the supplier itself, but also on the capabilities of the supply chain management (SCM) function to recognize and integrate the supplier resources. Originality/value This study adds to the extended resource-based view literature by integrating the notion of supplier resource competition. In addition, the study shows the importance of indirect capabilities for obtaining preferential resource allocation from suppliers. Finally, the authors show the importance of separating between service and manufacturing when examining SCM practices...|$|R

40|$|We study dual {{agency in}} {{residential}} real estate, where <b>the</b> same agent/agency <b>represents</b> both <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> and seller. We assess {{the extent to}} which dual agency suffers from an inherent conflict of interest, where the dual agent furthers the interest of one client {{at the expense of the}} other client’s, as well as principal-agent incentive misalignment where the agent furthers her own interest at the expense of one or both clients. And, we examine how these incentive conflicts affect agent behavior and transaction outcomes. To do so, we analyze 10, 891 residential real estate transactions in Long Island, NY, from 2004 - 2007. Specifically, we (i) identify how dual agency is correlated with house prices and time-to-sale, (ii) describe and assess agent behaviors that could generate these correlations, and (iii) provide some intuition as to the economic effects of prohibiting dual agency in real estate transactions. We find that the incidence of dual agency is uncorrelated with sale price and negatively correlated with time-to-sale. However, on very fast deals, list prices and sale prices are significantly higher on houses sold via dual agency. These findings are consistent with first-resort selling (agents first showing house...|$|R
40|$|The {{sizes of}} modern digital {{libraries}} have grown beyond {{our capacity to}} comprehend manually. Thus we need new tools to help us in organizing and browsing large corpora of text {{that do not require}} manually examining each document. To this end, machine learning researchers have developed topic models, statistical learning algorithms for automatic comprehension of large collections of text. Topic models provide both global and local views of a corpus; they discover topics that run through the corpus and describe each document as a mixture of the discovered topics. In this dissertation, I consider the topic modeling of corpora whose documents are organized in a multi-level hierarchy. My interest in this subject arose from the need to analyze two sprawling, real-world corpora from the field of computer security. The first is a collection of job postings on a crowdsourcing site, where many advertisers seek cheap human labor for different forms of Web service abuse. I view this corpus as a three- layer tree in which an interior node represents a buyer, and children of <b>the</b> interior node <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> postings. <b>The</b> second corpus is a collection of threads from an underground Internet forum, where blackhat operatives discuss tactics for abusive forms of Internet marketing such as spamming and search engine optimization. The subforums and threads in this data set form a five- level deep hierarchy. Using these two data sets as test beds, I develop topic models that incorporate hierarchies in corpora. The models I consider can be viewed as special (finite-dimensional) instances of hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs). For these models I show that there exists a simple variational approximation for probabilistic inference and demonstrate a parallel inference algorithm that can scale to corpora with deep hierarchies and large numbers of documents. On several hierarchical corpora, I show advantages of my topic models over other topic models that do not consider hierarchies. Also I compare my variational method to existing implementations of HDPs and find that my approach is faster than Gibbs sampling and able to learn more predictive models than existing variational method...|$|R
