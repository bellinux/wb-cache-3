5000|$|About 1600 {{it becomes}} clear that the {{northern}} part of the Low Countries is going to win the war against Spain. As expected the number of Geuzen multiplies. Since also prosperity has increased Geuzen medals are very much in demand. The very few issues of 1566 to 1572 are manifold copied by striking or engraving on <b>rolled</b> <b>silver</b> plate and not by casting. Also new types are developed and struck. Early in the 17th century it becomes fashion to attach small beggars’ bowls and flasks to the medal. About 1700 Jonghelincks’ Geuzen medal becomes the most frequently struck, but now with one beggars’ bowl and two flasks attached. That is also the kind of execution of today’s Geuzen medal as award for exceptional merits.|$|E
5000|$|Central nave and choir have double bays {{with six}} {{sections}} each. The pilars at their corners {{are supported by}} flying buttresses (since 1502-'22 only on the southern side). The pilars of the middling ribs, carrying only one fourth (or eighth) of the weight, have none, except of the choir, where they were added as late as in 1911.At Easter 1334 Prince-Archbishop Burchard Grelle claimed to have found the skulls of the Saints Cosmas and Damian. He [...] "personally 'miraculously' retrieved the relics of the holy physicians Cosmas and Damian, which were allegedly immured and forgotten in the quire of the Bremen Cathedral. In celebration of the retrieval Prince-Archbishop and cathedral chapter arranged a feast at Pentecost 1335, when the relics were translated from the wall to a more dignified place." [...] (For the original quotation see the note) Grelle claimed the relics were those Archbishop Adaldag brought from Rome in 965. In about 1400 the cathedral master-builder Johann Hemeling commissioned a shrine for the relics, which has been accomplished until after 1420. The shrine from carved oak wood covered with gilt <b>rolled</b> <b>silver</b> is considered an important mediaeval gold work. In 1649 Bremen's Chapter, meanwhile Lutheran, sold the shrine with the alleged relics to Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria. It is now shown in the Jesuit church of St Michael in Munich.|$|E
50|$|On the medal, 38,5 mm high, is {{presented}} a sword with a “penning” on top between two ears, left a spectacle and flute, right 9 “penningen”. The text reads “EN TOVT FIDELLES AV ROY 1572”. The medal partly struck weakly, the date {{is difficult to}} read. Reverse shows two nobles, one with beggars bowl and flask {{and the other with}} an oversized Geuzen medal. The text reads “IVSQVES A PORTER LA BESASE”. Because of the two texts this medal belongs to the category of Geuzen medals (it was also “reissued” in the 17th century, but struck on <b>rolled</b> <b>silver</b> plate). The symbolism “ears” refers to Alba, who should listen and spectacles is associated with the seize of Den Briel, the last may sound in Dutch as “bril”, i.e. “spectacles”. Although fighting was already fierce, it still lasted 9 years before Philip II in 1581 was no longer acknowledged as sovereign by the “PLACCAERT VAN VERLATINGHE”. The 9 plus one “penningen” relate to the prohibited taxation of the “tiende penning”.The purpose of both medals or tokens, dated 1572, is not clear; were they issued just to commemorate or was their aim also or more to be a token you presented to important friends to show that you belonged to the elite that supported the Geuzen or William of Orange. In view of the difficult economic situation, where there was little room for luxury, the use as token is most likely.|$|E

5000|$|What {{are said}} to be their skulls are venerated in the convent of the Clares in Madrid, where they have been since 1581, the gift of Maria, {{daughter}} of Emperor Charles V. They had previously been removed from Rome to Bremen in the tenth century, and thence to Bamberg. Other skulls said to be theirs were discovered in 1334 by Burchard Grelle, Archbishop of Bremen. He [...] "personally 'miraculously' retrieved the relics of the holy physicians Cosmas and Damian, which were allegedly immured and forgotten in the choir of the Bremen Cathedral. In celebration of the retrieval Archbishop and Chapter arranged a feast at Pentecost 1335, when the relics were translated from the wall to a more dignified place. Grelle claimed the relics were those Archbishop Adaldag brought from Rome in 965. The cathedral master-builder Johann Hemeling made a shrine for the relics, which was finished around 1420. The shrine,made from carved oak wood covered with gilt and <b>rolled</b> <b>silver</b> is considered an important mediaeval gold work. In 1649 Bremen's Chapter, Lutheran by this time, sold the shrine without the heads to Maximilian I of Bavaria. The two heads remained in Bremen and came into the possession of the small Roman Catholic community. They were shown from 1934 to 1968 in the Church of St. Johann and in 1994 they were buried in the crypt. The shrine is now shown in the Jesuit church of St Michael in Munich. At least since 1413 another supposed pair of skulls of the saints has been stored in St Stephens's Cathedral in Vienna. Other relics are claimed by the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice.|$|E
50|$|The medal {{measures}} about 35 mm. The text reads “LIVER TVRCX DAN PAVS” (“Rather Turkish than Papist“) and “EN DESPIT DE LA MES” (“In {{spite of}} the Mass”). Note the “little lobster” emblem between “…PIT” and “DEL…”, the privy mark or “huismerk” of the medal maker. In the 16th century most metal (including gold and silver) items and also good pottery was produced with a privy mark, resulting in later periods in assay marks for silver and gold objects. We {{do not know the}} man (for that period we can exclude females) whose emblem was the “little lobster”. Anyhow, we should not trust “half moons” made out of <b>rolled</b> <b>silver</b> plate by sawing and engraving if they show an engraved “little lobster”. Such work is later, where the maker did not recognise this mark as a privy mark. A faithful silversmith would put his own mark in the proper spot or probably nothing in case of an early specimen. The medal has the reference vL.I 192/190 and the qualification “rare to very rare”. In the Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden this medal is shown in a display on city history, but there is a little silver ring attached to the eyelet, probably meaning that this medal was worn on a silver chain in later days.These medals were also worn by the Sea Beggars at the capture of Den Briel in 1572.The medal itself and its background doubtless is older than 1572. Wearing half moons was already in practice in and around Antwerp by attendants of “hagepreken”, open-air sermons, by Herman Modet. Modet created the slogan “Liever Turks dan paaps” (“Rather Turkish than Papist”), or anyhow was the one who spread it. Some time later he became parson with the Watergeuzen or Sea Beggars and there reintroduced wearing half moons, where in other places it had become out of fashion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Texture {{transition}} in silver {{introduced by the}} addition of 10 at % Pd alloying element was analyzed in this study. Experimental results show that the dependence of rolling texture on rolling reduction in thickness rather than on rolling temperature has been mostly detected, and the recrystallization texture transition process in pure silver is so strongly influenced {{by the addition of}} alloying element palladium that the final stable state of recrystallization texture has been changed from Brass { 011 } orientation to Copper { 112 } orientation. The single cube { 001 } recrystallization texture in warm <b>rolled</b> <b>silver,</b> Brass { 011 } recrystallization texture in room-temperature <b>rolled</b> <b>silver,</b> and Copper { 112 } recrystallization texture in room-temperature rolled or warm rolled Ag- 10 at % Pd alloy have been successfully developed for the fabrication of metallic substrates suitable for high-temperature superconducting tapes...|$|E

40|$|Silver is {{well known}} to be {{thermally}} etched in an oxygen-rich atmosphere and has been extensively studied in the laboratory to understand thermal etching and to limit its effect when this material {{is used as a}} catalyst. Yet, in many industrial applications the surface of <b>rolled</b> <b>silver</b> sheets is used without particular surface preparation. Here, it is shown by combining FIB-tomography, FIB-SIMS and analytical SEM that the kinetics of thermal etch pitting are significantly faster on rolled Ag surfaces than on polished surfaces. This occurs due to range of interacting phenomena including (i) the reaction of subsurface carbon-contamination with dissolved oxygen to form pores that grow to intersect the surface, (ii) surface reconstruction around corrosion pits and surface scratches, and (iii) sublimation at low pressure and high temperature. A method to identify subsurface pores is developed to show that the pores have { 111 } and { 100 } internal facets and may be filled with a gas coming from the chemical reaction of oxygen and carbon contamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} {{evolution and}} mechanical properties of silver generated by equal channel angular pressing and by rolling and asymmetric {{rolling in the}} severe plastic deformation regime is investigated. Experimental investigations are combined with finite element analyses to improve the understanding on strain distribution developed during asymmetric rolling and to evaluate the equivalent strain accumulated after {{a large number of}} passes. The silver samples could be successfully deformed by both processing techniques up to strain values exceeding 8. The ECAP processed materials featured a submicrometer-size equiaxed grain structure with sharp grain boundaries, while symmetric and asymmetric rolling led to subgrain structures with a higher dislocation density at grain interiors and less defined grain boundaries. Accordingly, the tensile properties achieved after the different processing routes differed. In ECAP samples the strength improved at first passes and then showed a plateau for the whole range of imposed strain. In <b>rolled</b> <b>silver,</b> the achieved strength almost continuously improved even at larger strains. The finite element model showed that surface strain effects related to local friction between working rolls and sample surface regions promote an additional deformation, especially in asymmetric rolling, leading to a significant contribution at large plastic strains and generate discrepancies with equivalent strains assessed by continuum theories...|$|E
40|$|This is an Open Access Article (CC-BY 3. 0). It is {{published}} by Elsevier as Open Access at: [URL] tin finishes are widely used in the electronics industry due to their excellent solderability, electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. However, the spontaneous growth of tin whiskers during service can result in localised electrical shorting or other harmful effects. Until recently, the growth of tin whiskers was successfully mitigated by alloying the tin with lead. However, restriction {{in the use of}} lead in electronics as a result of EU legislation (RoHS) has led to renewed interest in finding a successful alternative mitigation strategy. Whisker formation has been investigated for a bright tin electrodeposit to determine whether whisker growth can, at least partially, be mitigated by control of electroplating parameters such as deposition current density and deposit thickness. The influence of substrate material and storage at 55 C/ 85 % humidity on whisker growth have also been investigated. Whisker growth studies indicate that deposition parameters {{have a significant effect on}} both whisker density and whisker morphology. As deposition current density is increased there is a reduction in whisker density and a transition towards the formation of large eruptions rather than potentially more harmful filament whiskers. Increasing the tin coating thickness also results in a reduction in whisker density. Results demonstrate that whisker growth is most prolific from tin deposits on brass, whilst that from tin deposits on <b>rolled</b> <b>silver</b> is greater than that observed for tin deposits on copper...|$|E

40|$|Commercially {{pure silver}} has been {{subjected}} to severe plastic deformation (SPD) by ECAP and by asymmetric cold rolling (ASR). Microstructure evolution as a function of imparted equivalent strain (up to about 8) has been investigated mainly by SEM and TEM. Mechanical properties have also been measured by room-temperature tensile testing. Silver is here selected as a representative FCC metal with a low stacking fault energy featuring high probability of deformation by twinning. Limited information exists on its structure evolution in the ultrafine grain-size range after SPD. Due to its ductility, the silver samples could be successfully deformed by the two processing techniques up to strain values exceeding 8. The ECAP processed materials featured a submicrometer-size equiaxed grain structure with sharp grain boundaries. On the contrary, both symmetric and asymmetric rolling led to a subgrain structure with a higher dislocation density at grain interiors and less defined grain boundaries. The tensile properties achieved after the different processing routes consistently differed. In ECAP samples the strength improved at first passes and then showed a plateau for the whole range of imposed strain here considered. In symmetrically and symmetrically <b>rolled</b> <b>silver,</b> the achieved strength almost continuously improved even at larger strains. An estimate of the work-hardening behaviour over the whole strain range of the silver samples was computed by adding the experienced strain supplied during processing to that experienced during tensile testing. It was confirmed that in the asymmetrically rolled samples, the overall work-hardening behaviour was higher with respect to ECAP samples, at least up to equivalent strains of around 8...|$|E
