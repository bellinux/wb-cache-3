25|$|Firstly, {{there are}} no <b>ramified</b> {{covering}} maps from a curve of lower genus to a curve of higher genus – and thus, since non-constant meromorphic maps of curves are <b>ramified</b> covering spaces, {{there are no}} non-constant meromorphic maps from a curve of lower genus to a curve of higher genus.|$|E

40|$|Applying {{nucleoside}} diphosphatase (NDPase) histochemistry, {{the appearance}} and differentiation of microglial {{cells in the}} developing human cerebral hemispheres were investigated by light and electron microscopy. In the pallium of the 38 days old human embryo, a few round NDPase-positive cells (round cells) were observed in the expanding zone. Although distinct blood vessels had not yet formed within {{the wall of the}} pallium, some cellular elements resembling haemopoietic cells were noticed in the expanding zone. In the 51 days old fetus, blood vessels displaying NDPase activity were seen in the mantle and marginal layers, and some invaded the matrix. Several round NDPase-positive cells were distributed, mainly around the vascular sprouts (primitive blood vessels) in the matrix. In the marginal layer, NDPase-positive cells exhibiting short cytoplasmic processes were encountered (poorly <b>ramifying</b> cells). In the 58, 66 and 82 days old fetuses, the round NDPase-positive cells were seen mainly in the matrix or subcortical layer where vascular sprouts were conspicuous and the poorly <b>ramifying</b> cells were in the subcortical and marginal layers. In the two latter fetuses, NDPase-positive cells showing long highly <b>ramifying</b> cytoplasmic processes (highly <b>ramifying</b> cells) were noted mainly in the marginal layer and sometimes in the subcortical layer. In the 5 months old fetuses, numerous NDPase-positive cells were distributed in the mantle, subcortical and marginal layers, and most of them appeared to belong to the populations of the poorly or highly <b>ramifying</b> cells. On the basis of the ultrastructural features, the round cells and highly <b>ramifying</b> cells were regarded as amoeboid cells and microglial cells, respectively. These findings suggest that at least some amoeboid cells are transformed into microglial cells via the stages of poorly <b>ramifying</b> microglial cells, and also that, in the human cerebral hemispheres, appearance of the microglial elements is closely related with vascularisation, especially in the early developmental stages...|$|R

25|$|In mathematics, the {{discriminant}} of an {{algebraic number}} field is a numerical invariant that, loosely speaking, measures {{the size of}} the (ring of integers of the) algebraic number field.

25|$|Just {{as there}} are various types of manifolds, there are various types of maps of manifolds. In {{addition}} to continuous functions and smooth functions generally, there are maps with special properties. In geometric topology a basic type are embeddings, of which knot theory is a central example, and generalizations such as immersions, submersions, covering spaces, and <b>ramified</b> covering spaces.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, {{named after}} Bernhard Riemann and Adolf Hurwitz, {{describes}} {{the relationship of}} the Euler characteristics of two surfaces when one is a <b>ramified</b> covering of the other. It therefore connects ramification with algebraic topology, in this case. It is a prototype result for many others, and is often applied in the theory of Riemann surfaces (which is its origin) and algebraic curves.|$|E
25|$|The {{discriminant}} of K can {{be referred}} to as the absolute discriminant of K to distinguish it from the relative discriminant of an extension K/L of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of L, and like the absolute discriminant it indicates which primes are <b>ramified</b> in K/L. It is a generalization of the absolute discriminant allowing for L to be bigger than Q; in fact, when L=Q, the relative discriminant of K/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant of K.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein had an {{important}} influence on Russell as he himself discusses in his My Philosophical Development. He led him, for example, to conclude, much to his regret, that mathematical truths were purely tautological truths, however {{it is doubtful that}} Wittgenstein actually held this view, which he discussed in relation to logical truth, since {{it is not clear that}} he was a logicist when he wrote the Tractatus. What is certain is that in 1901 Russell's own reflections on the issues raised by the paradox that takes his name Russell's Paradox, led him to doubt the intuitive certainty of mathematics. This doubt was perhaps Russell's most important 'influence' on mathematics, and was spread throughout the European universities, even as Russell himself laboured (with Alfred North Whitehead) in an attempt to solve the Paradox and related paradoxes, such as Burali-Forti. As Stewart Shapiro explains in his Thinking About Mathematics, Russell's attempts to solve the paradoxes led to the <b>ramified</b> theory of types, which, though it is highly complex and relies on the doubtful axiom of reducibility, actually manages to solve both syntactic and semantic paradoxes at the expense of rendering the logicist project suspect and introducing much complexity in the PM system. Philosopher and logician F.P. Ramsey would later simplify the theory of types arguing that there was no need to solve both semantic and syntactic paradoxes to provide a foundation for mathematics. The philosopher and logician George Boolos discusses the power of the PM system in the preface to his Logic, logic & logic, stating that it is powerful enough to derive most classical mathematics, equating the power of PM to that of Z, a weaker form of set theory than ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory with Choice). In fact, ZFC actually does circumvent Russell's paradox by restricting the comprehension axiom to already existing sets by the use of subset axioms.|$|E
500|$|In computability theory, Putnam {{investigated}} {{the structure of}} the <b>ramified</b> analytical hierarchy, its connection with the constructible hierarchy and its Turing degrees.

2500|$|Much of the {{significance}} of the discriminant {{lies in the fact that}} <b>ramified</b> ultrametric places are all places obtained from factorizations in Qp where p divides the discriminant. [...] This is even true of the polynomial discriminant; however the converse is also true, that if a prime p divides the discriminant, then there is a p-place which ramifies. For this converse the field discriminant is needed. [...] This is the Dedekind discriminant theorem. [...] In the example above, the discriminant of the number field Q(x) with x3nbsp&−nbsp&xnbsp&−nbsp&1 = 0 is −23, and as we have seen the 23-adic place ramifies. [...] The Dedekind discriminant tells us it is the only ultrametric place which does. [...] The other <b>ramified</b> place comes from the absolute value on the complex embedding of F.|$|E
2500|$|In mathematics, Weierstrass's {{elliptic}} {{functions are}} elliptic functions that take a particularly simple form; they are named for Karl Weierstrass. [...] This class of functions are {{also referred to}} as p-functions and generally written using the symbol ℘. The ℘ functions constitute branched double coverings of the Riemann sphere by the torus, <b>ramified</b> at four points. They can be used to parametrize elliptic curves over the complex numbers, thus establishing an equivalence to complex tori. They also yield solutions of the Korteweg–de Vries equation.|$|E
2500|$|To {{construct}} such an isomorphism, {{one needs}} to consider the group L2(5) as a Galois group of a Galois cover a5: X(5) → X(1) = P1, where X(N) is [...] a modular curve of level N. This cover is <b>ramified</b> at 12 points. The modular curve X(5) has genus 0 and is isomorphic to a sphere over the field of complex numbers, and then the action of L2(5) on these 12 points becomes the symmetry group of an icosahedron. One then needs to consider {{the action of the}} symmetry group of icosahedron on the five associated tetrahedra.|$|E

2500|$|Further, codimension 0 immersions do not {{behave like}} other immersions, which are largely {{determined}} by the stable normal bundle: in codimension 0 one has issues of fundamental class and cover spaces. For instance, there is no codimension 0 immersion , despite the circle being parallelizable, which can be proven because the line has no fundamental class, so one does not get the required map on top cohomology. Alternatively, this is by invariance of domain. Similarly, although S3 and the 3-torus T3 are both parallelizable, there is no immersion [...] – any such cover {{would have to be}} <b>ramified</b> at some points, since the sphere is simply connected.|$|E
2500|$|Frege's {{construction}} was flawed. Russell discovered that Basic Law V is inconsistent (this is Russell's paradox). Frege abandoned his logicist program soon after this, {{but it was}} continued by Russell and Whitehead. They attributed the paradox to [...] "vicious circularity" [...] and built up what they called <b>ramified</b> type theory to deal with it. In this system, they were eventually able to build up much of modern mathematics but in an altered, and excessively complex form (for example, there were different natural numbers in each type, and there were infinitely many types). They also had to make several compromises {{in order to develop}} so much of mathematics, such as an [...] "axiom of reducibility". Even Russell said that this axiom did not really belong to logic.|$|E

[...] The breach of his parliamentary immunity degenerated into a national embarrassment, prompting the collective resignation of Ion Ghica's Wallachian cabinet. He retook his seat in the 1861 race. This came shortly after violent riots in Craiova, which, Știrbei argued, called for a parliamentary inquiry.
