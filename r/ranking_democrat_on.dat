5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the <b>ranking</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>on</b> the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee.

Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E
