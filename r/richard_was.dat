He trained with the Astros and the Texas Southern University team, participating regularly in pitching and batting practice with both {{towards the end of the}} baseball season. After pitching in a few simulated games, <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> placed on the 40-man active roster on September 1, 1981. Astros manager Bill Virdon thought <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> not ready to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of William's {{background}} or family, except that his father Godwin held land in Shipbourne, near Wrotham in Kent, perhaps as a vassal of the Archbishops of Canterbury. William's brother <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> named as William's deputy in 1207.|$|E

5|$|<b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> {{reduced to}} a figurehead with little power. As {{a result of the}} Merciless Parliament, de Vere and Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk, who had fled abroad, were sentenced to death in their absence. Alexander Neville, Archbishop of York, had all his {{possessions}} confiscated. Several of Richard's council were executed.

Bolingbroke and Mowbray were exiled.|$|E

5|$|When <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> {{held for}} ransom in Germany while {{returning}} from crusade, Savaric {{met with his}} cousin the Emperor Henry VI {{in an attempt to}} secure Richard's release. He remained in Germany throughout 1193 and continued {{to be involved in the}} negotiations, until he returned to England at the end of the year. Once <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> released, Savaric was one of the hostages left behind in Germany to ensure the payment of the remainder of the ransom. It may have been while he was in Germany negotiating about Richard's ransom that he was named imperial chancellor of Burgundy, but as he was not named by that title until 1197, the exact date of his occupation of the office is unclear.|$|E
5|$|A. Keene <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} American {{known to have}} {{specifically}} bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which he crossed on Thoroughbreds, and also bred purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the Civil War and have no known purebred Arabian descendants today. Another major U.S. political figure, William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859, prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After leaving high school, <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> {{selected}} by the Astros as the second pick {{in the first round}} of the 1969 amateur draft. From the time he made his major league debut with the Astros in 1971 until 1975, Richard had a limited role as an Astros pitcher, throwing no more than 72 innings in a season. In 1975, Richard played his first full season in the majors as a starting pitcher.|$|E

50|$|<b>Richards</b> <b>was</b> a {{close friend}} of the {{journalist}} and art critic Robbie Ross, who like <b>Richards</b> <b>was</b> a Canadian living in England. Ross was {{a close friend}} of Oscar Wilde, and was his literary executor.|$|R
5|$|Boston police {{attempted}} to arrest Richard {{in the dressing}} room after the game ended, but were turned back by Canadiens players who barred the door, preventing any arrest. Bruins management finally persuaded the officers to leave with a promise that the NHL would handle the issue. <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> never arrested for the incident. He was instead sent to the hospital by team doctors after complaining of headaches and stomach pains.|$|E
5|$|During 1191 the {{citizens}} of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199. In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard. Prince John, however, hearing that <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle, which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> going to be freed, he left England and went to France.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th century, a folktale {{developed}} in which Richard’s minstrel Blondel roamed (singing a song {{known only to}} him and Richard) to find Richard's prison. This story was the foundation of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and inspired the opening of Richard Thorpe's film version of Ivanhoe. Sixteenth-century tales of Robin Hood began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of Richard the Lionheart; Robin became an outlaw {{during the reign of}} Richard's evil brother, John, while <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> fighting in the Third Crusade.|$|E
50|$|<b>Richards</b> <b>was</b> born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was {{the brother}} of Stephen L Richards, who would become an apostle in the LDS Church, and the {{grandson}} of Willard <b>Richards,</b> who <b>was</b> also an apostle. From 1908 to 1910, <b>Richards</b> <b>was</b> a missionary for the LDS Church in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|One of his brothers, William Buell <b>Richards,</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Another, Albert Norton <b>Richards,</b> <b>was</b> {{a member of}} the Canadian House of Commons and Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Richards</b> <b>is</b> a Chelsea supporter, {{but would}} often watch Fulham {{as a child}} due to his father and youth coach. As a child, <b>Richards</b> <b>was</b> nicknamed 'Duffer' due to a {{similarity}} in appearance to Damien Duff.|$|R
5|$|Juskalian {{was flown}} to Paris, France, where he {{presented}} himself {{at a military}} post and requested financial assistance. However, {{he did not have}} official identification and was refused. An officer, who knew George's older brother Richard (Dikran), who lived in Watertown, overheard him and recognized the last name Juskalian. George confirmed that <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> his brother, and he was then given all the provisions he needed.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp governed England while <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> on the Third Crusade, but his {{authority}} was challenged by Richard's brother, John, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England. Longchamp's {{relations with the}} other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to the demands for his exile. Soon after Longchamp's departure from England, <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard's release. Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard's return to England, he lost much of his former power. He aroused {{a great deal of}} hostility among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop's death in 1197. Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which remained well known throughout the later Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{attempted}} {{to influence the}} outcomes of the elections in the Holy Roman Empire, which would appoint a new King of the Romans. When the more prominent German candidates failed to gain traction, Henry began to back his brother Richard's candidature, giving donations to his potential supporters in the Empire. <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned the Holy Roman Emperor, but continued {{to play a major}} role in English politics. His election faced a mixed response in England; <b>Richard</b> <b>was</b> believed to provide moderate, sensible counsel and his presence was missed by the English barons, but he also faced criticism, probably incorrectly, for funding his German campaign at England's expense. Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France, the two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully; for Henry, a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade.|$|E
50|$|Mary's husband, Captain Joseph <b>Richards,</b> <b>was</b> also born in Liverpool, in 1838; he {{was also}} from an Irish Catholic family. He and his father John <b>Richards</b> <b>were</b> both Merchant Navy captains, and his mother Catherine Richards came from a mariner family.|$|R
