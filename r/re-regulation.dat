500|$|Instead, Stabæk started {{negotiating}} with IT Fornebu {{to take over}} a lot they owned. They needed a [...] lot which would have a market value of between NOK60 and 80 million, and Reinsfelt stated that the municipality was willing to help by [...] "maneuver in gray areas within the margins". The club was further pressured by NFF, who were going to limit the exceptions allowed for Nadderud and other stadiums not meeting their criteria. On 29 October, FB and Stabæk signed an agreement whereby Stabæk received a free lot and NOK50 million, in exchange for FB taking over the commercial properties. The condition was that the municipality allowed a more dense use of the rest of FB's area. This would require a <b>re-regulation</b> of the area, and Reinsfelt estimated {{that it would not be}} possible for construction to start until 2006. In November, UEFA changed the rules for artificial turf to state that it had to be green. Until Stabæk's proposal was made, UEFA had not though that anyone would build a pitch with a non-green turf, and representatives stated that it was because of Stabæk the rule change was made. The plans were nearly terminated in October 2006, after discussion about the planned Fornebu Line—a people mover which would connect Fornebu to Lysaker—stopped the regulation plan. However, in November the final permissions were granted by Bærum Municipality. On 22 December, Stabæk announced that the financing was secured.|$|E
500|$|The three dams, Rogers, Hardy, and Croton (all {{owned and}} {{operated}} by Consumers Energy), are operated in different modes but in concert give a net run of river effect on water flow. The Rogers itself has little or no impoundment and runs in run of river mode, passing through as much water as it receives. The Croton and Hardy work in concert. The Hardy, which has a larger capacity reservoir, larger turbines, and is upstream of the Croton, runs in full peaking mode, meaning that the river flow is impounded and used to generate electricity during peak demand periods. This causes wide fluctuations in water flows and reservoir levels, typically with low outflow during the night when power demand is lowest. Full peaking was once very common but because of the outflow fluctuations, is now less common. However, with the Croton immediately downstream, and with no river segment (the Croton impoundment stretches back to the Hardy outlet), it can be run in <b>re-regulation</b> mode, allowing a natural flow rate to exit. The Croton reservoir level fluctuates inversely with the Hardy, rising during the day and lowering at night. Since the Hardy reservoir is so large, its reservoir level fluctuates about [...] in total, while the Croton reservoir fluctuates about [...] During the winter and spring runoff, the Hardy is allowed to fluctuate much more. It can be drawn down up to [...] to meet winter power demand but is required to return to normal levels by the end of April each spring.|$|E

40|$|Broad {{deployment}} {{of renewable energy}} (RE) technologies is a primary objective of the European climate strategy. All European member states developed policy strategies and financial support mechanisms for renewable electricity. However, apart from the remuneration scheme, non-economic and regulatory factors influence market diffusion of RE-technologies. Diffusion results from decisions of individual actors and their perceptions of market attractiveness. Therefore, understanding the basic determinants governing their decisions is crucial to anticipate diffusion processes under given framework conditions and to develop policy tools pinpointing the essential factors and enabling RE-deployment cost- and time-efficiently. We propose a robust set of determinants for RE-diffusion and suggest respective data sources allowing for objective assessment of framework conditions on country level. Results are based on literature research, interviews and expert workshops. They are utilisable as input for construction of benchmarking tools (composite indicators) and energy economic modelling (diffusion models) and provide a sound basis for evaluation of <b>RE-regulations</b> and efficient policy design...|$|R

By the year 2009, market reforms and <b>re-regulations</b> allowed private companies to enter the pharmacy market.

The purpose of this thesis was to examine how competition affects market-entry decisions.

Conversely, the effect of competition on market-exit was also addressed. Using yearly data on municipality level, the sample incorporates all 290 Swedish municipalities, of which 287 were examined. The excluded municipalities are Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö. The main estimations were made by means of Poisson regressions. Additionally, all estimations were also regressed using the Negative Binomial method.

In fact, the process took much longer and the freedom of services implemented in the early 1990 s affected professional services in various forms and different degrees. Business consulting is an industry with a tradition of rather low degree of market regulation in all European countries. However, it is indirectly affected by a high level of regulation in neighbouring fields of business services and in some of the fields where they have developed special consulting expertise. As a consequence <b>re-regulations</b> of these branches do have an impact on the consultants' business as well. There is a wide agreement in the political and scientific debates over the shift of decision making arenas and powers from the national to the supranational and from the public to the private sector. We argue that business asso-ciations and large companies can be regarded as co-responsible for the increasing impact of supranational institutions on the sectoral governance.

Apoteket AB was before the <b>re-regulation</b> a monopolistic company but {{was due to the}} <b>re-regulation</b> partly sold. New pharmacies were established on the market and therefore Apoteket AB was exposed to free competition. This thesis is about how the management control systems have been affected by the <b>re-regulation.</b> Research Problem: When former monopolistic companies are exposed to free competition, the management control systems are affected. Companies that never have thought about competition now have to prepare for competitors and focus on keeping their customers. How does the management control systems changes when a monopoly market is exposed to competition? Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe and analyze how the <b>re-regulation</b> of the pharmacy market has affected the management control systems in Apoteket AB. Methodology: Through a qualitative case study, this thesis is based on five interviews with employees at different positions in Apoteket AB.
