25|$|Correct potato {{husbandry}} can be {{an arduous}} task in some circumstances. Good ground preparation, harrowing, plowing, and rolling are always needed, along with a little grace from the weather and {{a good source of}} water. Three successive plowings, with associated harrowing and rolling, are desirable before planting. Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are 'rogued' in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.|$|E
2500|$|Chisel plows are {{becoming}} more popular as a primary tillage tool in <b>row</b> <b>crop</b> farming areas. Basically the chisel plow is a very heavy duty field cultivator intended to operate at depths from 15cm [...] {{to as much as}} 46cm [...] However some models may run much deeper. Each of the individual ploughs, or shanks, are typically set from nine inches (229mm) to twelve inches (305mm) apart. Such a plough can encounter significant soil drag, consequently a tractor of sufficient power and good traction is required. When planning to plough with a chisel plough it is important to bear in mind that 10 to 20 horsepower (7.5 to 15kW) per shank will be required, depending on depth.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} about pesticide use and a steadily increasing conversion to organic farming have been major factors driving research in physical and cultural weed control methods in Europe. This paper reviews {{some of the}} major results achieved with non-chemical methods and strategies especially adapted for <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> (e. g. corn, sugar beet, onion, leek, and carrot) and small grain cereals (e. g. barley and wheat). In <b>row</b> <b>crops,</b> intra-row weeds constitute a major challenge and research has mainly aimed at replacing laborious hand weeding with mechanization. A number of investigations have focussed on optimising the use of thermal and mechanical weeding methods against intra-row weeds, such as flaming, harrowing, brush weeding, hoeing, torsion weeding and finger weeding. And new methods are now under investigation such as robotic weeding for <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> with abundant spacing between individual plants and band-steaming for <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> developing dense crop stands. The strategic use of mechanical weed control methods in small grain cereals has been another area of considerable interest. Weed harrowing and inter-row hoeing provide promising results when {{they are part of a}} strategy that also involves cultural methods such as fertiliser placement, variety choice, crop seed vigour, and crop seeding rate. Positive interactions between preventive and cultural factors and direct physical methods have been less pronounced in <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> Although research in preventive, cultural, and physical methods have improved weed control in <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> and small grain cereals, effective long-term weed management in low-external input and organic systems can only be achieved by tackling the problem in a wider context, i. e. at the cropping system level. Basic principles of this approach, examples of cover crop and intercropping use for weed suppression, and an application in a two-year rotation are presented and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of perennial cellulosic feedstocks for bioenergy presents {{the potential to}} diversify regional economies and the national energy supply, while also serving as climate ‘regulators’ due {{to a number of}} biogeochemical and biogeophysical differences relative to <b>row</b> <b>crops.</b> Numerous observational and model-based approaches have investigated biogeochemical trade-offs, such as increased carbon sequestration and increased water use, associated with growing cellulosic feedstocks. A less understood aspect is the biogeophysical changes associated with the difference in albedo (a), which could alter the local energy balance and cause local to regional cooling several times larger than that associated with offsetting carbon. Here, we established paired fields of Miscanthus 9 giganteus (miscanthus) and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), two of the leading perennial cellulosic feedstock candidates, and traditional annual <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> in the highly productive ‘Corn-belt’. Our results show that miscanthus did and switchgrass did not have an overall higher a than current <b>row</b> <b>crops,</b> but a strong seasonal pattern existed. Both perennials had consistently higher growing season a than <b>row</b> <b>crops</b> and winter a did not differ. The lack of observed differences in winter a, however, masked an interaction between snow cover and species differences, with the perennial species, compared with the <b>row</b> <b>crops,</b> having a higher a when snow was absent and a much lower a when snow was present. Overall, these changes resulted in an average net reduction in annual absorbed energy of about 5 W m - 2 for switchgrass and about 8 W m - 2 for miscanthus relative to annual crops. Therefore, the conversion from annual <b>row</b> to perennial <b>crops</b> alters the radiative balance of the surface via changes in a and could lead to regional cooling...|$|R
