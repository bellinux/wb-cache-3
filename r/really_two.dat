The most conspicuous is that of the Miller family, descended from church builder Thomas Tompkins Miller, located a short distance south of the church. It has a tall obelisk to Miller himself {{in the middle of a}} small area delineated by a tasseled iron railing on stone posts. The other plot is located due west of the church. It has some smaller monuments and family plots marked off by iron railings less elaborate than the Millers'.|$|E
25|$|Wicker Tilts and wheel was <b>really</b> <b>two</b> works, a {{grinding}} wheel {{known to have}} been working in 1581, and a tilt forge built in the 1740s. A second tilt was added near Lady's Bridge by 1752. The grinding wheel, which supplied 36 troughs, was replaced by a wire mill in the 1870s, and was still using water power in 1895, by which time the tilts were using steam power. The weir was close to Lady's Bridge, and the head goit flowed through one of the arches of the bridge. It is thought that there are several goits in culverts near Blonk Street, but their exact extent is unknown. The culverted Porter Brook joins the River Sheaf, which is also culverted, below Sheffield Railway Station, and the combined flows join the Don between Lady's Bridge and Blonk Street bridge.|$|E

I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are <b>really</b> <b>two</b> discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E

For in truth there are <b>really</b> <b>two</b> kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute.

500|$|Liverpool captain Rush {{collected}} the trophy from the Royal box at Wembley Stadium. Liverpool's victory meant Rush won {{the competition for}} the fifth time in his career, which is a record. McManaman was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as man of the match. McManaman praised the performance of the Bolton players: [...] "Give Bolton their due, they battled {{back in the second half}} like we knew they would but it was a great team effort by our lads and I was just happy to get two goals like that." [...] Liverpool manager Roy Evans praised the performance of McManaman stating: [...] "The two goals were fantastic. Sometimes he does need a kick up the backside, but they were <b>really</b> <b>two</b> great goals." [...] Evans was also delighted to have won his first trophy as Liverpool manager: [...] "We believed that we've always had a decent squad with players of outstanding ability. The way the lads have worked this season is outstanding. This cup is the first step. We are in Europe and we are delighted." ...|$|E
500|$|Early {{concepts}} for {{the film}} called for a [...] "fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied" [...] Queen. However, Walt Disney became concerned that such an approach would make the character seem less plausible. Sensing that more time was needed {{for the development of}} the Queen, he advised that attention be paid exclusively to [...] "scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear." [...] Disney further developed the main plot himself (Ollie Johnston said the film's story was based on the idea that the Queen's character was going to murder [...] "another drawing" [...] and Disney decided to make it appear believable), finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, whom he envisioned as a mixture of Lady Macbeth and the Big Bad Wolf, and decided to set on [...] "a high collar stately beautiful type" [...] whose [...] "beauty is sinister, mature, plenty of curves – she becomes ugly and menacing when scheming." [...] According to the 1993 Disney Classics series of trading cards, [...] "she is <b>really</b> <b>two</b> characters, the beautiful evil Queen and the grotesquely evil witch." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Plain Dealer, Susan Glaser {{wrote that}} the museum [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>two</b> museums in one: Its {{historical}} exhibits encompasses about 60 percent of the gallery space, while cultural exhibits take up the other 40 percent."

[...] She describes 14-year-old Till, who was lynched for allegedly whistling at a white woman: [...] "Though his body was severely disfigured, his mother insisted on an open casket at his funeral, hoping to show the world the effects of racial injustice. It helped ignite the civil rights movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some philosophers' {{views are}} {{difficult}} to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, Ted Honderich holds the view that [...] "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" [...] and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or {{things that can be}} located in space and time, but are abstract entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are <b>really</b> <b>two</b> notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The [...] "new" [...] problem is how to resolve this conflict.|$|E

2500|$|During early rugby union games {{there were}} only <b>really</b> <b>two</b> positions; most players were in the forwards, who formed part of the {{scrimmage}} (which later was called [...] "scrummage" [...] and then [...] "scrum"), and a few defensive [...] "tends" [...] (from [...] "goaltenders"). Eventually, the attacking possibilities of playing close behind the scrimmage were recognised. The players who stationed themselves between the forwards and tends became known as [...] "half-tends". Later, {{it was observed that}} the players outside scrimmage were not limited to a defensive role, so the tends and half-tends were renamed [...] "backs" [...] and [...] "half-backs". As the game became more sophisticated, the backs positioned at different depths behind the forwards. They were further differentiated into half-backs, three-quarter-backs, and full-back. Specialised roles for the scrum also evolved with [...] "wing-forward" [...] (modern day flankers) being employed to protect the half-back. The first international between England and Scotland was played in 1871 and consisted of twenty players on each side: thirteen forwards, three half-backs, one three-quarter and three full-backs. The player numbers were reduced to fifteen in 1877. Numbers were added to the backs of players' jerseys in the 1920s, initially as a way for coaches and selectors to rate individual players.|$|E
2500|$|Publicly, Shaker Heights {{is served}} by the Shaker Heights City School District, a K-12 {{district}} with an enrollment of about 5,600 students in eight total schools. [...] There are five lower elementary schools, Fernway, Mercer, Boulevard, Lomond and Onaway; an upper elementary school, Woodbury Elementary School; Shaker Heights Middle School; and Shaker Heights High School. The district estimates that roughly 90% of Shaker graduates attend college, and has been recognized for its efforts to increase neighborhood integration. In the 1950s, {{the public school system}} was rated in the top ten nationally. In recent years, however, the school district is no longer top rated. According to the 2007-2008 State of Ohio Report Card, Shaker scored 97.1 out of a possible 120. The district is listed as [...] "Effective," [...] the third tier on a 6 tier scale. On the other hand, since 1995, 9-17% of seniors at Shaker Heights High School have been recipients of National Merit Scholarship awards, and in 2008, the high school had twice as many National Merit Scholarship winners as any other public school in the state. This can possibly be explained in a 2009 survey of the school, which said that Shaker Heights High School [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>two</b> schools – one school with students in an outstanding Advanced Placement program and one school with students with academic needs." ...|$|E
