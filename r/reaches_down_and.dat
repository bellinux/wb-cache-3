And he <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pulls a leg out of the checker table. 'I'll go through this Trimble outfit,' says he, 'like a cottontail through a brush corral. I'm not pestered any more {{with a desire to}} engage in rucuses, but I got to be home by seven. You lock the door after me, Buck. And don't you forget--I won three out of them five games. I'd play longer, but Mariana--' ...|$|E
5000|$|Known as [...] "la mecedora" [...] in Mexico. The {{opponent}} is {{face down on}} the mat, with the attacker bending both of their legs up and tucking their ankles against his armpits. He then <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> grabs both of the opponent's arms before sitting down, [...] "rocking" [...] back and forth and stretching the back.|$|E
50|$|The attacking wrestler {{stands over}} a face down opponent, {{facing the same}} direction. The wrestler first hooks each of the opponent's legs {{underneath}} his own armpits as if performing a reverse Boston crab, the wrestler then <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> underneath the opponent's chin with both hands applying a chinlock, finally leaning back to pull up the opponent's head and neck.|$|E
50|$|<b>And</b> Ernie will <b>reach</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{catch the}} egg.|$|R

5000|$|The police {{investigated}} the Atherstone Hunt following video evidence of hounds chasing and killing a fox near Grendon, Warwickshire on 14th November 2015, which {{was taken by}} local animal rights activists of the West Midlands Hunt Saboteurs.The video footage shows the dogs chase a fox across a field. As the hounds tear into the fox with their teeth, {{a member of the}} hunt <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pulls the lifeless body of the animal from underneath the pack and slings it over the front of a colleague’s horse.|$|E
50|$|After {{returning}} to Moonbase, Koenig and company solemnly await the collision. When the two Moons touch, {{they create a}} space-time schism—returning both to {{the chaos of the}} anomaly. There, the Moons merge to form a single Moon. Once complete, everything vanishes in a burst of white light—which fades as the Alphans awaken to find they are again in a different part of space. Carter wonders if the other Alphans also survived. As Koenig questions if they ever really existed, Helena <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> retrieves something that had fallen to the floor...a bouquet of roses given to her by Earth Bergman from his garden.|$|E
50|$|Alexis sees Daniel and Betty {{running down}} the street to the {{printers}} and as they sprint side by side toward the entrance, Alexis wins in the end. Daniel later runs into Betty at a bar and tells her that if Alexis wants the company, then she can have it and he will be only too glad to return to his old lifestyle of partying and unemployment. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina sits in her office and thinks of a plan, so she <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> scratches out her own last name on her stationery and writes Meade in its place, then dolls up and heads over to see Bradford, where she offers him a little dinner and some company.|$|E
60|$|Swiftly but silently the man <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> hauled Eliphalet to the {{sidewalk}} by the nape of the neck.|$|R

50|$|The {{final scene}} of the video shows Jeremy striding into class, tossing an apple to the teacher, and {{standing}} before his classmates. He <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> draws back his arm as he takes a gun {{out of his pocket}} (The gun only appears onscreen in the unedited version of the video). The edited version cuts to an extreme close-up of Jeremy's face as he puts the barrel of the gun in his mouth, closes his eyes, and pulls the trigger. After a flash of light the screen turns black. The next shot is a pan across the classroom, showing Jeremy's blood-spattered classmates, all completely still, recoiling in horror. The video ends on a shot of a dangling blackboard, on which all the harsh terms and phrases seen earlier had been scrawled.|$|E
5000|$|Mumm-Ra gloats as {{he holds}} up the sword as Adam remains impaled on it, saying he can sense all evil {{as well as a}} lack of evil. Adam’s lack of it was the beacon that allowed Mumm-Ra to find him and probe his mind to take a form Adam trusted to give up the sword. Adam manages to grip the sword and summon the power of Grayskull to {{transform}} into He-Man, healing his wounds. Mumm-Ra and He-Man battle as Mumm-Ra uses the sword against both He-Man and Cringer. Just as He-Man gets the upper hand Mumm-Ra vanishes in a flash of light. He reappears in a dark corridor and hears the Ancient Spirts of Evil speaking to someone. The Spirits say that both the sword and Mumm-Ra are his to do with what he pleases as long as he fulfills his end of the bargain. Before Mumm-Ra can react he is blasted to dust and Skeletor <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> picks up the Power Sword telling the Spirits they have a deal.|$|E
5000|$|When the steer wrestler {{is ready}} he [...] "calls" [...] for the steer by {{nodding his head}} and the chute man trips a lever opening the doors. The {{suddenly}} freed steer breaks out running, shadowed by the hazer. When the steer reaches {{the end of his}} rope, it pops off and simultaneously releases the barrier for the steer wrestler. The steer wrestler attempts to catch up to the running steer, lean {{over the side of the}} horse which is running flat out and grab the horns of the running steer. The steer wrestler then is pulled off his horse by the slowing steer and plants his heels into the dirt further slowing the steer and himself. He then takes one hand off the horns, <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> grabs the nose of the steer pulling the steer off balance and ultimately [...] "throwing" [...] the steer to the ground. Once all four legs are off the ground, an official waves a flag marking the official end and a time is taken. The steer is released and trots off.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{took the}} {{slip of paper}} which she held out to him. The {{following}} legend met his eye, printed in bold letters: ...|$|R
60|$|This gentleman of {{the range}} {{deliberately}} <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> took up her left hand. Before she recovered from her start of amaze he had stripped off her glove.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{took her}} hands. [...] "I want you, Margaret. My extravagance is done with. I'm {{going back to}} {{undertake}} my proper job and I need your help." ...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, the Dodo appears. Porky {{tries to}} catch it, but it plays tricks on him. The dodo {{pulls out a}} pencil and draws a door in mid-air, and instead of opening it and running through, <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> lifts up the bottom edge of the door like a curtain, darts {{underneath}} and lets it snap back into place for Porky to bump into. At another point, the do-do appears on the Warner Bros. shield logo and slingshots Porky into the ground. Porky is defeated when the dodo pulls a wall of bricks in the picture and lets him crash into it. At {{the end of the}} film, Porky triumphs when he disguises himself as a bearded paperboy, shouting [...] "Extra! Extra! Porky captures Dodo!", before hitting the bird with a mallet. Porky loudly proclaims to the audience that he has captured the last dodo. The dodo mockingly replies, [...] "Yes, I'm really the last of the dodos. Ain't I, fellas?". A multitude of dodos appear, all yelling out, [...] "Yeah, man!". They and the Dodo all howl, which allows him to escape and stand on Porky's head.|$|E
40|$|Audrey Whitson <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> stirs {{something}} {{deep in the}} soul. Her love of {{the land}} is respectful, serious, irresistible. The terrain she captures so vividly on paper as a record of her Alberta pilgrimage moves the heart of any reader who has known and loved the prairies. 2 ̆ 2 The land is calling you, no matter who you are, calling you home. 2 ̆ 2 This book truly does call the prairie soul back to its home. Whitson 2 ̆ 7 s is a journey that is deeply spiritual, without being orthodox. Her spirituality is articulated as understandable and embodied; it is felt through her language and use of metaphor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{renewal of}} chromospheric {{activity}} in red giants and super-giants is interpreted {{in terms of}} the reappearance of dynamo activity in the interior due to the spin-up of the core caused by its contraction in the course of evolution from the main sequence to the giant stage. A region of very high rotational shear (differential rotation) develops between the core, which spins up by a large factor through the drastic contraction, and the envelope, which spins down in contrast by virtue of expansion. Mechanisms of angular momentum transfer may operate to smear this large shear, and bring the inner part of the envelope into sheared rotation. A convective layer, on the other hand, develops in the envelope from the surface inwards, when the envelope expands and the temperature is lowered. A dynamo layer, or a layer in which the sheared rotation co-exists with the convection (the presence of a remnant magnetic field being postulated), will thus reappear in the inner part of the envelope when the envelope-convection <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> invades the layer of sheared rotation. Surface chromospheric activity due to the magnetic field is thus renewed when the regenerated magnetic field is brought up to the surface by the envelope-convection. These phenomena occur as the star evolves into the giant stage and hence explain the observed characteristic of gradual revival of chromospheric activity from the subgiant to the giant stage. Key words: stellar evolution—chromospheric activity—dynamo activity —red giant...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grab a root there! Where's my band cutter? Here, you, {{climb on}} here!" [...] <b>And</b> David <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pulled Shep Watson {{up by the}} {{shoulder}} with his gigantic hand.|$|R
60|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{lifted one}} of the lids. As he glanced within he uttered an exclamation of astonishment. The box was almost filled with bottles, lying {{regularly}} on their sides.|$|R
5000|$|... "One morning last week, while {{pondering the}} daily {{question}} of khakis vs. jeans, {{it was as}} if an occult hand <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> plucked the baggy green pants from the hanger and thrust them at me." ...|$|R
60|$|A stick was handy, {{and fixing}} a bent {{nail in the}} end, Dave <b>reached</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> after a little trouble secured the lantern. Then the boys went below and secured the {{lanterns}} in the sawdust pit.|$|R
60|$|Arthur <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> drew a slight, boyish form {{over the}} gunwale, while Patsy clasped Maud's hand {{and helped the}} girl over the side. She was still strong, but panted from her exertions to support the boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{life would}} have been different, too," [...] Tasso murmured. She <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> unfastened one of her boots. She kicked the boot off, onto the floor. [...] "Major, {{do you want to go}} in the other room? I'm sleepy." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{accident}} {{was such a}} comical one that Dave and his chums laughed outright, and Tom Dillon and Abe Blower grinned broadly. Link Merwell <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> assisted the former teacher to his feet. Job Haskers's face was sourness itself.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I froze at {{the sight}} of a black figure against the light of my window. I {{recognized}} the strange bat, the grotesque outlines. I was about to shout for help when the fellow <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> softly began to raise the sash.|$|R
60|$|And {{when the}} bulls paused, Manu <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> seized a tawny ear. With all his little might he tugged upon the heavy head until slowly it turned back, {{revealing}} the tousled, black head and clean-cut profile of Tarzan of the Apes.|$|R
60|$|He backed slowly {{until he}} was again beside the horse, when he <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> grasped the cinch, which was still intact. Then with one hand he raised the carcass from the ground. The girl freed herself and rose to her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{took hold}} of the tip of that little short tail and drew it out until it was long, almost twice as long as the body of little Mr. Mouse. 'Now jump,' she commanded, 'and jump with all your might.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The hand {{may be seen}} in the Ascension of Christ, sometimes, as in the Drogo Sacramentary, <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{clasping}} that of Christ, {{as though}} to pull him up into the clouds. The ivory plaque now in Munich (left) with such a depiction is possibly the earliest representation of the Ascension to survive.|$|R
60|$|So Tarzan swung {{quickly to}} a lower limb {{in line with the}} {{approaching}} fugitives; and as Mr. Samuel T. Philander came panting and blowing beneath him, already too spent to struggle up to the safety of the limb, Tarzan <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and,</b> grasping him by the collar of his coat, yanked him to the limb by his side.|$|R
6000|$|... "I-- I can't!" [...] gasped Miss Harrow. And now {{the youth}} {{saw that she}} was almost paralyzed from fright. She clung desperately to the window sill, evidently unable to move. Clinging to the ladder with his left hand, Tom placed his right foot on the window sill, <b>and</b> then he <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> caught the teacher under the arm.|$|R
60|$|The ape, {{feeling the}} {{movement}} beside him, <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> gathered {{the girl in}} the hollow of one mighty arm. The burnoose covered the hairy body so that Jane Clayton believed that a human arm supported her, and from the extremity of hopelessness a great hope sprang into her breast that at last she was in the keeping of a rescuer.|$|R
