30|$|Several {{methods for}} {{monitoring}} airborne pollutants {{have been devised}} and tested previously. Dosimetry {{as a method of}} determining air pollution threat was made available by Grøntoft et al. [9], under the MEMORI® system. This consists of two small dosimeter samples; one dosimeter is covered with a thin synthetic polymer film and sensitive to oxidizing gases such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3), and with UV light, while the other is a potassium-rich glass sensitive to acidic gases. X-ray fluorescence has been used to monitor CH objects in the Czech Republic by Trojek et al. [10]. This uses non-contact determination of elemental composition and has been able to increase the sensitivity and extended the range of lighter elements to be determined in the examination of artworks. Tempera dosimeters have been used as dosimeters by Odlyha et al. [3] and can rank the sites and act as early warning devices or damage assessment tools. Automatic corrosion loggers have been developed Prosek et al. [11]. <b>Resin</b> <b>mastic</b> varnish-coated piezoelectric dosimeters have been developed by Odlyha et al. [12, 13] for monitoring the indoor microclimate or in specific sites such as organ pipes and microclimate frames for paintings. EWO dosimeters have been developed by Lopez-Aparicio et al. [14]. Glass Dosimeters have been developed by Leissner [15, 16]. Dosimetry has been developed by Grøntoft et al. [17] in the special application to paintings in microclimate frames with early warning from a synthetic polymer and the <b>Resin</b> <b>Mastic</b> coated piezo electric quartz, however, they ran passive diffusion samplers alongside for individual gases.|$|E
30|$|Relatively high {{concentrations}} of acetic and formic acids were measured {{in the air in}} the store rooms for icons and textiles, and books, in the Tismana monastery. The highest damage risk was found in the icons and textile room, where it was indicated that observable damage, which would require active conservation, was likely to occur to lead and sensitive glass within 3  years (“red”). For iron objects, sensitive pigments, varnish (Laropal A 81, <b>resin</b> <b>mastic</b> and dammar) and paper, it was indicated that observable damage would take longer to develop in both locations, between three and about 30  years (“yellow”). The risk to paper and sensitive pigments was due to photo-oxidation rather than acidic impact. No lower threshold was identified by Memori for photo-oxidative impact on sensitive pigments, so this risk could probably not be totally avoided [6].|$|E

40|$|Triterpenoid resins, such as dammar <b>resin</b> and <b>mastic</b> <b>resin,</b> {{are natural}} {{products}} used as protective varnishes on paintings. Dammar resin {{consists of a}} large amount of triterpenoid molecules including two triterpenic acids: oleanolic acid and ursolic acid. Similarly, <b>mastic</b> <b>resin</b> is a complex blend of terpenoids but containing oleanolic acid. In this paper, high-mass-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has been used to characterize the fragmentation patterns of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid. The hypothesized fragmentation pathways for these triterpenic acids have also been discussed. In order to distinguish between these two structural isomers, principal component analysis (PCA) has been adopted. This multivariate statistical analysis technique permits to identify the characteristic fragments and discriminates between very similar mass spectra. In addition, dammar <b>resin</b> and <b>mastic</b> <b>resin</b> have been characterized. A selection of characteristic peaks from ursolic and oleanolic acids mass spectra has been used to build a dataset for a multivariate analysis to compare triterpenoid resins and triterpenic acids. The results of PCA have revealed that <b>mastic</b> <b>resin</b> is strictly related to oleanolic acid, whereas dammar resin is differentiated by ursolic acid fragments. This study confirms that, in the cultural heritage field, the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry technique combined with PCA can be a powerful tool to investigate the chemical composition of organic compounds with very complex composition...|$|R
30|$|Significant {{risk for}} damage to {{some types of}} {{sensitive}} materials, due to exposure to an acidic atmosphere, was observed in the icons and textile room and book store room in the Tismana monastery. Materials at risk {{were found to be}} especially lead and sensitive glass, with some risk also for iron objects and varnish (Laropal A 81, <b>resin</b> <b>mastic,</b> dammar). Some risk for photo-oxidation of paper and sensitive pigments was found. Sensitive objects could be moved out of rooms with high acid emissions, probably mostly from wood materials. It would be especially important to avoid high humidity situations with RH above ~ 60 %, which accelerate corrosion. It would be beneficial to keep rooms cool. Rooms could be ventilated when the outdoor air is good (clean, dry and cool). Paper and objects with sensitive pigments could be moved into showcases or protective enclosures, or moved away from exposure to outdoor air and light.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} standard triterpenes (-amyrine, oleanolic acid, betulin, lupeol, betulinic acid and lupenone) and of raw resinous materials (frankincense <b>resin,</b> <b>mastic</b> resin and birch bark pitch) was performed using direct exposure electron ionisation mass spectrometry (DE-MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). DE-MS provides a mass spectral fingerprint of organic materials {{in a few}} minutes which highlights the compounds that are the main components in the sample. The application of principal component analysis (PCA) on DE-MS data in the mass ranges 181 - 260 and 331 - 500, corresponding to the fragmentation of triterpenoid molecules, enabled us to distinguish between different triterpenoid materials such as mastic resin, frankincense resin and birch bark pitch, and to graphically plot the resinous substances in three separate clusters, retaining 89 % of the total variance. GC/MS analysis of the same materials has permitted to elucidate in detail the molecular composition and to identify minor components and species that act as markers of the degradation undergone by the materials. The paper also reports the results for the organic residues contained in an Egyptian censer (5 th- 7 th AD) which was recovered in the excavation of the Necropolis of Antinoe (Egypt), and for the hafting material found on a Palaeolithic tool recovered at the site of Campitello (Arezzo, Tuscany), dating back to the Mid-Pleistocene period. Although DE-MS was found to be a fast analytical tool, it failed to give any information on the presence of less abundant compounds when applied to mixtures of different materials: only mastic resin was found in the residues from the Roman censer, whereas GC/MS analysis identified the presence of a vegetable oil from Brassicaceae seeds and Pinaceae resin. Birch bark pitch as a pure material was identified in the sample from the Palaeolithic flint flake using both procedures...|$|E
40|$|Pollutants {{and their}} {{potential}} degradation of paintings have been measured {{for the first time}} in microclimate frames (mc-frames), which are used to protect paintings. The pollutants that were measured include both inorganic pollutants, which originate mainly from external sources, and organic pollutants from mainly internal sources. Those originating from the outdoors enter rooms and subsequently mc-frames at a rate depending on the ventilation rates (air exchange rates) of the mc-frames. The concentration of gaseous pollutants emitted within the mc-frames will depend on net emission rates of the materials used to make the mc-frames, their design, and their ventilation rates. In the EU PROPAINT project measurements of gaseous air pollutants and climatic conditions were performed at various locations both inside and outside different state-of-the-art mc-frames. Diffusive passive pollution gas samplers were used together with different types of dosimeters. Results show that the dosimeters respond to either the photo-oxidizing conditions or the level of volatile organic acids in the environments both in the museums and within the mc-frames. Two dosimeters, the Early Warning Organic (EWO) made from a synthetic polymer and the <b>Resin</b> <b>Mastic</b> coated Piezo electric Quartz Crystals (RM-PQC) respond to photo-oxidation and showed higher values outside than inside the mc-frames. Two other dosimeters, the Glass Slide Dosimeter (GSD) and the Lead coated Piezo electric Quartz Crystals (L-PQC) respond to volatile organic acids and yielded higher values inside than outside the mc-frames. This study emphasizes the need for further work to determine environmental damage functions for paintings, in particular for the effects of organic acids. Such information is essential for the evaluation of the protective effects of mc-frames for paintings. The use of mc-frames is increasing and it is very important to know that this protective measure does not introduce new risks...|$|E

30|$|Assessment was {{performed}} {{of the air}} quality related risk to the conservation of cultural heritage objects in one urban and one rural indoor location in Romania, with expected different air quality related conservation challenges: the National military museum in Bucharest and the Tismana monastery in Gorj County. The work {{was performed}} within and subsequent to the EU-Memori project by applying Memori methodology, Memori®-EWO (Early warning organic) dosimeters and passive pollution badge samplers for acetic and formic acids. The measurements in the National military museum were performed in three rooms with different exposure situations, and inside protective enclosures in the rooms. The rooms had organic and inorganic objects on exhibition and in store. The observed risks were associated with photo-oxidizing impact probably due to traffic pollutants entering from outdoor, and/or light exposure and temperature. The risks {{were found to be}} moderate, generally comparable to typical European purpose built museum locations. The highest risk was observed in a more open exhibition room in the main museum building. It was indicated that some observable change might happen to sensitive pigments and paper within 3  years, and to lead, copper and sensitive glass within 30  years in this location. Risk for observable change to sensitive pigments, paper, lead and sensitive glass within 30  years, was indicated in the other locations. The lowest risk was observed in a warehouse. A reduction in photo-oxidizing risk was measured in two of the enclosures, but a slightly higher acidic impact was measured in all the three enclosures, as compared to the respective rooms. In the Tismana monastery, a high level of acetic plus formic acid was observed in the air in the storerooms for icons and textiles, and books. Damage risk within 3  years was indicated for lead objects and sensitive glass, and within 30  years for iron and varnish (Laropal A 81, <b>resin</b> <b>mastic</b> and dammar). As organic acid attack increases significantly at higher air humidity (>[*]~  60 %), this would be especially important to avoid. Risk for photo-oxidizing damage to paper and sensitive pigments within 30  years was indicated.|$|E

40|$|Twenty three {{samples of}} Egyptian organic materials, {{spanning}} from the Old Kingdom to the Copto-Byzantine Period, were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The sample set {{was comprised of}} ten balm samples from human mummies, three balms from shrews, and ten samples of residues scraped from jars and amphora from storehouses. This research program was undertaken with two main goals: Firstly to provide complementary data on the mummification balms from both humans and animals {{with an emphasis on}} the occurrence of bitumen in mummification mixtures. Secondly to explore whether the jar residues were mixtures that were used for mummification purposes or whether they were pure ingredients stored for various uses including ritual practices. The analysis highlighted that the most abundant constituents of the mummification balms were: fats or oils, waxes, conifer <b>resin,</b> pitch, <b>mastic</b> <b>resin,</b> castor oil, and bitumen. Balms from animal mummies were not found to be significantly different from the balms from human mummies. Residues from potsherds appeared to belong to two categories: pure products (fats and castor oil) and mixtures containing fats, Pinaceae <b>resin</b> and pitch, <b>mastic</b> <b>resin,</b> and castor oil, i. e. the constituents also identified in mummification balms. The mixtures were thus residues of preparations for ritual practices and embalming. This study demonstrates that bitumen is underestimated by the chemical approach currently applied in most archaeometric studies of Egyptian organic residues, which are better suited for the identification of lipids and resinous materials. We thus applied a specific analytical design, targeted at bitumen. Bitumen from the Dead Sea was conclusively identified using as reference materials for comparison, i. e. the present day bitumen from the Dead Sea floating blocks, as well as several bitumens from mummification balms and bitumen lumps unearthed from the archaeological site of Tell Yarmouth near Jerusalem in Israel...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in the fluorescence of binding media and varnishes (proteins, oils, and resins) commonly used in paintings {{is based on the}} potential for discriminating these organic materials. A useful way of studying the presence of the broad-band fluorescence emissions found in these complex organic materials is fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy. However, due to the presence of Raman and Rayleigh scattering which may necessitate correction or preprocessing for statistical analysis and visualization, an alternative approach has been adopted for the analysis of different samples of artist materials based on total synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. Films of selected drying oils, glue, egg, and casein and the <b>resins</b> <b>mastic,</b> dammar, copal, and shellac were analyzed using total synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, and an interpretation of the differences between spectra is given. A data reduction method based on the transformation of fluorescence contours extracted from total synchronous fluorescence from Cartesian to polar coordinates is presented and is followed by the comparison of data using multivariate analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis.
