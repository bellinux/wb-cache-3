40|$|Increasing {{concentrations}} of nitrogen (N) in the waterbodies along with increasing {{concentrations of}} nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{and carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere have become an international environmental concern. Permanent grasslands are important sources of feed for intensively managed dairy and beef farming systems in North West Europe and represent around 90 % of agricultural land in Ireland. However, there is a potential for substantial N losses following grazing during the winter when a significant effective rainfall occurs. In addition, ploughing and <b>reseeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in order to increase its productivity may lead to a substantial decrease in soil organic matter (SOM) followed by an increase in soil inorganic N. This two year study investigated (i) the environmental impact of a dairy production system involving grazing over the winter through calculations of soil surface N balances and its effect on soil N dynamics and N loses to groundwater; (ii) the impact of permanent grassland renovation on soil N, N 2 O emissions, N leaching and soil organic carbon (SOC) in a poorly drained clay-loam soil at Solohead Research Farm. The correlations between grazing management and soil N dynamics in the soil profile or N concentrations in the groundwater were difficult due to high natural buffering capacity of the soils associated with heavy texture, high SOC, high soil pH, anaerobic conditions and presence of shallow groundwater. For this reason, grazing over the winter period had no effect on soil N dynamics and groundwater quality on this site. In contrast, grassland renovation decreased topsoil SOC and total N, increased oxidized N leaching to groundwater and N 2 O emissions from the soil surface as a result of soil disturbance, enhanced decomposition of SOM followed by nitrification and denitrification. Although, the overall losses due to net SOM mineralisation were high (3 t N and 32 t C ha- 1), the proportion lost via N leaching and direct N 2 O emissions was low (27 kg N ha- 1 y- 1) suggesting that nitrate were instantaneously reduced by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium or complete denitrification...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for agriculture today is to manage soil properties and their spatial distribution to optimize productivity and minimize environmental impacts, such as diffuse pollution. To identify best management practices, the effects of different agricultural management practices on pollutant sources, mobilization, transfer and delivery to water bodies need to be understood. Grasslands managed for dairy and meat production, despite being widespread, have received less research attention than other agricultural land uses. Therefore, this thesis studies the effects <b>of</b> different <b>grassland</b> management practices on soil properties and their spatial distribution and the mobilization and delivery of multiple diffuse pollutants. As a grassland case study, monitoring for this thesis was conducted across three fields (6. 5 – 7. 5 ha) on the North Wyke Farm Platform, a grassland experimental farm in the UK. First, the effects <b>of</b> permanent <b>grassland</b> management (permanent for at least 6 years, but different grassland management > 6 years ago) were characterized as a baseline, followed by quantifying the short-term effects <b>of</b> ploughing and <b>reseeding</b> <b>of</b> permanent <b>grassland</b> fields. Throughout those management periods, i) a range of soil physical (bulk density [BD]) and chemical (soil organic matter [SOM], total N [TN], total phosphorus [TP], total carbon [TC]) soil properties and their spatial distribution were sampled and analysed by geostatistics, and ii) hydrological characteristics and multiple pollutant fluxes (suspended sediment [SS] and the macronutrients: total oxidized nitrogen-N [TONN], total phosphorus [TP], and total carbon [TC]) were monitored at high temporal resolution (monitoring up to every 15 minutes). The permanent grassland fields (or areas within fields) can {{be considered to be}} functioning differently. Past management legacy (more than 6 years ago) has affected soil properties and their distribution with subsequent effects on sediment and macronutrient delivery from the fields to surface waters. Overall, permanent grasslands were found to contribute significantly to agricultural diffuse pollution. The estimated erosion and macronutrient losses were similar to or exceeded the losses reported for other grasslands, mixed land use and even arable sites, and sediment and TP concentrations exceeded those recommended by EU / UK water quality guidelines. Ploughing and reseeding did not homogenize spatial variation and did not override past management effects. Long-term management differences affected soil properties and altered soil processes, so that the fields subsequently responded differently to ploughing and reseeding. All nutrient concentrations were significantly reduced in the older grassland field (no ploughing for 20 years), but not in the younger grassland field (no ploughing for 6 years). Ploughing and reseeding significantly accelerated the losses of sediment and macronutrients and sediment, TP and TONN exceedance frequencies of EU / UK water quality guidelines increased. Additionally, ploughing and reseeding caused a shift in the relative importance of nutrients, by increasing the relative importance of N. Such large sediment and nutrient losses from intensively managed grasslands should be acknowledged in land management guidelines and advice for future compliance with surface water quality standards. The between-field and within-field variation highlights the importance of baseline characterization and paired catchment studies. The long-term effects of management still acting on soil properties and subsequently water quality indicates how long it may take to see soil and water quality improvements after implementing mitigation measures. Therefore, long-term management history always has to be included when interpreting soil and water quality data. Case-funded PhD between NERC and Rothamsted Research (North Wyke...|$|R

40|$|The grasslands, {{like the}} {{majority}} of the terrestrial systems, are complex ecosystems and such complexity comes from the high number of biotic and abiotic elements which form this systems and from the interactions between the same elements, which could vary in time and space their nature and intensity. Keeping attention to this complexity and knowing that there is an equilibrium state in which the plant community has the maximum possible number of species, for a certain soil-climate context, this research work is centred on the description of the components <b>of</b> the <b>grassland</b> ecosystem, <b>of</b> the relations which exist between them and on the possible way of management, to achieve improvements in the future, in terms of productivity of phytocoenosis, of soil defending, of biodiversity conservation and also in terms of improving the life conditions of human population. In particular, the main target of this phD was to create an exhaustive knowledge structure about Apennines grasslands, because until now, all the studies made were partial, tending to characterize the herbaceous communities from a phytosociological viewpoint, but not ecological-functional. Moreover, considering the size of the study area and the complexity of the research and of the management <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> ecosystems, we thought to share the research work in the three years, the timing and the operations. In fact, the research plan was structured like a “pyramid” at the base of which there is the phytosociological research which is the support to all the other studies, while regarding on the timing we decided to concentrate each year in a bioclimatic belt, following this scheme: 1 th year: − bibliography research − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − set up a sampling method for the ecological survey 2 th year: − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belt − Ecological structure analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − sinecological analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − analysis of the vegetation for a zootechnical characterization <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and higher/lower supratemperate belts 3 th year: − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> orotemperate and criotemperate belts − ecological structure analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belts − sinecological analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belt − zootechnical characterization <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and higher/lower supratemperate belts [ [...] . ] In the three years it was possible to finish all the phytosociological, ecological and zootechnical researches for the <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower/higher supratemperate belts; then it was possible to implement phytosociological and sinecological knowledges <b>of</b> the <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> orotemperate belt and to realize a phytosociological placement of the herbaceous commmunities of criotemperate belt...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeographyMelinda DanielsThe Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is {{a prairie}} grouse of {{conservation}} {{concern in the}} Southern Great Plains. In response to declining population numbers and ongoing threats to its habitat, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in May 2014. In western Kansas, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken occupies the Sand Sagebrush Prairie, Mixed-grass Prairie, and Short-grass/CRP Mosaic Ecoregions. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the overall range and population has declined by 92 % and 97 % respectively. Much of this decline is attributed to the loss and fragmentation <b>of</b> native <b>grasslands</b> throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range. Whereas much of the loss and degradation <b>of</b> native <b>grassland</b> have been attributed to anthropogenic activities such as conversion <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> to cropland and energy exploration, federal legislation since the 1980 s to convert cropland on highly erodible soils to perennial grasses through the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) may curtail or reverse these trends. My objective was to document changes in the areal extent and connectivity <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> in the identified Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas from the 1950 s to 2013 using remotely sensed data. I hypothesized that the total amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> decreased between the 1950 ’s and 2013 because of an increase in agricultural practices, but predicted an increase <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> between 1985 and 2013 in response to the CRP. To document changes in grassland, land cover maps were generated through spectral classification of LANDSAT images and visual analysis of aerial photographs from the Army Map Service and USDA Farm Service Agency. Landscape composition and configuration were assessed using FRAGSTATS to compute a variety of landscape metrics measuring changes in the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> present as well as changes in the size and configuration <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> patches. Since 1985, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas has increased by 210, 9963. 3 ha, a rise of 11. 9 %, while the mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> increased 18. 2 % and 23. 0 % respectively, indicating grassland has become more connected during this time in response to the CRP. Prior to the implementation of CRP, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had been decreasing since 1950, as 66, 722. 0 ha <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> was converted to croplands. The loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had a considerable effect on the patch size <b>of</b> <b>grasslands,</b> as mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size decreased by 8. 8 % and 11. 1 % respectively. The primary driver <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> loss between 1950 and 1985 was the emergence of center pivot irrigation, which had its greatest impact in western and southwestern parts of the range in Kansas. In particular, while the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in Range 5, a region of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range found in southwest Kansas, has increased overall since the 1950 s by 4. 7 %, the area-weighted mean patch size has decreased by 53. 0 % in response to center pivot irrigation fragmenting the landscape. While the CRP has been successful in increasing and connecting grassland throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range to offset the loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> since the 1950 s, continuation of the CRP faces an uncertain future in the face of rising commodity prices, energy development, and reduction in program scope leaving open the possibility that these areas that have created habitat for Lesser Prairie-Chickens could be lost. As time progresses, a reduction in the scope of the CRP would reduce the amount of habitat available to Lesser Prairie-Chickens, threatening the persistence of their population...|$|R

40|$|China has {{abundant}} grassland resources (approximately 400 million ha <b>of</b> natural <b>grasslands),</b> {{which account}} for 41. 7 % of China's total area. Grasslands are an important base for boosting the development of China's livestock husbandry economy and maintaining China's ecological security. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data, this study developed a grassland vegetation growth index that ranked the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> vegetation growth indices across {{a wide variety of}} field experiments. This study applied the grassland vegetation growth index to conduct remote-sensing monitoring of the spatiotemporal status <b>of</b> China's <b>grassland</b> vegetation growth in 2008. We found that the vegetation growth <b>of</b> China's <b>grassland</b> was classified as 'good' in 2008. The areas <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> with desirable vegetation growth accounted for 38. 47 % <b>of</b> China's monitored <b>grassland</b> areas, and the areas with less desirable vegetation growth accounted for 22. 85 %. Additionally, the good vegetation growth was stable within each 10 day study period in 2008. The vegetation growth reached a balance in early June. After early September, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> with desirable vegetation growth declined, and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> with balanced and less desirable growth increased. The regions with less desirable vegetation growth mainly included the middle and eastern regions of Inner Mongolia, the northern region of Xinjiang, and most parts of Heilongjiang. The regions with desirable vegetation growth were mainly distributed in the north of Tibet, the southwest of Qinghai, the west of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi, and the northwest of Liaoning. The remote-sensing monitoring of the spatiotemporal patterns <b>of</b> China's <b>grassland</b> vegetation growth in the present study revealed the overall vegetation growth status <b>of</b> China's <b>grassland</b> on a broad scale. These findings could provide a helpful scientific basis for understanding China's grassland vegetation conditions and the management and regulation <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> livestock husbandry. 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
