5|$|After the war, the Navy's accomplishments {{paid off}} {{in the form of}} better funding, and it {{embarked}} on the construction of many new ships. However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> another war, until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops during the three decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt steam power and shell guns, but they lagged behind the French and British in adopting the new technologies.|$|E
5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E
5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E

5|$|Admission is {{competitive}} and decisions {{are based on}} evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, social and emotional maturity, and <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results {{at or above the}} 91stpercentile (over 120 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers in the actual classroom setting.|$|E
5|$|Agordat {{was built}} at the Castellammare shipyard; her keel was laid down on 18 February 1897 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 11 October 1899. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 26 September 1900. Sea trials lasted from 11 February 1901 to 6 March, and during the final speed trial she exceeded her design speed by a knot. She nevertheless proved to be too slow and short-legged to be useful as a fleet scout, which limited her active duty career. She served in the main fleet in 19031904, during which time the fleet was kept {{in a state of}} <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> seven months. For the remaining five months, the ships had reduced crews. During the 1908 fleet maneuvers, Agordat was assigned to the hostile force that was tasked with simulating an attempt to land troops on Sicily.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} <b>readiness</b> factors <b>for</b> the {{adoption}} of Internet-based inter-organizational systems (IOS) via a case analysis of fifteen Taiwanese firms. By proposing a three-dimension readiness model (readiness of firm, readiness of partners, and readiness of collaborative relationships), this study extends previous work of IOS adoption to identify critical <b>readiness</b> factors <b>for</b> Internet-based IOS adoption and examines the impacts of these readiness factors on different types of Internet-based IOS adoption, in terms of simple web-based IOS adoption, EOI (EDI on the Internet) adoption, and RosettaNet-based IOS adoption. Three findings are shown in this study: (1) The readiness of firm is an essential condition for all cases, and cases of simple web-based IOS adopters place more focus on firm readiness than other readiness dimensions; (2) EOI adopters places most emphasis on partner <b>readiness,</b> and (3) <b>for</b> the cases of RosettaNet adopters, collaborative relationships {{is more important than}} firm readiness and partner readiness...|$|R
5|$|Her first Vietnam combat tour completed, New Jersey {{departed}} Subic Bay 3 April 1969 for Japan. She {{arrived at}} Yokosuka for a two-day visit, sailing for the United States 9 April. Her homecoming, however, {{was to be}} delayed. On the 15th, while New Jersey was still at sea, North Korean jet fighters shot down an unarmed EC-121 Constellation electronic surveillance plane over the Sea of Japan, killing its entire crew. A carrier task force was formed {{and sent to the}} Sea of Japan, while New Jersey was ordered to come about and steam toward Japan. On the 22nd she arrived once more at Yokosuka, and immediately put to sea in <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> what might befall.|$|E
5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, {{realizing that the}} conflict was pointless, signaled his <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> friendly relations. At the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and {{to allow for the}} peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, as Washington had advised in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, {{lifeboat}} launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> when the next call came. While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the primary}} roles of the {{regiment}} {{is to provide a}} counter-terrorist capability, with an element of the SASR designated as the Tactical Assault Group (West) to respond to domestic incidents on the west coast of Australia and also for international operations. TAG (West) maintains a short-notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of state/territory and federal Police Tactical Groups. Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery. A capability to board ships at anchor, ships underway and off-shore gas and oil platforms is also maintained. TAG (West) is kept at high <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role. The 2nd Commando Regiment provides Tactical Assault Group (East) to respond to domestic incidents on the east coast of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Since the Spanish Armament of 1790, the Royal Navy {{had been}} at sea {{in a state of}} <b>readiness</b> <b>for</b> over three years. The Navy's dockyards under First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton were all fully fitted and {{prepared}} for conflict. This was quite unlike the disasters of the American Revolutionary War ten years earlier, when an ill-prepared Royal Navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign—which ended in defeat at the Battle of Yorktown due to lack of supplies. With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{as far north}} as the Russian Far East as officials anticipated the remnants of the typhoon to cause significant disruption in the region.
