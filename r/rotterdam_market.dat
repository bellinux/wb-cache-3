This may explain observed price differences between commodities from different origins but with the same observable characteristics. We analyse data for the <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>market</b> and use hedonic price analysis to show the existence of a price premium that favours the US over other origins. As secondary information points out exporter reliability as one explanation we formalise the relationship between reliability and price premiums in a theoretical model and analyse its implications. firm reputation, supplier reliability, price differences, groundnuts trade, hedonic analysis, country of origin, Demand and Price Analysis, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} {{crude oil}} prices started the year 2014 within parameters {{comparable to those of}} the precedent year: WTI (USA) recorded 92 /barrel, on the American spot market, considered a minimum value for the last 5 weeks, while Brent (Great Britain) had a more stable evolution, on the spot <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>market,</b> staying around a value of 107, 50 /barrel. Despite analysts’ forecasts, which during the last 3 years staked on a lower oil price, {{as a consequence of the}} spectacular increase in non-OPEC oil production, namely of shale oil, the international oil price, namely that of Brent, closed each of the last 3 years around the same level, of 108 /barrel. As for 2014, the great majority of oil analysts estimates again a decline of oil prices, as a result of a significant rise of oil offer globally, which will greatly surpass the demand rise. ...|$|E

40|$|Using IRI Infoscan data {{pertaining}} to six types of spaghetti sauces and employing {{an extension of}} the demand systems framework developed by Duffy, estimates are obtained of own-price, cross-price, and total expenditure elasticities as well as own- and cross-product advertising elasticities. We augment the Duffy model {{through the use of a}} polynomial inverse lag mechanism to deal with the carryover effects of advertising. We also account for the impacts of features in newspaper fliers, in-store displays, and coupons. Advertising efforts by industry leaders in spaghetti sauce produce positive own-advertising elasticities (ranging from -. 000003 to -. 0094). Own-price elasticities are in the elastic range, and nearly all compensated cross-price effects are positive, indicative of Hicksian substitutes.

25|$|Starting {{with the}} 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, {{a period of}} {{prolonged}} high oil prices set in that characterised {{the rest of the}} 1970s. Romania as a major oil-producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the <b>Rotterdam</b> spot <b>market.</b> As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans. A major problem with Ceaușescu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.|$|R
40|$|Crude Palm Oil (CPO) {{is one of}} {{important}} commodity for Indonesia. Indonesia is the biggest producers of CPO in the world, and the second exporter after Malaysia. Despite the fact that Indonesia and Malaysia are mayor CPO exporters, CPO traders determine CPO price in spot market. As a result, Indonesian and Malaysian producers often face price volatilites. Indonesian traders do not have bargaining power in the price determination. On other hands, domestik demands for CPO grow up. For that reason, The Indonesian goverment must take a policy to guarantee the fulfilment of CPO needs. The objective of research are (1) to describe the Indonesian policy in CPO trade that integrated with World <b>market</b> in <b>Rotterdam</b> and Malaysian <b>Market</b> and (2) to formulate the policy implication of CPO price formation in Indonesia. The research showed that Indonesia act as price taker, this is because Indonesian goverment has no bargaining power to determine price in domestic - and International market.
