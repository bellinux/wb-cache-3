With the imminent threat of demolition, the local community rallied to save pier, to widespread media coverage. In the weeks <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the cessation of service from the pier, thousands of Hong Kong residents arrived to post banners and other messages in support of retention.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Saxon immigration, the Székelys –Hungarian-speaking free warriors {{cultivating}} communal lands– were transferred to the southeast of the province. From the 13thcentury they were governed independently from the voivode by a royal official, the count of the Székelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at Cârţa was established in the early 13thcentury, Andrew II ordered that the strip of land <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the mountains between the rivers Olt, Cârţişoara and Arpaş be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. <b>Running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E

5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1890 the Prince of Wales {{had taken to}} visiting Doncaster Racecourse for the Doncaster Cup. In {{previous}} years he had stayed at Brantingham Thorpe with his friend Sir Christopher Sykes, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Beverley. Sykes had run into financial difficulties and {{could not afford to}} host Edward, and Tranby Croft, home to Arthur Wilson and family, became the venue. After consulting with the prince, the Wilsons also invited some of Edward's inner circle, including Sykes, Gordon-Cumming and the prince's courtiers: the equerry Tyrwhitt Wilson, Lord Coventry, Lord Edward Somerset, Captain Arthur Somerset—his cousin—and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams, along with their wives. Also accompanying the party was Lieutenant Berkeley Levett, a brother officer to Gordon-Cumming in the Scots Guards and a friend of the Wilson family.|$|E
5|$|Naz {{is one of}} four {{characters}} from series 2 who has an official profile on social networking site Twitter, along with Stevie, Stevie's boyfriend Olly Manthrope-Hall (Joshua McGuire) and Fatboy, where it is revealed that the character works in a kebab shop during the summer holiday. Further posts on Twitter allude to the storyline <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the start of the series, such as Naz buying the fake ID from Fatboy. Naz also appears in extra video content on the E20 website. In one video, she attempts to take a photo of herself to use on her fake ID. In another, Stevie and Naz have a picnic in the park, and Naz makes a video of Stevie, hoping to make Olly jealous, but Stevie ends up with cake on her face. In another video, the four friends play a drinking game in the café. Another scene features Stevie and Naz talking about kissing, and another features a nightmare scenario of her and Ekin getting married in a Laz Vegas wedding chapel.|$|E

5|$|The Nclass {{incorporated}} {{the principles of}} power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. These features are attributed to Holcroft, {{who worked on the}} GWR 4300class before joining the SECR. The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsell’s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames.|$|E
5|$|The decades <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1381 were a rebellious, troubled period. London was a {{particular}} locus of unrest, and {{the activities of the}} city's politically active guilds and fraternities often alarmed the authorities. Londoners resented the expansion of the royal legal system in the capital, in particular the increased role of the Marshalsea Court in Southwark, which had begun to compete with the city authorities for judicial power in London. The city's population also resented the presence of foreigners, Flemish weavers in particular. Londoners detested John of Gaunt because he was a supporter of the religious reformer John Wycliffe, whom the London public regarded as a heretic. John of Gaunt was also engaged in a feud with the London elite and was rumoured to be planning to replace the elected mayor with a captain, appointed by the Crown. The London elite were themselves fighting out a vicious, internal battle for political power. As a result, in 1381 the ruling classes in London were unstable and divided.|$|E
