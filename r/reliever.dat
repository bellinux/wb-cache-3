50|$|Gradually after World War II, {{full-time}} <b>relievers</b> {{became more}} acceptable and standard. The <b>relievers</b> were usually pitchers {{that were not}} good enough to be starters. <b>Relievers</b> in the 1950s started to develop oddball pitches to distinguish them from starters. For example, Hoyt Wilhelm threw a knuckleball, and Elroy Face threw a forkball.|$|R
50|$|This {{difference}} between the leagues (the DH) also affects <b>relievers,</b> {{but not to the}} same degree. This is because National League <b>relievers</b> actually pitch to pitchers less often than NL starters do for a number of reasons, chiefly because <b>relievers</b> are usually active in later innings when pinch hitters tend {{to be used in the}} pitcher's batting spot.|$|R

5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time <b>reliever</b> for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a <b>reliever.</b> The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the differential impact of perceived risk upon two alternative channels of distribution, namely specialty store and mail-order buying, for different product categories.

This study confirms the general belief that mail-order buying is not only more risky than buying the same product in a specialty store but it also indicates "that the level of perceived risk seems to be highly influenced by {{the value of the}} product. Although mail-order companies may reduce this competitive disadvantage by using the appropriate risk <b>relievers</b> the results clearly indicate that risk <b>relievers</b> differ considerably in effectiveness.
