5|$|Achebe's novels laid a {{formidable}} groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style. In some spots this {{takes the form}} of <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.|$|E
5|$|Fivefold <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> position: Similar to the threefold-repetition rule, but in {{this case}} neither player needs to claim the draw; thus a tournament {{director}} can intervene and declare the game to be drawn. This is a relatively recent (2014) addition to the FIDE rules.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events. The <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the experiment happened in February 1955.|$|E

Upper limb training was performed daily {{beginning with a}} duration of 5  min each time, gradually increasing to 20  min.

Echolalia (<b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> another person's words) and palilalia (<b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease.

5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves the <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages {{at different times}} and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 12 -hour incubation or 24 -hour incubation {{in three}} different media on {{the reduction of the}} spore forming ability of Clostridium perfringens in the sporulation medium (DS medium) has been studied. 1) The increasing the number <b>of</b> the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> the 12 -hour incubation in the thioglycollate medium with 2 % glucose decreased the spore forming ability of tested strains (NCTC 8238, 8239, 8798) in the sporulation medium. 2) In the case of NCTC 8238, the increasing the number <b>of</b> the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 12 -hour incubation in the cooked meat medium decreased the spore forming ability in the sporulation medium, but the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 24 -hour incubation in the cooked meat medium only slightly decreased the spore forming ability. On the other hand, the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 12 -hour incubation in the cooked meat medium with 2 % gall powder as a subculture medium only slightly decreased the spore forming ability of NCTC 8238, and the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 24 -hour incubation in the medium did not almost decreased the spore forming ability. 3) When the subculture media were heated (75 ℃, 20 min) immediately following the inoculation, the second incubation of 12 -hour incubation in the cooked meat medium as a subculture medium remarkably decreased the spore forming ability of NCTC 8238, but the increasing the number <b>of</b> the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 24 -hour incubation in the medium increased the spore forming ability of NCTC 8238. On the other hand, the culture in 12 -hour incubation in the cooked meat medium with 2 % gall powder as a subculture medium was killed by the heating, but the <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> 24 -hour incubation in the medium did not almost decreased the spore forming ability of NCTC 8238. 継代培地による反復培養がウェルシュ菌の胞子形成培地における胞子形成能力の低下に及ぼす影響を, 12 時間の継代培養を繰り返した場合と 24 時間の継代培養を繰り返した場合とについて比較・検討した。 1) 継代培地としてグルコース 2 %添加チオグリコレート培地を用いた 12 時間培養の反復によつて,供試株(NCTC 8238, 8239, 8798) の胞子形成能力が反復回数の増加とともに低下した。 2) 供試株(NCTC 8238) の場合,継代培地としてクックドミート培地(CM) を用いた時には,胞子形成能力は 12 時間の継代培養を反復すると反復回数の増加によって低下し, 24 時間の培養を反復すると反復回数が増加しても僅かに低下したに過ぎなかった。一方,継代培地として胆汁末 2 %添加クックドミート培地(GPCM) を用いた時には,胞子形成能力は 12 時間の継代培養を反復すると反復回数が増加しても僅かに低下したに過ぎず, 24 時間の培養を反復すると殆ど低下しなかつた。 3) 継代培地接種直後に加熱処理(75 ℃, 20 min) した場合には,継代培地としてCMを用いた時には,供試株(NCTC 8238) の胞子形成能力は 2 回の 12 時間培養によって著しく低下し, 24 時間培養の反復においては反復回数の増加と共に上昇した。一方,継代培地としてGPCMを用いた時には, 12 時間培養菌は加熱処理によって死滅した。 24 時間培養の反復においては,反復によって胞子形成能力は殆ど低下しなかった...|$|R

5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine {{to give the impression}} of a fast winter's journey by means of the troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> its final phrase.|$|E
5|$|Threefold <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> position: This most {{commonly}} occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage.

The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E
