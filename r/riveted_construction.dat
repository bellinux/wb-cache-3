5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of <b>riveted</b> <b>construction,</b> but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E
25|$|The M-10 {{was much}} more {{advanced}} design compared to older Soviet 152mm howitzers. It had modern split trail carriage, which allowed for much larger traverse. The trails were of <b>riveted</b> <b>construction.</b> The carriage was equipped with suspension and with wheels from the ZiS-5 truck, meaning higher transportation speed.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the issues}} with the yard was {{that the size of}} boats that could be built was {{restricted}} by the locks at either side of the site. Sheffield-sized boats were around , and could leave the yard either by passing through Thorne Lock and on to the Don Navigation, or by travelling to Keadby and entering the Trent. Sloops were restricted to the Keadby route, because of their larger size, and the largest boats built at Thorne before the 1940s were [...] tugs, 300-ton coasters and 300-ton lighters. From 1933, the yard began experimenting with welded rather than <b>riveted</b> <b>construction,</b> and their first all-welded steam tugs were constructed for the Admiralty in 1942. They continued to lead the field with developments in tug propulsion in the 1960s, and by the last 1970s had built seventeen tugs [...] with Kort nozzle or Kort rudder steering and twenty tugs with Voith-Schneider propulsion systems at Thorne. With the yard at Hessle on the Humber, bought from Henry Scarr in 1932, they were one of the largest un-nationalised shipbuilders in Britain.|$|E

50|$|The CA-2 {{requires}} about 600 {{hours to}} build. The airframe is of all-metal construction using 2024-T3 aluminum sheet, extruded angles and tubing, fastened primarily with stainless steel pop <b>rivets.</b> <b>Construction</b> requires normal hand tools, plus a small bending brake and a tube bender.|$|R
500|$|The next {{military}} operation the T-26 light tank participated in was the Soviet-Japanese border conflict. Commencing with the Battle of Lake Khasan, in July 1938. The 2nd Mechanised Brigade, the 32nd and the 40th Independent Tank Battalions had 257 T-26s, from which 76 tanks were damaged and 9 burnt {{towards the end}} of battle action. A small number of T-26 tanks and flame-throwing tanks based on the T-26 chassis, participated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol against Japanese forces in 1939. The T-26 was vulnerable to Japanese tank-killing teams armed with Molotov cocktails; poor quality welds left gaps in the armour plate, and flaming petrol easily seeped into the fighting compartment and engine compartment. The 37mm gun on the Japanese Type 95 light tank, despite its mediocre performance, was also effective against the T-26. Portions of the armour plating on earlier models of the T-26 used <b>riveted</b> <b>construction</b> and were very vulnerable to both types of attacks. The use of riveted armour on some older T-26 models led to [...] "spalling", when the impact of enemy shells, even if they failed to disable the tank or kill the crew on their own, caused the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank.|$|E
500|$|A {{deck crane}} {{was used for}} the {{construction}} of the main span of the bridge. A specially designed crane of 45tonne capacity was used to erect the pylons of the bridge. The structural steel used in the bridge weighs about 13,200 tonnes. The pylons, which are [...] in height, are designed as free standing portals. They are provided with two cross portal members, one at the bottom and another at the top, below the pylon head. The deck is connected to the end piers by bolts embedded in the chambers of the piers. Pylons made of [...] steel boxes of <b>riveted</b> <b>construction</b> were raised on the two side spans of the bridge; one set is on the Calcutta side and the other is on the Howrah side. The six pylons on the Calcutta side of the bridge were installed using 75 MT and 50 MT cranes, while on the Howrah end, a single 50 MT crane was used. Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through Dywidag rods, duly anchored in the piers. Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 MT hoist frames. The hoist frames were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks. Pressure grouting was performed to fill the voids between the wire and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes. A twotonne tower crane, fixed inside the pylons, lifted the cables into position.|$|E
2500|$|LMS {{advised a}} return to <b>riveted</b> <b>construction</b> due to doubts about its strength, and rather than risk delays {{due to a lack}} of welders, this was accepted. The welded design used two layers of armour plate, the inner being of steel that would weld readily without losing its properties. This two-plate system was {{retained}} when the design reverted to <b>riveted</b> <b>construction.</b> The use of <b>riveted</b> <b>construction,</b> the use of steel wheels instead of the intended aluminium and an increase in armour specification to [...] at the front of hull and turret increased the weight to a level where the tank suspension was at maximum load, leaving no room for later development of the design.|$|E
50|$|A native Italian {{design was}} the L6/40, {{a very small}} light tank with a 20 mm Breda cannon and <b>rivetted</b> <b>construction.</b> A medium tank, based on the Vickers Six-Tonner, was the M11-M13 series which {{had a very good}} 47 mm gun, but very thin armor.|$|R

50|$|Hungary {{produced}} the Toldi {{as well as}} a medium tank, the Turan. The Turan I was based on a prototype of Czech medium tank Škoda T-21 (Š-II-c), had <b>rivetted</b> <b>construction,</b> and a 40 mm gun. The later Turan II had a 75 mm gun. During World War II these tanks were supplemented by several dozen imported German vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The boiler was of <b>rivetted</b> <b>construction</b> and {{comprised}} several sections. The outer firebox was {{topped with}} a semi-circular dome that extended forward over the boiler barrel and acted as a steam collection space. In addition there was a steam dome on the front section of the boiler. The two spring balance safety valves were located on the outer firebox.|$|R
50|$|In June 1941, 116 Stridsvagn m/41 SI were ordered. These were {{delivered}} from December 1942 - August 1943. The Stridsvagn m/41 was of <b>rivetted</b> <b>construction</b> which made manufacture easier. As with the preceding Strv m/38-Strv m/40, it was {{armed with a}} 37 mm Bofors m/38 gun, and the first batch had the same engine as the Strv m/40L, the Scania-Vabis type 1664.|$|R

Kalakala was the first vessel on which the new technique was used. [...] The new bridge and wheelhouse were built entirely out of copper, from fear that the steel used {{in the rest of}} the vessel would interfere with the ship's compass.|$|R

Construction was rushed by {{plans to have}} Emperor Hirohito attend the launching ceremony and due to inexperience with the electric arc welding method, portions of the hull warped during construction. Immediately after the launching ceremony, Taigei was returned to the dry dock for repairs and modifications, which involved replacement of damaged sections by the traditional <b>rivet</b> <b>construction</b> method.|$|R

50|$|These {{coaches were}} of <b>rivetted</b> <b>construction</b> in {{accordance}} with the standards of the time. They had an open 3rd class section with a centre aisle and 2+3 seating arrangement, and four 2nd class compartments each with six seats. As on express coaches, the entrances were inset, but the roof was of basket arch design at the coach ends, as on the Class 28 Rheingold Express coaches. The entrances at the ends of each coach had double doors for 3rd class and a single swing door for 2nd class. By each of the entrance ways was a toilet with a wash basin. The windows were 800 mm wide in 3rd class and one metre wide in 2nd class.|$|R
