40|$|Objectives: We {{examined}} (1) {{the effect}} of a counterforce forearm brace on isokinetic strength, stretch reflex, passive stretching, and proprioception of the forearm muscles in healthy subjects and (2) {{the effect of}} different strap tensions of the brace on the above variables. Design: The dominant hand of 15 healthy subjects were tested under four randomized conditions: (1) no brace, (2) brace with minimal tension, (3) brace with 2. 5 kg force tension, and (4) brace with 5 kg force tension. The tests included isokinetic wrist extensors strength, passive stretching to the wrist extensors until onset of pain, joint proprioception, and <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> of forearm extensor muscles. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance test was used to analyze the data, and significant results were further analyzed with post hoc linear contrasts with α at 0. 0083. Results: There was no difference in isokinetic strength, proprioception, and stretch <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> among the four conditions. For passive stretching, {{there was a significant difference}} (P = 0. 001) in that using a brace produced a higher pain threshold than without a brace.

In a physical contact sport like soccer, direction-specific muscle reflex responses are crucial in maintaining core stability. Delayed core muscle response times repeatedly have been reported in patients with low back pain, but no study has compared core muscle <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies</b> and postural control between soccer players and less active nonplayers. Purpose: The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether soccer players will exhibit shorter average core muscle <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies</b> along with less postural sway in response to a sudden trunk perturbation compared with nonplayers. A second goal was to see whether postural control measures are a valid, more practical alternative for the use of surface EMG in measuring reflexive core neuromuscular control. Methods: Sudden trunk loading in the frontal and sagittal plane was used in 10 high-level amateur soccer players and 11 less active nonplayers to study core muscle <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies,</b> using surface EMG of six major trunk muscles. Simultaneously, kinematic response data of a balance seat were obtained using gyroscopes measuring seat angular velocity. Results: Soccer players demonstrated shorter <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies</b> compared with nonplayers for the rectus abdominis, erector spinae, and externus obliquus muscles in response to sagittal plane perturbations. These shorter <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies</b> went along with greater seat movement in response to sudden trunk loading, with moderate correlations between the two measures. Conclusions: The results showing shorter <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies</b> and greater balancing movements for soccer players add to the debate whether more postural sway is an appropriate indicator of having less neuromuscular control...|$|R

This study aimed to measure the urethral sensory threshold and the urethro-anal <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> in healthy volunteers, establishing reading criteria, comparing the results and technique used with the literature and verifying the effect of physiological factors. Materials and methods Thirty healthy female volunteers were studied. They had an absence of genital or urinary complaints and had undergone no previous pelvic or vaginal procedures. the measurement of the urethral sensory threshold and urethro-anal <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> were performed as described. Results the determination of the urethral sensory threshold and urethro-anal <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> were obtained in 96. 6 % of the volunteers. the electrophysiological parameters did not correlate with age, parity or number of vaginal deliveries. There was a positive association of the urethral sensory threshold with height. Technical aspects were considered and compared with those in the literature as well as the advantages and limitations of the method. Conclusions the measurement of the urethral sensory threshold and urethro-anal <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> presented consistent recordings. the urethral sensory threshold should be analyzed carefully in individuals with height above the population average. Subsequent observations are necessary to clarify their function in patients with continence disturbances and to measure the urethral function, but these values can be used as normal parameters for comparison.

Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{immediate}} effects of counterforce forearm brace on isokinetic strength, stretch reflex, passive stretching pain {{threshold of the}} wrist extensors, and proprioception of the wrist in subjects with lateral humeral epicondylosis for different strap tensions of a forearm brace. Background: Counterforce forearm bracing {{has been used for}} treating lateral humeral epicondylosis, but the effect of brace tension has not been well reported. Methods and Measures: Fifteen subjects diagnosed with lateral humeral epicondylosis on their dominant arm were tested under 4 randomized conditions: (1) no brace, (2) brace with minimal tension, (3) brace with 25 -N tension, and (4) brace with 50 -N tension. The tests included isokinetic wrist extensors strength, passive stretching force in wrist flexion to elicit pain in the wrist extensors, wrist proprioception, and stretch <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> of the extensor carpi ulnaris. A repeated-measures MANOVA was used to analyze the data and significant results were further analyzed with post hoc linear contrasts (α =. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVES—There are {{at least}} three {{clinically}} indistinguishable but genetically different types of autosomal dominant pure spastic paraplegia (ADPSP). Lower urinary tract symptoms are often present but have not been described in a homogeneous patient population. In this study lower urinary tract symptoms, cystometrical, and neurophysiological characteristics are described in patients with ADPSP linked to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24.  METHODS—Lower urinary tract symptoms were recorded at an interview and according to a formalised questionnaire. Eleven patients were clinically evaluated and cystometry, measurements of the cutaneous perception threshold, bulbocavernosus <b>reflex</b> <b>latency,</b> and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) of the pudendal nerve were performed.  RESULTS—All patients experienced urinary urgency or urge incontinence. Rectal urgency and sexual dysfunction were reported by most patients. The cystometrical findings showed a mixed pattern of bladder dysfunction. The SSEPs were normal in all but the bulbocavernosus <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> was significantly prolonged in seven patients and the cutaneous perception threshold was raised in five patients.  CONCLUSIONS—Lower urinary tract symptoms and probably also bowel and sexual dysfunction in patients with ADPSP linked to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24 are due to a combination of somatic and autonomic nervous system involvement which support the proposed multisystem affection in ADPSP linked to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24. ...|$|E

In these studies, the neuronal circuitries underlying the reflex responses remain unclear due to the problem of determining the exact reflex latencies. We present a novel cumulated average method to determine the <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> during high rate stimulation of the nervous system which was proven to be significantly more accurate than the classical method. The classical method, cumulant density analysis, reveals {{the relationship between the two}} synchronously recorded signals as a function of the lag between the signals.

40|$|Involuntary {{responses}} to muscle stretch are often {{composed of a}} short-latency reflex (SLR) and more variable responses at longer latencies such as the med-ium-latency (MLR) and long-latency stretch reflex (LLR).

40|$|Chronic {{low back}} pain (CLBP) was shown to be {{associated}} with longer <b>reflex</b> response <b>latencies</b> of trunk muscles during external upper limb perturbations. One theoretical, but rarely investigated possibility for longer <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies</b> might be related to modulated somatosensory information processing. Therefore, the present study investigated somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to median nerve stimulation in CLBP patients and healthy controls (HC). Latencies of the peripheral N 9 SEP component were used as primary outcome. In addition, latencies and amplitudes of the central N 20 SEP component, sensory thresholds, motor thresholds, and nerve conduction velocity were also analyzed in CLBP patients and HC. There is a trend for the CLBP patients to exhibited longer N 9 latencies at the ipsilateral Erb’s point compared to HC. This trend is substantiated by significantly longer N 9 latencies in CLBP patients compared to normative data. None of the other parameters showed any significant difference between CLBP patients and HC. Overall, our data indicate small differences of the peripheral N 9 SEP component; however, these differences cannot explain the reflex delay observed in CLBP patients. While it was important to rule out the contribution of early somatosensory processing and to elucidate its contribution to the delayed reflex responses in CLBP patients, {{further research is needed to}} find the primary source(s) of time-delayed reflexes in CLBP...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sedative and antinociceptive effects of three dopaminergic blockers often used in veterinary medicine. The study was conducted on 10 Thoroughbred mares. Sedation was evaluated by determining the spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) in automated individual behavior stalls and by measuring head ptosis (HP). The intravenous injection of acepromazine (0. 05; 0. 08 and 0. 11 mg/kg) and azaperone (0. 25; 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/kg) did not induce significant changes on SLA. In contrast, intramuscular injection of levomepromazine caused an increase in SLA at the dosages of 0. 75 and 1. 0 mg/kg, but not at 0. 5 mg/kg. Significant head ptosis occurred with all dosages and drugs. Antinociception was determined utilizing a heat projection lamp to record the hoof withdrawal <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> (HWRL) and skin twitch <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> (STRL). Acepromazine (0. 08 mg/kg) and levomepromazine (0. 75 mg/kg) did not induce significant changes on both HWRL and STRL, but azaperone (0. 5 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in both HWRL and STRL. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test (P< 0. 05).

Procedures-Horses received each of 3 treatments (10 mL of saline [0. 9 % NaCl] solution, 5 mu g of buprenorphine/kg, or 10 mu g of buprenorphine/kg). Treatments were administered IV Order of treatments was randomized, {{and there was}} a 10 -day interval between subsequent treatments.

Antinociceptive effect was investigated by hoof-withdrawal <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> (HWRL) and skin-twitching <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> (STBL) after painful stimulation with a heat lamp. Results-Moderate excitement was observed in all horses from 5 to 10 minutes after the administration of both dosages of buprenorphine. the SLA increased significantly for 6 and 14 hours after IV administration of 5 and 10 mu g of buprenorphine/kg, respectively. Values for HWRL increased significantly only at 30 minutes after injection of 5 mu g of buprenorphine/kg, whereas STRL and HWRL each increased significantly from 1 to 6 hours (except at 2 and 4 hours) and 11 hours, respectively, after injection of 10 mu g of buprenorphine/kg. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-IV injection of buprenorphine caused a dose-dependent increase in SLA, but only the dose of 10 mu g/kg induced analgesia on the basis of results for the experimental method used.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight is {{acknowledged}} to have significant {{effects on the}} major postural muscles. However, it {{has been difficult to}} separate the effects of ascending somatosensory changes caused by the unloading of these muscles during flight from changes in sensorimotor function caused by a descending vestibulo-cerebellar response to microgravity. It is hypothesized that bed rest is an adequate model to investigate postural muscle unloading given that spaceflight and bed rest may produce similar results in both nerve axon and muscle tissue. METHODS: To investigate this hypothesis, stretch reflexes were measured on 18 subjects who spent 60 to 90 days in continuous 6 head-down bed rest. Using a motorized system capable of rotating the foot around the ankle joint (dorsiflexion) through an angle of 10 deg at a peak velocity of approximately 250 deg/sec, a stretch reflex was recorded from the subject's left triceps surae muscle group. Using surface electromyography, about 300 reflex responses were obtained and ensemble-averaged on 3 separate days before bed rest, 3 to 4 times in bed, and 3 times after bed rest. The averaged responses for each test day were examined for <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> and conduction velocity (CV) across gender and compared with spaceflight data. RESULTS: Although no gender differences were found, bed rest induced changes in <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> and CV similar to the ones observed during spaceflight. Also, a relationship between CV and loss of muscle strength in the lower leg was observed for most bed rest subjects. CONCLUSION: Even though bed rest (limb unloading) alone may not mimic all of the synaptic and muscle tissue loss that is observed as a result of spaceflight, it can serve as a working analog of flight for the evaluation of potential countermeasures that may be beneficial in mitigating unwanted changes in the major postural muscles that are observed post flight...|$|E
40|$|Kinesio Tex tape (KT) is used {{to prevent}} and treat sports-related {{injuries}} and to enhance muscle performance. It has been proposed that the direction of taping may either facilitate or inhibit the muscle by having different effects on cutaneous receptors that modulate excitability of the motor neurons. This study had 2 goals. First, we wished to determine if KT application affects muscle performance and if the method of application facilitates or inhibits muscle performance. This was assessed by measuring isokinetic knee extension peak torque in the knee extensor. Second, we assessed neurological effects of taping on the excitability of the motor neurons by measuring the <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> and action potential by electromyography (EMG) in the patellar reflex. The study was a single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial with 28 healthy volunteers with no history of knee injuries. Participants received facilitative KT treatment, inhibitory KT treatment, or Hypafix taping of the knee extensor. There were {{significant differences in the}} peak torque between 3 treatments (F[sub (2, 54) ] = 4. 873, P < 0. 01). Post hoc analysis revealed that facilitative KT treatment resulted in higher knee extensor peak torque performance than inhibitory KT treatment (P = 0. 036, effect size 0. 26). There were, however, no significant differences in the <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> (F[sub (2, 54) ] = 2. 84, P = 0. 067) nor in the EMG values (F [sub (2, 54) ] = 0. 18, P = 0. 837) in the patellar reflex between the 3 taping applications. The findings suggest that the direction of KT application over the muscle has specific effects on muscle performance. Given the magnitude of effect is small, interpretation of clinical significance should be considered with caution. The underlying mechanism warrants further investigation.

30|$|The {{application}} of AQUA TITAN-treated tape to the triceps surae complex during and following strenuous running decreased short <b>latency</b> <b>reflex</b> response time and maintained Achilles tendon stiffness, relative to untreated placebo tape. The inference from the short <b>latency</b> <b>reflex</b> outcome suggests faster reflex motor control {{as the most}} likely mechanism responsible for the tendon response, which might improve musculotendinous performance. These findings may explain, in part, faster restoration of running economy reported with {{application of}} AQUA TITAN-treated garments during recovery from strenuous exercise. A {{greater understanding of the}} physical mechanism of action of dermally-applied AQUA TITAN-treated materials on the physiological processes influencing musculotendinous recovery is required to provide further evidence in support of the restoration hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{sensorimotor}} {{influence of}} the lateral ankle ligaments in muscle activation is unclear. Hypothesis: The lateral ankle ligaments have significant sensorimotor influence on muscle activation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Muscle-firing characteristics {{in response to a}} high-speed inversion perturbation and during gait were assessed in 13 normal subjects. Solutions (1. 5 % lidocaine or a placebo of saline) were injected bilaterally into the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments (1. 5 ml per ligament) to alter peripheral afferent influence. Subjects were again tested with the same protocol. Results: The protective response of the anterior tibialis and peroneal muscles during inversion perturbation and mean muscle activation amplitude decreased during running after both injections. After injection, no significant differences were seen for muscle <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies,</b> maximum amplitude, time to maximum amplitude during inversion perturbation, or mean amplitude during walking. Conclusion: The lateral ankle ligaments have a sensorimotor influence on muscle activation. Clinical Relevance: Induced edema from the injected solutions may have altered the sensorimotor {{influence of the}} lateral ankle ligaments, thereby inhibiting the dynamic ankle stabilizers. This finding suggests that dynamic stability may be compromised because of swelling after joint injury...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- The blink <b>reflex</b> <b>latencies</b> and cephalometric indexes were {{analysed}} in 30 male {{volunteers from}} three different races, 10 white, 10 black, and 10 Oriental. Ages ranged from 15 to 59 years, height from 1, 60 to 1, 80 m, and weight from 60 to 80 kg. Blink reflexes were obtained after unilateral electric stimulation of the supraorbital nerve for quantitative analysis of 3 responses, early ipsilateral (R 1), late ipsilateral (R 2 i) and late contralateral (R 2 c), obtained from the orbicularis oculi muscle. Cephalometric indexes were calculated by multiplying the ratio between the longer transverse and the longer sagital head diameters by 100. The R 1, R 2 i and R 2 c latencies were consistent with other published papers revealing no differences between the different racial groups. The mean of the cephalometric indexes of each group were consistent with respective racial characteristics. This study revealed {{that there are no}} differences between R 1, R 2 i and R 2 c latencies in the 3 different studied races. KEY WORDS: blink reflex, races.

40|$|Lateral humeral epicondylosis (tennis elbow) is {{a common}} {{clinical}} condition affecting the middle-aged group in particular. Its usual clinical managements include therapeutic exercises, electro-physical treatments and forearm counterforce bracing. This paper reviews the effects of forearm bracing {{in terms of the}} neuromuscular performances. There is evidence that forearm counterforce bracing can increase the stretching pain threshold of the forearm extensor muscles in both the uninjured and people with lateral epicondylosis, but {{it does not seem to}} have significant effects on the strength, proprioception and stretch <b>reflex</b> <b>latency</b> of the forearm muscles. The effect on the pain threshold may depend on the tension in the brace - up to 50 N of brace tension was found to be better than lower tension levels in uninjured subjects and those with symptoms of lateral epicondylosis.

40|$|<b>Reflex</b> <b>latency</b> {{variability}} {{was established}} for single motor neuron discharges in the bulbocavernosus reflex, as elicited by electrical stimuli to the dorsal penile nerve and recorded {{by a single}} fibre EMG electrode in the bulbocavernosus muscle. Whereas many reflex responses had a rather large latency variability of above 1000 /is (expressed as SD of mean latency) {{there was a group}} of motor neurons with a variability of around 500 /is. Single motor neuron reflex responses with shorter latencies tended to show less varia-bility. No habituation of single motor neuron reflex discharges was observed on prolonged regular repetitive stimulation. Both absence of habituation and the relatively low latency variability of bulbocavernosus reflex responses for single motor neurons suggest similarities between this reflex and the first component of the blink reflex; we postulate that the shortest bulbocavernosus reflex pathway is oligosynaptic...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionWhen {{the spine}} is {{subjected}} to perturbations, neuromuscular responses such as reflex muscle contractions contribute to the overall balance control and spinal stabilization mechanisms. These responses are influenced by muscle fatigue, which {{has been shown to}} trigger changes in muscle recruitment patterns. Neuromuscular adaptations, e. g. attenuation of reflex activation and/or postural oscillations following repeated unexpected external perturbations, have also been described. However, the characterization of these adaptations still remains unclear. Using high-density electromyography (EMG) may help understand how the nervous system chooses to deal with an unknown perturbation in different physiological and/or mechanical perturbation environments. AimTo characterize trunk neuromuscular adaptations following repeated sudden external perturbations after a back muscle fatigue task using high-density EMG. MethodsTwenty-five healthy participants experienced a series of 15 sudden external perturbations before and after back muscle fatigue. Erector spinae muscle activity was recorded using high-density EMG. Trunk kinematics during perturbation trials were collected using a 3 -D motion analysis system. A two-way repeated measure ANOVA was conducted to assess 1 the adaptation effect across trials, 2 the fatigue effect, and 3 the interaction effect (fatigue x adaptation) for the baseline activity, the <b>reflex</b> <b>latency,</b> the reflex peak and trunk kinematic variables (flexion angle, velocity and time to peak velocity). Muscle activity spatial distribution before and following the fatigue task was also compared using t-tests for dependent samples. ResultsAn attenuation of muscle reflex peak was observed across perturbation trials before the fatigue task, but not after. The spatial distribution of muscle activity was significantly higher before the fatigue task compared to post-fatigue trials. Baseline activity showed a trend to higher values after muscle fatigue, as well as reduction through perturbation trials. Main effects of fatigue and adaptation were found for time to peak velocity. No adaptation nor fatigue effect were identified for <b>reflex</b> <b>latency,</b> flexion angle or trunk velocity. ConclusionThe results show that muscle fatigue leads to reduced spatial distribution of back muscle activity and suggest a limited ability to use across-trial redundancy to adapt EMG reflex peak and optimize spinal stabilization using retroactive control...|$|E
40|$|Adaptation of {{reflexes}} to {{environment and}} {{task at hand}} is a key mechanism in optimal motor control, possibly regulated by the cortex. In order to locate the corticospinal integration, i. e. spinal or supraspinal, and to study the critical temporal window of reflex adaptation, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and upper extremity muscle stretch reflexes at high temporal precision. In twelve participants (age 49 ± 13 years, eight male), afferent signals were evoked by 40 ms ramp and subsequent hold stretches of the m. flexor carpi radialis (FCR). Motor conduction delays (TMS time of arrival at the muscle) and TMS-motor threshold were individually assessed. Subsequently TMS pulses at 96 % of active motor threshold were applied with a resolution of 5 – 10 ms between 10 ms before and 120 ms after onset of series of FCR stretches. Controlled for the individually assessed motor conduction delay, subthreshold TMS was found to significantly augment EMG responses between 60 and 90 ms after stretch onset. This sensitive temporal window suggests a cortical integration consistent with a long <b>latency</b> <b>reflex</b> period rather than a spinal integration consistent with a short <b>latency</b> <b>reflex</b> period. The potential cortical role in reflex adaptation extends over the full long <b>latency</b> <b>reflex</b> period, suggesting adaptive mechanisms beyond reflex onset...|$|R

30|$|The large {{reduction}} in short <b>latency</b> <b>reflex</b> suggests that AQUA TITAN tape has a neurological effect on muscular coordination. Korte (2008) reported that mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons {{mounted on a}} slide under AQUA TITAN tape had lower resting-membrane potential and dose-sensitive firing rates reducing the capacity for long term potentiation induction. Since the short <b>latency</b> <b>reflex</b> {{is dependent on the}} balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from receptors and in turn modulates the excitability of motor neurons (Hultborn et al. 1987), the present faster tendon-tap reflex suggests that faster nerve conduction through a reflex arc might improve the in vivo peripheral motor control. The peripheral response may, via afferent feedback networks, also influence central motor centres increasing the potential for alterations in postural balance or cyclic tasks that utilize acute feedback to improve contractile function or provide musculoskeletal stability during movement (Ishikawa and Komi 2007).|$|R
