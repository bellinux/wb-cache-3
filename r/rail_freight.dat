5|$|Victoria {{does not}} have a {{dominant}} mining base as with other states, and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture for <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> traffic. By the 1990s road transport had captured most general freight traffic, with an average of only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried each year between 1996 and 1998; containers being the major cargo, followed by cement, logs, quarry products and steel.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> {{levels are}} far down {{compared}} to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried {{into and out of}} London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.|$|E
50|$|In June 2009 the Queensland Government {{announced}} the privatisation of Queensland <b>Rail's</b> <b>freight</b> business. This resulted in Queensland <b>Rail's</b> <b>freight</b> assets being transferred to QR National (now Aurizon) from 1 July 2010.|$|R

5|$|Hisar is {{a railway}} {{junction}} station, and it falls under Bikaner division of North Western Railway Zone. The first railway {{line to the}} city was laid down in 1883 when Delhi Rewari Railway was extended to Bhatinda. Currently, four broad gauge railway lines are at the station. The railway station {{is a part of}} Western Dedicated <b>Rail</b> <b>Freight</b> Corridor according to which the city is to be developed as an export-oriented industrial unit. The city is well connected to the neighboring states through rail links.|$|E
5|$|The city enjoys strong musical traditions, both {{classical}} and alternative, underground and popular, with educational and performance {{institutions such as}} the concert halls of Musikhuset, the opera of Den Jyske Opera, Aarhus Symfoniorkester (Aarhus Symphony Orchestra) and Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium (Royal Academy of Music, Aarhus/Aalborg). Musikhuset is the largest concert hall in Scandinavia, with seating for more than 3,600 people. Other major music venues include VoxHall, rebuilt in 1999, and the associated venue of Atlas, Train nightclub at the harbourfront, and Godsbanen, a former <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> station.|$|E
5|$|The Østfold Line is {{the railway}} that connects Norway to Continental Europe, and 80% of all land-based, {{international}} freight transport goes through Østfold. Until the Follo Line opens, there cannot be a capacity increase on international freight trains to Norway. The Rail Administration {{has set a}} goal of tripling the amount of <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> by 2040, which for the South Corridor is equal to the removal of 750 trucks per day from European Route E18. The Follo Line will also allow freight trains to pass during rush hour.|$|E

5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954. British <b>Rail</b> <b>freight</b> traffic continued {{to pass through the}} station until 1964. After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Amarillo has no {{passenger}} rail service but remains {{an important part}} of the <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> system. The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day. The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Technicolor Corporation {{contracted}} with SRI {{to develop a}} near-instantaneous, electro-optical alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design {{and development of the}} Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy's development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.|$|E

5|$|In 1993 the Kennett Government offered long-distance country rail {{services}} previously {{run by the}} government-owned operator V/Line {{to private}} operators. While several rail services were replaced by road coach services, West Coast Railway successfully tendered to operate the railway line to Warrnambool, becoming the first private operator in Victoria. In 1993 Professor Fred Hilmer presented {{the findings of the}} National Competition Policy Review Committee, known as the Hilmer Report, leading to the introduction of National Competition Policy in 1995. This allowed new <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> operators to establish operations in Victoria. Specialised Container Transport commenced operating trains to Perth in 1995, and Great Northern Rail Services started intrastate operations.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in <b>rail</b> <b>freight.</b> In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham container service.|$|E
5|$|The North of England pioneered rail transport. Milestones {{include the}} 1758 Middleton Railway in Leeds, the first railway {{authorised}} by Act of Parliament {{and the oldest}} continually operating in the world; the 1825 Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first public railway to use steam locomotives; and the 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first modern main line. Today the region retains many of its original railway lines, including the East Coast and West Coast main lines and the Cross Country Route. Passenger numbers on Northern routes increased over 50% between 2004 and 2016, and Northern England handles over half of total UK <b>rail</b> <b>freight,</b> but infrastructure is poorly funded compared to Southern railways: railways in London received £5426 per resident in 2015 while those in the North East received just £223 per resident, and journeys between major cities are slow and overcrowded. To combat this, the Department of Transport has devolved many of its powers to Rail North, an alliance of local authorities from the Scottish Borders down to Staffordshire which manages the Northern Rail and TransPennine Express franchises that operate many routes in Northern England. Meanwhile, new build such as the Northern Hub around Manchester, High Speed 2 from Manchester and Leeds to London and High Speed 3 from Liverpool to Hull and Newcastle is planned to increase capacity on important Northern routes and decrease travel times.|$|E

5|$|The B {{became part}} of the larger C system through a merger with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. The freight {{operation}} on the island was renamed the Staten Island Railroad Corporation in 1971. The B and C became isolated from their other properties in New Jersey and Staten Island, with the creation of Conrail on April 1, 1976, by merger of bankrupt lines in the northeast United States. As a result, their freight service was truncated to Philadelphia, however, for several years afterward, one B freight train a day ran to Cranford Junction, with B locomotives running through as well. By the year 1973, the Jersey Central's car float yard at Jersey Central was closed. Afterwards, the car float operation of the B was brought back to Staten Island at Saint George Yard. This car float operation was taken over by the New York Dock Railway in September 1979, and was ended the following year. Only a few isolated industries on Staten Island were using rail service for freight, meaning that the yard at Saint George was essentially abandoned. The C system was forced to sell the Staten Island Railroad to the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad, which was owned by the Delaware Otsego Corporation in April 1985, {{due to a lack of}} business. The Susquehanna then embargoed the track east of Elm Park on the North Shore Branch, ending <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> traffic to Saint George. In 1990, Procter & Gamble, the line's largest customer closed, leading to a large drop in freight traffic. The last freight train over the bridge came in 1990, and the operation ended on July 25, 1991, when the Arthur Kill Bridge was taken out of service. Afterwards, the North Shore Branch and the Arthur Kill Bridge were taken over by CSX. The line as well as the bridge were purchased again in 1994, this time by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), whose purchase was followed by a decade of false starts.|$|E
