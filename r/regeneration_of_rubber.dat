My main reasons for coming here are personal: to look up the graves and {{dwellings}} of my great-grandparents, Salomon and Rebecka Alexander, and to explore the city and the university where my grandfather, Paul Alexander, grew up and studied. But I thought that {{it would be nice to}} combine the business of family pilgrimage with the pleasure of giving a math talk. I am very grateful to Wolfgang Hackbusch for kindly accepting my offer to give a seminar talk here. I am also very thankful to all of you for coming! Even though this talk is supposed to be on math rather than on family history, let me nevertheless spend a few minutes telling you about my grandfather Paul Alexander, to whom this talk is dedicated. A Few Words about Paul Alexander 1. Paul got his Dr. Phil. in 1897, here in Leipzig. His dissertation was entitled: “ Über die Einwirkung von o-Nitrobenzylchlorid auf Natriummalonsäureäthylester”. 2. Paul was the inventor of efficient verfahrens for the <b>regeneration</b> (recycling) <b>of</b> caoutchouc (<b>rubber).</b> 3. Paul had many patents, e. g.

However, information about the effects <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> size on {{the properties}} <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> cement-based materials, especially pore structure, mechanical strengths, and drying shrinkage properties, remains limited. Three groups <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> with major particle sizes of 2 – 4 mm, 1 – 3 mm, and 0 – 2 mm were selected in this study. This paper presents experimental studies on the effects <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> size on the consistency, fresh density, pore structure, mechanical properties, and drying shrinkage properties <b>of</b> crumb <b>rubber</b> mortars (CRMs).

By contrast, the influence <b>of</b> the <b>rubber</b> size on the mesopore (< 50 nm) volume is not as significant as that <b>of</b> the <b>rubber</b> content. The mechanical properties of CRMs decreased with the rubber size. Low rubber stiffness and large pore volumes, especially those <b>of</b> small sized <b>rubbers,</b> contribute to the reduction of CRMs strength.

This method consists of net export/total trade ratio and export performance ratio. For the trend analysis, researchers found out that the fluctuation happens on each types <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> during the period of export performance.
