[...] Monica Herrerra of Billboard {{magazine}} wrote: [...] "Rihanna effectively assumes the hip-hop posture and even recruits the ultimate street cred booster in rapper Young Jeezy, who provides the thrust needed to send a song with a somewhat inert chorus home". Herrerra continued, [...] "Though 'Hard' doesn't find Rihanna in her typical comfort zone, the atypical is precisely what she has aimed for with her new material—and it works". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy" [...] the highlights of Rated R, and wrote, [...] "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a sulky, icy, monotone". Petridis {{also noted that the}} song [...] "undercuts the standard braggathon of Hard—'fan mail from 27 million. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Rihanna's vocal style and the persona she adopts in the song. Greenblatt wrote, [...] "Rihanna dons hip-hop swagger like borrowed armor, leaning heavily on her Caribbean accent and unleashing a string of baddest-bitch boasts via dancehall-riddim'd bangers like 'Hard,' 'G4L,' and 'Wait Your Turn. Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media wrote, [...] "the bulletproof guise is good for the record's high point on 'Hard', a strutting statement of power bolstered by a <b>roiling</b> undertow of a beat from 'Umbrella' producer Tricky Stewart." ...|$|E
500|$|Kofi Outlaw, Editor-in-Chief at Screenrant.com, gave Man of Steel a 4 out of 5 star review, {{stating that}} [...] "Man of Steel {{has more than}} earned its keep, and deserves to be THE iconic Superman movie for a whole new generation". He {{would go on to}} name Man of Steel the best Superhero movie of 2013. Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave Man of Steel a 9 out of 10 while praising the action {{sequences}} and the performances of Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it a 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said rebooting the franchise was unnecessary, but that the film was confident enough and Snyder's attention to detail careful enough that audiences could overlook another reboot. PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III, wrote, [...] "The path of this flawed savior isn’t quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comic book-divergent choices. On the other hand, barring Lois Lane’s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction’s greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of Man of Steel is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created… with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times stated that, [...] "Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew." [...] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said, [...] "The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s <b>roiling</b> humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just okay, but the man part is super." [...] In a review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing movie" [...] and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod. But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois. In 2014, Empire ranked Man of Steel the 286th greatest film ever made on their list of [...] "The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time" [...] as voted by the magazine's readers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC) {{was formed}} by 250 congregations that had left the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS) in a schism precipitated by {{disputes}} over biblical inerrancy {{as part of the}} overall Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy that was <b>roiling</b> American Protestant churches.

2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the album from music critics was highly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Naturally, {{there is quite a}} bit of <b>roiling</b> darkness here -- they're Cure-loving metalheads, it's in their blood -- but there's shade and light, control of texture, with the band deepening rather than expanding." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press also awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Unlike their alleged 'peers' (do they really have any?), Deftones learned years ago that a whisper can be more terrifying than a scream and power isn't always about BPMs and downstrokes per minute." [...] He also added that Diamond Eyes [...] "belongs in a pantheon of amazing albums born from tragedy". BBC writer Mike Diver was also impressed, and opined that the album [...] "knocks every pretender to the band's throne into the middle of next week". He praised the band for playing to their strengths, and summarized: [...] "Eros is reportedly their excursion into weirdness, while this is a statement of consolidation, a neatly segued set that finds Deftones playing to their well-established strengths." ...|$|E

In July, urban areas of Kure are firebombed, {{and most of}} the city burns. Suzu is nearly killed by a U.S. low-level strafing run, but saved by Shūsaku. Like many other Japanese, Suzu is unable to avoid tragedy; in addition to the death of her brother Yōichi, Suzu loses her niece, Harumi, and her right hand, which she describes as an [...] "irreplaceable" [...] part of her body due to its dominance, when a delay-action bomb detonates very close to them. As she suffers from depression, Suzu debates returning to the relative safety of her hometown (Eba) in Hiroshima City in time for the local summer festival on August 6; when she is unable to see a doctor, however, she decides to stay an extra week in Kure. On that particular morning, Suzu, still at her marriage home in Kure, notices a bizarre light and an abrupt quake from a distance. Strangely, Hiroshima Radio Station of Japan Broadcasting Corporation goes off the air, and a towering, <b>roiling</b> cloud rises ominously over the mountain from the direction of Hiroshima City. Soon, Suzu learns what has occurred in Hiroshima City; a new, devastating bomb has fallen on the town, destroying countless citizens and buildings in Hiroshima City. For a while, Suzu is unable to enter or get information about her hometown.|$|E

60|$|It is {{remarkable}} how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods, and still sustain {{themselves in the}} neighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters only. How retired the otter manages to live here! He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in the woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an hour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from under Brister's Hill, half a mile from my field. The approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young pitch pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to sit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without <b>roiling</b> it, and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the woodcock led her brood, to probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank, while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me, she would leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract my attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up their march, with faint, wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as she directed. Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the parent bird. There too the turtle doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white pines over my head; or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly familiar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns.|$|E
