5|$|Introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system. In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the Fit and the Insight platform is the position of the fuel tank. While the Fit locates the fuel tank under the front seats, the Insight positions the fuel tank under the <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b> This allows the Insight’s hybrid battery pack to be located in the cargo floor below the spare tire, to accommodate folding <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> lower roofline, and a more aerodynamic body shape.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the noise {{performance}} for the seat adjuster mechanism, noise and vibration measurements were conducted in both European and Australian cars for six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations on the driver's seat. The six modes of the driver's seat operations are: both up for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, both down for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, front seat end up, front <b>seat</b> end down, <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end up and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end down. The eight modes of the seat operations are: forward, backward, both up for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, both down for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, front seat end up, front <b>seat</b> end down, <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end up and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and the root causes for the noise problems have been analysed and discussed for the six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations. The noise characteristics have been identified; the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify the sound quality of the seat adjuster and the assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} {{the effect of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> {{structure}} on child occupant protection. According to GB 15083 - 2006 standard, a finite element model of luggage cabin and rear-row seat was developed in LS-DYNA and validated via test results. The model was used in analysis of the safety performance of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> structure under luggage impact in car frontal crashes, in order to minimize the risk of child occupant injury. A 3 years old child seat was simulated with fixing on the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> Four optimization schemes were designed {{in order to reduce the}} intrusion and acceleration of the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> structure, comparing to the original model. The original model was improved via the structure optimization of <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> as well as the fixed positions of child seat. A verification model is developed to simulate <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> impact with combined optimization schemes. The final results from the verification model show that the intrusion and acceleration of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> structure are all much smaller than original seat model...|$|R

40|$|Major {{gains in}} {{occupant}} protection in automotive crashes {{have been made}} {{over the past few}} decades, with the introduction of technologies such as airbags and seat belt pretensioners. However, the focus, both in terms of regulation and consumer testing, has been on front <b>seat</b> occupants. With <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants being over-represented in vehicle fatalities, {{there is a need to}} examine protection offered to those who sit in the back seat of motor vehicles. This thesis consists of six inter-related studies focused on characterising the rates and biomechanical mechanisms of the injury to <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants (not using child restraints), and evaluations of both existing and novel technologies for improving injury outcomes for <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. The methods used include in-depth crash investigation and crash sled testing, with a focus on children aged 8 - 16 and older occupants. The results of these studies indicate that substantial casualty savings in <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants might be achieved through the implementation of existing technology to front seat occupants. While the results of the in-depth crash investigation demonstrated that injury mechanisms differ between front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, it was found from sled testing that tailoring existing technologies to meet the needs of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, such as younger and older occupants, may substantially improve <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant protection. Vehicle regulation and consumer testing has previously been an effective method for driving improvements in occupant protection, and it is recommended that vehicle regulation bodies incorporate requirements for performance of the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant protection system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} seat belt laws and public {{education}} campaigns on seat belt use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on seat belt use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater seat belt usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory seat belt use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of seat belt use among <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt use, was calculated by gender before and after the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt legislation came into effect. Results Among <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4. We registered no statistically significant changes over time in the over-reporting factor, nor any major differences between genders. Conclusion Self-reported seat belt usage by rear passengers represents an efficient alternative to observational studies for tracking changes in actual behavior, although the reported figures need to be adjusted using an appropriate over-reporting factor in order to gain an idea of genuine seat belt use. </p...|$|R
