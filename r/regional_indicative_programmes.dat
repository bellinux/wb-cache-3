While the target timeline is questionable with year 2015 fast approaching, the goal to increase irrigated areas to 7 % is certainly valid and has significant implications for regional food security and livelihood of rural population. The objective {{of this paper is}} to examine water resources in conjunction with the status of irrigation development in SADC region, and assess water availability for irrigation development. The desktop analysis builds largely upon literature, existing projects and products to integrate baseline information. The results reveal that water is sufficiently available for doubling irrigation without hampering too much on environment even with the possible impacts imposed by climate change. The potential is however largely variable from country to country, and basin to basin.

The <b>Regional</b> <b>indicative</b> strategic developmental plan has moved significant strides in the process of regional integration. The main thrust of this research is to empirically evaluate the pace and progress of the development plan against the objectives of SADC. To achieve this, the study uses surveys and in depth interviews to assess the extent to which SADC has managed to meet the timelines set in the plan against the achieved set milestones. The study seeks to critically assess the feasibility of a customs union in SADC, taking into consideration the economic disparities that exist within the regional block. Furthermore the study assesses the member states response to the convergence targets that form the foundation of monetary integration through case studies and key informant interviews. If SADC member states achieve monetary integration, it will be feasible for the states to achieve a single currency which is scheduled for 2018. The single currency will be administered by a regional central bank. Therefore considering the advances of SADC in the integration process the study sums up that full integration is feasible even though the timelines of the strategic plan will not be met...|$|R

Accordingly, in its policies toward Central Asia, the bloc, as the <b>indicative</b> <b>programmes</b> of its Development Cooperation Instrument suggest (European Commission, 2007, 2011, 2014), primarily concentrates on the furtherance of regional collaboration and good neighbourly relations, improvement of living standards and lessening of poverty as well as energy, environmental and water projects. Incidentally, the 2007 Strategy also mentions human rights and democratisation as dimensions of the EU’s activities, but they are coupled with good governance (Council of the EU, 2007 : pp. 7 – 9), to which the EU, as some researchers argue, tends to give priority. Meden (2012 : p. 59), for instance, points out that Brussels is shifting its focus from democracy promotion to fight against corruption, on paper, however, continuing to demand democratisation.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of individual farmers participation in the National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi (NASFAM). Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM {{is a form of}} producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's <b>Regional</b> <b>Indicative</b> Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access. © 2013 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa...|$|R

The aim of the programme, {{which is to be}} implemented over a six-year period, is to create the necessary capacities in ACP countries so that they can benefit from increased trading opportunities. Commenting on the programme, the EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said 'we need to ensure that the benefits from better trading opportunities translate into growth and development'. He spoke explicitly about sending the right signals to developing countries ahead of the Cancun WTO Ministerial. Commissioner Lamy emphasised that trade assistance is a key element of the EU-ACP EPA currently being negotiated. The trade-{{assistance programme}} is identified as important in enhancing ACP participation in trade negotiations, integrating trade into development strategies, ensuring that goods are produced to the requisite international standards and promoting ACP capacity to export. There are three main components to this trade. com programme: strengthening local capacities to formulate trade policies, while encouraging the participation of all stakeholders in the process; assistance for ongoing trade negotiations by establishing a unique network of ACP trade experts (this component is known as a 'hub and spoke' programme with the secondment of senior advisors - the hub - to regional organisations, and experts in national ministries -the spokes); funding of pilot projects to address institutional and supply-side constraints with a special emphasis on enabling ACP countries to meet technical standards and sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements, which the Commission acknowledged 'represent a major obstacle to improving their export performance'. Comment: The funds committed represent an average of less than € 660, 000 per ACP country for trade related technical assistance With an implementation period of six years this represents only € 110, 000 per annum per ACP country.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{commissioned}} by Norad. The Report provides {{an assessment of the}} institutional restructuring of SADC and an input to the planning of future Norwegian assistance to regional co-operation in Southern Africa. The institutional reforms mainly revolve around the changing role and functions of the SADC Secretariat but also include the sector co-ordinating units in member states which have been found highly uneven in their ability to pursue and implement policies; the establishment of SADC National Committees in member countries; greater emphasis on the role of non-state actors; a SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security which became part of the SADC structure; and the preparation of a <b>Regional</b> <b>Indicative</b> Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) intended to make SADC’s objectives more operational. The report finds the reforms major and significant steps to address the weaknesses associated with the old SADC structure. It is found significant that SADC has managed to make progress in several policy areas despite political divisions in the Southern African region. Looking at the future, the report concludes that it will be important to ensure that all member countries benefit from the membership to some degree; points out that regional integration will not succeed only on perceptions of economic costs and benefits in individual member countries but also depends on political will and commitment; argues that the RISDP is extremely important for the future success in delivery and creation of a common understanding of SADC’s role; emphasises South Africa’s crucial role in advancing regional co-operation; and finds that overlapping regional integration efforts in Southern Africa, like the relation between SADC and Comesa, may become more problematic with the move to economic integration. SADC should not be expected to make rapid progress in implementation and delivery in the short run. Progress will rather be an incremental process that will require time and astute management. Norway must be prepared for continued flexibility and shortterm assistance in its support, and build capacity for monitoring and analysis. In the medium to long-term, Norwegian support should focus on SADC’s core areas of operations. Norway should follow closely SADC’s efforts to facilitate conflict resolution and political stability and, in its assistance to individual SADC member countries, support projects and programmes that enable the countries to benefit from regional co-operation...|$|R
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} and explores the Southern African Development Community’s {{activities}} {{to determine whether}} the intended objectives have been accomplished as stated in its purpose statement. The study argues that the achievement of the Southern Africa Development Community’s purpose statement is important with regard to the implementation of developmental initiatives. This is because the SADC objectives are measured in the operationalisation and implementation of policies and the operationalisation of key activities. The Southern African region is rich in natural resources but lacks the political will and capacity for the institutionalisation of key processes to, among others, alleviate poverty and HIV/AIDS and address human security matters. This study revealed that SADC did not achieve all its intended objectives. Several challenges, such as the full convertibility of regional currencies among member states still need to be addressed. One of the major challenges impacting negatively on the implementation and completion of SADC’s projects are the capacity, skills and expertise to drive key business processes. This study has found that in spite of complexities and challenges to implement SADC’s policies and programmes as stated in its purpose statement, {{there is a need to}} align the member states’ priorities with SADC’s objectives to maximise impact and overall successful execution thereof. Coupled with this challenge is another crucial challenge relating to the SADC structure, mechanisms and methodologies that are used for achieving SADC’s objectives. The study revealed that the structures, mechanisms and methodologies are inadequate to successfully implement and evaluate SADC’s projects. Consequently, this study proposes some reforms in SADC’s <b>Regional</b> <b>Indicative</b> Strategic Plan that should be considered and integrated into the national plans, budgets and priorities of all SADC member states. Critically, it is important to ensure the alignment and buy-in of member states with regard to the development and implementation of SADC’s projects and programmes in the Southern African region. Firstly, the study proposes that partnerships with research institutions should be explored to strengthen the limited capacity of SADC’s Secretariat. Benchmarking and best practices with other international government organisations such as the African Union and the United Nations will provide a platform to improve the current activities of SADC to be more focused towards the desired outcomes. Secondly, v SADC’s activities that are linked to its objectives should be intensified through the mobilisation of resources and expertise that are geared to all key result areas to improve regional integration and ultimately the achievement of SADC’s objectives as stated in its purpose statement.

30|$|Restoring fire to oak-dominated {{ecosystems}} in {{the eastern}} United States {{has the potential to}} increase groundcover plant diversity, both in terms of increased species richness and, more importantly, increased abundance of <b>regional</b> endemics <b>indicative</b> of rare habitats. Prescribed burning alone, however, most likely will not greatly increase diversity in the short term. Ideally, frequent prescribed burning should be coupled with overstory canopy reduction, while being particularly mindful of minimizing disturbance of the groundcover vegetation when felling or removing trees (Brewer et al. 2012). In areas where timber harvest is not practical, prescribed burning could be implemented in anticipation of, or following, natural wind-throw disturbances (e.g., tornadoes, derechos, hurricanes) to restore groundcover vegetation of fire-maintained open woodlands. Alternatively, more intense prescribed fires that cause some overstory canopy damage might produce similar results to those caused by the combined effects of fire and wind-throw damage. Although there are good reasons to be cautious about the application of fire to oak-dominated ecosystems {{in the eastern}} United States (Brewer et al. 2015), there are also consequences to inaction. Given our incomplete knowledge of how fire will interact with different soil types, land-use histories, and climate change, a prudent approach to fire management in Eastern oak and oak-pine ecosystems would be experimental application of fire with appropriate controls.|$|R
