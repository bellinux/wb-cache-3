Currently, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration</b> by forests on the continent has been estimated at 0. 23 petagrams of carbon per year, though the uncertainty about this estimate is nearly 50 %. This offsets about 13 % of the fossil fuel emissions from the continent [Pacala et al., 2007].

40|$|Tropical forests have a {{valuable}} role in relation to climate change, being a source and sink of carbon. This paper reviews the state of knowledge on carbon stocks and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration</b> of various forest ecosystems in the Philippines. Carbon density ranges widely from less than 5 t/ha to more than 200 t/ha in the following order: old growth forests> secondary forest> mossy forest> mangrove forest> pine forest> tree plantation> agroforestry farm> brushlands> grasslands. Carbon sequestration ranges from less than 1 t/ha/yr in natural forests to more than 15 t/ha/yr in some tree plantations. Land-use change and forestry make an important contribution in the national emissions and sinks. It is estimated that Philippine forest lands are a net sink of greenhouse gasses (GHG) absorbing 107 Mt CO 2 equivalent in 1998, about equal to the total Philippine GHG emissions.

40|$|Abstract As humans {{continue}} to impact the Critical Zone, {{we need to}} project how our environment will evolve into the future. To model such change requires the ability to simulate interactions among the lithosphere, pedosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere — including the activities of humans. Such projections, which some have called earthcasts, must be made with mechanistic models that capture the important phenomena, as well as scenarios of human behavior. As an example, we present earthcasts of future weathering in the mid-continent of the USA {{into the next century}} <b>of</b> projected warming. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 from the atmosphere due to weathering will change in the future as carbonate and silicate minerals are dissolved or precipitated in soil. The downward or upward advance of the carbonate reaction front in the soil is an analogue of the oceanic lysocline.

Understanding this and other responses to perturbations will best be achieved using multiple models for earthcasting...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{of an active}} material for treating uranium contaminated groundwater within a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) is reported. This material, called PANSIL, has a tailored ligand system that selectively removes the uranyl (UO 22 +) cation from solution. The active uranyl ligand in PANSIL is a polyacryloamidoxime resin derived from polyacrylonitrile, which is deposited from solution {{onto the surface of}} quartz sand to form a thin film coating. PANSIL is effective at sequestering cationic and neutral uranyl species when the solution pH is above 4, due to the stability of the polyacryloamidoxime-uranyl complex formed. However the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration</b> decreases rapidly when the pH exceeds about 8 where neutral uranyl species are present only at very low concentrations. It can preferentially sequester UO 22 + in the presence of typical divalent groundwater cations. In mildly alkaline conditions the sequestration performance in groundwater is sensitive to the concentration of uranyl complexing ligands, such as bicarbonate. Such behaviour has important consequences for PRB design as it will determine the barrier thickness required to treat a particular groundwater flow rate...|$|E

To gain biochemical access to these compartments, the embryos were permeabilized by brief exposure to an intense electric field. Sequestration was determined as the retention of tracer, 45 Ca, after filtration of aliquots on Millipore filters. The permeabilized cells sequester Ca 2 + at a constant rate for at least 20 min, with the following characteristics: (i) ATP is required. (ii) Sequestration occurs at Ca 2 + levels corresponding to those estimated in vivo. (iii) The Ca 2 + concentration dependence of sequestration and its insensitivity to mitochondrial poisons imply that the activity derives from a single, nonmitochondrial transport system. The Ca 2 +-sequestering activities of embryos that are permeabiized at successive stages of the first cell cycle (one-cell stage) progressively increase to 5 times the initial level.

Using a two-period sequential decision making model, we analytically derive optimal rates for the two control variables, abatement and sequestration rates. Uncertainty is assumed to affect the desired future stabilization level of the CO₂ stock but is resolved prior to the decision on how much to control the stock in the second period. Contrary to recent numerical studies, we find that uncertainty can make it optimal to use carbon sequestration either earlier or later depending on the relative rates of change in both marginal cost curves and on the amount of land that can be converted to forest.

The study reports on strain development and process development. In the area of strain development, knockouts in genes which divert carbon from the enzymatic steps involved in CO{sub 2 } consumption were completed, and were shown not to affect significantly the rate of CO{sub 2 } sequestration and succinic acid generation. Furthermore, the pyc gene encoding for pyruvate carboxylase proved to be unstable when integrated onto the chromosome.

In the present work we demonstrate that glucosidase inhibitors [castanospermine (CST) and deoxynojirimycin] have a stabilizing effect on newly synthesized glucosylated N-linked glycoproteins and impaired their lysosomal delivery as shown by subcellular fractionation on Percoll gradients. The inhibition of macroautophagy was restricted to N-linked glycoproteins because macroautophagic parameters such as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration</b> of cytosolic markers and the fractional volume occupied by autophagic vacuoles were not affected in CST-treated cells. The protection of glucosylated glycoproteins from autophagic sequestration was also observed in inhibitor-treated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in Lec 23 cells (a CHO mutant deficient in glucosidase I activity). The interaction of glucosylated glycoproteins with the ER chaperone binding protein (BiP) was prolonged in inhibitor-treated cells in comparison with untreated CHO cells. These results show that the removal of glucose from N-glycans of glycoproteins is a key event for their delivery to the autophagic pathway and that interaction with BiP could prevent or delay newly synthesized glucosylated N-linked glycoproteins from being sequestered by the autophagic pathway...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} results toward {{developing a}} process to sequester CO{sub 2 } centered on the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase. The process {{involves the use of}} bacteria to convert CO{sub 2 } and glucose as a co-substrate and generates succinic acid as a commodity chemical product. The phases of research have included strain development and process development. Though we continue to work on one important component of strain development, the research has principally focused on process development. In the previous year we constructed several strains which would serve as templates for the CO{sub 2 } sequestration, including the knock-out of genes involved in the formation of undesirable byproducts. This project period the focus has been on the integration of the pyruvate carboxylase gene (pyc) onto the E. coli chromosome. This {{has proven to be a}} difficult task because of relatively low expression of the gene and resulting low enzyme activity when only one copy of the gene is present on the chromosome. Several molecular biology techniques have been applied, with some success, to improve the level of protein activity as described herein. Progress in process development has come as a result of conducting numerous fermentation experiments to select optimal conditions for CO{sub 2 } sequestration. This process-related research has progressed in four areas. First, we have clarified the range of pH which results in the optimal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration.</b> Second, we have determined how the counterion used to control the pH affects the sequestration rate. Third, we have determined how CO{sub 2 } gas phase composition impacts sequestration rate. Finally, we have made progress in determining the affect of several potential gaseous impurities on CO{sub 2 } sequestration; in particular we have completed a study using NO{sub 2 }. Although the results provide significant guidance as to process conditions for CO{sub 2 } sequestration and succinate production, in some cases we do not yet understand the underlying mechanism or reason for the observation. Also, process development has used the ''baseline'' organism in the absence of the pyruvate carboxylase gene. In some cases the conclusions regarding the process may change when the ''final'' strain is used which incorporates the key CO{sub 2 } sequestration technology...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} gain {{knowledge}} on {{the changes in}} intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) in response to increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and climate change over the last century. We investigated the variation in the iWUE of mature Fagus sylvatica trees located in the higher, central and lower altitudinal forest limits (HFL, CFA and LFL) {{of one of the}} southernmost sites of beech distribution in Europe, the Montseny Mountains in Catalonia (northeast Spain), during the last century by analysing the δ 13 C of their tree rings. Pre- and post-maturation phases of the trees presented different trends in δ 13 C, Δ 13 C, Ci (internal CO 2 concentration), iWUE and basal area increment (BAI). Moreover, these variables showed different trends and absolute values in the LFL than in the other altitudinal sites, CFA and HFL. Our results show the existence of an age effect on δ 13 C in the CFA and HFL (values increased by ca. 1. 25 ‰ coinciding with the BAI suppression and release phases, previous to maturation). These age-related changes were not found in the LFL, whose beech trees arrived to maturation earlier and experienced drier conditions during the suppression phase. In the last 26 years of comparable mature trees, the increase of iWUE deduced from the Δ 13 C analyses was ca. 10 % in LFL, ca. 6 % in CFA and not significant in HFL. These results show that climate change towards more arid conditions accounted for these higher Δ 13 C-values and increases in the LFL more than the continuous increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. This increased iWUE in the LFL did not avoid a decline in growth in these lowest altitudes of this beech southern range-edge as a result of warming. Furthermore, since there was no apparent change in iWUE and growth in the beech forests growing in the more standard-adequate environments of higher altitudes in the last 26 years, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration</b> of C into temperate ecosystems may not increase with increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations as predicted by most models based on short-term small scale experiments...|$|E
40|$|The Early Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM 2) at ~ 53. 7 Ma {{is one of}} {{multiple}} hyperthermal events that followed the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~ 56 Ma). The negative carbon excursion and deep ocean carbonate dissolution which occurred during the event imply that a substantial amount (10 3 Gt) of carbon (C) {{was added to the}} ocean-atmosphere system, consequently increasing atmospheric CO 2 (pCO 2 ). This makes the event relevant to the current scenario of anthropogenic CO 2 additions and global change. Resulting changes in ocean stratification and pH, as well as changes in exogenic cycles which supply nutrients to the ocean, may have affected the productivity of marine phytoplankton, especially calcifying phytoplankton. Changes in productivity, in turn, may affect the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration</b> of excess CO 2 in the deep ocean and sediments. In order to reconstruct the productivity response by calcareous nannoplankton to ETM 2 in the South Atlantic (Site 1265) and North Pacific (Site 1209), we employ the coccolith Sr/Ca productivity proxy with analysis of well-preserved picked monogeneric populations by ion probe supplemented by analysis of various size fractions of nannofossil sediments by ICP-AES. The former technique of measuring Sr/Ca in selected nannofossil populations using the ion probe circumvents possible contamination with secondary calcite. Avoiding such contamination is important for an accurate interpretation of the nannoplankton productivity record, since diagenetic processes can bias the productivity signal, as we demonstrate for Sr/Ca measurements in the fine (< 20 μm) and other size fractions obtained from bulk sediments from Site 1265. At this site, the paleoproductivity signal as reconstructed from the Sr/Ca appears to be governed by cyclic changes, possibly orbital forcing, resulting in a 20 – 30 % variability in Sr/Ca in dominant genera as obtained by ion probe. The ~ 13 to 21 % increase in Sr/Ca above the cyclic background conditions as measured by ion probe in dominating genera may result from a slightly elevated productivity during ETM 2. This high productivity phase is probably the result of enhanced nutrient supply either from land or from upwelling. The ion probe results show that calcareous nannoplankton productivity was not reduced by environmental conditions accompanying ETM 2 at Site 1265, but imply an overall sustained productivity and potentially a small productivity increase during the extreme climatic conditions of ETM 2 in this portion of the South Atlantic. However, in the open oceanic setting of Site 1209, a significant decrease in dominant genera Sr/Ca is observed, indicating reduced productivity...|$|E

After constraining a carbon accounting model to observed measures of growth, allocation <b>of</b> biomass, and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> litterfall and litter decomposition, the model was calibrated to maximise the efficiency of prediction of SOC and its fractions. Uncertainties in both measured and modelled results meant that efficiencies of prediction of SOC across the 125 contrasting plantings were only moderate, at 39 – 68 %. Data-informed modelling nonetheless improved confidence in outputs from scenario analyses, confirming that: (i) reforestation on agricultural land highly depleted in SOC (i. e. previously under cropping) had the highest capacity to sequester SOC, particularly where rainfall was relatively high (> 600 mm year− 1), and; (ii) decreased planting width and increased stand density and the proportion <b>of</b> eucalypts enhanced <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> SOC <b>sequestration.</b> These results improve confidence in predictions of SOC following environmental reforestation under varying conditions.

40|$|Plant {{life and}} primary {{production}} {{play an important}} role in the global carbon (C) cycle through the fixing of atmospheric C into the terrestrial biosphere. However, the <b>sequestration</b> <b>of</b> C into the soil not only depends on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> plant productivity, but also on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> litter decomposition. The triangular relationship between climate, litter quality, and litter decomposition suggests that whilst low-producing plants fix C at a slower rate than highproducing plants, they may release C at an even slower rate, due to the production of a recalcitrant litter. Here, the relationships between environment, productivity, litter quality and decomposition are investigated to determine their relative influences on C sequestration for taxa in the genus Chionochloa. Annual productivity was measured in situ for 23 taxa located across New Zealand, whilst litter and soil were collected for analyses and two ex-situ decomposition experiments; litter incubation on a common alpine soil, and litter incubation on each taxon's home-site soil. Plant growth rate was found to be positively correlated with both litter nitrogen and litter fibre content. Litter decomposition on the common soil was instead negatively correlated with lignin content, which showed a strong correlation with phylogeny, as opposed to environment or growth rate. When incubated on home-site soils, litter quality had no influence on decomposition, which was instead positively correlated with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> soil C decomposition, and negatively correlated with both soil organic matter and soil water content. On the common soil there were weak correlations between productivity and decomposition; however the proportional increase in productivity was greater than the corresponding increase in decomposition, resulting in high-producing plants sequestering C at a greater rate than low-producing plants. However, there was no correlation between productivity and decomposition on the home-site soil, with soil water content being a better predictor <b>of</b> C <b>sequestration</b> <b>rate</b> than productivity. Despite the range of variation in morphology, ecophysiology, productivity and habitat displayed within the Chionochloa genus, taxa all produced litter of a very similar quality. Breakdown of that litter is then most strongly influenced by the environment in which decomposition occurs, as opposed to the quality of the litter. Any subsequent differences in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> C <b>sequestration</b> are therefore most influenced by the environment decomposition occurs in, with wet and cool environments likely to result in increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> C <b>sequestration,</b> independent <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> productivity...|$|R

This study expands the earlier analyses by taking into account thinnings as measures to increase carbon stocks in forests, in addition to lengthening the rotation age. The results indicated that, in {{joint production}}, both the growing stock level and rotation length are increased. Postponing thinnings and reducing their intensity was more cost-effective in sequestering carbon than increasing the rotation length. The costs for moderate increases <b>of</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> were rather low, with present values of 1 – 6 € /ton CO 2, and they depended {{on the amount of}} carbon sequestered, initial stand age, site, and growing stock characteristics. For mature stands, the present value of costs to sequester a given amount of carbon was considerably higher, exceeding 20 € /ton CO 2. This was due to the higher annual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> and the fact that all the additional sequestration had to be obtained by increasing the rotation length...|$|R
40|$|The Review {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point, {{on the balance}} of probabilities {{and not as a}} matter of belief, the majority opinion of the Australian and international scientific communities that human activities resulted in substantial global warming from the mid- 20 th century, and that continued growth in greenhouse gas concentrations caused by human-induced emissions would generate high risks of dangerous climate change. A natural carbon cycle converts the sun’s energy and atmospheric carbon into organic matter through plants and algae, and stores it in the earth’s crust and oceans. Stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere requires the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gas emissions to fall to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>sequestration.</b> There are many uncertainties around the mean expectations from the science, with the possibility of outcomes that are either more benign— or catastrophic.

40|$|When {{agricultural}} land {{is no longer}} used for cultivation and allowed to revert to natural vegetation or replanted to perennial vegetation, soil organic carbon can accumulate by processes that essentially reverse some of the effects responsible for soil organic carbon losses from when the land was converted from perennial vegetation. We discuss the essential elements {{of what is known}} about soil organic matter dynamics that may result in enhanced soil carbon sequestration with changes in land-use and soil management. We review literature that reports changes in soil organic carbon after changes in land-use that favor carbon accumulation. This data summary provides a guide to approximate <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> SOC <b>sequestration</b> that are possible with management, and indicates the relative importance of some factors that influence the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> organic carbon <b>sequestration</b> in soil. There is a large amount <b>of</b> variation in <b>rates</b> and the length of time that carbon may accumulate in soil that are related to the productivity of the recovering vegetation, physical and biological conditions in the soil, and the past history of soil organic carbon inputs and physical disturbance. Maximum <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> C accumulation during the early aggrading stage of perennial vegetation growth, while substantial, are usually much less than 100 g C m y. Average <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> accumulation are similar for forest or grassland establishment: 33. 8 g C m y and 33. 2 g C m y respectively. These observed <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> soil organic C accumulation, when combined with the small amount of land area involved, are insufficient to account for a significant fraction of the missing C in the global carbon cycle as accumulating in the soils of formerly {{agricultural land}}.

40|$|Carbon (C) {{occluded}} in phytolith (PhytOC) is {{a stable}} form of C; when PhytOC {{is returned to}} the soil through litterfall it is stored in the soil which {{can be an effective}} way for long-term C sequestration. However, few estimates on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> PhytOC input to the soil are available. To better understand the seasonal dynamics of PhytOC production and the annual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> stable C <b>sequestration</b> through PhytOC input, we quantified the monthly litterfall, phytolith and PhytOC return to the soil over a year in a typical Lei bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) forest in subtropical China. The monthly litterfall ranged between 14. 81 and 131. 18 g m 22, and the phytolith concentration in the monthly litterfall samples ranged between 47. 21 and 101. 68 g kg 21 of litter mass, with the PhytOC concentration in the phytolith ranged between 29. 4 and 44. 9 g kg 21 of phytolith, equivalent to 1. 8 – 3. 6 g kg 21 of PhytOC in the litterfall (based on litterfall dry mass). The amount of phytolith input to the soil system was 292. 21669. 12 (mean 6 SD) kg ha 21 yr 21, sequestering 41. 4569. 32 kg CO 22 e ha 21 yr 21 of C in the studied Lei bamboo forest. This <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> C <b>sequestration</b> through the formation of PhytOC found in this study falls within the range <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> for other grass-type species reported in the literature.

By linking a site-specific economic simulation model of agricultural production to a crop ecosystem model, the approach shows the economic efficiency of soil carbon (C) sequestration depends on site-specific opportunity costs of changing production practices and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> soil C <b>sequestration.</b> An application is made to the dryland grain production systems of the U. S. Northern Plains which illustrates the sensitivity <b>of</b> the <b>sequestration</b> costs to policy design.

40|$|The large {{increases}} in reactive nitrogen (N) deposition {{in developed countries}} since the Industrial Revolution have had a marked impact on ecosystem functioning, including declining species richness, shifts in species composition, and increased N leaching. A potential mitigation of these harmful effects is the action of N as a fertiliser, which, through increasing primary productivity (and subsequently, organic matter production), {{has the potential to}} increase ecosystem carbon (C) storage. Here we report the response of an upland heath to 10 years of experimental N addition. We find large {{increases in}} plant and soil C and N pools, with N-driven C sequestration rates in the range of 13 – 138 kg C kg − 1. These rates are higher than those previously found in forest and lowland heath, mainly due to higher C sequestration in the litter layer. C sequestration is highest at lower N treatments (10, 20, and 40 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 above ambient), with evidence of saturation at the highest N treatment, reflecting a physiologically aged Calluna vulgaris (Calluna) canopy. To maintain these <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sequestration,</b> the Calluna canopy should be managed to maximise it's time in the building phase. Scaling our results across UK heathlands, this equates to an additional 0. 77 Mt CO 2 e per annum extra C sequestered into plant litter and the top 15 cm of heathland soil as a result of N deposition. The bulk of this is found in the litter and organic soil horizons that hold an average of 23 % and 54 % of soil C, respectively. This additional C represents around 0. 44 % of UK annual anthropogenic GHG emissions. When considered in the context of falling biodiversity and altered species composition in heathland, policy focus should remain on reducing N emissions...|$|R
40|$|The microbially {{mediated}} {{transformation of}} detrital P entering wetlands {{has important implications}} for the cycling and long-term <b>sequestration</b> <b>of</b> P in wetland soils. We investigated changes in P forms in sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) and cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.) leaf litter during 15 months of decomposition at two sites of markedly different nutrient status within a hard-water subtropical wetland (Water Conservation Area 2 A, Florida). Leaf litter decomposition at the nutrient enriched site resulted in net <b>sequestration</b> <b>of</b> P from the environment in forms characteristic of microbial cells (i. e., phosphodiesters and pyrophosphate). In contrast, low P concentrations at the unenriched site resulted in little or no net <b>sequestration</b> <b>of</b> P, with changes in P forms limited to the loss of compounds present in the initial leaf litter. We conclude that under nutrient-rich conditions, P sequestration occurs through the accumulation of microbially derived compounds and the presumed concentration of endogenous macrophyte P. Under nutrient-poor conditions, standing P pools within wetland soils appear to be independent of the heterotrophic decomposition of macrophyte leaf litter. These conclusions have important implications for our ability to predict the nature, stability, and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> P <b>sequestration</b> in wetlands in response to changes in nutrient loading...|$|R
40|$|Peatland {{ecosystems}} store about 500 - 600 Pg {{of organic}} carbon, largely accumulated {{since the last}} glaciation. Whether they continue to sequester carbon or release it as greenhouse gases, perhaps in large amounts, is important in Earth's temperature dynamics. Given both ages and depths of numerous dated sample peatlands, their <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> can be estimated throughout the Holocene. Here we use average values for carbon content per unit volume, the geographical extent of peatlands, and ecological models of peatland establishment and growth, to reconstruct the time-trajectory <b>of</b> peatland carbon <b>sequestration</b> in North America and project it into the future. Peatlands there contain ~ 163 Pg of carbon. Ignoring {{effects of climate change}} and other major anthropogenic disturbances, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> carbon accumulation is projected to decline slowly over millennia as reduced net carbon accumulation in existing peatlands is largely balanced by new peatland establishment. Peatlands are one of few long-term terrestrial carbon sinks, probably important for global carbon regulation in future generations.
