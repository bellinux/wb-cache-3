5|$|Operation Swath-10 (also {{known as}} Bilogora '91) was planned by the Croatians {{to regain control}} of the Virovitica–Lončarica–Grubišno Polje <b>road,</b> <b>cutting</b> off and {{destroying}} the TO forces deployed {{in the area of the}} road (the northernmost part of western Slavonia captured by the TO or the JNA). Those objectives were also designed to deny the Banja Luka Corps support if it attempted to break through towards Virovitica; control the last remaining supply route between Zagreb and Slavonia; shorten the Croatian defensive positions, and improve troop and civilian morale. The offensive was originally scheduled for 15 October, but was postponed for two weeks due to the unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade and the special police. The plan of operation called for the ZNG to first cut off the two TO battalions on the Bilogora Mountain within 48 hours, with the second stage of the offensive destroying the trapped TO force. The operation was authorised by Colonel Miroslav Jezerčić, commander of Bjelovar Operational Zone, on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|The route {{started at}} St. Joseph, Missouri on the Missouri River, it then {{followed}} what is modern-day U.S. Highway 36 (US36 the Pony Express Highway) to Marysville, Kansas, where it turned northwest following Little Blue River to Fort Kearny in Nebraska. Through Nebraska it followed the Great Platte River <b>Road,</b> <b>cutting</b> through Gothenburg, Nebraska, clipping {{the edge of}} Colorado at Julesburg, Colorado, and passing Courthouse Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scotts Bluff, before arriving at Fort Laramie in Wyoming. From there it followed the Sweetwater River, passing Independence Rock, Devil's Gate, and Split Rock, to Fort Caspar, through South Pass to Fort Bridger and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the Central Nevada Route blazed by Captain James H. Simpson of the Corps of Topographical Engineers in 1859. This route roughly follows today's US50 across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the Great Basin, the Utah-Nevada Desert, and the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe before arriving in Sacramento. Mail was then sent via steamer down the Sacramento River to San Francisco. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to Oakland, California.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd {{decided that}} a rapid advance on Damascus would best deal with the {{critical}} situation. He sent two companies of Free French troops and some artillery south to Sheikh Meskine to bolster reinforce the two squadrons of the Transjordan Frontier Force which had taken defensive positions across the road eastwards from Sheikh Meskine to Dezraa and ordered the Indian brigade to advance. During the night of 15 June, pushing forward through the hills {{to the left of}} the Kissoué to Damascus road, Indian troops took Aartouz on the Quneitra to Damascus <b>road,</b> <b>cutting</b> the rearward communications of the Vichy force advancing on Quneitra. On the afternoon of 16 June, it was reported incorrectly that Ezraa had been re-taken by the Allies but the news from Quneitra was less promising. Outnumbered 3:1 and facing tanks against which they had no effective counter, the Allied defenders at Quneitra, a battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (less a company which was at Kissoué), held out until, surrounded and ammunition virtually exhausted, at 19:00 on 16 June the remaining 13 officers and 164 men surrendered.|$|E

25|$|The 12th Guards Airborne Division {{was formed}} on 23 December 1943 from three Guards Airborne Brigades {{as part of}} the 38th Guards Airborne Corps. However, some Soviet {{accounts}} state that it began formation months later in March 1944. The division's first commander was Mikhail Denisenko, who had commanded the 202nd Airborne Brigade before the war. It was held in reserve in Belarus until December 1944. On 18 December 1944, it became the 105th Guards Rifle Division in Maryina Horka. On 5 January 1945, it was assigned to the 38th Guards Rifle Corps. From 21 January to 20 February, it was transported to Szolnok, where the corps became part of the 9th Guards Army. On 30 March, the division crossed the Rába. The division advanced into Austria and captured Pressbaum on 6 April. During the Vienna Offensive, the 105th Guards blocked the Vienna-Linz <b>road,</b> <b>cutting</b> Vienna off from German reinforcements and allowing other Soviet troops to capture the city. Along with other units, the division caused severe losses among the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf, the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, and the Hungarian 2nd Armored Division and 9th Infantry Division of the Third Army. On 26 April, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. On 5 May, the division marched into Czechoslovakia and captured Znojmo on 9 May. On 12 May, the division met American troops on the Vltava near the village of Tsisek.|$|E

2500|$|Acre ( [...] or , , ʻAko, most {{commonly}} spelled as Akko; , ʻAkkā) {{is a city}} in the northern coastal plain region of the Northern District, Israel at the northern extremity of Haifa Bay. The city occupies an important location, as it sits {{on the coast of}} the Mediterranean Sea, traditionally linking the waterways and commercial activity with the Levant. The important land routes meeting here are the north–south one following the coast and the <b>road</b> <b>cutting</b> inland through the Plain of Esdraelon; Acre also benefits from one of the very rare natural harbours on the coast of the Land of Israel. This location helped it become one of the oldest cities in the world, continuously inhabited since the Middle Bronze Age some 4000 years ago.|$|E

2500|$|Also on March 29, 1865, the Union V Corps under Major General Gouverneur K. Warren {{moved to}} the end of the Confederate White Oak Road Line, the far right flank of the Confederate defenses. Warren's corps seized control of advance Confederate picket or outpost {{positions}} and occupied a segment of a key transportation and communication route, the Boydton Plank Road, at the junction of the Quaker Road, as a result of the Battle of Lewis's Farm. After a day of pushing the Union line forward on March 30, Warren's force was driven back temporarily on March 31 by a surprise Confederate attack. The V Corps rallied and regained their position on the Boydton Plank <b>Road,</b> <b>cutting</b> direct communication over the White Oak Road between the Confederate defensive line and Major General George Pickett's task force about [...] west at Five Forks, during the afternoon of March 31 at the Battle of White Oak Road. At the end of the day, the V Corps remained the closest Union infantry corps to Sheridan's position.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} game mechanic is {{the construction}} of a road network so as to allow for an efficient transportation system, as any settlers transporting goods must use roads. To build a road, the player must place a flag, select the [...] "build road" [...] option, and then place another flag. The computer will then automatically find the shortest route between the two and build the road, although the player is also free to build the road manually. To maximize distribution, the player must set as many flags as possible on each road. Flags can only be set a certain distance apart, and serve as transport hubs; a settler will carry an item to a flag and set it down, at which point the next settler along will pick up the item and continue, freeing the first settler to return and pick up another item at the previous flag. The more flags the player has, the more settlers will operate on a given <b>road,</b> <b>cutting</b> down the distance each settler must travel, and reducing the time to transport one item and return for the next, thus avoiding item congestion at each flag. When more than one item is placed at a flag, the game has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Players can also build shipyards, which allow for the manufacture of boats (can transport goods over small stretches of water), and ships (can transport goods across oceans).|$|E
60|$|On a rock on the {{right-hand}} side, thirty-four great vultures were gathered over the carcass of a steer. And this was an evil omen. They made unseemly noises as the tonga passed, and a raven {{came out of a}} bush on the right and answered them. To crown all, one of the hide and skin castes sat on the left-hand side of the <b>road,</b> <b>cutting</b> up some of the flesh that he had stolen from the vultures. Could a man desire three more inauspicious signs for a night's travel? Twilight came, and the hills were alive with strange noises, as the red moon, nearly at her full, rose over Chitor. To the low hills of the mad geological formation, the tumbled strata that seem to obey no law, succeeded level ground, the pasture lands of Mewar, cut by the Beruch and Wyan, streams running over smooth water-worn rock, and, as the heavy embankments and ample waterways showed, very lively in the rainy season.|$|E

60|$|Down {{the valley}} the slow stream meandered with marshy meadows on either side. A mile or two lower a huge drove of horses {{were to be}} seen {{assembled}} upon the bank. They were the steeds of the French cavalry, and the blue haze of a hundred fires showed where King John's men were camping. In front of the mound upon which they stood the English line was drawn, but there were few fires, for indeed, save their horses, there was little for them to cook. Their right rested upon the river, and their array stretched across a mile of ground until the left was {{in touch with a}} tangled forest which guarded it from flank attack. In front was a long thick hedge and much broken ground, with a single deeply rutted country <b>road</b> <b>cutting</b> through it in the middle. Under the hedge and along the Whole front of the position lay swarms of archers upon the grass, the greater number slumbering peacefully with sprawling limbs in the warm rays of the September sun. Behind were the quarters of the various knights, and from end to end flew the banners and pennons marked with the devices of the chivalry of England and Guienne.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Brothers--I am safe at Southampton--after having ridden {{three stages}} outside {{and the rest}} in for it began to be very cold. I {{did not know the}} Names of any of the Towns I passed through--all I {{can tell you is that}} {{sometimes}} I saw dusty Hedges--sometimes Ponds--then nothing--then a little Wood with trees look you like Launce's Sister [...] "as white as a Lily and as small as a Wand"--then came houses which died away into a few straggling Barns--then came hedge trees aforesaid again. As the Lamplight crept along the following things were discovered--"long heath broom furze"--Hurdles here and there half a Mile--Park palings when the Windows of a House were always discovered by reflection--One Nymph of Fountain--N.B. Stone--lopped Trees--Cow ruminating--ditto Donkey--Man and Woman going gingerly along--William seeing his Sisters over the Heath--John waiting with a Lanthorn for his Mistress--Barber's Pole--Doctor's Shop--However after having had my fill of these I popped my Head out just as it began to Dawn--N.B. this Tuesday Morn saw the Sun rise--of which I shall say nothing at present. I felt rather lonely this Morning at Breakfast so I went and unbox'd a Shakspeare--"There's my Comfort."[11] I went immediately after Breakfast to Southampton Water where I enquired for the Boat to the Isle of Wight as I intend seeing that place before I settle--it will go at 3, so shall I after having taken a Chop. I know nothing of this place but that it is long--tolerably broad--has bye streets--two or three Churches--a very respectable old Gate with two Lions to guard it. The Men and Women do not materially differ from those I have been in the Habit of seeing. I forgot to say that from dawn till half-past six I went through a most delightful Country--some open Down but for the most part thickly wooded. What surprised me most was an immense quantity of blooming Furze on each side the <b>road</b> <b>cutting</b> a most rural dash. The Southampton water when I saw it just now was no better than a low Water Water which did no more than answer my expectations--it will have mended its Manners by 3. From the Wharf are seen the shores on each side stretching to the Isle of Wight. You, Haydon, Reynolds, etc. have been pushing each other out of my Brain by turns. I have conned over every Head in Haydon's Picture--you must warn them not to be afraid should my Ghost visit them on Wednesday--tell Haydon to Kiss his Hand at Betty over the Way for me yea and to spy at her for me. I hope one of you will be competent to take part in a Trio while I am away--you need only aggravate your voices a little and mind not to speak Cues and all--when you have said Rum-ti-ti--you must not be rum any more or else another will take up the ti-ti alone and then he might be taken God shield us for little better than a Titmouse. By the by talking of Titmouse Remember me particularly to all my Friends--give my Love to the Miss Reynoldses and to Fanny who I hope you will soon see. Write to me soon about them all--and you George particularly how you get on with Wilkinson's plan. What could I have done without my Plaid? I don't feel inclined to write any more at present for I feel rather muzzy--you must be content with this fac simile of the rough plan of Aunt Dinah's Counterpane.|$|E
