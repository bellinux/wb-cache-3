50|$|Taking {{stock and}} looking forward - on the {{desirability}} of {{the continuation of the}} Forum: 45 speakers and nine written statements supported a continuation of the Forum. Many speakers emphasized the usefulness of the IGF as a platform for dialogue, free from the pressures of negotiations. A majority of speakers and written submissions supported an extension of the mandate as it is, that is, to continue the IGF as a multi-stakeholder platform that brings people together to discuss issues, exchange information and share best practices, but not to make decisions, nor to have highly visible outputs. The other speakers, while supporting a continuation of the IGF along similar lines to its current form, called for some change, ranging from small operational improvements to major changes in its functioning, such as adding provisions that would allow it to produce outputs, <b>recommendations</b> <b>and</b> <b>decisions</b> on a multi-stakeholder consensus basis, or to finance the IGF through the regular UN budget. Most of those who supported the continuation of the forum would like to do so for at least another five-year term. Two speakers, while welcoming the success of the IGF and not opposing an extension, said it had not met expectations as regards ‘enhanced cooperation’ in the area of Internet governance. They also linked the IGF to unilateral control of critical Internet resource, an issue that needed to be addressed in the future. Egypt, the host country, supported the continuation of the forum, while stressing {{at the same time the}} need to review its modalities of work, to increase institutional and financial capacity of its secretariat. The Chairman, Mr. Sha Zukang, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, concluded the meeting by stating that he would now report back to the Secretary-General on the discussions held in Sharm El Sheikh and the Secretary-General would then make his recommendations to the UN Membership, as requested by the Tunis Agenda.|$|E

40|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} is a multi-step process which is complex as {{it requires the}} consideration of many factors. Additionally, the accuracy of diagnosis varies depending on the skill and knowledge a physician has in the medical field. Using ICT solution, the physicians can be assisted {{so that they can}} make an accurate decision. Many applications have been developed to enhance physician performance and improve the patient outcome, however, the quality of these applications varies depending on knowledge representation methodology and reasoning approach adopted. Nowadays, ontology is being used in many clinical decision support as it formally represents the concepts and relationships of terms associated with medical domains which in turn improves the information processing, retrieval, <b>and</b> <b>decision</b> support. However, some of these applications do not explain their reasoning process; their knowledge base may not be built using the standard medical ontologies and they build ontology but fail to develop an application that a physician can use. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate how an ontology and its generic tools can be used to overcome the above challenges; how diagnostic can be formally represented and to implement a clinical decision support system that uses that ontology and diagnostic criteria to assist physician when making a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The ontology extends DDO and has been designed in protégé 5. 0. 0 OWL-DL. 19 rules were created based on diabetes diagnostic criteria by using jena rule syntax and forward chaining inference. Furthermore, the system uses the jena rule engine to reason with patient data from ontology against the rules defined in a rule file to generate a patient diagnosis, <b>recommendation</b> <b>and</b> <b>decision</b> explanation based on the patient vital signs and blood glucose test result. As result, 4 patient’s case was successful diagnosed; <b>recommendation</b> <b>and</b> <b>decision</b> explanation produced by the system undoubtedly matched the patient diagnosis. Overall system result {{is the same as the}} one expected by the physician, thus, makes it an expert system. The ontology supports the interoperability between CDSS and healthcare system and can be used for the management of the patient.

40|$|IEEE Abstract — The {{number of}} alarms {{for a typical}} power system event may be {{overwhelming}} to power system operators and may delay the operator from taking appropriate corrective action. Worldwide, a number of alarm processing techniques are used {{to reduce the number}} of alarms that the operator ‘sees’, so as to better comprehend the situation at hand and make accurate decisions faster. This paper proposes an alarm processing algorithm that goes beyond the prioritization of alarms. The conceptual algorithm proposed has additional features that offer the operator <b>recommendations</b> <b>and</b> <b>decisions</b> for the event that has caused the alarms, as well as a feature that may execute controls if the event is non critical. In this sense, the proposal is a bridge from wide area measurement to wide area control systems.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of safety and}} efficacy of therapeutics for children and adolescents {{requires the use of}} multi-centered designs. However, the need to obtain ethical approval from multiple independent research ethics boards (REBs) presents as a challenge to investigators and sponsors who must consider local requirements while ensuring that the protection of human subjects is consistent across sites. In pediatrics, this requirement is complicated by pediatric-specific ethical concerns such as the acquisition of assent and consent and the need for pediatric expertise to assess the scholarly merit of the proposed research. Efforts to tackle these challenges have focused on the process of ethics review, which will improve efficiency. In addition to improving process, we suggest further research to fill gaps in the evidence base for <b>recommendations</b> <b>and</b> <b>decisions</b> made by REBs, specifically their effectiveness to protect human subjects.

UTPREF maintains an explicit (but incomplete) generalized additive utility (GAI) model of user preferences, and uses minimax regret for recommendation. We assess the following general questions: How effective is regret-based elicitation in finding optimal or near-optimal products? Do users understand and accept the minimax regret criterion in practice? Do decision-theoretically valid queries for GAI models result in more accurate assessment than simpler, ad hoc queries? On the first two issues, we find that the minimax regret decision criterion is effective, understandable, and intuitively appealing. On the third issue, we find that simple, semantically ambiguous query types perform as well as more demanding, semantically valid queries for GAI models.
