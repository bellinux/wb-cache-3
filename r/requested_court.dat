The traditional approach has been to minimise the opportunities for the <b>requested</b> <b>court</b> to assess whether return would be in the welfare of the child, because that assessment is time consuming, and to keep the parameters of the specified exceptions to retention within very narrow bounds, for otherwise the Convention’s principles risk being entirely subverted...|$|E
