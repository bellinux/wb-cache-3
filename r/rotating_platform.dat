5|$|There {{were two}} main design {{alternatives}} to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a <b>rotating</b> <b>platform</b> {{to give them a}} broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E
25|$|The Sagnac effect {{demonstrates}} that one beam on a <b>rotating</b> <b>platform</b> covers less distance {{than the other}} beam, which creates the shift in the interference pattern. Georges Sagnac's original experiment {{has been shown to}} suffer extinction effects, but since then, the Sagnac effect has also been shown to occur in vacuum, where extinction plays no role.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, August 15, 1998, an 8-year-old girl {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} a week before her 9th birthday, after she rode the Screaming Yellow Eagle (now known as Danny Phantom Ghost Zone), a <b>rotating</b> <b>platform</b> ride from Chance Rides. Her parents said she died from a heart attack because she had a history of heart {{problems}} for five years before her death. The ride was normally operating properly.|$|E

50|$|She was a barbette ship, an {{ancestor}} {{of the modern}} battleship with the main battery mounted in open barbettes on armored <b>rotating</b> <b>platforms,</b> {{in contrast to the}} heavy self-contained turrets more common to the period and which the progress of the design of modern battleships would soon abandon.|$|R
25|$|Tilt-A-Whirl is an {{amusement}} ride {{that consists of}} seven freely spinning cars, each holding three or four passengers, attached at fixed pivot points on a <b>rotating</b> <b>platform.</b> Designed for commercial use at amusement parks, fairs and carnivals {{in which it is}} commonly found, the Tilt-A-Whirl is commonly known for making riders experience nausea. The Tilt-A-Whirl was invented in 1926 by Herbert Sellner, who first operated it at {{an amusement}} park in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. More than likely, Sellner discovered its unpredictable dynamics not through mathematical analysis but by building one and trying it out.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the Sagnac effect. Two signals were sent in {{opposite}} directions around a <b>rotating</b> <b>platform.</b> After their arrival a displacement of the interference fringes occurs. Sagnac himself believed that he had proved {{the existence of the}} aether. However, special relativity can easily explain this effect. When viewed from an inertial frame of reference, it is a simple consequence of the independence of the speed of light from the speed of the source, since the receiver runs away from one beam, while it approaches the other beam. When viewed from a rotating frame, the assessment of simultaneity changes during the rotation, and consequently the speed of light is not constant in accelerated frames.|$|E
25|$|The COW gun {{mounting}} in {{the nose}} was of Westland design, and allowed the gun to be trained over a wide arc. It supported the gun on the apex of a pyramidal structure, that was asymmetric to allow the gunner to {{have easy access to}} the weapon. This structure was fixed on a rotating base, which also provided the gunner with a <b>rotating</b> <b>platform</b> to stand on. The gunner could train the mount by turning a hand gear, or push on a pedal to engage a brake that locked the mount in its position. The elevation and depression of the gun were accomplished by the muscle power of the gunner. As the large ammunition clip of the COW gun prevented sighting over the barrel, a sight was installed to its left. The gun is reported to have been successfully fired in the air, also when trained to the side.|$|E

25|$|Rajendra {{fire control}} radar for the Akash SAM: The Rajendra is stated to be ready. However, {{it can be}} {{expected}} that further iterative improvements will be made. The Rajendra is a high power Passive electronically scanned array radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80km with 18km height coverage against small fighter sized targets {{and is able to}} track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high speed signal processing system with adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs and variable pulse repetition frequency. The entire PESA antenna array can swivel 360 degrees on a <b>rotating</b> <b>platform.</b> This allows the radar antenna to be rapidly repositioned and even conduct all round surveillance.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{protected}} cruisers {{had been}} {{equipped with a}} small number [...] guns, but Jingyuen {{became one of the}} first ships of this type which were instead equipped with a larger number of smaller guns.

Both mounts were protected by [...] thick gun shields. The secondary armament consisted of two [...] Armstrong guns mounted on sponsons on either side of the deck. The ship also had eight QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns on Vavasseur mountings, two QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, and eight 1-pounder guns. Jingyuen was also equipped with weapons other than naval artillery, which included six gatling guns as well as four above water mounted torpedo tubes. One pair of the torpedo tubes was mounted forward, and another pair mounted aft where they were activated using electricity from the captain's cabin.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1917, Sydney docked at Chatham for {{a three-month}} refit.

40|$|The paper {{proposed}} {{an approach to}} reconstruct the solid of rotation lacking in texture from two-dimensional images. The approach only requires a digital camera, an ordinary slide projector and a <b>rotated</b> <b>platform.</b> The camera and projector are required to be calibrated in advance. The <b>rotated</b> <b>platform</b> is functioned as a control ground and the target object is put on it. The projector projects the slide points onto the solid of rotation so that the texture is supplied {{to the surface of}} it. The digital camera takes sequential images with these points when the <b>platform</b> <b>rotates</b> continually. For each space feature point projected {{on the surface of the}} solid of rotation, there are two corresponding 2 D points existing. One is an image point in one of the image sequences and another is a point within the slide points. Gotten the two 2 D coordinates of the points, the 3 D coordinates of the space points on the surface of the solid of rotation can be calculated by the collinear equations. The sequential images are taken from different directions of the solid of rotation. Using the correspondence of whole adjustment and the inherent structure characteristic of the solid of rotation, the 3 D coordinates of all space points projected on the whole surface of the solid of rotation can be computed out entirely. The 3 D model of this solid of rotation is acquired by connecting all neighbour space points. This approach is flexible and practical, which are confirmed by the results of the reconstructing experiments...|$|R
