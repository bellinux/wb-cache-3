5|$|Stone bridge {{construction}} {{started with the}} excavation of foundations for the abutments. Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron. This structure supported the stone arch during construction. Once the stone arch was built, the spandrel walls and wing walls could be added. Then the <b>road</b> <b>bed</b> was built, with fill (loose stones or dirt) added to support it as needed. Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit, then set in mortar. Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened, the center was gradually lowered and then removed. In March 1996, after standing for between 156 and 121 years, the arch of Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} originally {{designated as}} the Willow Run Expressway were rebuilt from Rawsonville Road in Belleville to Ozga Road in Romulus starting in 1972. As part of this reconstruction, the segment between Haggerty Road and Ozga Road was widened from four to six lanes, and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with I-275, a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time. The Willow Run segment was also resurfaced at this point, as the old <b>road</b> <b>bed</b> did not contain steel mesh. Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive.|$|E
25|$|The libratores {{then began}} their work using ploughs and, {{sometimes}} {{with the help}} of legionaries, with spades excavated the <b>road</b> <b>bed</b> down to bed rock or at least to the firmest ground they could find. The excavation was called the fossa, the Latin word for ditch. The depth varied according to terrain.|$|E

50|$|Ruffed grouse {{frequently}} seek {{gravel and}} clover along <b>road</b> <b>beds</b> during early morning and late afternoon. These are good areas to walk {{during this time}} to flush birds. Also, grouse use sandy <b>road</b> <b>beds</b> to dust their feathers to rid themselves of skin pests. Dusting sites are visible as areas of disturbed soils with some signs of feathers. Birds will return to these spots during the late afternoon to bathe in dust and to socialize and mate.|$|R

25|$|During 1871, {{construction}} had {{progressed to}} the point where the <b>road</b> <b>bed</b> throughout the three divisions was practically completed including work in Frederick city itself in Biser's field north end of Love Lane or East Street. Track-laying of the iron rail purchased from Lochiel had been carried from the State line to Little Pipe Creek eleven miles.|$|E
25|$|After {{the civil}} {{engineer}} {{looked over the}} site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the agrimensores went to work surveying the <b>road</b> <b>bed.</b> They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a groma, which helped them obtain right angles. The gromatici, the Roman equivalent of rod men, placed rods and put down a line called the rigor. As they did not possess anything like a transit, a civil engineering surveyor tried to achieve straightness by looking along the rods and commanding the gromatici to move them as required. Using the gromae they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road.|$|E
25|$|The Anniston Eastern Bypass was a stalled {{project of}} the Alabama Department of Transportation to build a four-lane highway in Calhoun County until revived by the 2009 federal {{stimulus}} package. It was the largest influx of federal money into the local economy since Fort McClellan closed. More than $21 million was earmarked for this project in 2005. This funding was spent acquiring rights of way and grading {{a section of the}} proposed bypass from Oxford to the community of Golden Springs. As of April 2009, the section was a graded, but undriveable, clay dirt <b>road</b> <b>bed.</b> The Eastern Bypass was revived by the 2009 Federal Stimulus Package and was opened to traffic into McClellan on the northwest end in January 2011. As of December 2015, the route is now open to traffic and carries US-431 from the Saks community southward.|$|E

25|$|The Appalachian Mountains form {{a natural}} barrier to eastwest travel, from New York to Georgia {{there are only}} five ways {{to travel to the}} west, with only three natural {{interior}} breaks allowing animal powered travel without great engineering works. These were the Gaps of the Allegheny and the several ways such as the Kittanning Paths in Pennsylvania, the Cumberland Narrows in northwestern Maryland host to Nemacolin's Path, and the Cumberland Gap in the four-state region of North Carolina and Virginia on the east side and through the gap, Tennessee and Kentucky. While late 19th and 20th century technologies would later bridge the mountain chain in other places, these all required significant civil engineering works to make a <b>road</b> <b>bed</b> past the barrier range geologist classify as the ridge-and-valley Appalachians. Settlers from Pennsylvania tended to migrate south along the Great Wagon Road through the Great Appalachian Valley and Shenandoah Valley.|$|E

500|$|The freeway {{construction}} {{required a}} half-block of right-of-way {{on the south}} side of Davison Avenue and the demolition of 69 homes to accommodate the [...] of excavation along the [...] project. Another 63 homes were moved. The outbreak of World War II accelerated the construction schedule after the project was given priority due to the defense plants near the roadway. The freeway opened for traffic without a dedication ceremony at 4:00p.m. on November 25, 1942. Travel times across Highland Park dropped from 15minutes to around 3–4minutes after the freeway opened. The roadway was the first urban, depressed freeway in the United States.

The spandrels, {{the space between the}} arches, are filled with mortared granite rubble, and the arch barrels are constructed with an estimated 550,000 bricks. The original roadway was made of granite blocks, the seams of which were filled with tar, but this has been modified with modern asphalt paving and with the piers being modified with the addition of reinforced concrete sheathing for the river piers. The iron walkways, produced by Crowell and Sisson, project over both the sides of the bridge with iron brackets.|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 1882, {{the first}} {{passenger}} train {{passed through the}} Black Canyon.

We had often heard of the scenery of this canyon, but no one can have the faintest conception of its grandeur and magnificence until they have made a trip through it. It is a narrow gorge with walls of granite rising in some places to a height of thousands of feet…Throughout its entire length there is probably not {{a quarter of a mile}} of straight track on it. It is a serpentine road in every respect and the curves are frequent and sharp. In hundreds of places the walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places the <b>road</b> <b>bed</b> is blasted out in the side of the walls of rock which overhang the track."

50|$|Railroad <b>beds,</b> like <b>road</b> <b>beds,</b> are {{designed}} to drain water away from the tracks, so there is usually a bed of rock and gravel resulting in fast drainage away from the tracks. At the same time, this drainage often accumulates in areas fairly near the tracks where drainage is poor, forming small artificial wetlands. These unnatural conditions combine to form different zones, some in which water is scarce, others in which water is abundant.|$|R
