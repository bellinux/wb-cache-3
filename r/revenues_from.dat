5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. Backed by the <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> the lucrative Cornish tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle.

5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> sales did not even provide him with the money to pay back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. <b>Revenues</b> <b>from</b> these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Bayern is an {{exception}} in professional, international football, having generated profits in nine of the last ten seasons. Other clubs often report losses, realizing transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. Also Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. While other clubs derive more than 35% of their <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> broadcasting right, Bayern earn only 22% of their revenues that way. This is often accounted for by Bayern not marketing their broadcasting right themselves. Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates broadcasting rights for the whole Bundesliga.|$|E

5|$|Hughes disliked loans, so he {{financed the}} {{purchase}} {{and development of}} new properties primarily through real estate limited partnerships (RELPs). At first, Public Storage built warehouses and sold them to independent RELPs for a development fee. The company's own RELP, called Public Storage Partners Ltd, was formed in 1975 and closed its first deal for $3 million in investments two years later. Public Storage paid cash to acquire property and build a self-storage facility, then used the property's income to pay investors back and earn a portion as profit. Public Storage Inc. also earned <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> a portion of each deal that was made.|$|E
5|$|In 1216, when a Scottish army {{invaded the}} Eden valley and Alan of Galloway {{occupied}} Westmorland, Brougham Castle played {{no part in}} the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> Cumberland, and these helped fund {{the construction of the}} castle. Brougham Castle was constructed {{in the northern part of}} the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son John was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E
