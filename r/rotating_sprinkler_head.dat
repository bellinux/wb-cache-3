40|$|Understanding the {{atomization}} of {{fire sprinkler}} sprays fills a critical {{gap in the}} modeling of fire suppression systems. Previous research by the authors has shown instability models and spatio-stochastic transport models can paint most of the sprinkler spray picture, but require input {{in the form of}} thickness and velocity of unstable fluid sheets. The model outlined makes use of a free streamline model of the flow which can be constructed based on a description of the water jet as a potential flow. The free stream-lines separating the jet from the surrounding air take the form of vortex sheets with the air assumed to be at rest. Any solution so obtained is an exact solution of inviscid flow equations with interior flow an exact solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. There is considerable literature describing two-dimensional free streamline flows, with most problems being solved through the use of the hodograph method. In three dimensions, the hodograph method and complex variable techniques are no longer available. Instead a mathematical model can be formulated using Green’s functions in conjunction with free streamline constant pressure assumptions regarding the surface of the flow.
