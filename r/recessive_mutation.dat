5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a <b>recessive</b> <b>mutation.</b> Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|The stomach has the {{characteristic}} pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular); {{it is not}} split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (antrum) is covered by a glandular epithelium. The gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>mutation.</b> At about 50%, hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E

40|$|Conclusions: Whilst {{adaptive}} evolution would {{correspond to}} gains of function that would, {{most of the}} time, be dominant, the phenomenon of speciation would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the advantageous loss of certain functions since <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations</b> very often correspond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of inbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations</b> in genomes. A consequence of the model proposed is {{that the existence of}} species would correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and outbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive outbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations</b> that could ultimately only lead to the extinction. |$|R

25|$|If a horse {{does not}} possess a functional, {{dominant}} {{copy of the}} wildtype E-allele at the Extension locus, then Mc1r cannot be produced. Without this protein, the black pigment eumelanin cannot form in the hair. Such horses, having two copies of the <b>recessive</b> <b>mutation,</b> have eumelanin-free, phaeomelanin-rich coats; they are red, or chestnut. In summary, unless a horse {{has at least one}} functional E-allele, it cannot be bay.|$|E
25|$|The primary defect {{associated}} with iminoglycinuria is a homozygous (<b>recessive)</b> <b>mutation</b> of the SLC36A2 (PAT2) gene. One of several membrane transport proteins in the {{solute carrier family}} of amino acid transporters, PAT2 is the high-affinity renal transporter of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline found to be defective in both alleles when iminoglycinuria is present in an individual. This {{is in contrast to}} the fact that when only one PAT2 allele is defective, hyperglycinuria will be present instead of iminoglycinuria. These findings delineate iminoglycinuria as the homozygous form of hyperglycinuria, with the former having a higher degree of urinary excretion of glycine and imino acids correlating to mutations in both alleles.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>mutation</b> or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10â€“13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E

40|$|Although autism {{has a clear}} genetic component, {{the high}} genetic {{heterogeneity}} of the disorder has been a challenge for the identification of causative genes. We used homozygosity analysis to identify probands from nonconsanguineous families that showed evidence of distant shared ancestry, suggesting potentially <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations.</b> Whole-exome sequencing of 16 probands revealed validated homozygous, potentially pathogenic <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations</b> that segregated perfectly with disease in 4 / 16 families. The candidate genes (UBE 3 B, CLTCL 1, NCKAP 5 L, ZNF 18) encode proteins involved in proteolysis, GTPase-mediated signaling, cytoskeletal organization, and other pathways.

2500|$|In {{research}} mammals, such as mice, albinism is more strictly defined. Albino mice occur {{due to a}} <b>recessive</b> <b>mutation</b> of the C gene. No such mutation {{exists in}} horses. Albino mice lack pigment, but [...] "...the inability of albino animals to produce pigment stems not from an absence of melanocytes...but from a deficiency and/or alteration {{of the structure of}} tyrosinase in melanocytes which are otherwise normal." [...] This definition of albinism in mice - the inability to make tyrosinase - is extended to other mammals.|$|E
2500|$|Children of first-cousin marriages {{may have}} an {{increased}} risk of genetic disorders, particularly if their parents both carry a harmful <b>recessive</b> <b>mutation,</b> but this can only be estimated empirically, and those estimates are likely to be specific to particular populations in specific environments. [...] Children of more distantly related cousins have less risk of harmful genetic mutations. [...] In fact, a study of Icelandic records indicated that marriages between third or fourth cousins (people with common great-great- or great-great-great-grandparents) may produce the most children and grandchildren.|$|E

40|$|Dominant {{mutations}} in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR 1) gene are well-recognized causes of both malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) and central core disease (CCD). More recently, <b>recessive</b> RYR 1 <b>mutations</b> {{have been described}} in few congenital myopathy patients with variable pathology, including multi-minicores. Although a clinical overlap between patients with dominant and <b>recessive</b> RYR 1 <b>mutations</b> exists, in most cases with <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations</b> the pattern of muscle weakness is remarkably different from that observed in dominant CCD. In order to characterize the spectrum of congenital myopathies associated with RYR 1 mutations, we have investigated a cohort of 44 patients from 28 families with clinical and/or histopathological features suggestive of RYR 1 involvement. We have identified 25 RYR 1 mutations, 9 of them novel, including 12 dominant and 13 <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations.</b> With only one exception, dominant mutations were associated with a CCD phenotype, prominent cores and predominantly occurred in the RYR 1 C-terminal exons 101 and 102. In contrast, the 13 <b>recessive</b> RYR 1 <b>mutations</b> were distributed evenly along the entire RYR 1 gene and were associated {{with a wide range}} of clinico-pathological phenotypes. Protein expression studies in nine cases suggested a correlation between specific mutations, RyR 1 protein levels and resulting phenotype: in particular, whilst patients with dominant or <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations</b> associated with typical CCD phenotypes appeared to have normal RyR 1 expression, individuals with more generalized weakness, multi-minicores and external ophthalmoplegia had a pronounced depletion of the RyR 1 protein. The phenomenon of protein depletion was observed in some patients compound heterozygous for <b>recessive</b> <b>mutations</b> at the genomic level and silenced another allele in skeletal muscle, providing additional information on the mechanism of disease in these patients.
