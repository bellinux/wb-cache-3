50|$|<b>Plug</b> and socket <b>connectors</b> {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female {{receptacle}} (typically socket contacts), although hermaphroditic connectors exist, such as the original IBM token <b>ring</b> LAN <b>connector.</b> <b>Plugs</b> generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|R

50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber <b>connector</b> <b>plugs.</b> A multiple-jointed <b>connector</b> assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of <b>connector</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|R

40|$|Copper–graphite {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} possess {{the properties of}} copper, i. e. excellent thermal and electrical conductivities, and properties of graphite, i. e. solid lubricating and small thermal expansion coefficient. They are widely used as brushes, and bearing materials because of the above properties. Copper-graphite with low percentages of graphite is also used for slip <b>rings,</b> switches, relays, <b>connectors,</b> <b>plugs</b> and low voltage DC machines with very high current densities. In the present investigation, {{attempts have been made}} for the fabrication of Cu-graphite MMC by conventional and spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques. The MMCs were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different mechanical properties like density, bulk hardness and wear study were also conducted. XRD spectra show the presence of Cu, graphite and Cu 2 O peaks which shows that no interaction between Cu and graphite takes place during fabrication. The presence of a weak peak of Cu 2 O proves that slight oxidation of Cu takes place during sintering. It has been found that addition of graphite into copper does not result in much improvement in hardness due to the soft nature of graphite. However, 90 % and 97 % of theoretical density have been obtained for conventional sintered and SPS samples respectively. Maximum Vickers hardness value of around 100 has been achieved for Cu- 1 vol. % graphite MMC when it is fabricated by SPS. However, a hardness value of 65 has been obtained for the same composite when it is fabricated by conventional sintering at 900 °C for 1 hour. The micrographs of Cu-graphite reflect the clean interface and good compatibility between matrix and reinforcement. From wear study, it is concluded that the wear resistance of the composite increases with increase in graphite content due to the lubricating properties of graphite. It has also been found that wear depth decreases with increase in graphite content. SPS sintered samples show higher wear resistance than conventional sintered samples...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{improve the}} {{surgical}} results of aortic dissection, {{we used a}} novel vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> for anastomosis. MethodsThe vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> is a titanic ring used as a stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. From November 2007 to December 2008, 19 consecutive patients (age range 36 – 77 years; 16 male and 3 female) with aortic dissection underwent open surgery. All patients received aortic reconstruction with vascular grafts (including 5 cases of arch replacement). The combined procedures were 5 Bentall and 4 {{coronary artery bypass graft}} operations. ResultsThere were no significant blood leaks from the anastomotic sites. The time required for each anastomosis was 1 to 2 minutes. All patients were discharged uneventfully and are still doing well after a follow-up period of 1 to 12 months. ConclusionThe vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> may improve the early surgical results of aortic dissection by reducing both the time for anastomosis and the risk of bleeding and may be an alternative technique for aortic reconstruction. Its usefulness in the routine treatment of aortic dissection warrants further evaluation...|$|R

This cable/connector is being proposed for both SATA II and SAS. Figure 1 shows the <b>connector</b> <b>plug</b> used on the backplanes. It follows the design of the SATA host connector. Figure 1 — Internal wide <b>connector</b> <b>plug</b> picture (from Amphenol) Editor’s Note 1 : The connector ended up with 6 sidebands in the middle rather than 4 as shown.

The connector interface includes 4 high-speed serial channels and 6 sideband signals (in the middle). It is split into two tongues for stability. SAS- 1. 1 should recognize this as a standard connector and define signal assignments for it.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{observed}} midterm {{results of}} vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> in surgery for aortic dissection. MethodsVascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> {{were used as}} stents in vascular grafts to achieve quick, sutureless anastomoses. Tapes were used to secure ringed vascular grafts from outside the aorta. ResultsFrom November 2007 to February 2011, 113 consecutive patients with aortic dissection, except 3 in preoperative profound shock, underwent open surgery. All underwent aortic reconstruction with vascular grafts and vascular ring connectors: ascending aorta in 29, descending thoracic aorta in 20, distal hemiarch plus descending thoracic aorta in 22, total arch in 14, ascending aorta plus total arch in 12, total arch plus descending thoracic aorta in 7, ascending aorta plus arch plus descending thoracic aorta in 8, and thoracoabdominal aorta in 1. Concomitant operations were 19 Bentall procedures, 14 coronary bypasses, 2 mitral valve replacements, 1 aortic valve replacement, and 1 heart transplant. We used sternotomy to repair 77 % of type B dissections, 83 % with elephant trunks. Time to extubation was 9. 0 ± 6. 2 hours. Average blood loss was 345 ± 195 mL. Half the patients needed no blood transfusion. In-hospital mortality was 5. 3 %; late mortality was 2. 7 %. ConclusionsUse of vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> in surgical repair for aortic dissection might reduce risks and improve early and midterm results. With addition of elephant trunk, most type B dissections could be repaired through sternotomy. With the improved surgical results, we can suggest open repair for most uncomplicated type B dissections; however, more long-term follow-up is needed...|$|R
