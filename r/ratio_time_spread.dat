40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{application}} of turbo codes across Space <b>Time</b> <b>Spreading</b> Channel. This is done by undertaking a study into {{the extent to which}} these error correction codes can reduce the bit error rate across the space <b>time</b> <b>spreading</b> channel. Both the turbo codes and space time channel have been developed in Matlab�s Simulink. The thesis starts with an introduction to turbo codes which is presented on the basis of classical turbo codes introduced by Berrou et al in 1993 (Berrou et al., 1993). This is illustrated by some examples of their performance across the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGN). Then a detailed description of the Space <b>Time</b> <b>Spreading</b> (STS) channel and the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) turbo codes. Using the UMTS turbo codes this thesis produces simulation results showing to what extent they reduce the bit error rate of the STS channel. A description of the system in Simulink and Matlab is presented. The simulation results show that UMTS turbo codes applied on the top of the STS channel can improve the bit error rate performance by approximately 5 dB. This is done at the expense of increased complexity and reduced effective data rate...|$|R

Tests indicate that futures prices with one, two and three months to maturity are unbiased predictors of the spot and hence provide an efficient hedging mechanism for Australian equity index market participants, while six-, nine- and twelve-month futures prices are biased predictors of spot prices, indicating that speculative opportunities may exist in futures contracts for these <b>time</b> <b>spreads.</b> An analysis of the short-run dynamic properties of the long-run equilibrium relationship found that for all <b>time</b> <b>spreads</b> the futures prices respond {{to changes in the}} long-run equilibrium, and for the twelve-month contract, both futures and spot prices adjust to return to the long-run equilibrium.

40|$|Abstract—Multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} factor in the bit error rate of high-frequency ionospheric communication channels and in the target detection performance of over-the-horizon radars. In this study, the probability density distribution of multi-path time delay and Doppler shift of ionospheric radio signal are derived using Rayleigh fading. Moreover, the probability density distribution of time delay, average power of the received signal, and received signal variance are discussed in detail. Using a designed experimental circuit, the measured value of the multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> is obtained from three given radio paths by the sweep-frequency pulse sounding technique. The average value of the multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> that changes with the ratio K, which is the operating frequency of the basic maximum usable frequency, is also analyzed and fitted using the least-squares fitting method. Theoretical and statistical research shows that for a given radio path and specific frequency, the multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> approximately follows a normal distribution. The average <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> decreases with the increase in the ratio K; however, it eventually approaches a steady value. The results of this research provide an empirical reference for further prediction and estimation of the <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> of a radar wave propagating through the ionosphere...|$|R
