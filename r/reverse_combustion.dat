50|$|There are {{a variety}} of designs for {{underground}} coal gasification, all of which are designed to provide a means of injecting oxidant and possibly steam into the reaction zone, and also to provide a path for production gases to flow in a controlled manner to the surface. As coal varies considerably in its resistance to flow, depending on its age, composition and geological history, the natural permeability of the coal to transport the gas is generally not adequate.

40|$|Most {{widely used}} concept for {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) incineration is combustion on a moving grate with energy recovery. In MSW incinerators fresh waste stacked on a grate enters the combustion chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs.

The present project is investigating the so called <b>reversed</b> <b>combustion</b> of waste on a grate.

30|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the feasibility of applying the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> approach to the in situ gasification of lignite with the production of hydrogen-rich syngas (H 2 and CO). The so-called forward combustion gasification (FCG) and <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> gasification (RCG) approach in which oxygen and steam are simultaneously fed to the simulated system of underground coal gasification (UCG) was studied. A simulated system of UCG was designed and established. The underground conditions of the coal seam and strata were simulated in the system. The combustion gasification of lignite {{has been carried out}} experimentally for almost 6.5  days. The average effective content (H 2  + CO) of syngas during the FCG phase was 62.31  % and the maximum content was 70.92  %. For the RCG phase the corresponding figures are 61.33 % and 67.91  %. Thus, the feasibility of using RCG way for UCG has been demonstrated. The temperature profiles have been provided by using of 85 thermocouples during the model experiment, which portrayed the several nephograms of thermal data in the gasifier were of significance for the prospective gasification processes.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} methods of combustion: Dry forward, <b>reverse</b> and wet <b>combustion.</b> Dry forward uses an igniter to {{set fire to}} the oil. As the fire {{progresses}} the oil is pushed away from the fire toward the producing well. In reverse the air injection and the ignition occur from opposite directions.

30|$|Generally {{forward and}} <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> {{approaches}} {{are used in}} shaftless type UCG process. In the practical operations, <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> was widely applied to link the injection and production wells in UCG (Blinderman et al. 2007), but was seldom used to gasify coal. Forward combustion has been usually applied to gasify the coal seam with appropriate gasification agents (Skafa 1960; Blinderman et al. 2007). When the flame gradually moved to the product borehole in the late stage of FCG, the huge cavity should be formed in the coal seam due to coal combustion gasification and overburden roof spalling. It made coal gasification efficiency reduce {{and the quality of}} production gas decrease. The high intensity forward gasification process would be difficult to be continued. The reasons are as follows (Yang et al. 2008): (1) The dry distillation zone becomes shorter and shorter in the later forward gasification. (2) The reaction activity of coal significantly decays after coal seams underwent dry distillation during forward gasification. (3) The reaction rates of coal combustion and gasification fell for descending concentration of gasification agents absorbed on coal surfaces of the cavity wall. To make coal seams further gasify and enhance syngas quality, the injection borehole and product borehole should be exchanged in practical operation. Then coal seams will be continued to gasify by shifting the direction of injection gas. New gasification conditions formed again. If the gasification flame moved to the direction of injection gas flow, therefore the residual coal seams around former product borehole would not be gasified. It is the waste for coal resource. In order to keep on gasifying residual dried and distilled zone, and solve the problem of the late stage of FCG, the <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> gasification could be applied in UCG process. To research the feasibility and characteristics of the RCG approach, gasification experiments were performed in a system of UCG to simulate the FCG and RCG processes.|$|E

40|$|Waste {{combustion}} on a grate {{with energy}} recovery {{is an important}} pillar of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the Netherlands. In MSW incinerators fresh waste stacked on a grate enters the combustion chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Typically, the reaction zone starts {{at the top of}} the waste layer and propagates downwards, producing heat for drying and devolatilization of the fresh waste below it until the ignition front reaches the grate. The control of this process is mainly based on empiricism. MSW is a highly inhomogeneous fuel with continuous fluctuating moisture content, heating value and chemical composition. The resulting process fluctuations may cause process control difficulties, fouling and corrosion issues, extra maintenance, and unplanned stops. In the new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air (T > 220 °C) from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. That is why this approach is denoted by upward combustion. Experimental research has been carried out in a batch reactor with height of 4. 55 m, an inner diameter of 200 mm and a fuel layer height up to 1 m. Due to a high quality two-layer insulation adiabatic conditions can be assumed. The primary air can be preheated up to 350 °C, and the secondary air is distributed via nozzles above the waste layer. During the experiments, temperatures along the height of the reactor, gas composition and total weight decrease are continuously monitored. The influence of the primary air speed, fuel moisture and inert content on the combustion characteristics (ignition rate, combustion rate, ignition front speed and temperature of the reaction zone) is evaluated. The upward combustion concept decouples the drying, devolatilization and burnout phase. In this way the moisture and inert content of the waste have almost no influence on the combustion process.

The application requires not only that the temperature be kept sufficiently low but also that a suitably tailored temperature profile be provided at the combustor exit, with higher temperatures generally permissible at the blade tip than at the blade root because of higher centrifugal loads at the root. A single jet. As spacing is reduced, jet penetration is also reduced, and the cooling jets tend to remain close to the wall from which they are injected.

30|$|Low-rank coals, such as lignites, have {{considerable}} natural permeability {{and can be}} exploited for UCG {{without the need for}} linking technologies. However, high-rank coals, such as anthracites, are far less permeable, making the gas production rate more limited if UCG is employed [35]. For the use of high-rank coals in UCG, a method of linking must be employed to increase the permeability and fracture the coal seam [36]. The boreholes in traditional LVW gasifiers are linked by special methods including forward combustion, <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion,</b> fire linkage, electric linkage, hydrofracturing, and directional drilling to create sizable gasification channels [35, 37].|$|E
30|$|The {{quality of}} syngas {{declined}} in the later stages of phase II because a large cavity was formed along the gasification channel. The oxygen concentration in {{the surface of the}} incandescent coal was so low that the coal combustion reaction rate declined. In addition, the reactivity of the coal declined because the residual coal was partially pyrolyzed and was converted into char, which possessed a lower reactivity owing to the larger pore diameter (Alejandro and Fanor 1998; Yang et al. 2008). The high intensity forward gasification process would be difficult to be continued. Then, the RCG approach was proposed to solve the problem in the late stage of UCG process. And a new UCG technique of the <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> gasification combined with forward combustion gasification creatively formed. The objective of <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> gasification is optimized to the UCG process further. At the moment the injection and product boreholes were switched, oxidants were injected into the product borehole and product gas was removed from the injection borehole, but the flame then moved to the product borehole. At the beginning of phase III, the steam was blown into the two boreholes to remove the product gas. The 93  % oxygen was injected from the product borehole to improve the gasifier temperature, and its initial supply rate was 5  m 3 /h. After 0.5  h, the temperature of the gasifier center returned to above 1, 000  °C, and the steam was fed continuously until the total process was terminated.|$|E

On a complete oxidation basis, and under certain arrangements, the latter fuels have volumetric energy capacities that exceed the most recognized, automotive constraints; furthermore, the solid metal oxide products (EM+,B 3 +/ 02 -) {{have the potential to}} be regenerated off-board to their respective hydrides via electrolytic reverse complete oxidation processes. Electrolytic reverse complete oxidation processes are conceptualized as water electrolysis and electrolytic <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> or electrolytic reverse hydrolysis unit operations in series. To more clearly express these mostly electrochemical fuel-cycles, a thermodynamic reaction model was contrived. To investigate the electrolytic reverse hydrolysis hypothesis, attempts were made to prepare metal-supported, electrolytic reverse hydrolysis anode compartments. The glycine nitrate process facilitated the synthesis of nickel iron oxide (anode) and select doped ceria fluorite and double-doped LaGaO 3 perovskite (solid oxygen anion electrolytes) powders. Hydridic electrolyte compositions belonging to the Na 2 BH 5 -Na 413205 quasi-binary system were synthesized from NaH, NaBH 4 and NaB 02. Analyses for the materials' compatibilities and solubilities studies (823 + 10 °K, 1. 00 f 0. 01 MPa) included induction coupled plasma, inert x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. NaH reduces magnetite to austenite; hence, the most promising solid oxygen anion electrolyte, Lao 7 Sro 3 GauFeo 3 Mgo 103. 6 (LSGFM), cannot be in direct contact with these hydridic electrolytes. The other oxides of Lao 8 Sro 2 Ga 08 Mg 0203. 6 are significantly soluble in these melts, but either a quenching or an electrochemical technique will be required to more accurately assess their values. For the preparation of small, metal-supported, electrolytic reverse hydrolysis anode compartments, suspension plasma spraying was used for the depositions of the anode and solid oxygen anion electrolyte layers. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction were used for the analyses of the resultant coatings' characteristics. In consequence of LSGFM's remarkable specific conductivity at — 673 °K, a solid oxygen anion electrolyte-supported, electrolytic <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> or electrolytic reverse hydrolysis anode compartment design may be considered, but this will require the addition of a protective, solid oxygen anion electrolyte layer.

In Portugal in multifamily housing and with natural ventilation systems, installing a mechanical exhaust fan in every kitchen (decentralized ventilation) is common. In this paper, the impact of such a device is evaluated regarding the performance of a water heating appliance for heating the indoor environment or for domestic hot water (B-type gas appliance usually installed in the kitchen). The combination of natural or mechanical ventilation in the kitchen with the natural exhaust of the gas appliance’s combustion products were tested as well as the evaluation of critical conditions that lead to stopping the gas appliance safely or to <b>reversing</b> the <b>combustion</b> products in the respective exhaust duct. One of the main conclusions to be drawn is that in the case of mechanical exhaust in the kitchen simultaneously with the natural exhaust of the gas appliance’s combustion products, the kitchen’s exterior air inlet is a key device for ensuring proper exhaust of combustion products.

Laboratory experiments have been conducted to evaluate the potential of combustion and hot-gas injection for the thermal recovery of oil from the Asphalt Ridge and the Tar Sand Triangle deposits in Utah. This paper discusses the saturated hydrocarbon distributions in the thermally produced oils and in the tar sand bitumens. The oil produced by <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> of Asphalt Ridge tar sand contained 45 wt.

Results from field ionization mass spectrometric analysis of the saturates indicated significantly larger amounts of material with carbon numbers less than C^Q were present in both product oils from combustion than {{were present in the}} original bitumens. The saturates in these product oils were comprised of mostly acyclic alkanes, mono-, and dicycloalkanes. Carbon number distributions of tetracyclo- and pentacycloalkanes (biological markers) were similar for both the product oil recovered by <b>reverse</b> <b>combustion</b> and the bitumen from Asphalt Ridge. The hot-gas injection process produced a greater amount of oil, containing more saturated hydrocarbons, than either combustion process. Significant amounts of medium-molecular-weight material from Cj 5 to C^y were present in oils produced by hot-gas injection. A comparison of the carbon number and Z-series distributions of saturates indicated that relatively greater amounts of branched alkanes and lower-numbered cyclic systems were present in product oils from combustion and hot-gas injection than in the original tar sand bitumens.

50|$|One {{problem with}} both of these early designs, which are called centrifugal-flow engines, was that the {{compressor}} worked by accelerating air outward from the central intake to the outer periphery of the engine, where the air was then compressed by a divergent duct set-up, converting its velocity into pressure. An advantage of this design {{was that it was}} already well understood, having been implemented in centrifugal superchargers, then in widespread use on piston engines. However, given the early technological limitations on the shaft speed of the engine, the compressor needed to have a very large diameter to produce the power required. This meant that the engines had a large frontal area, which made it less useful as an aircraft powerplant due to drag. A further disadvantage of the earlier Whittle designs was that the air flow was <b>reversed</b> through the <b>combustion</b> section and again to the turbine and tailpipe, adding complexity and lowering efficiency.
