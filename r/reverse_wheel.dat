40|$|Results are {{presented}} of an experimental investigation {{made of the}} applied ground loads and the coefficient of friction between the tire and the ground during the wheel spin-up process in impacts of a small landing gear under controlled conditions on a concrete landing strip in the Langley impact basin. The basic investigation included three major phases: impacts with forward speed at horizontal velocities up to approximately 86 feet per second, impacts with forward speed and <b>reverse</b> <b>wheel</b> rotation to simulate horizontal velocities up to about 273 feet per second, and spin-up drop tests for comparison with the other tests. In addition to the basic investigation, supplementary tests were made to evaluate the drag-load alleviating effects of prerotating the wheel before impact so as to reduce the relative velocity between the tire and ground. In {{the presentation of the}} results, an attempt has been made to interpret the experimental data so as to obtain some insight into the physical phenomena involved in the wheel spin-up process...|$|E

5000|$|In the Middle Ages {{until the}} start of the Early Modern Period the ore was broken up above ground using sledges and sorted by hand into silver, lead and copper ores and gangue. The {{pounding}} stones (Pochsteine) or stamps used have occasionally been found in recent times during archaeological excavations. The use of water power increased {{around the turn of the}} 16th and 17th centuries and it began to be employed in processing to enrich the ore concentration. On the one hand water was used as an energy source; on the other it was used to wash out the unwanted clay and to separate ore from gangue by making use of the different density of the minerals. The tailings from the washing process were simply emptied into the rivers of the Harz along with the used driving water. The low efficiency of the first ore processing machines resulted in a high content of heavy metals in the rivers. As a consequence of using the aforementioned water-based method of processing the stamp mills (Pochwerke) were located in the deeper river valleys. As a rule, they obtained water from the pits, where it had been used to drive water <b>wheels</b> and <b>reversing</b> <b>wheels.</b> Until the beginning of the industrial era, mechanical processing was carried out as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|As the day wore along I {{improved}} on my obstructive tactics. When the Elsinore {{was up in}} the eye of the wind, {{and making}} sternway, I found that by putting the wheel sharply over, one way or the other, I could swing her bow off. Then, when she had paid off till the wind was abeam, by <b>reversing</b> the <b>wheel</b> hard across to the opposite hard-over I could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work her off squarely before it. This made all the wood-floated triangles of bird-snares tow aft along her sides.|$|R

50|$|By January 1903, {{the company}} {{switched}} to production of gasoline-fueled automobiles {{with a model}} called the Century Tourist which was equipped with a single-cylinder, water-cooled internal combustion engine of seven-horsepower. The car had a newly designed carburetor and a planetary gear system which had two speeds; forward and <b>reverse.</b> The <b>wheels</b> were 28 in in diameter, fitted with 3 in detachable tires. The wheelbase was 6 ft and the power equipment was hung on a 2 in steel I-beam frame, on which the body also rested. The power equipment could be removed by taking out eight bolts. The car weighed 1,100 pounds and had a maximum speed of 22 mph.|$|R
25|$|In this design, {{the tank}} is placed behind the cab, usually over a {{supporting}} bogie. This removes {{the weight of}} the water from the driving wheels, giving the locomotive a constant tractive weight. The disadvantage is a reduction in water carrying capacity.

50|$|Frequently used in {{mines and}} {{probably}} elsewhere (such as agricultural drainage), the <b>reverse</b> overshot water <b>wheel</b> was a Roman innovation to help remove {{water from the}} lowest levels of underground workings. It is described by Vitruvius in his work De Architectura published circa 25 BC. The remains of such systems found in Roman mines by later mining operations show that they were used in sequences so as to lift water a considerable height.|$|R

50|$|The LAGR vehicle, {{which was}} {{about the size of}} a {{supermarket}} shopping cart, was designed to be simple to control. (A companion DARPA program, Learning Locomotion, addressed complex motor control.)

5000|$|The {{four-wheel drive}} system {{used in the}} Passat Variant Syncro shared the {{mechanics}} of the Audi 80 quattro rather than the Volkswagen Golf Syncro. When first shown, at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show, the car was meant to be called the [...] "Passat Tetra". The Syncro's bottomplate was almost entirely different, requiring a transmission tunnel, a relocated gas tank, and no spare tire well (to make room for the complex rear axle assembly). Unlike the related Audi 80 quattro which used a <b>reversed</b> front <b>wheel</b> setup, the rear-axle was an adapted Volkswagen Transporter unit so as to retain a flat loading floor. Only the more popular estate was deemed worthy of reengineering, so as to not offer direct competition with the sedan-only Audi 80 quattro. Syncro was also available in the North American market, only with the five-cylinder engine.|$|R
50|$|Another device {{which was}} used widely was the Archimedean screw, and {{examples}} of such drainage machines have also been found in many old mines. Depictions show the screws being powered by a human treading on the outer casing to turn the entire apparatus as one piece.They were also used in series, so increasing the lift {{of water from the}} workings. However, they must have been more difficult to operate since the user had to stand on a slanting surface to turn the screw. The steeper the incline, the greater the risk of the user slipping {{from the top of the}} screw. No doubt the <b>reverse</b> water <b>wheel</b> was easier to use with a horizontal treading surface. On the other hand, the screw could be operated by a crank handle fitted to the central axle, but would be more tiring since the weight of the operator does not bear on the crank, as it does when trod from above.|$|R
40|$|Conference paperE-learning poses a {{challenge}} in a pedagogical perspective such as finding ways on how to motivate the students to learn {{in spite of the}} absence of a human instructor. Many researchers in the field have proposed and implemented various mechanisms to improve the learning process such as individualization and personalization.

In this paper, a revolutionary technique has been proposed and implemented to perform individualization and personalization using <b>reversed</b> roulette <b>wheel</b> selection algorithm that runs at O(n). The technique is simpler to implement and is algorithmically less expensive compared to other revolutionary algorithms since it collects the dynamic real time performance such as examinations, reviews and study matrices.

25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to <b>reverse</b> the <b>wheel</b> to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the concept of Indian identity and the English language as reflected in Indian literature. Questions of identity in this literature are inextricably connected with the issue of using English, the language of the erstwhile colonisers, to portray the non-English, multilingual socio-cultural and political experience of the Indian space. I argue that English is today an Indian language and even functions as a vernacular Indian language. An attempt to dismiss English as the language of the coloniser is endeavouring to <b>reverse</b> the <b>wheels</b> of history, because the Indian nation itself is a product of colonialism. Literature written in this language is not antithetical to or removed in its concerns from literature written in the different regional Indian languages. Rather, like literature in any other Indian language, not only is Indian-English literature credible Indian literature, but often it expresses a sensibility associated with the vernacular and can be meant primarily for an Indian audience. The vernacularisation of English is not based on any linguistic peculiarities of Indian English, but is achieved through the socio-political aspects of the language and the literary articulations of English in a mutually constitutive manner alongside various Indian regional languages...|$|R
