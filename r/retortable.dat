5000|$|Utilising {{the plastic}} retort pouch over these other forms, {{particularly}} for delicate {{foods such as}} smoked salmon. T.D. Durance and L.S. Collins found that [...] "processing of late-run chum salmon in <b>retortable</b> pouches resulted in 48% reduction in processing time" [...] for a given level of lethality to microorganisms, a clear advantage over traditional canning techniques.|$|E
50|$|Heat or {{ionizing}} irradiation {{can be used}} to {{kill the}} bacteria that cause decomposition. Heat is applied by cooking, blanching or microwave heating in a manner that pasteurizes or sterilizes fish products. Cooking or pasteurizing does not completely inactivate microorganisms and may need to be followed with refrigeration to preserve fish products and increase their shelf life. Sterilised products are stable at ambient temperatures up to 40 °C, but to ensure they remain sterilized they need packaging in metal cans or <b>retortable</b> pouches before the heat treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Cooking low-acid {{food items}} in a <b>retortable</b> pouch is a {{relatively}} new process, with the first commercial use of such retort pouches found in Italy in 1960, Denmark in 1966, and in Japan in 1969. It consists of enclosing the fish in [...] "a multilayer flexible packaging consisting mainly of polypropylene (PP), aluminum foil, and polyester (PET)" [...] instead of the metal can or glass jar used in canning; but from there the technique is quite similar. Four different retort pouch structures were used; namely cast polypropylene (CPP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/silicon oxide-coated nylon/CPP (SIOX), Aluminum oxide-coated PET/nylon/CPP (ALOX), and PET/aluminum foil/CPP (FOIL).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Peeled hard cooked {{eggs were}} held in. 1 N citric acid containing. 2 % sodium ben-zoate at 4 C for 4 days. The eggs were then packed in sealed metal cans and in <b>retortable</b> pouches in a dilute organic acid. They were {{retorted}} for 15 min at 121 C. Other eggs in <b>retortable</b> pouches were immersed {{in boiling water}} for 15 min. The previously hard cooked eggs endured the stresses of retorting or immersion in boiling water with no detectable changes in sensory characteristics. Microbiological examination of thermally processed eggs after 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months storage at 4 C or 21 C gave no evidence of growth of microorganisms. Hard cooked eggs can be packaged and thermally processed without harm to sensory qualities. Such eggs could be merchandised with or without refrigeration.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{effect of}} {{entrapped}} air content on heat penetration characteristics in institutional size <b>retortable</b> pouches packed with pears {{and green beans}} was investigated. In addition, products processed in pouches and in number 10 cans were compared using several indices of quality (color, texture, total phenolics, ascorbic acid) and sensory panel evaluations. Heat penetration studies were conducted in an FMC Laboratory Retort. Pouches were placed in horizontal orientation, using both constrained and restrained racking methods. For green beans, a retort temperature of 121 °C and 0. 68 Atm (25 psig) overriding pressure, of steam and air, were used for processing.

40|$|Ethylene {{vinyl alcohol}} (EVOH) {{is one of}} the best known {{flexible}} thermoplastic oxygen barrier materials in use today. It is especially important for refrigerated and shelf-stable foods where oxygen deteriorates the quality of packaged products and reduces their shelf life. EVOH accounts for a majority of thermoplastic barrier materials used for rigid or semi-rigid <b>retortable</b> food containers. However. it is of limited use in flexible packages or lid films for rigid trays used for packaging thermally processed shelf-stable low acid foods due to its moisture sensitivity. Nevertheless, current use of other oxygen barrier materials such as polyvinylidene chloride and aluminum foil creates environmental concerns. Innovations in food processing technologies provide opportunities for increased use of EVOH in food packaging. The aim of this review is to give an overview of research on the oxygen barrier properties of EVOH from the perspective of structure-barrier property relationships and the consequences of food processing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work has}} {{employed}} an optimization process among experimental temperatures and those obtained by {{finite elements analysis}} (FEA) for {{the determination of the}} convective heat transfer coefficient (h) during a stand up <b>retortable</b> pouch process in a steam-air retort.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 77) Effect {{of processing}} and storage on folacin content of green beans canned in tinplated cans and <b>retortable</b> pouches, under home canning conditions were studied. Blanching resulted in retentions of 51. 5 percent of free folacin (FFA) and 81. 4 {{percent of total}} folacin (TFA). Due to leaching, 0. 9 percent FFA and 15. 3 percent TFA were detected in the blanching water. The heat processing itself and leaching caused no significant reduction in FFA in either type of package. The TFA retention following sterilization was 75 percent in cans and 73. 9 percent in pouches. As {{a result of a}} higher liquid to solid ratio, leaching of TFA was higher in cans than in pouches. During 12 weeks of storage, the FFA content of canned green beans decreased significantly (p< 0. 5), whereas the corresponding reduction in pouched green beans was not significant. The concentration of FFA in the brine portion of both types of packages increased initially, then reduced slightly and finally stabilized after the third week of storage. (See more in text. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} texture of Okara, a by- product of tofu manufacturing, the effects of heating in a {{pressure}} cooker and retort on the maceration of Okara were examined. First, Okara (1 g) and water (3 ml) were added to a vial, which was then sealed with a screw cap and heated at 113, 120 or 128 ℃ for specified times in the cooker, Heating at 120 ℃ for 30 min and then grinding with a blender mill {{were found to be}} effective for the maceration of Okara.

40|$|Optimal {{sterilization}} {{temperature was}} defined as the temperature resulting in a minimum surface cook-value product together with the desired degree of sterility. Sterilization of conduction heated foods, with simple shapes as infinite slab, infinite cylinder and sphere, was modelled. The model assumed first order inactivation kinetics for microorganisms and quality. The temperature distribution was solved by an explicit finite difference numerical method with a non-capacitance surface node. Optimal temperatures were calculated as a function of : i) Food Properties - thermal diffusivity, Z-value for the quality factor, Processing Conditions - dimensions and geometry of the food or container, surface heat transfer coefficient, initial product temperature, heating medium come-up-time and Processing Criteria - target Fovalue. Initial food temperature and heating medium come-up-time have a minor influence on the optimal conditions. Generalized (semi) -empirical formulas relating quantitatively optimal temperatures and all relevant variables were developed. The generalized equations are a valuable tool to calculate or estimate processing sterilization conditions for regularly and irregularly shaped products. They were successfully applied to predict the optimal sterilization temperatures for conduction heated foods, packaged in typical cylindrical cans and <b>retortable</b> pouches, with different surface resistances to hea, transfer...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop and evaluate a low-cholesterol egg salad product capable of being thermally processed in a <b>retortable</b> pouch. Formulations containing 12 % dried egg white solids (EWS) with water binding solutes (modified corn starch or iota-carrageenan), raw yolk, and a heat-stable salad dressing mixture were packaged, processed, and evaluated by a 9 - to 10 -member taste panel for appearance, color, texture, flavor, and overall acceptability. The formula-tions were also objectively evaluated for color and for texture using the Instron machine. Results indicated that the formulated egg salad products were significantly better in all parame-ters than the control egg salad after processing. Color measurements showed the use of glucose-free albumen prevented browning after heat treatment. Rheological measurements indicated that the breaking force and modulus of rigidity of processed EWS gels containing. 375 or. 625 % iota-carrageenan were similar to that of fresh albumen gels while those of processed EWS containing 2 % modified corn starch were much higher than fresh albumen gels.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of the mechanisms of edge wicking in <b>retortable</b> paperboard. <b>Retortable</b> board is used for packaging preserved food, a process which requires that the package and its contents be sterilised by exposure to high temperature steam for up to three hours. The board used must thus have higher water repellence than traditional liquid packaging. Water vapour that condenses on the cut edges {{on the outside of the}} board causes particular concern. The paperboards studied were made from refined and unrefined bleached softwood kraft pulp and from refined unbleached softwood kraft pulp in one or two plies with different sizing levels and structures. Samples of each of the boards were immersed in a water bath at 95 °C. Other samples from the same boards were exposed to a combination of saturated steam at 130 °C and condensed steam in a special apparatus developed for this purpose. The board samples were placed on a cooling plate to simulate the temperature gradient when a container of cold food is sterilised with heated steam. Still other samples were exposed to heated steam in the absence of condensation by hanging them freely in the apparatus. The extent of edge wicking in the boards was determined by gravimetric measurements and also by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, a technique that yields more information about the moisture content profiles and the mechanisms of liquid sorption. The moisture content profiles of boards exposed to saturated steam in the absence of condensation show more uniform water uptake. This phenomenon can be explained by rapid vapour phase transport throughout the pore structure, followed by slower water uptake in the fibres. By contrast, in samples exposed to both heated steam and condensed steam, there was both liquid sorption in the fibre network and rapid vapour phase transport of the steam. The moisture content in those samples was much higher close to the edge and lower behind the liquid frontier. The edge wicking of high temperature water was greatest in board that was not fully sized, in low density board, and in board made from unrefined pulp. The greater edge wicking in board made from unbleached pulp can be accounted for in terms of its greater swelling potential. In the low density board and the board made from unrefined pulp, the lumens at the unsized edge and the weaker bonding strength are suggested to affect the results. Capillary sorption takes place in lumens and delaminated bonds at the edge and then any further propagation takes place entirely by fibre diffusion. Capillary sorption may also be important in damaged areas where broken fibre-fibre bonds are exposed to liquid. The weaker bonded area in low density board therefore also contributes to water sorption. Edge wicking in the boards placed on the cooling plate and exposed to a combination of saturated and condensed steam was of a different nature. For these samples, density was not an important factor. The difference is due to the different mechanism at work in this case, where the relative area of the edge exposed to condensed steam was larger in the high density boards than in the low density boards. In the high density boards, condensed steam was sorbed in the structure by diffusion in the fibre structure, whereas in low density boards, the dominant effect was vapour phase transport in the void spaces followed by water uptake in the fibres.

40|$|ABSTRACT Deboned, {{skinless}} {{white and}} dark meat from fowl was pretreated by overnight soaking at 3 C in either deionized water, 2 % sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, 3 % Kena solution (sodium polyphosphate), or 2 % NaCl plus 3 % Kena solution. Meat was subsequently water cooked 90 min at 92 C: then diced and batched with ground cooked skin, fat, and broth. Ingredients were packaged and sealed in flexible <b>retortable</b> pouches and retorted at 121 C (250 F). Finished prod-ucts were evaluated for proximate composition, mineral content, and sensory properties. Presoaking the meat in water or 2 % NaCl {{had little effect}} on product composition or sensory properties after retorting. Soaking in Kena, with or without NaCl, increased moisture, decreased percentage protein, and increased ash. Kena plus NaCl had significantly higher Na and CI contents than all other treatments. Finished products made from meat presoaked in Kena, with or without NaCl, were lighter in color, more tender, and less off-flavored than products presoaked in water or 2 % NaCl only. Product made from Kena plus NaCl differed significantly from product made from Kena alone in higher initial juiciness, increased perception of seasoning, and higher Na and CI contents; however, {{there were no significant differences}} in other parameters. The value of increased juiciness and seasoning perceived versus the value of increased Na content would need to be con-sidered in making a recommendation on the use of polyphosphates with or without NaCl to improve fowl meat products. If dietary sodium content is a concern, small differences in quality may be negated by increased sodium content resulting from treatment with polyphosphates plu...|$|E

40|$|Meat from yak (Bos grunniens) is {{a primary}} staple in diets of people in western China. Yak meat has low-fat content, high protein and good amino acid and fatty acid profiles. However, meat from yak may be less tender than meat from Bos taurus cattle. Gannan Black yaks (n = 181) were used to {{investigate}} the effects of age at harvest and aging days on meat quality characteristics of M. longissimus dorsi. Yaks were harvested at 2, 3 and 4 year of age and muscles of each yak carcass were aged for 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 or 21 days at 4 °C and frozen at - 20 °C until analyzed. Age at harvest affected shear force and percentage fat, protein and moisture (p< 0. 05). Aging days affected shear force, retort cooking loss, pressing loss, moist cooking loss, pH, percentage fat, moisture (p< 0. 01) and protein (p< 0. 10). There were interactions between aging days and age at harvest for shear force, moisture and protein (p< 0. 01). Aging days appeared {{to have a greater}} effect on shear force than age at harvest and tended to moderate the age at harvest effect on shear force. When cooked in <b>retortable</b> bags, cooking loss decreased until 3 days postmortem after which it remained relatively constant. When steam cooked, meat aged 7 days had the lowest cooking loss (p< 0. 05). Pressing loss decreased until 3 days postmortem then remained relatively constant.
