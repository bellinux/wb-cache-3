5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder {{believes}} the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is {{having an affair with}} Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E
500|$|No single theory, however, {{has found}} {{universal}} agreement. Leo Steinberg {{suggests that the}} King and Queen are {{to the left of}} the viewer and the <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is that of the canvas, a portrait of the king and queen. Others speculate that Velázquez represents himself painting the Infanta Margaret Theresa.|$|E
60|$|Silent from joy, the Prince {{kissed her}} hand to express his thanks, and when he rose and saw his new <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> which {{surrounded}} him, he understood that Curlicue was indeed gone for ever.|$|R
5000|$|Swarna's truly unique role as {{an actress}} is evident in films such as Vasantha Obeysekera's Dadayama (The Hunt) and Kadapathaka Chayava (<b>Reflections</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror),</b> Dharmasiri Bandaranayake's Suddhilage Kathawa (The Story of Suddhi) and Bava Duka / Bava Karma, Sumitra Peries' Sagara Jalaya (Letter Written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand) and Prasanna Vithanage's [...] Anantha Rathriya (Dark Night of the Soul).|$|R
5000|$|Fortress, Door to the Inner Chamber: using <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> shield, <b>the</b> warriors must {{navigate}} {{a path to}} {{the chamber}} door without looking at the demons, which will eliminate them if they sense eyes looking at them directly. Once at the door, they must place their key into the fourth lock to open it.|$|R
500|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the Kingston Lacy painting is a copy by Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo (c. 1612-1667), son-in-law and close follower of Velázquez. The version is missing some of the final work's details and nuances such as the royal couple's <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> [...] Its composition is almost identical to the original. [...] Although its colors are lighter, the light is less strong. [...] Pencil lines outlining the Infanta's face, eyes, and hair are also visible.|$|E
2500|$|The rouge test is {{a measure}} of self-concept; the child who touches the rouge on his own nose upon looking into a mirror {{demonstrates}} the basic ability to understand self-awareness. [...] Animals, young children, and people who have their sight restored after being blind from birth, sometimes react to their <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as though it were another individual.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the age of}} 6 to 12 months, {{the child}} {{typically}} sees a [...] "sociable playmate" [...] in the mirror's reflection. Self-admiring and embarrassment usually begin at 12 months, and at 14 to 20 months most children demonstrate avoidance behaviours. Finally, at 18 months half of children recognise the <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as their own and by 20 to 24 months self-recognition climbs to 65%. Children do so by evincing mark-directed behaviour; they touch their own nose or try to wipe the mark off.|$|E

"Then," [...] said he, [...] "the King Bird {{and all the}} Nobility of Paradise, who rejoice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most {{brilliant}} plumage, come here from their bath and dance upon the golden floor the Beauty Dance, which keeps their blood warm until the feathers have all dried.

2500|$|The pilasters were of gray {{scagliola}} with gilt-bronze capitals {{supplied by}} Gouthière. The girandole lights suspended <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> between <b>the</b> pilasters were semi-circular, so that with their <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{they appeared to}} be circular chandeliers hanging in space, a useful trompe l'œil to enlarge the somewhat cramped space, which was essentially an enlarged vestibule between the entrance and the Salon du Roi.|$|R
2500|$|Liu Bei {{had been}} holding a grudge against Zhang Yu since the {{incident}} in Fu County, so he became angrier when he heard that Zhang Yu was predicting his downfall, and decided to take revenge against Zhang Yu. He accused Zhang Yu of making an inaccurate prediction about the Hanzhong Campaign, imprisoned him, and wanted to execute him. When Zhuge Liang pleaded with Liu Bei to spare Zhang Yu, Liu Bei said, [...] "When something blocks your doorway, {{even if it were}} pretty flowers, you'll {{have to get rid of}} it." [...] As Zhang Yu was well-versed in physiognomy, every time he saw his <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> he grew weak and collapsed, because he knew he would die by execution. Zhang Yu was subsequently executed by beheading and his body was dumped into the street.|$|E
2500|$|Detail and colour have {{a strong}} {{aesthetic}} effect in Nabokov's work, offering sharp reminders to both reader and character of the joy to be obtained from observation, however fleeting, {{of the world around}} them. Before the Soviet arrives, Ivanov observes [...] "the glittering wheels of cars that left ribbon-like imprints on the heat-softened asphalt, resembling the ornate lacework of snakes." [...] This and others are part of a joyous, seemingly childlike vision, in which inanimate objects are often anthropomorphised. The Soviet's <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> showed that same [...] "waxen bald spot ... from which the bowler hat had ascended to snag a hat hook". Once again, it is Ivanov who is rewarded with this joyous skill of observation, watching the passersby and cars, and then inside noting the [...] "marble surfaces aglitter with green and gold scent bottles". The Soviet says and sees little in the story, another contrast that emphasises where the author's affections lie.|$|E
2500|$|Gallup {{expanded}} {{the study by}} manipulating the chimpanzees' appearance and observing their reaction to their <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> [...] Gallup anaesthetised the chimpanzees and then painted a red alcohol-soluble dye on the eyebrow ridge and on {{the top half of}} the opposite ear. [...] When the dye dried, it had virtually no olfactory or tactile cues. [...] Gallup then returned the chimpanzees to the cage (with the mirror removed) and allowed them to regain full consciousness. [...] He then recorded the frequency with which the chimpanzees spontaneously touched the marked areas of skin. After 30 minutes, the mirror was re-introduced into the room and the frequency of touching the marked areas again determined. [...] The frequency of touching increased to 4–10 with the mirror present, compared to only 1 when the mirror had been removed. [...] The chimpanzees sometimes inspected their fingers visually or olfactorily after touching the marks. [...] Other mark-directed behaviour includes turning and adjusting of the body to better view the mark in the mirror, or tactile examination of the mark with an appendage while viewing the mirror.|$|E
50|$|Casey's friend Romy {{tells her}} of a superstition that newborns should not see their <b>reflections</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> {{for at least a}} year because {{otherwise}} they will die soon. Casey's eyes begin to change color; a doctor asks if she is a twin, and explains the change as tetragametic chimerism and heterochromia, and that it is completely normal. Her neighbor's infant dies, supporting the superstition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} passages {{are expressed}} in St. Augustine's Confessions. [...] "I find in these examples nothing worthy of imitation. To the end {{that we may be}} true to our nature, we should not become false by copying and likening to the nature of another as do the actors and <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> ... We should, instead, seek that truth which is not self-contradictory and two-faced." ...|$|R
5000|$|Alexander McQueen later {{described}} {{his thoughts on}} the idea used during VOSS of forcing his audience to stare at their own <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> walls for over an hour:"Ha! I was really pleased about that. I was looking at it on the monitor, watching everyone {{trying not to look}} at themselves. It was a great thing to do <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fashion industry—turn it back on them! God, I’ve had some freaky shows." ...|$|R
2500|$|Set dresser Frank Silva {{was cast}} as the mysterious [...] "Bob". Lynch himself recalls that the idea {{originated}} when he overheard Silva moving furniture around in the bedroom set, and then heard a woman warning Silva not to block himself in by moving furniture {{in front of the}} door. Lynch was struck with an image of Silva in the room. When he learned that Silva was an actor, he filmed two panning shots, one with Silva {{at the base of the}} bed, and one without; he did not yet know how he would use this material. Later that day, during the filming of Sarah Palmer having a vision, the camera operator told Lynch that the shot was ruined because [...] "Frank [...] was reflected in the mirror." [...] Lynch comments, [...] "Things like this happen and make you start dreaming. And one thing leads to another, and if you let it, a whole other thing opens up." [...] Lynch used the panning shot of Silva in the bedroom, and the shot featuring Silva's reflection, in the closing scenes of the European version of the pilot episode. Silva's <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> can also be glimpsed during the scene of Sarah's vision at the end of the original pilot, but it is less clear. A close-up of Silva in the bedroom later became a significant image in episodes of the TV series.|$|E

50|$|The {{appeal of}} artistic {{creation}} {{is not limited}} to the expressive and communicative function to be projected outwardly, it also includes the inwardly-directed self-reflection of the artist. The different forms and imagery of self-portraiture in a variety of individual works are like <b>reflections</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mirror</b> image as an object perceived by myself causes the invisible self to become visible. It helps us to understand and to identity with the ‘Self’. Eventually, one can get along better with ‘Others’ in this phenomenal world and hopefully lead to a happier life.|$|R
60|$|The present was an {{elaborate}} hatrack of polished buffalo horns, mounted on red plush, with an inset mirror.

She had not seemed to hear him coming in, but he saw her eyes change when they caught his <b>reflection</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> From lost and blank, they became alive and smouldering.|$|E

It turned again when near the door, and again showed me its pale, ghastly countenance, before it disappeared. But how it left the room, whether by the door, or otherwise, my spirits were too much hurried to remark exactly; nor have I been able, by any effort of recollection, distinctly to remember." ...|$|E
