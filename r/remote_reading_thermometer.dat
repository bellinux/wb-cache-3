When such variations at a point occur within a few minutes, periodic vertical motions of the water arc implied, for other heat transfer mccha-nisms within the lake are too slow, Thcsc periodic motions, internal waves, may bc studied at a given depth by simultaneous continuous tempcraturc mcasurcmcnt at three closely spaced stations. From these observations and the mean vertical gradient the ampli-tude, direction, period, and speed of the internal waves have been determined.
