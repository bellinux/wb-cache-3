40|$|In the {{extensive}} literature of British {{economic and social}} history, much less {{attention has been given}} to merchants and trading companies than to manufacturing and banking enterprises, particularly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This is because the British Industrial Revolution was long thought to have been about production rather than trade or finance. The present generation of <b>researchers</b> <b>has</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> redress the balance, but has often been handicapped by a paucity of records, and by an unwillingness {{on the part of the}} handful of surviving firms to release information.

Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).|$|E
5000|$|In modern {{cognitive}} psychology, many <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> {{strip the}} notion of the unconscious from its Freudian heritage, and alternative terms such as [...] "implicit" [...] or [...] "automatic" [...] have come into currency. These traditions emphasize the degree to which cognitive processing happens outside the scope of cognitive awareness, and show that things we are unaware of can nonetheless influence other cognitive processes as well as behavior. Active research traditions related to the unconscious include implicit memory (see priming, implicit attitudes), and nonconscious acquisition of knowledge (see Lewicki, see also the section on cognitive perspective, below).|$|E
50|$|Since its introduction, several <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> {{test this}} idea. Tett and Gutterman (2000) {{conducted}} {{one of the}} first large-scale tests via an investigation of the impact of situation trait relevance on the relationship between traits and behaviors. Specifically, they analyzed the relationships between participants' responses to a personality test assessing five personality traits (risk taking, complexity, empathy, sociability, and organization) and responses to a measure about behavioral intentions in multiple scenarios designed to target these same traits. Results of this tests support notion that traits are expressed to the degree that the situation offers opportunities for their expression. In addition, the study found support for the idea that situations can be assessed for {{the degree to which they}} are relevant to certain traits (even those targeting the same trait).|$|E

This <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> tap into the vision of Ferratt & Hall (2009) whereby educators and technology designers are encouraged to extend the vision of online learning to “virtually being there and beyond. ” Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine innovative synchronous technology and pedagogy as a means of promoting social presence in online learning. The inquiry was quantitative in nature. Through adapting Garrison and colleagues’ community of inquiry framework (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer 2000) it was noted that students perceived the use of synchronous Centra technology to be beneficial in promoting a sense of social presence in online learning. Through one-on-one conversations within Centra, it was discovered that the use of this technology also had a positive effect on student retention. There was a correlation between learners’ perception that the instructor promoted an atmosphere of online community and there being a sense of social presence. There was evidence of satisfaction with instructor as evidenced by high student evaluation ratings. Instructor ratings were above the department mean and the university mean...|$|R

50|$|Very {{aggressive}} environments require novel materials {{approaches in}} order to combat declines in mechanical properties over time. One method <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> use is introducing features to stabilize displaced atoms. This {{can be done by}} adding grain boundaries, oversized solutes or small oxide dispersants to minimize defect movement. By doing this, there would be less radiation-induced segregation of elements, which would in turn lead to more ductile grain boundaries and less intergranular stress corrosion cracking. Blocking dislocation and defect movement would also help to increase the resistance to radiation assisted creep. Attempts have been reported of instituting yttrium oxides to block dislocation motion, but it was found that technological implementation posed a greater challenge than expected. Further research is required to continue improving the radiation damage resistance of structural materials used in nuclear power plants.|$|E

In December 2010, University of Arkansas researchers successfully spliced a gene into M. acetivorans that allowed it to break down esters.

[...] In 2011, it was shown that most methane produced during decomposition at landfills comes from M. barkeri. The researchers found that the microbe can survive in low pH environments and that it consumes acid, thereby raising the pH and allowing {{a wider range of}} life to flourish. They argued that their findings could help accelerate research into using archaea-generated methane as an alternate power source.|$|R
50|$|Conventional optical {{microscopy}} utilizing far-field illumination achieves resolution that is restricted by the Abbe diffraction limit. Modern optical microscopes with diffraction limited resolution are therefore capable of resolving features {{as small as}} λ/2.3. <b>Researchers</b> <b>have</b> long <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> break the diffraction limit of conventional {{optical microscopy}} {{in order to achieve}} super-resolution microscopes. One of the first major advances toward this goal was the development of scanning optical microscopy (SOM) by Young and Roberts in 1951. SOM involves scanning individual regions of the sample with a very small field of light illuminated through a diffraction limited aperture. Individual features as small as λ/3 are observed at each scanned point, and the image collected at each point is then compiled together into one image of the sample.|$|R

40|$|Moonlighting is a {{small but}} {{significant}} aspect of labor market activity of North America. Moonlighting, or multiple job-holding, is defined by a worker who holds more than one job.
