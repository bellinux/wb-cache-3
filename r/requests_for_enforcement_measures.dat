40|$|Part I of {{this article}} will examine the concept of {{domestic}} jurisdiction. One of the principal purposes of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security, which in 1946 was thought to essentially entail maintaining the peace between nation States. Internal power struggles and conflicts {{were thought to be}} within the jurisdiction of the State where they took place, unless they posed a rather substantial 2 ̆ 2 threat 2 ̆ 2 to the peace. Thus, the drafters of the U. N. Charter made sharp distinctions between internal and international conflicts. For instance, the Charter generally proscribes international, but not domestic, conflict, and the U. N. Security Council is accorded primary responsibility for maintaining international, not internal, peace and security. The Charter also contains a specific prohibition on intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of Member States, unless there is a need <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> under chapter VII...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: RNA {{interference}} is a process, {{in which}} a molecule of double-stranded RNA prevents {{the expression of a}} particular gene and leads to its silencing. Application of this technology in the control of disease-carrying insects is rising in agriculture and medical sciences. Also, its application in control of insect-borne diseases could be considered as a new, important, and effective approach. In this article, it was attempted to study the mechanisms of RNA interference, routs of its delivery to insects, as well as its application in genetic control of disease vector insects. Methods: In this study, 71 indexed articles in databases, such as Pubmed, SID, Scopus, Science direct, and Google scholar, were used. Results: dsRNA could be delivered to insect body through three routes of oral, injection, and Impregnation. The mechanism of dsRNA entrance into the cells has considerable effect on the success and applicability of this technique. Identification of host-parasite relationship in the insect body is one of the important applications of RNAi in medical entomology. Conclusion: Although, there is a considerable number of researches on RNAi in the agricultural pests field, studies on insect vectors of human diseases have been mostly in-vivo. However, application of RNAi is suggested as a new, safe and applicable approach, alone or along with other methods. Certainly, further researches in this field can pave the way <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> in the control of disease vectors, especially Zika, dengue fever, and malaria in the not so distant future...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION All {{existing}} traffic radars {{to be used}} <b>for</b> speed <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> {{the speed}} of the passing vehicles {{on the basis of a}} CW technology. A new prototype of a traffic radar sensor has been developed that not only measures {{the speed of the}} vehicle but also its distance to the radar device, photograph see figure 1. The measured distance enables the police to unambiguously assign the measured speed to a vehicle shown in a picture, even in special cases. The prototype is based on a 77 GHz pulse radar technology that has so far been used only for driver assistance systems. In a first step, the accuracy of an existing sensor was analysed by comparing the results with a reference system for speed measurements. In a second step, the sensor was modified in order to optimise it <b>for</b> speed <b>enforcement,</b> and tested again. The concept of the prototype, the modifications and the results of the comparison are described. Figure 1 : Photograph of the new radar sensor, a German Pfenni...|$|R

5000|$|The Court {{held that}} the fact that an event was not wholly [...] "private" [...] did not mean that an {{individual}} had no interest in limiting its disclosure. The privacy interest in a rap sheet was substantial. Whether an invasion of privacy was warranted had to turn {{on the nature of the}} requested document and its relationship to the basic purpose of the FOIA, which focused on the citizen's right to be informed about the government's actions. The news groups in this case did not intend to discover anything about the conduct of the agency, and response to the request would not shed any light on the agency's conduct. Thus, the public interest in release of a rap sheet was not the type of interest protected by the FOIA. The Court held, as a categorical matter under § 552(b)(7)(C), that a third party's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> law <b>enforcement</b> records about a private citizen could reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy, and that when the request sought no official information about the government, the privacy invasion was unwarranted.|$|R
40|$|Copyright {{regime has}} been unable to answer to the changed {{consumption}} models and needs of the consumers. The regime is typically perceived as overly restrictive and unfair among the pub-lic. Given the lack of convenient legal options, the consumers have resorted to piracy. Instead of proactively developing better legal options, the copyright right holders have pushed <b>for</b> more effective <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> The proportionality of these measures have been seriously questioned. The <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> referred to above require monitoring of the internet.

The monitoring of the internet and the processing of internet user’s personal data constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights to privacy and personal data protection of the individual. Additionally, some <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> interfere with internet user’s fundamental right to a fair trial.

40|$|Park {{officials}} at Carara National Park, Costa Rica, face considerable challenges. They believe poaching {{has become a}} significant threat to the park’s biodiversity and that their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures,</b> largely due to limited funds, are inadequate. Through family-level interviews in six communities surrounding Carara National Park, this study aims to understand the dynamics of poaching by identifying animals at risk of poaching and identifying communities to target future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> Interviews inquired about interactions with wildlife, perceived populations of wildlife, sale of wildlife, opinions towards hunting, and observed hunting activities. Summary statistics, CART modeling and probit regressions are {{used to analyze the}} data. Results indicate hunting is not prevalent {{in terms of the number}} of families that hunt. However, these families can still have significant impacts on wildlife populations with poaching occurring for both subsistence and market-oriented reasons. Two potential community sets are identified as areas to target enforcement. Based on the number of reported families engaging in hunting, enforcement should be targeted in Bijagual and Tárcoles. However, exploring truthfulness through CART and probit regression analysis indicates enforcement should be targeted in El Sur and La Hacienda. Ultimately, future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be determined by Carara officials. Although potential target communities are identified and management practices such as ecotourism and community-based management are potentially viable avenues for reducing poaching, the park faces considerable challenges <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> due to its limited financial capabilities...|$|R

Their results show that enforcement by itself has a negative effect on the probability of formal training but that its interaction with labor law rigidity has a positive and significant effect. Two possible shortcomings, however, would seem to be (1) that no allowance is given to a direct effect of labor law rigidity on training (or the firm’s perceived severity of these regulations as in the “obstacles approach) and (2) the possible endogeneity or selection bias in their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|R

No person was found smoking in 92 % of all premises. However, "no smoking" signs did not conform to regulations in > 70 % of premises, and ashtrays were seen in 17 % of enclosed premises. All supervisors and managers (100 %) knew that smoking is banned in enclosed premises but < 15 % knew the fines liable to persons, respective owners of enclosed places, when a person smokes in an enclosed premise. Furthermore, 60 % of supervisors were not aware that no smoking signs must comply with a specific regulation and 40 % were not aware that ashtrays are not permitted in enclosed premises. In conclusion, the positive finding is that few persons smoke in restaurants, bars and discotheques, but the survey also showed that several aspects of regulations for tobacco control in enclosed premises are not well implemented.
