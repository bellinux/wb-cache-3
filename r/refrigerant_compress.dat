50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are also}} positive displacement compressors. The <b>refrigerant</b> is <b>compressed</b> when one spiral orbits around a second stationary spiral, creating {{smaller and smaller}} pockets and higher pressures. By the time the refrigerant is discharged, it is fully pressurized.|$|R
50|$|The first market {{introduction}} of a linear compressor to <b>compress</b> <b>refrigerant</b> in a refrigerator was in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{compressors}} used in chillers are reciprocating, rotary screw, centrifugal, and scroll compressors. Each application prefers {{one or another}} due to size, noise, efficiency and pressure issues. Compressors are often described as being either open, hermetic, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and/or motor is situated {{in relation to the}} <b>refrigerant</b> being <b>compressed.</b> Variations of motor/compressor types can lead to the following configurations: ...|$|R
25|$|In {{hermetic}} {{and most}} semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system.

50|$|Typically in hermetic, {{and most}} semi-hermetic {{compressors}} (sometimes known as accessible hermetic compressors), the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the refrigerant system. The motor is hermetic {{and is designed}} to operate, and be cooled by, the <b>refrigerant</b> being <b>compressed.</b> The obvious disadvantage of hermetic motor compressors is that the motor drive cannot be maintained in situ, and the entire compressor must be removed if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt out windings can contaminate whole refrigeration systems requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the refrigerant replaced.|$|R
50|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 4, <b>refrigerant</b> vapor is <b>compressed</b> {{to a higher}} {{pressure}} resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed vapor is then condensed into a liquid. The condenser is where heat is expelled from the circulating refrigerant and is carried away by whatever cooling medium {{is used in the}} condenser (air, water, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|A thermal {{expansion}} valve {{is a key element}} to a heat pump; the cycle that makes air conditioning, or air cooling, possible. A basic refrigeration cycle consists of four major elements, a compressor, a condenser, a metering device and an evaporator. As a refrigerant passes through a circuit containing these four elements, air conditioning occurs. The cycle starts when refrigerant enters the compressor in a low-pressure, moderate-temperature, gaseous form. The <b>refrigerant</b> is <b>compressed</b> by the compressor to a high-pressure and high-temperature gaseous state. The high-pressure and high-temperature gas then enters the condenser. The condenser converts the high-pressure and high-temperature gas to a high-pressure liquid by transferring heat to a lower temperature medium, usually ambient air.|$|R
40|$|A {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (PWM) bypass capacity control technique for air conditioners has been developed to achieve high scroll compressor efficiency over a wide capacity range, and we investigated the technique’s fundamental characteristics in this study. With this capacity control technique, the refrigerant flow rate is controlled by periodically switching a full load mode, in which the <b>refrigerant</b> is <b>compressed</b> and discharged out of the compressor, and an unload mode, in which the <b>refrigerant</b> is not <b>compressed</b> so that the power needed to compress is unnecessary. In this study, we measured the pressure and input power of a compressor using the control technique to clarify the technique’s dynamic characteristics. We also developed a numerical simulation model to predict the dynamic behavior of the refrigerant. The calculated pressures {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the measured pressures and were used to estimate the relation between the PWM period and the efficiency or the discharge flow rate. Since the PWM period could not be determined by the demanded load capacity, the estimations were used to determine it. Using this period, we carried out performance tests of a compressor with PWM bypass capacity control. The results showed the capacity reached 30 % of the lower limit of rotational speed and that the calculated efficiencies agreed well with the experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction and}} performance of a temperature-controlled chamber, based on a 'vortex' cooler. The chamber is capable of operation between room temperature and - 42 C. The only nontrivial infrastructure requirement is dry compressed gas at 100 psi and 8 cfm. The chamber is economical, easy to operate and to build using commercially available parts. Since the <b>refrigerant</b> is <b>compressed</b> air, the chamber has minimal environmental impact. It does not generate mechanical vibrations nor electrical noise. It is suitable for testing electronically sensitive and low-power electronics at cold temperatures. We measured the reserve cooling capacity of the cold plate to be 17 watts at - 27 C. At the limiting temperature of - 42 C, reserve cooling power reduces to zero...|$|R
50|$|Most {{compressors}} {{are either}} positive displacement compressors or radial compressors. Positive displacement compressors are currently {{the most efficient}} type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit (400-2500 RT). They have a large range of possible power supplies, and can be 380 V, 1000 V, or even higher. The principle behind positive displacement compressors utilizes a turbine to <b>compress</b> <b>refrigerant</b> into high-pressure vapor. Positive displacement compressors are of four main types: screw compressor, rolling piston compressor, reciprocating compressor, and rotary compressor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the heating}} mode the ground {{serves as the}} evaporator. Liquid {{refrigerant}} coming - through the liquid line- from the heat pump’s indoor coil (serving as the condenser) is expanded and enters the smaller diameter tube of the ground loop. Heat is then transferred from the warmer ground to the ground loop. This leads to the refrigerant boiling to a vapor (evaporation) as it progresses through the loop. The refrigerant vapor then exits the ground loop and is returned -through the vapor line- to the compressor unit. Once in the compressor, the <b>refrigerant</b> is <b>compressed</b> to a higher pressure and temperature. The hot, superheated refrigerant vapor is now delivered to the indoor coil (condenser) where it gives off heat to the cooler building’s final delivery fluid {{with the assistance of}} the indoor circulator. As the refrigerant vapor gives off heat, it gradually condenses back to the liquid state.|$|R
50|$|Circulating {{refrigerant}} vapor {{enters the}} compressor, where its pressure and temperature are increased. The hot, <b>compressed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> vapor {{is now at}} a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air. The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils, making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.|$|R

50|$|Refrigeration {{compressors}} {{are essentially}} a pump for refrigerant gas. The {{capacity of the}} compressor,and hence the chiller cooling capacity, is measured in kilowatts input (kW), Horse power input (HP), orvolumetric flow (m3/h, ft3/h). The mechanism for <b>compressing</b> <b>refrigerant</b> gas differs betweencompressors, and {{each has its own}} application. Common refrigeration compressors includereciprocating, scroll, screw, or centrifugal. These can be powered by electric motors, steam turbines, orgas turbines. Compressors can have an integrated motor from a specific manufacturer, or be open drive--allowing the connection to another type of mechanical connection. Compressors can also be eitherHermetic (welded closed) or semihermetic (bolted together).|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the compressor in the vapor compression system, an electrochemical compressor (EC) was suggested and its performance was investigated. The EC <b>compresses</b> <b>refrigerant</b> by charging an external voltage to the membrane electrolyte assembly (MEA). Ammonia is used as a working fluid due to its high thermodynamic characteristics. This paper mainly focuses on two topics: thermodynamic compression limit at the open loop and the EC performance at the closed loop. The thermodynamic compression limit of the EC at open loop verifies the voltage and compression ratio relationship based on the Nernst equation. The current density of the MEA was investigated with voltage and refrigerant charge. The pressure lift across the EC was measured as well. ...|$|R
40|$|Rotary compressor(Fig. 1) {{has been}} {{improved}} in performance by reducing clearances between the roller piston and either the cylinder or sub-bearings which {{play a key}} role in the leakage of the <b>compressed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> gas. However, reducing the clearances increases friction loss due to the boundary lubrication between the rolling piston and the cylinder of the rotary compressor. Therefore it is necessary that an optimal clearance height should be determined by balancing two factors, the leakage and the friction. It is difficult, however, to measure the clearance height using conventional contact type measurement techniques such as gap gauge because clearances are not accessible and, more importantly, their sizes change when the compressor is assembled, especially bolted...|$|R
50|$|Emerson {{manufactures}} a {{scroll compressor}} that {{is capable of}} varying the refrigerant flow as per requirement. Instead of fixing the scrolls together permanently, the scrolls are allowed to move apart periodically. As the scrolls move apart, the motor continues to turn but the scrolls lose the ability to <b>compress</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> thus motor power is reduced when the scroll compressor is not pumping. By alternating the two different working states: the loaded state and the unloaded state. A solenoid contracts and expands the rotating scroll and/or the fixed scroll, using axial compliance. The controller modifies the load time, and the unload time, matching the capacity of the compressor to the load requested. This type of scroll compressors while offering variable capacity control, normally down to 20% of the full flow, can suffer from a significant loss of efficiency especially toward the lower range of the capacity control.|$|R
50|$|Circulating {{refrigerant}} gas vapor (which also carries the compressor lubricant oil across the system along with it) from the evaporator enters the gas compressor {{in the engine}} bay and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, <b>compressed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser, usually {{in front of the}} car's radiator. Here the refrigerant is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils (originating from the vehicle's movement or from a fan, often the same fan of the cooling radiator if the condenser is mounted on it, automatically turned on when the vehicle is stationary or moving at low speeds) and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant rejects heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air.|$|R
50|$|Since the Carnot {{cycle is}} a {{reversible}} cycle, the four processes that comprise it, two isothermal and two isentropic, {{can all be}} reversed as well. When this happens, it is called a reversed Carnot cycle. A refrigerator or heat pump that acts on the reversed Carnot cycle is called a Carnot refrigerator and Carnot heat pump respectively. In {{the first stage of}} this cycle (process 1-2), the refrigerant absorbs heat isothermally from a low-temperature source, TL, in the amount QL. Next, the <b>refrigerant</b> is isentropically <b>compressed</b> (process 2-3) and the temperature rises to the high-temperature source, TH. Then at this high temperature, the refrigerant rejects heat isothermally in the amount QH (process 3-4). Also during this stage, the refrigerant changes from a saturated vapor to a saturated liquid in the condenser. Lastly, the refrigerant expands isentropically where the temperature drops back to the low-temperature source, TL (process 4-1).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} construction of an energy scavenging system from a household air conditioning unit. The scavenged energy is used to heat up water for domestic purposes. The system consists of the condenser of a household air conditioning unit (existing), a pump, a plate heat exchanger, and a hot water storage tank. The condenser unit of a household air conditioner is modified to enable the flow of hot <b>compressed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> coming out from the compressor through the plate heat exchanger. The superheated portion of the heat is continuously absorbed by the water inside the hot water storage tank. Experimental investigation showed that this system can heat up water from room temperature to 82 ºC within 9 hours of operation (8 : 00 am to 5 : 00 pm). By using this type of energy scavenging device, compressor efficiency can be improved {{and at the same}} time, hot water for domestic purposes can continuously be obtained free of charge. The end result is faster cooling and prolonged compressor life. This system is simple yet affordable and able to save water heating cost and environment friendly, i. e., less heat is rejected to the environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{model of a}} variable speed rolling piston rotary compressor, with a speed range from 1100 rpm up to 9000 rpm, was developed to study {{the performance of the}} compressor. The mathematical simulation includes (1) a thermodynamic model of the cylinder refrigerant gas based on the principles of conservation of energy and mass, (2) a heat transfer model to predict the transient and steady-state temperatures of the compressor system and the degree of suction gas heating, (3) a one-dimensional compressible unsteady flow model to study the supercharging effects and 2 ̆ 2 wire drawing 2 ̆ 2 loss due to the suction process dynamics, and (4) a linear gas pulsation model based on the Helmholtz resonator approach to investigate the pressure oscillations in the compressor discharge manifolds.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} cooling systems produce {{water as}} a byproduct, which can be recovered and put to good use. In order to product cool air from a <b>compressed</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> a set of coils allow a hot, high-pressured refrigerant to dissipate its heat and condense into a liquid. An expansion valve is then typically used to evaporate and cool the refrigerant. This cool gas then runs {{through a set of}} coils that allows it to absorb heat and cool the air, which is blown over the coils and into the inside of the building. This process cools the warm coils, so when the warm air blowing past the coils reaches its dew point the moisture in the air condenses onto the coils, producing what is essentially distilled water. This byproduct of air conditioning units is called as Condensate drain water. The quality of condensate created by Air Conditioners is typically very high, having low amounts of suspended solids, a neutral to slightly acidic pH, and low temperatures. These characteristics make the condensate adequate for several non-potable uses such as irrigation, cooling tower make-up or toilet flushing. In addition to quality water, high recovery capacity is a major benefit of these systems. Although the amount of condensate produced can vary greatly and depends on the size and operational load of the Air-conditioning system as well as the ambient temperature and humidity within a particular region. A rule of thumb created by Karen Guz (Director of the Conservation Department for the San Antonio Water System, USA) is that 0. 1 to 0. 3 gallons of condensate per ton of air being chilled is produced every hour that the system is operating. Seizing this opportunity by replacing or supplementing potable water with the recovered condensate can considerably reduce a building’s demand for potable water. By implementing a condensate recovery system free, clean and unused water will be replacing costly, treated, high demand potable water. Decreasing the use of potable water within buildings {{plays a major role in}} conserving municipal sources. Moreover following potential LEED credits can be achieved. Water Efficient Landscaping a.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce the {{dependence}} on fossil fuels, a variety of research initiatives has focused on increasing the efficiency of conventional energy systems. One such approach is to use waste heat recovery to reclaim energy that is typically lost {{in the form of}} dissipative heat. An example of such reclamation is the use of waste heat recovery systems that take low-temperature heat and deliver cooling in space-conditioning applications. In this work, an ejector-based chiller driven by waste heat will be studied from the system to component to sub-component levels, with a specific focus on the ejector. The ejector is a passive device used to <b>compress</b> <b>refrigerants</b> in waste heat driven heat pumps without the use of high grade electricity or wear-prone complex moving parts. With such ejectors, the electrical input for the overall system can be reduced or eliminated entirely under certain conditions, and package sizes can be significantly reduced, allowing for a cooling system that can operate in off-grid, mobile, or remote applications. The performance of this system, measured typically as a coefficient of performance, is primarily dependent on the performance of the ejector pump. This work uses analytical and numerical modeling techniques combined with flow visualization to determine the exact mechanisms of ejector operation, and makes suggestions for ejector performance improvement. Specifically, forcing the presence of two-phase flow has been suggested as a potential tool for performance enhancement. This study determines the effect of two-phase flow on momentum transfer characteristics inside the ejector while operating with refrigerants R 134 a and R 245 fa. It is found that reducing the superheat at motive nozzle inlet results in a 12 - 13 % increase in COP with a 14 - 16 K decrease in driving waste heat temperature. The mechanisms of this improvement are found to be a combination of two effects: the choice of operating fluid (wet vs. dry) and the effect of two-phase flow on the effectiveness of momentum transfer. It is recommended that ejector-based chillers be operated such that the motive nozzle inlet is near saturation, and environmentally friendly dry fluids such as R 245 fa be used to improve performance. This work provides critical methods for ejector modeling and validation through visualization, as well as guidance on measures to improve ejector design with commensurate beneficial effects on cooling system COP.
