40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the implementation {{challenges faced by}} the current high performing error <b>resilient</b> <b>joint</b> source channel coding (JSCC) techniques based {{on the concept of}} softinput soft-output (SISO) decoding of arithmetic codes (AC). Further, it proposes several efficient algorithmic and a very large scale integration (VLSI) architectural techniques to improve the throughput performance of SISO for JSCC. The VLSI hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm, when implemented on a 90 nm standard cells technology running at 588 MHz, achieves a decoding throughput of up to 2. 63 Mbits/s capable of decoding QCIF format for video conferencin...|$|E
40|$|Osteochondral injuries, if {{not treated}} adequately, {{often lead to}} severe osteoarthritis. Possible {{treatment}} options include refixation of the fragment or replacement therapies such as Pridie drilling, microfracture or osteochondral grafts, {{all of which have}} certain disadvantages. Only refixation of the fragment can produce a smooth and <b>resilient</b> <b>joint</b> surface. The aim of this study was the evaluation of an ultrasound-activated bioresorbable pin for the refixation of osteochondral fragments under physiological conditions. Methods In 16 Merino sheep, specific osteochondral fragments of the medial femoral condyle were produced and refixed with one of conventional bioresorbable pins, titanium screws or ultrasound-activated pins. Macro- and microscopic scoring was undertaken after three months...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} the problem of shaft-hub {{connections}} rigidity and one way of solving it by using the new constructions of <b>resilient</b> keyed <b>joints.</b> Methods of experimental research of the <b>resilient</b> paral-lel keyed <b>joints</b> statics are described by showing de-pendences between their deformations, torque and sizes, and conclusions in comparison with theoretical research are made. Key words: shaft-hub connection, resilient parallel key, torque transfer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes {{an optimal}} maximum a poste-riori {{probability}} decoder for variable-length encoded sources over binary symmetric channels {{that uses a}} novel state-space {{to deal with the}} problem of variable-length source codes in the decoder. This sequential, finite-delay, joint source-channel decoder delivers substantial improvements over the conventional decoder and also over a system that uses a standard forward error correcting code operating at the same over all bit rates. This decoder is also robust to inaccuracies in the estimation of channel statistics. Index Terms—Error <b>resilient</b> communication, <b>joint</b> source-channel decoding, MAP decoding, variable length codes. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{useful life}} of the wire probe in an {{ultrasonic}} kidney stone disintegration instrument is enhanced and prolonged by attaching the wire of the wire probe {{to the tip of}} an ultrasonic transducer by means of a clamping arrangement. Additionally, damping material is applied to the wire probe {{in the form of a}} damper tube through which the wire probe passes in the region adjacent the transducer tip. The damper tube extends outwardly from the transducer tip a predetermined distance, terminating in a <b>resilient</b> soft rubber <b>joint.</b> Also, the damper tube is supported intermediate its length by a support member. The damper system thus acts to inhibit lateral vibrations of the wire in the region of the transducer tip while providing little or no damping to the linear vibrations imparted to the wire by the transducer...|$|R
50|$|Whereas the RE used {{a complex}} stepped frame on bus variants. Seddon {{decided to use}} a {{straight}} frame using 8in channel longitudinals and mainly tubular cross-members which was oriented to rise from front to rear at about 5 degrees from the horizontal. Wheelbases offered were either 16 ft 6in for 33 ft coachwork or 18 ft 6in for 36 ft bodies. Instead of the complex drive-line arrangement of the RE a straightforward T-drive layout was employed. The rear end of the 10.45-litre Gardner 6HLX (the 8.6 litre 6HLW was optional) was mounted below and hard against the rear cross member on the short version, driving directly via a fluid flywheel into a Self-Changing Gears 4 or 5-speed direct-operating epicyclic gearbox, air-operated with electrical control. The Eaton spiral-bevel rear axle, {{to a variety of}} different final drive ratios, was just ahead of the power pack and a very short drive shaft was fitted with <b>resilient</b> rubber-based <b>joints.</b> Originally on the long-wheelbase version a similar arrangement was employed but with the engine further {{from the rear of the}} frame. Conventional leaf springs were used, but the spring shackle-pins were fitted with polyurethane bushes, which would not require greasing and so reduce maintenance costs. The braking was full air-operated using Girling wedge-type drum brakes. A spring operated air parking-brake was employed, power steering for the Seddon-designed front-axle was optionally available. Unlike the RE and the Leyland Panther the radiator was not carried at the front but hung from the offside of the chassis in mid-wheelbase, ahead of the rear axle. A combined saloon heating and ventilation system with a thermostatically-controlled heat-exchanger and reversible fan drive was announced but this was never made available to customers.|$|R
