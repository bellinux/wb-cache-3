40|$|Single event upsets (SEUs) {{are caused}} in {{semiconductor}} microcircuits when charge is deposited in a <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> of the circuit by an incident energetic particle.

Sensitive regions of a microcircuit typically consist of reverse-biased junctions which efficiently collect deposited charge through the influence of drift fields. During laboratory SEU testing, angled ion strikes are often used to conveniently mimic normally incident particles of higher linear energy transfer (LET). This practice is based on ion pathlengths through a thin rectangular parallelepiped (RPP) <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume.</b> Specifically, the authors assume that an angled strike deposits 1 /cos{theta} more charge in the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume,</b> {{which in turn is}} assumed to lead to 1 /cos{theta} more charge collection at the sensitive node, and an increase in the particle`s effective LET to 1 /cos{theta} higher than at normal incidence...|$|R

40|$|The dose {{imparted}} {{by a small}} non-equilibrium {{photon radiation}} field to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> of a detector located within a water phantom depends on {{the density of the}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume.</b> Here this effect is explained using cavity theory, and analysed using Monte Carlo data calculated for schematically modelled diamond and Pinpoint-type detectors. The combined impact of the density and atomic composition of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> on its response is represented as a ratio, Fw,det, of doses absorbed by equal volumes of unit density water and detector material co-located within a unit density water phantom. The impact of density alone is characterized through a similar ratio, Pρ -, of doses absorbed by equal volumes of unit and modified density water. The cavity theory is developed by splitting the dose absorbed by the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> into two components, imparted by electrons liberated in photon interactions occurring inside and outside the volume. Using this theory a simple model is obtained that links Pρ - to the degree of electronic equilibrium, see, at the centre of a field via a parameter Icav determined by the density and geometry of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume.</b> Following the scheme of Bouchard et al (2009 Med. Phys. 36 4654 - 63) Fw,det can be written as the product of Pρ -, the water-to-detector stopping power ratio [L[overline](Δ) /ρ](w) (det), and an additional factor Pfl -. In small fields [L[overline](Δ) /ρ](w) (det) changes little with field-size; and for the schematic diamond and Pinpoint detectors Pfl - takes values close to one. Consequently most of the field-size variation in Fw,det originates from the Pρ - factor. Relative changes in see and in the phantom scatter factor sp are similar in small fields. For the diamond detector, the variation of Pρ - with see (and thus field-size) is described well by the simple cavity model using an Icav parameter in line with independent Monte Carlo estimates. The model also captures the overall field-size dependence of Pρ - for the schematic Pinpoint detector, again using an Icav value consistent with independent estimates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction This study investigates {{uncertainties}} {{pertaining to}} the use of optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) in radiotherapy dosimetry. The sensitivity of the luminescent material is related to the density of recombination centres [1], which is in the range of 1015 – 1016 cm- 3. Because of this non-uniform distribution of traps in crystal growth the sensitivity varies substantially within a batch of dosimeters. However, a quantitative understanding {{of the relationship between the}} response of an OSLD and its <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> has not yet been investigated or reported in literature. Methods In this work, OSLDs are scanned with a MicroCT scanner to determine potential sources for the variation in relative sensitivity across a selection of Landauer nanoDot dosimeters. Specifically, the correlation between a dosimeters relative sensitivity and the loading density of Al 2 O 3 :C powder was determined. Results When extrapolating the <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume’s</b> radiodensity from the CT data, it was shown that there is a non-uniform distribution incrystal growth as illustrated in Fig. 1. A plot of voxel count versus the element-specific correction factor is shown in Fig. 2 where each point represents a single OSLD. A line was fitted which has an R 2 -value of 0. 69 and a P-value of 8. 21 9 10 - 19.

40|$|Besides {{the fine}} spatial {{resolution}} inherent in polymer gel-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dosimetry, the method also features {{the potential for}} multiple measurements of varying <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> in a single experiment by integrating results in MRI voxels of finite dimensions (i. e., in plane resolution by slice thickness). This work exploits this feature of polymer gel dosimetry to propose an experimental technique for relative output factor (OF) measurements of small radiosurgical beams. Two gel vials were irradiated with a 5 and 30 mm diameter 6 MV radiosurgery beam and MR scanned with the same slice thickness and three different in plane resolutions. Using this experimental data set, 5 mm OF measurements with the PinPoint ion chamber are simulated by integrating results over a <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> {{equal to that of}} the chamber. Results are found in agreement within experimental uncertainties with actual PinPoint measurements verifying the validity of the proposed experimental procedure. The polymer gel data set is subsequently utilized for OF measurements of the 5 mm beam with varying <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> to discuss the magnitude of detector volume averaging effects. Seeking to correct for volume averaging, results are extrapolated to zero <b>sensitive</b> <b>volume</b> yielding a 5 mm OF measurement of (0. 66 +/- 5 %). This result compares reasonably with corresponding ionometric and radiographic film measurements of this work and corresponding, limited, data in the literature. Overall, results suggest that polymer gel dosimetry coupled with the proposed experimental procedure helps overcome not only tissue-equivalence and beam perturbation implications but also volume averaging and positioning uncertainties which constitute the main drawback in small radiosurgical beam dosimetry.

The microdosimeters, which demonstrate well-defined <b>sensitive</b> <b>volumes,</b> have significant potential for applications in regional microdosimetry. And, the highly tunable gate-defined quantum dots, which allow the observation of the single-electron regime, provide significant promise for quantum computation in coupled quantum dots. The design, fabrication and demonstration of novel cylindrical silicon-on-insulator (SOI) single-diode microdosimeters and arrayed microdosimeters is presented.

Experimental characterisation using ion-beam-induced charge collection (IBICC) technique shows that the devices achieve well-defined cylindrical <b>sensitive</b> <b>volumes</b> with excellent charge collection characteristics. Results also show that arrays of these <b>sensitive</b> <b>volumes</b> can be successfully read out in a parallel mode. Next, a few-electron double quantum dot was fabricated using metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible technology and low-temperature transport measurements were performed to study the energy spectrum of the device. The double dot structure is electrically tunable, enabling the interdot coupling to be adjusted over a wide range, as observed in the charge stability diagram.

Low-temperature electronic transport measurements of a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot, with independent gate control of electron densities in the leads and the quantum dot island is also reported. This architecture allows the dot energy levels to be probed without affecting the electron density in the leads, and vice versa. Appropriate gate biasing enables the dot occupancy to be reduced to the single-electron level, as evidenced by magnetospectroscopy measurements of the ground state of the first two charge transitions.
