5|$|In March 2006, the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Stewardship Council {{was formed}} to address {{post-closure}} management of <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> and provide a forum for public discussion. This organization was the successor organization to the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Coalition of Local Governments, which advocated for stakeholders during the site cleanup. The Council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information and Council meetings minutes and reports are available on its website. Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment {{announced}} its Cancer Registry was preparing a follow up cancer study {{to its original}} 1998 report on cancer incidence {{in the vicinity of}} the former <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Plant. The original report and 2016 report found no pattern of increased cancers in communities around <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Plant was {{a former}} U.S. nuclear weapons {{production}} facility about 15 miles northwest of Denver, Colorado, which caused radioactive contamination, primarily plutonium, americium, and uranium, within and outside its boundaries. The facility was dismantled and removed, and the central industrial area of the property became a Superfund site, surrounded by the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

5|$|In 1983 the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center {{was founded}} {{with a goal}} of closing the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> plant. The Center has since set goals of keeping the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> National Wildlife Refuge closed to the public, {{preventing}} construction of highways {{in or near the}} site of the former plant, and preventing new housing construction in the area. The Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation an, as of 2014, has one full-time employee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

5000|$|Mount McIntyre (...) is a <b>rocky,</b> <b>flat,</b> projecting-type {{mountain}} {{that forms the}} northeastern extremity of D'Angelo Bluff in Antarctica. It rises at {{the west side of}} Scott Glacier, near the head, directly opposite Mount Howe. The mountain was discovered in December 1934 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party led by Quin Blackburn, and was named by Admiral Byrd for Marvin H. McIntyre, Secretary to the President of the United States at that time, Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|R

I couldn't explain that this wasn't <b>Rocky's</b> <b>flat</b> without giving the poor old chap away hopelessly, because she would then ask me where he did live, {{and then he would}} be right in the soup. I was trying to induce the old bean to recover from the shock and produce some results when she spoke again.|$|R
5|$|The 1969 fire raised public {{awareness}} of potential hazards posed by the plant and led to years of increasing citizen protests and demands for plant closure. Releases from previous years had not been reported publicly prior to the fire; airborne-become-groundborne radioactive contamination extending well beyond the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> plant was not publicly reported until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{radioactive}} contamination from <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> came from three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969. Plutonium, {{used to construct}} the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously combust at room temperatures in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during the decades of plant operations.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of April 28, 1979, more than 15,000 people {{demonstrated}} against the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Nuclear Weapons Plant. The protest was coordinated with other anti-nuclear demonstrations across the country. Daniel Ellsberg and Allen Ginsberg were among the 284 people who were arrested. The demonstration followed {{more than six months}} of continuous protests that included an attempted blockade of the railroad tracks leading to the site. Large pro-nuclear counter demonstrations were also staged that year.|$|E

5|$|Weapons {{production}} at the plant was halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989. Due {{to the end of}} the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Plant was shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to cleanup. The <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Plant was declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and, treated more than 16 million gallons of water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Geography {{also allows}} Denver {{to have a}} {{considerable}} government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city {{by virtue of its}} being the capital of the state of Colorado. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats,</b> the Denver Federal Center, Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse, the Denver Mint, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1983, about 10,000 demonstrators {{turned out}} for protest at the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Nuclear Weapons Plant (well short of the 21,000 hoped for by protest organizers). No arrests were made. On August 10, 1987 (the 42nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki), 320 demonstrators were arrested after they tried to force a one-day {{shutdown}} of the plant. A similar protest with a turnout of about 3,500 was staged on August 6, 1989 (the anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima).|$|E
25|$|The reef flat is the sandy-bottomed flat, {{which can}} be behind the main reef, {{containing}} chunks of coral. This zone may border a lagoon {{and serve as a}} protective area, or it may lie between the reef and the shore, and in this case is a <b>flat,</b> <b>rocky</b> area. Fishes tend to prefer living in that <b>flat,</b> <b>rocky</b> area, compared to any other zone, when it is present.|$|R
50|$|The Rip is {{generally}} considered to be located in the triangular area of water between the land points of Point Nepean, Shortlands Bluff and Point Lonsdale. The entrance between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean is 3.5 km wide but the reefs projecting from these points reduce the navigable width to about 1 km. Within 800m outside the Heads, there is a shallow <b>rocky</b> <b>flat</b> known as the Rip Bank. The water deepens outside this flat to 30m and inside the Heads to as much as 90 m. This inequality of depth combined with tidal streams running up to 6 knots, causes the world-renowned dangerous conditions. The variation in seafloor depth within the rip itself can be anywhere from 100m to less than 5m amongst the rocky reefs and shoals.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} pair formation, spatial pattern of home range and spatial variation in density, size {{and social status}} of blotched foxface Siganus unimaculatus (family Siganidae) on an Okinawan coral reef. Of 32 pairs sampled for sexing, 31 (96. 9 %) were heterosexual and showed size-assortative pairing. Developed ovaries were found in April and July, whereas oocytes were immature in August, September and February. Heterosexual pairing was found in both reproductive and non-reproductive periods. Home range size tended to be positively related to fork length (FL). The degree of home range overlap for same size class pairs was smaller than that for different size class pairs. The intraspecific behavior when two pairs approached each other was categorized as ‘attack,’ ‘agonistic display’ and ‘no interactions,’ {{and the frequency of}} agonistic behaviors (“attack” or “agonistic display”) was significantly greater than “no interactions. ” Underwater observations at a seagrass bed, a <b>rocky</b> reef <b>flat</b> and a sheltered reef slope revealed that the mean FL was significantly smaller at the sheltered reef slope (4 – 13 cm) than at the <b>rocky</b> reef <b>flat</b> (> 13 cm). No individuals were found in the seagrass bed. Most individuals less than 6 cm FL were solitary, whereas most individuals over 7 cm FL were paired. Density was significantly greater on the sheltered reef slope than on the <b>rocky</b> reef <b>flat...</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E
5|$|Morland's {{article was}} {{published}} in the November 1979 issue of The Progressive. A month later he published an erratum in The Progressive with updates based on information that he had gathered during the trial from UCRL-4725, Chuck Hansen's letter and other sources. In Morland's opinion, the article contributed to a wave of anti-nuclear activism in the late 1970s and early 1980s that resulted in, amongst other things, the closure of the <b>Rocky</b> <b>Flats</b> Plant near Denver. Chuck Hansen went on to publish a book, U.S. Nuclear Weapons: The Secret History in 1988. This was subsequently expanded to a self-published five volume work entitled Swords of Armageddon. However, many mainstream media organizations still remained reluctant to test the law by publishing. On September 30, 1980, the Justice Department issued a statement that it would not prosecute alleged violations of the Atomic Energy Act during the Daily Californian or The Progressive cases.|$|E

40|$|Victoria beach (SW Spain) has a <b>rocky</b> <b>flat</b> at {{the northernmost}} zone. This has allowed {{to choose one}} profile and {{monitoring}} the changes induced by a single day storm. Topographic data taken during 21 days and different tendencies of the beach profile, as the accretion rate, were identified. The analysis is carried out by means of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) techniques, in order to separate the spatial from the temporal variability of the beach profile data. Among the conclusions, it should be highlighted that a swing or oscillation point of the profile was found around the intertidal zone. Furthermore, the erosion has been irreversible in a short term, and the recuperation consisted only in a modification of {{the slopes of the}} emerged part, trying to assimilate them to the ones before the storm.

60|$|The plain even at {{an early}} hour reeked with vapours {{distilled}} by the fires of the Samum: about noon, however, the air became cloudy, and nothing of colour remained, save that milky white haze, dull, but glaring withal, which is the prevailing day-tint in these regions. At mid-day we reached a narrowing of the basin, where, from both sides, “Irk,” or low hills, stretch their last spurs into the plain. But after half a mile, it again widened to upwards of two miles.
