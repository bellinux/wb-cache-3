50|$|The main {{products}} today are the heavy duty Ural sidecar motorcycles with two-wheel-drive designed for rough, rugged terrain, and cT model for urban commuting and paved road touring. There are many places in Russia where poor roads, or {{a lack of}} roads, makes horses and URAL motorcycles necessary to transport gear. URAL motorcycles have four-stroke, (as of 2014) fuel injected air-cooled, flat-twin engines, a four speed gear box with <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>shaft</b> drive, two disc dry clutch, spring shock absorbers, and (as of 2014) disc brakes on all three wheels. The company has developed an engine that meets the standards required by the modern sporting and leisure rider. Though the outward appearance of the engine is the same as before, new quality control techniques employ better alloying and casting, better engineering tolerances, and better paint, powder coating and stainless steel exhausts while retaining the advantage of continuity with the inherently balanced design of a horizontally-opposed flat twin engine with roller bearings in a solid frame.|$|E

This paper offers very valuable reference to product optimization and gear improvement. Instruction The test vehicle makes abnormal sound when the makers have a test for uphill with <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b> Entrusted by the makers, we have checked the gearbox. After the disassembling, We find that the tooth of the <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> of primary <b>shaft</b> and <b>reverse</b> idler <b>gear</b> have fractured, and in this case, the gear pair are scrapping.

40|$|AbstractThe 17 CrNiMo 6 {{steel is}} mainly {{used for the}} <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> of large modulus in many fields of heavy {{industry}} such as mining, transit, hoist, forging and so on[1]. The size of addendum circle and common normal line is changed a lot beyond the tolerance because of the long time of carburizing process and the out-of-step structural stress and thermal stress during the quenching process. And thus the posterior grinding efficiency and quality are influenced. In the paper comparison {{and analysis of the}} deformation affected by solid and hollow <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> were done and the methods of simulation and practice were both used. The results are as follows: the deformation of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> was small before and after carburizing while that of <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> was large before and after quenching because of different cooling velocity, structure and hardness of each position. And the deformation of hollow was much smaller than that of solid. Therefore, if the hollow <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> is used, the waste of material will be decreased, and finishing cost will be reduced, and thus the technology of heat treatment will be optimized...|$|R

50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three <b>gear</b> <b>shafts.</b> The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of articulated locomotives {{was a major}} impetus to the {{development of}} power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> instead of just one on a simple locomotive. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features. In British use, locking cylinders remained in use. The Hadfield <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> with added locking cylinder.Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system.|$|R

30|$|Under sterile conditions, the cell-bearing {{glass plate}} was {{attached}} to {{the lower end of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> with the cells facing the bottom plate. A space of 2  mm between the two plates was determined via computational simulations. After filling the lower petri dish to 70 % of its capacity with culture medium, a closing plate with a centred recess for the <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> (4  mm) was placed on top to seal the lower compartment. Lastly, a larger petri dish, having a central recess (4  mm), with an externally attached electric motor, was reversely installed above to form the upper compartment. As shown in Fig.  1, the transmission between motor and <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> was realised by using two same-sized gearwheels, one fixed on each of the two components within the non-sterile upper compartment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper takes a helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> as {{research}} subject and discusses the main structural parameters {{to see how}} it would affect natural frequency sensitivity. The parametrical model of helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> is created by using software PROE 3. 0. The natural frequencies and vibration shapes are calculated by the modal analysis. The relationship between the structural parameters and the natural frequency sensitivity can be obtained by means of ANSYS. The result shows that the structural parameters can affect the natural frequency sensitivity. The variation in low order natural frequency is similar to that in high order natural frequency. The effect of module on the natural frequency sensitivity is more remarkable comparing with pressure angle, modification coefficient and helical angle. Selecting structural parameters reasonably may reduce vibration and noise of the helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> effectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory tests that {{were aimed at}} detecting early stages of various faults in toothed wheels by measurement and analysis of transverse vibration speed of the transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts.</b> In experimental investigation, cracking of the root tooth and chipping of the tooth were detected. The laser vibrometer Ometron VH 300 + was used for non-contact measurement of shaft transversal vibration speed. Gear vibrations were recorded in selected points of gear housing and <b>gear</b> <b>shafts</b> at different speeds and gear loads. Results were analyzed and compared but in this paper is presented only selected examples. This paper shows that {{on the basis of}} the transverse vibration speed of transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shafts,</b> it is possible to detect defects at an earlier stage than {{on the basis of the}} housing vibration accelerations. In the case of measuring <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> vibration velocity, the way of the signal generated by the defect of a gear wheel (or bearing) is shortened as well as the influence of composed transmittance of the bearing-gear housing system is eliminated. WV time-frequency analysis and complex continuous wavelet transformations were used for detection. The authors introduced a measure of local tooth damage, which was proportional to the size of damage. The results of research presented in this paperconfirmed that the defect's measure is very sensitive to the development of teeth faults...|$|R
