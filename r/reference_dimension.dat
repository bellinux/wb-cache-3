40|$|Abstract—Finding {{the size}} and {{distance}} of objects viewed through a single optical path—a typical endoscopic condition—is a challenge. Stereo imaging, which would provide {{the size and}} distance information, typically requires multiple optical channels or other elaborate techniques, increasing the endoscope diameter and system complexity. This paper reports {{the development of a}} miniature flipping disk device that enables stereo measurement, and demonstrates the operation of the device installed in an endo-scope. The fabricated Pyrex disk (1. 2 mm in diameter and 485 μm in thickness), anodically bonded to a 50 -μm-thick silicon vertical comb-drive actuator, is flipped to ± 10. 7 ◦ at a resonant frequency of 414 Hz by 10 VAC of electrostatic actuation. The image shift made by such glass flipping provides a <b>reference</b> <b>dimension,</b> against which the real size and distance of objects seen through a standard single-channel endoscope can be estimated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{identify}} any potential {{relations between the}} size of an emptied plaque cavity and the remodelling pattern, plaque or vessel dimensions, lumen narrowing, and other ultrasonic lesion characteristics.  DESIGN—Intravascular ultrasound was used to examine prospectively 51  ruptured ulcerated coronary plaques. Cross sectional area measurements comprised lumen, vessel, plaque, and emptied plaque cavity. Lumen narrowing was calculated as 1  − (lesion lumen area/reference lumen area)  ×  100 %. A remodelling index was calculated as lesion vessel area/reference vessel area, and plaques were divided into those with values >  1. 05 (group A) and ⩽  1. 05 (group B).  RESULTS—Of the total of 51  plaques, 36  (71 %) were assigned to group A and 15  (29 %) to group B.  In neither group was there a significant difference in <b>reference</b> <b>dimensions</b> and lumen narrowing. However, lesion vessel (mean (SD) : 22. 6  (8. 1) mm 2 v 17. 5  (4. 3) mm 2; p =  0. 006) and plaque areas (15. 8  (6. 2) mm 2 v 12. 8  (3. 2) mm 2; p =  0. 03) were greater in group A than in group B.  The cavity inside the plaque was larger in group A than in group B (2. 8  (1. 6) mm 2 v 1. 8  (0. 9) mm 2; p =  0. 007) and showed a positive linear relation with lesion and reference vessel size (r =  0. 58 and 0. 56, respectively; p <  0. 001), but not with lumen narrowing.  CONCLUSIONS—The size of the emptied cavity inside ruptured plaques is on average larger in lesions with adaptive vascular remodelling, and shows a linear relation with lesion plaque and vessel size and with the <b>reference</b> <b>dimensions,</b> but not with the degree of lumen narrowing.    Keywords: intravascular ultrasound; ultrasonic scanning; plaque rupture; remodellin...|$|R
40|$|Generally it is {{impossible}} to determine the size of an object from a single image due to the depth-scale ambiguity problem. However, with knowledge of the geometry of the scene and the existence of known <b>reference</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the image, it is possible to infer the real world dimensions of objects with only a single image. In this paper, we investigate different methods of automatically determining the dimensions of cuboids (rectangular boxes) from a single image, using a novel reference target.

The accuracy of the measurements will be evaluated in the presence of noise in the feature points. The effects of lens distortions on the accuracy of the measurements will be investigated.

30|$|Uses {{a complex}} dynamic {{observation}} process supported by reflexive and iterative understanding. The observation process {{supported by the}} framework {{can be viewed as}} leading to an emergent process of understanding of a complex phenomenon, which is, in this case, the sustainability of a complex human–natural system. As described earlier, we consider that the basis of sustainability understanding is mainly formed by the interplay of the two dimensions of sustainability-linked knowledge and sustainability-linked worldview (Figure  4 a). On this basis, the other dimensions are employed to strengthen the understanding of sustainability further by gaining new observation contexts. In this process, the new <b>reference</b> <b>dimension</b> becomes the cumulative worldview and knowledge, and the observing dimension becomes, e.g., the resource limitation or availability. With the understanding gained through employing these dimensions together, the first sustainability boundary is obtained, whereas in this example, the boundary could be a threshold amount of resources (Figure  4 b). Once these limitations are recognized, taking the previously considered dimensions collectively (worldview, knowledge, and resources) as the reference, and then observing possible governing practices to overcome these limitations, a new sustainability boundary can be obtained (Figure  4 c). In this process, the previous understanding continues to inform the new understanding. Therefore, the pattern consists of iterative steps, where the meaning of iteration in this instance would denote building upon previous steps in understanding.|$|E

To measure organizational health, dimensions developed by Lyden and Klingele (2000) and to measure organizational effectiveness, dimensions developed by Quin and Rohrbaugh (1981, 1983) were employed. In order to achieve the validity of measurement models and the consistency of the proposed model showing the relationship between organizational health dimensions and organizational effectiveness, a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were performed. In an overall measurement models, the adequacy and the reliability of indicators were proved by measuring the composite reliability, the estimated percentage of variance extracted by each construct, discriminant and convergent validity. The results of DFA confirmed the seven dimensional nature of the organizational health and the nine dimensional nature of the organizational effectiveness. “Loyalty and morale, institutional reputation and ethics, development and resource utilization" dimensions were found to be effective in predicting organizational effectiveness in consequence of testing the structural equation model 1. As a result of the findings obtained from the proposed models in order to test the relationship between organizational health dimensions and organizational effectiveness dimensions, “development and resource utilization” dimension was determined as the <b>reference</b> <b>dimension</b> to predict organizational effectiveness.

40|$|Radio, {{optical and}} X-rays telescopes are {{improving}} {{our knowledge of}} deep space. All these telescopes detect electromagnetic radiation at various frequencies. But {{a different kind of}} radiation is generated in the deeper space; it is the gravitational one. Gravitational waves change the space-time metric. As a consequence, GW telescopes should detect an extremely small strain (h < 10 /sup - 21 /) of the geometry of a reference frame; if the frame has a <b>reference</b> <b>dimension</b> (L) of some kilometers, the deformation amplitude (Delta L = h * L) is limited to 10 /sup - 16 / meters. Laser interferometers are the most suitable devices to make precise measurements of distances. Their resolution is limited by the laser wavelength (lambda = 10 /sup - 6 / meters) and by the light wave-shift detection capability (Delta Phi = 1 ppb). These theoretical limits are strongly degraded by different noise sources, which reduce the actual resolution by several orders of magnitude. Applied physicists and engineers are working together to overcome the technical problems that still keep the distance between theoretical and actual detectors' performances. Three large GW telescopes, based on the laser interferometric technology, are under commissioning in the USA (2) and Europe (1). They will become operatives in the next years, with sensitivity of the order of h = 10 /sup - 21 /, in the range between 10 Hz and a few kHz. Among the others, two characteristics are peculiar of the VIRGO interferometer: the high performance of the minors' seismic isolation system and the huge ultra high vacuum volume, that will result in the biggest UHV apparatus ever built all over Europe.

The cheliped handedness in males was also analyzed. The LMC was measured in 480 males, the AW in 566 females, and all crabs had the carapace width (CW) measured that was considered as the <b>reference</b> <b>dimension</b> for both sexes. The inflection point in the graphs between each the dimensions and CW was calculated with the aid of the software REGRANS. The CW ranged from 2. 33 to 8. 33 mm in males and from 1. 65 to 7. 79 mm in females. The relationship between CW and LMC showed an inflection point at 4. 14 mm CW among males, and between CW and AW at 3. 52 mm CW among females. The allometric growth was positive for both dimensions throughout the entire ontogeny of both sexes, before and after the puberty. The equations describing the relationship between CW and LMC in males were: logLMC = - 0. 695960 + 1. 72. logCW for juveniles and logLMC = - 1. 212513 + 2. 5. logCW for adults.

BackgroundOCT is a promising light-based intravascular imaging modality with higher resolution than IVUS. However, the paucity of data on OCT image quantification has limited its application in clinical practice. MethodsA total of 227 matched OCT and IVUS pull backs were studied. One hundred FD-OCT and IVUS pull backs in nonstented (n = 56) and stented (n = 44) vessels were compared. Additionally, 127 matched TD-OCT and IVUS images were compared in stented vessels. ResultsFD-OCT depicted more severe native coronary disease than IVUS; minimal lumen area (MLA) was 2. 33 ± 1. 56 mm 2 versus 3. 32 ± 1. 92 mm 2, respectively (p < 0. 001). <b>Reference</b> vessel <b>dimensions</b> were equivalent between FD-OCT and IVUS in both native and stented coronaries, but TD-OCT detected smaller reference lumen size compared with IVUS. Immediately post-PCI, in-stent MLAs were similar between FD-OCT and IVUS, but at follow-up, both FD-OCT and TD-OCT detected smaller MLAs than did IVUS, likely due to better detection of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH). Post-PCI malapposition and tissue prolapse were more frequently identified by FD-OCT. ConclusionsFD-OCT generates similar <b>reference</b> lumen <b>dimensions</b> but higher degrees of disease severity and NIH, as well as better detection of malapposition and tissue prolapse compared with IVUS.

The primary aims {{of this study were}} to gain an understanding of nurses 2 ̆ 7 conceptions regarding suicide and suicide assessment, describe the strategies of suicide assessment adopted by psychiatric nurses, and contrast these to contemporary standards and practice guidelines of suicide assessment. ^ The research design was an inductive descriptive phenomenographic study. The nurse participants consisted of a snowball sample of six psychiatric nurses practicing in two psychiatric settings. The data were collected through participant observations of nurses 2 ̆ 7 assessing patients and semi-structured in-depth interviews with nurses regarding their assessments of actual cases and vignettes. ^ The participants in the study while performing suicide assessments relied on several different strategies among the common 10 categories that emerged as the core set of strategies. In most cases the nurses used between four to six different strategies in combination rather than relying solely on one specific strategy. However, the strategies used in suicide assessments by these nurses did not cover the areas identified in the standard guidelines in a comprehensive or all-inclusive manner, suggesting that the nurses were not systematic in their assessments. Out of the 10 categories, four have been linked to qualitative differences in suicide risk assessment. Namely, (1) reliance on exemplars, (2) reliance on intuition, (3) reliance on the assessments of other professionals, and (4) reliance on related stories. ^ The characteristics of the 10 categories of description regarding suicide assessment could be classified into three dimensions: (a) the Knowledge Dimension, (b) the Method Dimension, and (c) the <b>Reference</b> <b>Dimension.</b> These Dimensions provide a “structure of suicide assessment” used in nursing practice by the participants of this study. ^ The findings of this investigation are descriptive and were discovered in the nurses 2 ̆ 7 practice.

O comprimento da maior quela (CMQ) foi medido em 319 machos, e a largura do abdome (LAB) em 356 fêmeas. Adicionalmente, seis chama-marés sexualmente indiferenciados foram analisados. A largura da carapaça (LC) foi escolhida como dimensão de referência para ambos os sexos, a qual variou de 1, 94 a 20, 0 mm para machos, de 2, 50 a 18, 85 mm para fêmeas, e de 1, 94 a 3, 15 para os indivíduos sexualmente indiferenciados.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze teacher interventions in laboratory groups of elementary school students. It was designed as a descriptive study of interventions, with cross tabulations of certain variables. The study attempted to find information on the number and length of interventions, who initiated the interventions and for what reason, and to ascertain the outcome of the interventions. These variables were considered overall, and by group, class, and grade. The student variables of IQ, self-concept, extraversion and neuroticism were correlated with the student behavior variables of the proportion of sentences, solicits, responses, requests, and commands made during the intervention. The same student behavior variables during and outside the interventions were also studied. [...] The sample consisted of ten elementary classes, from grade 2, 4, and 6. Two pairs of students from each class were observed using videotape. The lessons chosen for taping were activity oriented, having the development of processes as one of their main objectives. After videotaping was completed, students were administered the Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory, a Self-Concept questionnaire, and the Raven Colored Progressive Matrices, Sets A, Ab, B, designed to measure IQ. [...] After all data were collected, typed transcripts were prepared from audio portions of the tapes. After the transcripts were edited, they were coded. Coded data was then keypunched with each unit of analysis on a separate card, and the punched data transferred to a computer disk file. Teacher intervention data was then isolated and analyzed. [...] Considering intervention length and number, results indicated that overall the length of the interventions was relatively short, and the number of interventions was generally low. [...] T-tests results in no significant difference for intervention length between groups within a class. Analysis of variance resulted in no significant differences between classes and between grades with respect to intervention length. [...] A critical incidents techniques showed that teachers intervened mainly to give procedure and to solicit progress reports. Students generally initiated interventions to report observations or to give a progress report. Teachers requested more often than did students. Both teachers and students did very little reacting. [...] Chi square tests showed that a significant relationship existed between the speaker and: (i) the type of pedagogical move, where teachers tended to solicit while students tended to respond; (ii) the use of gives, requests, and commands, where teachers tended to request more, and students tended to give more; (iii) the use of the Nature of <b>Reference</b> <b>dimension,</b> where both teachers and students tended to make reference to apparatus and individual results; and (iv) the use of the Rating dimension, where rating by both teachers and students was extremely low.

The proposed method is applied to multi-objective OPF problems in IEEE 30 -bus, IEEE 57 -bus and IEEE 300 -bus test systems. The results are compared with those obtained by other algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the IABC algorithm, and how the optimal scheme obtained by the proposed model can make systems more economical and stable. optimal power flow; fuzzy satisfaction-maximizing method; artificial bee colony algorithm; differential evolution algorithm; tent chaos mappin...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} predatory {{behaviour}} of Cancer novaezelandiae (Decapoda : Brachyura : Cancridae), a subtidal crab from Lyttelton Harbour, Banks Peninsula. Cancer crabs were obtained at bimonthly intervals over a 22 month sampling period. Examination of stomach contents suggested that C. novaezelandiae was an opportunistic predator feeding {{on a wide}} variety of food items. Molluscs composed the major components of diet, with bivalves and gastropods comprising 35 % of all food items. Crustacea were the next most important group comprising 20 % of all food items. Amphipods, isopods and crabs were the most frequent crustaceans found. Other food types included fish, sponges, coelenterates and plant matter in relatively low abundances. No variation in dietary composition was evident with crab sex, size or season. The functional morphology of the chelae, mouthparts and gastric mill were examined for two size-classes of crab (60. 0 - 70. 0 and 120. 0 - 130. 0 mm carapace width). The mouthparts and gastric mill were generalised in structure and were typical of large, predatory brachyurans. Large crista dentata of the third maxilliped and sharp, rounded mandibles, together with large, heavily chitinised gastric mill ossicles suggested that C. novaezelandiae was well equipped to macerate course, particulate matter. No variation in either mouthparts and gastric mill structure was evident with crab size or sex. Left and right chela of C. novaezelandiae were morphologically similar in shape and dental pattern, and no difference was found between sexes. Relative growth of the chelae was described from measurements made on propodus height and length using carapace width as the <b>reference</b> <b>dimension.</b> Log-transformed regressions were used to test for allometric growth and lines were compared using t-tests. No significant difference was found in the growth of the propodus between left and right chelipeds, and for males and females. Relative growth of the propodus was positively allometric which remained constant throughout crab growth. No discontinuity in growth of the propodus was evident for male and female crabs (however for male crabs over 110 mm carapace width there was a slight indication of increased propodus growth). Both left and right chela of male and female crabs had a large diastema, and mean mechanical advantage of 0. 367 and 0. 375 respectively. The high mechanical advantage of the chela in C. novaezelandiae appeared to remain constant throughout crab growth, allowing a compressive force in excess of 496 kN. m⁻². The polyfunctional chela are therefore, capable of holding, manipulating and crushing a variety of prey shapes. Predator-prey experiments were undertaken in the laboratory using male crabs of three size classes (55. 0 - 65. 0, 80. 0 - 90. 0 and 105. 0 - 115. 0 mm carapace width). Prey used included blue mussel Mvtilus edulis aoteanus, cockle Chione stutchburyi, spotted whelk Cominella maculosa and catseye Turbo smaragdus. C. novaezelandiae adopted five distinct techniques to open bivalve and three techniques to open gastropod shells. The particular opening technique used was influenced by crab size, prey size and success of previous attempts. Small molluscs were usually opened by direct crushing by the chela and/or mouthparts. Splitting of the umbone valves and removal of the aperture lip were the most successful techniques used to open large bivalves and gastropods respectively. Handling times increased exponentially with prey size, with large crabs requiring less time to open prey than small crabs. Prey species influenced handling times with bivalves opened more quickly than gastropods. Critical maximum prey size increased with crab size, while minimum critical size was smaller for small crabs. Different sized crabs consumed similar numbers of prey, but energy intake increased with crab size. Profitability curves were derived and tested with regard to optimal prey size and species. When presented with a size range, crabs selected prey sizes that minimized time spent foraging. However when presented with different prey species, crabs maximized energy intake by selecting optimum prey species. Findings suggested C. novaezelandiae exhibited a flexible foraging behaviour, which allows crabs to maximize feeding efficiency. This was discussed in the context of the ecology of the crab and the Energy Maximization Premise (Elner and Hughes, 1978) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point a multidimensional analysis {{of interviews with}} both native speakers of English and upper-intermediate to advanced EFL learners (Pérez-Paredes and Sánchez-Tornel, 2015 a). The native data were taken from The Louvain Corpus of Native English Conversations (LOCNEC) and the British component of the Contrastive Analysis of Orality in Spoken English Corpus (CAOS-E Corpus 2, Aguado et al. 2012); the learner data {{were taken from the}} Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage (LINDSEI, Gilquin et al. 2010). The interviews used in the analysis all follow the same set pattern and are made up of three main tasks: a personal narrative based on a set topic (an experience that taught them a lesson, a country that impressed them, or a film or play they liked/disliked), a free discussion mainly about university life, hobbies, foreign travel or plans for the future and a picture description. In Pérez-Paredes and Sánchez-Tornel (2015 a; 2015 b) both the native and the learner data were tagged for part of speech at the University of Northern Arizona (using a modified CLAWS tagset) and scores (Biber 1988) were subsequently computed for each interview and for each task for the following five dimensions of linguistic variation identified in Biber (1988) : Dimension 1 : involved versus information production, Dimension 2 : narrative versus non-narrative concerns, Dimension 3 : explicit versus situation-dependent <b>reference,</b> <b>Dimension</b> 4 : overt expression of persuasion, Dimension 5 : abstract versus non-abstract information. The multidimensional analysis revealed that the learners tend to score higher on the dimensions under scrutiny than the native speakers performing the same tasks. The analysis also shed light on variations in dimension scores between the various learner populations investigated and between the three interview parts. This research methodology has been used by Hardy and Römer (2013) to show variation in successful student writing in different disciplines represented in the MICUSP corpus (Römer & O'Donnell 2011). This paper is intended as a follow-up to Pérez-Paredes and Sánchez-Tornel (2015 a) as it seeks to explore why the learners in the LINDSEI corpus scored higher than the native speakers in the same communicative situation, in particular, on Dimension 1. Our main research question is what makes the learner interviews more involved, interactional and affective than the native interviews? Pérez-Paredes and Sánchez-Tornel (2015 a) found that the LINDSEI-ES informants understood the picture description as someway oriented towards expressing their opinions. Our study concentrates on two learner populations: the French and Spanish LINDSEI data sets. Both positive and negative features associated with Dimension 1 (Biber 1988, Conrad 2001) are scrutinized in the POS tagged learner and the native data. Positive features include, for example, reduced lexical content markers like demonstrative and indefinite pronouns and affective aspect of personal involvement markers like private verbs and possibility modals. Negative features include nouns, prepositions, attributive adjectives and the type/token ratio. Our analysis reveals a rather complex picture. It is not because one variety scores higher than another on Dimension 1 that all the positive features typically associated with this dimension systematically occur with higher frequencies in this variety. There is also considerable variation within each corpus. Having said this, on the whole, the learners under study tend to use a series of positive features more frequently than the native speakers. These include, among others, first and second person pronouns, indefinite pronouns, clausal coordination, causative adverbials and wh-questions. The learners can also be seen to use positive features such as contractions and hedges less frequently than the native speakers, which may point to performance as well as pragmatic concerns not so present in non-native communication (Aguado et al. 2012). The paper aims to paint an 'involvement profile' of the learner and the native speaker interviewees and considers the possible impact of some of the interview(er) variables (e. g. status of the interviewer). Our qualitative study also sets out to investigate differences between the two learner varieties (e. g. what makes the interviews with the Spanish learners even more involved than the French learner interviews?) and between the three tasks in the interviews (e. g. is the picture description less involved than the personal narrative and free discussion?). The paper concludes by evaluating the use of multidimensional analysis when exploring interviews with native speakers and EFL learners. References Aguado, P. Pérez-Paredes, P. & Sánchez, P. 2012.
