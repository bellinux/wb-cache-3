5000|$|Camaro Challenge: The Mega-Challenge: For what Andrew {{claims to}} be the show's most {{demanding}} Mega-Challenge yet, the drivers will each begin with a combined Eye of the Needle and Slalom, which ends in an Icy Corner that they have to safely negotiate. The drivers then have to navigate a forward section of wheel rims, then turn the car around in a space enclosed by concrete barriers, before ending the challenge with a reverse-flick. Sly goes first and hits nearly every arch and foam person in the initial section, then fails the Icy Corner. He then hits a lot of wheel rims in the forward section, dents and scrapes the Camaro in the concrete turning space, and knocks over even more wheel rims in the reversing section. After getting wedged on some rims, he gets out to remove them, but accidentally leaves the Camaro in reverse, resulting in it taking off without him and not stopping until it gets wedged on more rims. Finally, Sly attempts the reverse flick far too late and understeers, ensuring a total failure in every aspect of the challenge. Kevin gets off to a great start, and performs both the Eye of the Needle/Slalom combo and the Icy Corner flawlessly, causing Andrew to congratulate him just before he begins the wheel <b>rim</b> <b>section.</b> His congratulations prove premature however, as Kevin starts knocking down the rims, and his mounting stress causes the run to rapidly fall apart, with Kevin again heavily scraping the car while turning it around, knocking down even more wheel rims in reverse, and then getting the reverse flick spectacularly wrong and destroying the left-hand side of the turning area. Michael has the final run, and gets the initial straight right without hitting any arches or foam people, but then fails the Icy Corner. Like Kevin, his mounting stress then causes him to start knocking down the wheel rims; he at least turns the Camaro around without hitting anything, but continues to knock down rims in the reverse section, and then fails the reverse flick when he turns the steering wheel the wrong way, leaving Michael visibly angry with himself.|$|E

50|$|Mustang Challenge: The Mega-Challenge: This year's Mega-Challenge {{is a full}} {{kilometre}} in length, and as in most {{previous years}} consists of elements from many of this year's challenges. It begins with the drivers {{having to go through}} five Eye of the Needle arches, then having to swerve and avoid a foam pedestrian, before having to drive forwards and then backwards through a lengthy course of wheel rims. The drivers then have to do a reverse flick, and then end the run with a handbrake J-turn. Flora gets the first run, and hits every single arch in the Eye of the Needle section before mowing down the foam pedestrian. She then has a bad run through the wheel rim track in both directions, takes her reverse flick much too early and crashes through the outer wall of that part of the course, and then fails to turn at all in the final J-turn, crashing through both the foam Flora that serves as an obstacle, and the outer wall. Diane goes next, and drives far too quickly to begin with, hitting most of the arches on the opening run, though she at least avoids the foam pedestrian. After a comparatively decent run through the wheel rim segment, she then takes her reverse spin-out, but execute it a little too late and clips the far wall. On the final J-turn segment, Diane clips the foam Diane, skids and then goes even further off the course than Flora did. Diane is tearful after this run and proclaims herself Canada's Worst Driver; Andrew admits that he thought she'd do better, but still considers her far from the worst. Kevin also drives far too fast on the first straight; he somehow avoids hitting the first three arches, but completely smashes the last two. This is followed by an abysmal run through the wheel <b>rim</b> <b>section,</b> in which he manages to wedge himself on the rims during the reverse part, requiring Andrew to step in and free the car. On the reverse spin-out, Kevin takes too long to start turning the wheel and doesn't turn it far enough when he does, crashing off-course. When doing the final J-turn, Kevin completely forgets how to do the manoeuvre and hits the footbrake instead of applying the handbrake, losing control and going off the course yet again. Kevin's run is judged to be the worst by Andrew, as he hit more obstacles than Diane and Flora combined.|$|E

40|$|Studying dynamic {{behavior}} of planetary gear {{that has an}} interal gear whose rim is thin (for example Stoeckicht type planetary gear), {{we have to consider}} the deformation of the internal gear. Present report describes the results of an investigation about the influence of the internal teeth on its rim stiffness. Two kinds of experiments were done using twenty-eight steel internal gears (standard spur gear, operating pressure angle 20 °) which had different number of teeth, module, rim thickness and radius of center line of rim. On the one hand we took the effect that the teeth increased the stiffness of its rim from measuring the natural frequency of the internal gear in its own plane, on the other we took it from the relationship between the magnitude of the force and deflection when static force was applied to the radial direction of the internal gear. So the internal gears were replaced by rings of equivalent stiffness. Therefore the stiffness of the <b>rim</b> <b>section</b> in the internal gear including the teeth was described as the equivalent ring thickness with stiffness. This thickness was expressed by one experimental equation as the function of number of teeth and ratio of radius of center line of rim to rim thickness...|$|E
40|$|The Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at}} Ceres in March 2015. There, the on-board Framing Camera (FC) collects image data with {{a resolution of}} up to 35 m/pixel, which reveal a large variety of impact crater morphologies including polygonal craters. Polygonal craters show straight <b>rim</b> <b>sections</b> aligned to form an angular shape. They are com- monly associated with fractures in the target material, which may be preserved as linear structures on Ceres [3, 4]. On Ceres, we find polygonal craters with a size ranging between 5 km and 280 km in diameter. However, the ma- jority of polygonal craters have diameters ranging between 10 km and 50 km diameter. A preferential hexagonal shape is observed and some polygonal craters exhibit central peaks or relaxed crater floors. On average there are eight to ten polygonal craters per 100, 000 km 2, however the northern latitudes have a slightly higher and the southern latitudes a slightly lower polygonal crater density. This may hint at an older and younger age of the northern (> 60 °N) and southern regions (> 60 °S) compared to the mid latitudes, respectively. Alter- natively, the relaxation of craters may be advanced in the mid latitudes which are generally warmer than the poles and thus support the relaxation of depressions. Also, the southern region harbors relatively large craters which may have altered or destroyed preexisting structures in the crust which are necessary {{for the formation of}} polygonal craters. Most polygonal craters have six or seven straight rim sections; however, there is a tendency for fewer edges with decreasing crater size. Although this observation may be biased due to the map resolution, {{it is also possible that}} the impactor creating a relatively small polygonal crater embeds less energy and thus forms the straight <b>rim</b> <b>sections</b> during the excavation stage. This may result in fewer straight <b>rim</b> <b>sections</b> compared to more energetic impactors which form their polygonal shape during the modification stage. Straight <b>rim</b> <b>sections</b> and edges of polygonal craters often align with linear features associated with Ceres’ tec- tonics. Small and medium-sized polygonal crater rims tend to align with the general direction of linear features, whereas very large polygonal crater edges tend to be intersected by the linear features. This may hint at the differ- ent formation processes of polygonal craters depending on the embedded energy. In contrast, polygonal craters are also present in areas with no obvious tectonic features. These polygonal craters may be produced by subresolution or subsurface fractures.

40|$|The {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component for all land transport vehicles and the following research report investigates the feasibility of a passenger car wheel manufactured from carbon fibre. Previous research, evaluated a strain gauged BlackStone Tek motorcycle Ducati rim loaded to 700 Nm on a dynamic cornering test machine. In the current study, these experimental results were used to validate an FEA model of the BlackStone Tek Ducati rim. The validated FEA was used to investigate the feasibility of using carbon fibre to manufacture a passenger car rim. The FEA model did not include the aluminium hub, and the analysis was therefore considered valid for the spokes and rim only. The FEA strains of the Ducati rim spokes were within an acceptable 25 % correlation range with the experimental results. The FEA strains were generally higher than the experimental results. Having validated the FEA model, a carbon fibre passenger car rim, was analysed at a bending moment of 2000 Nm. The inverse of the factor of safety from the spoke to the <b>rim</b> <b>section</b> was below 1. This indicates that the newly designed rim should pass the dynamic cornering test, a vital standard proving that the rim is structurally durable to function on a small to medium sized passenger car. In comparison to aluminium rims of the equivalent size, a weight saving of 62. 2 % can be expected from a carbon fibre passenger car rim...|$|E

40|$|Rapidly {{increasing}} {{fuel prices}} and global pressures {{to reduce the}} harmful effects of vehicle emissions are forcing vehicle manufacturers to look at alternative materials to reduce the mass of the vehicles they produce. This has led to an increase in the research and development of magnesium alloys for use in automotive applications, and the methods used to produce them. With a density two-thirds that of aluminium alloys, and one quarter that of steel, magnesium alloys are continually being investigated as possible replacements for the production of automotive castings such as wheels and engine blocks. However, there is presently a lack of understanding of the effects of common alloy additions that refine the as-cast microstructure on the castability of the casting alloys in question. The most popular magnesium alloys for large automotive castings are based on the magnesium-aluminium alloy system. For the work presented in this thesis, two of the most common Mg-Al alloys, AZ 91 E and AM 60 B, were chosen to determine the effect of grain refinement on the castability of Mg-Al alloys. An experimental mould has been designed and developed to emulate the geometry, filling, and solidification of an alloy wheel casting. Two different grain refiners were investigated at varying addition levels to determine the effect of different levels of grain refinement on the castability of the two alloys. Castability, defined as the ability to produce sound castings from a particular alloy, has been assessed through visual examination of external casting defects, X-ray radiography of internal defects, as well as grain size and porosity level analysis of all samples produced. It has been found that for both AZ 91 E and AM 60 B, an increase in the level of grain refinement achieved lead to an increase in the occurrence and severity of the surface slumping defect in the castings produced. Conversely, increased levels of grain refinement were found to reduce or totally eliminate the occurrence of the hot tearing defect in both alloys. Contrary to popular belief, grain refinement was found to increase the level of internal shrinkage porosity in the Mg-Al castings. This was especially the case in the poorly fed regions of the casting, such as the junction between the spoke and <b>rim</b> <b>sections.</b> This is due to the increased reliance on interdendritic feeding of liquid to compensate for shrinkage during the latter stages of solidification in such areas, where solidification does not proceed directionally towards the feeding reservoirs. An increase in the level of grain refinement means the interdendritic network becomes heavily constricted, resulting in a rapid increase in the feeding pressure required to feed metal to the areas where it is required. This study has also resulted {{in the development of a}} novel method of successfully and consistently introducing carbon to a Mg-Al alloy melt. This has in the past been identified as a major issue to overcome when adding carbon based grain refiners to Mg-Al alloy melts...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{turbine engine}} {{configurations}} using higher temperature combustor and airfoil concepts require compressor and turbine disks that can withstand temperatures {{higher than the}} 650 C typical of current engines. This requires disk alloy and processing improvements. A versatile disk alloy was needed that could be given either fine grain heat treatments for high strength and fatigue and creep resistance up to 704 C or given coarse grain heat treatments for high strength and creep and dwell crack-growth resistance at higher temperatures. This alloy could produce disks with uniform microstructures and properties, {{as well as with}} varied, optimized microstructures at disk bore and <b>rim</b> <b>sections.</b> A series of experimental disk alloys were designed and processed to give subscale disks about 13 cm in diameter and 4 cm thick. These alloys had varying levels of key elements to affect mechanical properties and change the "solvus" solution heat-treatment temperature necessary to produce coarse grain microstructures. Disks were given coarse grain heat treatments followed by rapid oil quenching and slower fan air quenching. These heat treatments were intended to simulate the cooling paths of rapidly cooled full-scale disks at the outermost rim and interior bore locations, respectively. Preliminary quench tests of tensile specimens and coin-size minidisks had indicated that alloys having high solvus temperatures were more prone to cracking during rapid quenching from coarse grain heat treatments. These findings were confirmed in the subscale disks, where such alloys did form undesirable quench cracks. Mechanical tests were performed on specimens from subscale disks given these coarse grain heat treatments, as well as on specimens given a fine grain heat treatment. Tensile, creep, and crack growth tests were performed at 704 C and higher temperatures. A versatile alloy was identified that had a low solvus temperature for resistance to quench cracking as well as an optimal combination of high levels of strengthening refractory elements that produced balanced high mechanical properties for both fine grain and coarse grain microstructures. This low-solvus, high-refractory (LSHR) alloy has been scaled-up to produce prototype full-scale turbine disks typical of regional jet turbofan engines. Disks were successfully heat treated to give uniform coarse grain and uniform fine grain microstructures. Additional disks were given a NASA dual microstructure heat treatment (DMHT) that intentionally varied the solution heat-treatment temperatures between the disk rim and bore (re f. 1). The disk rim was heated to a high enough temperature to produce a coarse grain microstructure, while the bore was maintained at a lower temperature to produce a fine grain microstructure (see the figure). This DMHT can produce optimal high strength, fatigue, and creep resistance up to 704 C in the cooler running disk bore, and high strength, creep resistance, and dwell crack growth resistance at higher temperatures for the hotter disk rim. Extensive mechanical testing is being initiated to compare the mechanical properties of the uniform and DMHT disks...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{necessary}} fiction is explored below {{in a number of}} interrelated segments. The first section considers the nature of America's self-appointed 'global leadership' role in the post-cold war system, concentrating on the declinist versus global dominance arguments. The second section attempts to consider the Euro-defense debate in the context of overall transatlantic relations. The third section considers {{the question of whether the}} U. S. is reorienting its interests away from Europe towards the Pacific <b>Rim.</b> This <b>section</b> concludes by arguing that although Asia presents attractive markets for the U. S., strong economic and cultural links to Europe remain that on balance ensure a central position for Europe and U. S. foreign affairs. The next section considers the issue of whether fractious trade relations between the U. S. and the EU pose a challenge to the formation or enhancement of security ties between the two. It is suggested that the New Transatlantic Agenda may provide a useful vehicle for adjunct to the security dialogue by addressing trade and non-security related concerns. The fifth section examines the background and content of the two grand compromises (NATO's 1990 London Declaration and the January 1994 Brussels summit) that have shaped post-cold war European security. The most significant practical outcome of these compromises is the CJTF concept which, it is argued, has effectively consolidated U. S. leadership in both the NATO context but also, in a de facto manner in the exercise of 'Euro' options. As an interesting, but illustrative aside, the supply and dissemination of intelligence is considered as a significant example of this consolidation. The conclusion argues that the necessary fiction has established a workable modus vivendi where the main interests of the main actors are served and which may also constitute a stable platform for the development of other aspects of transatlantic relations...|$|R
