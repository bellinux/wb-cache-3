5000|$|Certain {{correctness}} guarantees {{are embedded}} in the USL grammar. In contrast to reactive approaches to program verification, testing for errors late into the life cycle, USL's development-before-the-fact philosophy is preventive, not allowing errors in the first place. A USL definition models both its application (for example, an avionics or banking system) and properties of control into its own life cycle. Providing a mathematical framework within which objects, their interactions, and their relationships can be captured, USL - a metalanguage - has [...] "metamechanisms" [...] for defining systems. USL's philosophy is that all objects are recursively reusable and reliable; <b>reliable</b> <b>systems</b> are {{defined in terms of}} reliable systems; only <b>reliable</b> <b>systems</b> are used as building blocks; and only <b>reliable</b> <b>systems</b> are used as mechanisms to integrate these building blocks to form a new system. Designers can then use the new system, along with more primitive ones, to define (and build) more comprehensive <b>reliable</b> <b>systems.</b> If a <b>system</b> is <b>reliable,</b> all the objects in all its levels and layers are reliable.|$|R

25|$|During {{the reign}} of Lê Thánh Tông, who was an emperor famous for his {{interest}} in learning and knowledge, the scholar and historian Ngô Sĩ Liên {{was appointed to the}} Bureau of History in 1473. Under the order of Thánh Tông, he based on the works of Lê Văn Hưu and Phan Phu Tiên to write the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư which was compiled in 15 volumes (quyển) and finished in 1479. In compiling the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Ngô Sĩ Liên also drew elements from other books such as Việt điện u linh tập (Compilation of the potent spirits in the Realm of Việt) or Lĩnh Nam chích quái (Extraordinary stories of Lĩnh Nam) which were collections of folk legend and myth but still considered by Ngô Sĩ Liên good sources for history because of their <b>reliable</b> <b>system</b> of citation. This was the first time such sources were used in historiography by a Vietnamese historian. Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư was finally completed in 1479 with the accounts that stopped by the coronation of Lê Thái Tổ in 1428. According to Lê Quý Đôn, Ngô Sĩ Liên also compiled an historical text about the reigns of Thái Tổ, Thái Tông and Nhân Tông named Tam triều bản ký (Records of the Three Reigns).|$|E

The electromagnetically operated friction clutch tended to burn out at normal operating voltages, the direct current components often caused arcing and the mechanical components wore out more quickly than anticipated.

2500|$|The first {{regular train}} left St. Petersburg on 30 October 1837 and in 35 minutes arrived to Tsarskoye Selo. This train of 8 {{carriages}} was pulled by a steam locomotive and its arrival was observed by numerous noble guests, including Nicholas I. Regular exploitation started in January 1838. Between January and April 1838, most trains were pulled by horses, and steam locomotives were used only on Sundays and public holidays. From April, horse power was eliminated, and almost 14,000 passengers had been served between 4 and 30 April. The trains ran without stops between St. Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo, and from May 1838 were reaching Pavlovsk. All communication was first done by voice and whistle. An optical telegraph {{was installed in}} 1838. It consisted of piles separated by [...] and a guard on duty in a shed nearby. Signals were set by raising 1, 2 or 3 black disks (daytime) or red lamps (night) on the pile and took about 30 minutes to transmit along the line. Electrical telegraph was installed in 1845, but dismantled in 1848 due to frequent failures; a more <b>reliable</b> <b>system</b> {{was set up in}} 1856.|$|E
2500|$|... 1982: The {{system was}} widely used by Argentine forces during the Falklands War. The Skyguard radar system was {{employed}} by the 601 Antiaircraft Artillery Group and the Super Fledermaus by the 1st Group of the Argentinian Air Force. The Skyguard succeeded in shooting down a Sea Harrier (XZ450) on 4 May 1982 at Goose Green. This resulted in a shift of tactics, so that British aircraft largely operated outside the weapons system's range. An RAF Harrier (XZ988) was shot down by these cannons again over Goose Green on 27 May. The system was also employed in direct fire mode against British paratroopers during the Battle of Goose Green, killing two and wounding 11 and stopping the advance of two companies. The guns were involved in two deadly friendly fire incidents during the campaign. The first took place on 1 May 1982, when a GADA 601 battery fired three burst of 35mm rounds at an Argentine Mirage III attempting to make an emergency landing at Stanley, after the aircraft had been already targeted by Argentine Marine Hispano-Suiza HS-831 30mm guns deployed along the town. The aircraft fell in flames north of the airport, killing the pilot. The other friendly shootdown occurred at Goose-Green, when one A4 Skyhawk flew by mistake over a banned zone, and was shot down {{with the loss of}} the pilot. The Argentine Air Force conceded that this time the incident was triggered by the pilot's navigation error. The Skyguard radars were targeted by the RAF during Operation Black Buck on May 31 and June 3. One Skyguard radar was destroyed by shrapnel from a Shrike missile strike and four operators died as a result. Another Harrier (XW919) was presumably hit by 35mm splinters over Sapper Hill on June 12 and sustained heavy damage. The aircraft was later declared out of service. There was a further direct-fire mission conducted against British troops on Wireless Ridge, just hours before the Argentinian surrender. After being disabled by their operators the guns were captured by British forces. Fifteen guns and five Skyguard units were captured. Four of the Skyguard sets were in good enough condition to be refurbished by BMARC in Britain with the fifth being damaged by its operators prior to capture so severely that refurbishment was not economically viable. Twelve guns and four Skyguard radars were put into British service operated by a reserve wing of the RAF Regiment 1339 wing Royal Auxiliary Air Force, comprising 2729 Squadron and 2890 Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment), based at RAF Waddington with an additional two new Skyguard units being procured from the Manufacturer. The RAuxAF Regiment used these guns and radar for about 10 years but defence cuts, coupled with the rising cost of ammunition and replacement gun barrels, forced the withdrawal from service of the very popular and <b>reliable</b> <b>system.</b> [...] One of the guns is on display at the RAF Regiment Heritage Centre at RAF Honington, and the Skyguard radar system is still in use by the RAF to monitor military low flying in the UK.|$|E
