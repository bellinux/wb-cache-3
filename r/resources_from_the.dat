5|$|After the UFA entered electoral {{politics}} {{and won the}} 1921 election, new premier Herbert Greenfield asked Brownlee to serve as his attorney-general. Brownlee agreed and {{was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a by-election in the riding of Ponoka. As attorney-general, he was an important member of Greenfield's government. He was closely involved in its most important activities, including efforts to better the lot of farmers living in Alberta's drought-ridden south, divest itself of money-losing railways, and win jurisdiction over natural <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> federal government. When a group of UFA backbenchers grew frustrated with Greenfield's weak leadership, they asked Brownlee to replace him. Brownlee eventually agreed, and became premier in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to pull British <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{observed}} build-up in the Somme, the XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps and the 117th Infantry Division attacked an arc of high ground positions, defended by the Canadian Corps. The German forces initially captured the heights at Mount Sorrel and Tor Top before entrenching on the far slope of the ridge. Following a number attacks and counterattacks, two divisions of the Canadian Corps, supported by the 20th Light Division and Second Army siege and howitzer battery groups, recaptured {{the majority of their}} former positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} France, men {{and resources}} were being marshalled {{in preparation for}} the large British-French Somme Offensive. The build-up in the Somme did not go unnoticed by the German Supreme Army Command. The German Second Army, which was holding the sector north of the Somme, had observed preparations for an offensive since the end of February 1916. Short of resources due to operations at Verdun, the Germans could only mount local operations in an effort to divert British <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Somme.|$|E

From Detroit, the British recruited and supplied Indian war parties to attack American forts and settlements, hoping to divert American military <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> primary theater {{of war in the}} East as well as keeping the Indians—and the lucrative fur trade—firmly attached to the British Empire. Indians of the Ohio Country, primarily the Shawnee, Mingo, Delaware, and Wyandot, hoped to drive American settlers out of Kentucky and reclaim their hunting grounds, which they had lost in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) and Lord Dunmore's War (1774).|$|E

The operation did not receive any <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations.

5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish.

Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{rapid transit}} system {{was seen as}} the quickest, cleanest and {{cheapest}} way of urban transport, and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> automobile industry to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming, the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide, with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985. The country's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J.

There was also competition for staff and <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948.

5|$|The attacks {{captured}} the German-held high ground along the Passchendaele–Westrozebeke ridge but {{the campaign was}} forced to end just short of Westrozebeke. The victory of the Austro-German forces against the Italian Army at the Battle of Caporetto and the forthcoming Battle of Cambrai forced the British into a parallel diversion of <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ypres Salient. The II Corps asked for a delay until 19 November, to move artillery forward, five divisions were transferred to Italy and four divisions on the coast were sent to take over French positions south of the Somme. On 20 November, Haig ended the battle, except for local attacks to gain better defensive positions.|$|E
5|$|The colony faced {{numerous}} difficulties {{during its}} brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions.

During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only {{with help from the}} French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.

5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Under the Armoury System, a character's {{equipped}} weapon {{determines the}} character class and players may change their class at will by changing weapons. Classes {{are divided into}} four disciplines: Disciples of War, masters of physical combat; Disciples of Magic, practitioners of the magical arts; Disciples of the Hand, crafters and handymen who synthesize and repair items; and Disciples of the Land, gatherers who collect <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> environment. Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes. The Job System builds upon the Armoury System for Disciples of War and Magic. In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes, players gain access to powerful skills, magic, weapons, and armor exclusive to the job corresponding to that class. These jobs, based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs, are more suited to party-based combat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the Royal Navy. A few weeks later the U–boat threat {{expected}} so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive {{was part of a}} wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. George Borrow was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Crisp was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major <b>resources</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> regular fleet, {{in the same manner as}} Q-ships deployed in the commercial sea lanes.|$|E
