40|$|Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is {{an active}} {{compound}} isolated from a Chinese herbal prescription that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine {{for the treatment of}} inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. We have previously reported that TMP acts as a potent antioxidant protecting endothelial cells against high glucose-induced damages. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the antioxidant effect of TMP remains to be elucidated. In this study, we show that TMP increases nitric oxide production in endothelial cells and promotes endothelium-dependent relaxation in rate aortic rings. The antioxidant effect of TMP appears attributable to its ability to activate the mitochondrial biogenesis, as reflected in an up-regulation of complex III and amelioration of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, TMP is able to <b>reverse</b> <b>high</b> glucose-induced suppression of SIRT 1 and the biogenesis-related factors, including PGC- 1 a, NRF 1 and TFAM, suggesting a new molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of TMP on the endothelium...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} whether tender coconut water (TCW) mitigates oxidative stress in fructose fed hypertensive rats. MethodsMale Sprague Dawley rats were fed with fructose rich diet and treated with TCW (4 mL/ 100 g of body weight) for 3 subsequent weeks. Systolic {{blood pressure was}} measured every three days using the indirect tail cuff method. At {{the end of the}} experimental period, plasma glucose and insulin, serum triglycerides and free fatty acids, lipid peroxidation markers (MDA, hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed in all the groups. ResultsTreatment with TCW significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure and reduced serum triglycerides and free fatty acids. Plasma glucose and insulin levels and lipid peroxidation markers such as MDA, hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes were significantly reduced in fructose fed rats treated with TCW. Activities of antioxidant enzymes are up regulated significantly in TCW treated rats. Histopathological analysis of liver showed that TCW treatment reduced the lipid accumulation and inflammatory infiltration without any significant hepatocellular damage. ConclusionsThe overall results suggest that, TCW treatment could prevent and <b>reverse</b> <b>high</b> blood pressure induced by high fructose diet probably by inhibition of lipid peroxidation, upregulation of antioxidant status and improved insulin sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The Illinois Long-term Selection Experiment is {{the longest}} running {{continuous}} genetics experiment in higher plants in the world. Seven hundred and twenty-one cycles of divergent selection for grain protein and oil concentration have produced populations with the known phenotypic extremes for this trait, and also illustrate the nature of responses to phenotypic selection. This report provides updates to the experiment, including {{the introduction of new}} chemical analytical procedures, assessment of methods for estimating genetic gain, and the recent initiation of reverse selection experiments from cycle 103 of Illinois High Protein (IHP). Prior genetic mapping studies suggest that the response to selection in this experiment is dependent upon the cumulative action of many genes with small phenotypic effects. An alternative theory explored here is that the response depends on quantitative expression variation of a few major regulators. Analysis of crosses between IHP and Illinois <b>Reverse</b> <b>High</b> Protein (IRHP) provides evidence that the response to selection in IRHP is due to one or a few loci with main effects, which is associated with biased frequencies for variant alleles of the ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 3 gene. Long-term divergent selection for grain protein concentration in the Illinois Protein Strains has dramatically altered the accumulation of the 19 -kD and 22 -kD α-zeins. Known regulators of α-zein protein accumulation are Opaque 2 (O 2), the Prolamin-box Binding Factor (PBF), and factors influencing the folding of zeins into endosperm protein bodies. RNA analysis and measuring protein abundance are two effective approaches for studying the regulation of zein expression, but they are also expensive, destructive and laborious. Furthermore, study of individual zein genes is complicated by their high copy number and sequence similarity. An alternative inexpensive and nondestructive approach to investigate the regulation of zein expression is the use of transgenic Floury 2 -mRFP reporter lines (Dave Jackson’s lab at Cold Spring Harbor), where the expression of the readily visible monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) is controlled by the genomic sequences encoding the Floury 2 -zein. The FL 2 -mRFP transgene has been introgressed into inbred lines derived from the four Illinois Protein Strains (IPS), as well as the reference inbred B 73. We found that FL 2 -mRFP expression not only correlates with grain protein concentration, but also follows known patterns of zein accumulation throughout development. At all developmental stages, RFP expression was strongest in Illinois High Protein (IHP), the lowest in Illinois Low Protein (ILP) and intermediate in Illinois <b>Reverse</b> <b>High</b> Protein (IRHP), Illinois Reverse Low Protein (IRLP), and B 73. By crossing FL 2 -mRFP to an o 2 mutant introgressed into IHP, we show that its expression is strongly activated by O 2, illustrating that the FL 2 -mRFP transgene is regulated {{in the same manner as}} endogenous -zein genes. Future experiments will use the FL 2 -mRFP transgene as a tool for identifying regulators influencing protein concentration in ongoing genetic mapping studies...|$|E

In the present study, an {{optimised}} <b>reverse</b> <b>High</b> Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) validated method was established for quantification of sennosides A and B, the major constituents of C. obovata with a simple and accurate method. Methods: HPLC analysis was done using Waters 515 pump on a Nova-Pak C 18 (3. 9 × 150 mm). Millennium software {{was used for the}} determination of the sennoside A and B in Cassia species and processing the information. The method was validated according to USP 32 requirements. Results: The solvent impact on the selectivity factor and partition coefficient parameters evaluated. Using a conventional RP- 18 L 1 column, 3. 9 × 150 mm, the mobile phase was selected after several trials with different mixtures of water and acetonitrile. Sennosides A and B were determined using the external standard calibration method. Using USP 35 -NF 30, the LOD and LOQ were calculated. The reliability of the HPLC-method for analysis of sennoside A + B was validated through its linearity, reproducibility, repeatability, and recovery. Fina 1 ly ethanol:water (1 : 1) extracts of Cassia obovata and Cassia angustifolia were standardized by assay of sennoside A and B through above HPLC validated method. Conclusion: Through the above method, determination of sennosides in Cassia species are completely possible. Moreover, through comparing the results, even though sennosides are rich in Cassia angustifolia but, the results shows that C. obovata could be considered as an alternative source for sennosides A and B. </p...|$|E

After discussing the most common scale invariants used in emulsification processes, we prepare emulsions at two different scales following a complete factorial experimental design. Using the empirical models obtained with the statistical analysis of the results, we determine the scale invariants for the system. Results from a previous study indicated that the scale invariant for the preparation of HIPRE could be the stirring rate. However, the results obtained in this work show that the scale invariant, based on droplet size, could change depending on the conditions of emulsification. Only when the stirring rate is high enough (> 1500 rpm), or when the surfactant-to-oil ratio is high and the total addition time low, the scale invariant is indeed the stirring rate. The elevated shear stress inside the mixer when the stirring rate is high is responsible of the small droplet size obtained on both scales. However, for other values of the process variables, the scale-invariant can be expressed as N¿D^a, where 0 < a < 0. 5, and depends on other two factors: the addition flow rate of dispersed phase or addition time, and the surfactant-to-oil ratio. We propose a methodology to determine these scale invariants and to calculate the threshold values of surfactant-to-oil ratio and addition flow rate from which the stirring rate is the scale invariant (when a → 0) ...|$|E
40|$|Aaron Sorkin {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most literate writer in TV". His undeniable style, whose overwhelming influence is more relevant today than ever in the way series are written is specially shown in his characters, the vehicle for his long sentences and never-ending monologues, owners of his funny, witty, high culture and popular references. Taking as a motto the idea that being smart is better than being stupid, and either they are fictional or taken from the real world, they are far away from average people. Is not only that every other character scripted by Sorkin talks like a Harvard graduated; in his personal pursuit for excellence, he has always reserved a place of importance for roles that have been traditionally a target of mockery in fiction: the geeks and the nerds. In Sorkin ideal reality, nobody is left out of normality because they're too clever.

40|$|Chloroplast and cytoplasmic ribosomes {{have been}} {{isolated}} {{from a number}} of species of the angiosperm genus Nicotiana. Ribosomal subunit and monosome proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE). Resultant two-dimensional electrophoretic patterns of chloroplast and cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins were processed by a computer algorithm, developed to formally compare different electrophoretic patterns by the construction of two-dimensional, conformal average electrophoretic mobility maps. The chloroplast ribosomal subunit of N. tabacum contains 22 - 24 distinct basic polypeptides (pI > 5) and 2 - 3 acidic proteins (pI < 5). The 50 S chloroplast ribosomal subunit possesses at least 1 acidic and 33 - 35 basic proteins. 40 S and 60 S cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits of the same species have 26 - 30 and 47 - 50 basic polypeptides, respectively. Molecular weights of chloroplast ribosomal proteins (ChRP) and cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (CyRP) were estimated. There was little similarity between the 2 D electrophoretic patterns of ChRP and CyRP of N. tabacum. However, 2 D-PAGE patterns of N. tabacum ChRP and CyRP were qualitatively isomorphous with homologous patterns of Chlamydomonas reinhardi, pea and spinach. In terms of molecular weight and electrophoretic pattern N. tabacum ChRP were found to be more closely affiliated with prokaryotic ribosomal proteins than with CyRP from the same species. ChRP were isolated from N. gossei (an Australian species) and its reciprocol interspecies hybrids with N. tabacum (denoted by: T x G and G x T). Interspecies polymorphisms between homologous N. tabacum and N. gossei ChRP were delineated by computerized mobility mapping and co-electrophoresis of radiolabeled N. tabacum ChRP with a large molar excess of N. gossei ChRP. The inheritance mode (Mendelian vs. maternal) of a number of well-defined interspecies ChRP polymorphisms was determined by co-electrophoresis of radioiodinated N. tabacum ChRP with T x G and G x T hybrid ChRP. Results indicate that at least 4 30 S ChRP and 3 50 S ChRP are encoded by nuclear genes. 30 S ChRP from an N. tabacum line carrying a maternally-inherited streptomycin-resistance mutation (SR- 1) were compared to N. tabacum 30 S ChRP by mobility mapping. Two differences were established between the SR- 1 and wild-type 30 S ChRP average mobility maps. These findings correlate with the reduced affinity of SR- 1 30 S chloroplast ribosomal subunits for (' 3) H-dihydrostreptomycin, and show that at least one 30 S ChRP is encoded by chloroplast DNA.
