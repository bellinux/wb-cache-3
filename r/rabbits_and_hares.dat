5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums.

The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E

25|$|Stoats were {{introduced}} into New Zealand {{during the late}} 19th century to control <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares,</b> but are now {{a major threat to}} native bird populations. The introduction of stoats was opposed by scientists in New Zealand and Britain, including the New Zealand ornithologist Walter Buller. The warnings were ignored and stoats began to be introduced from Britain in the 1880s, resulting in a noticeable decline in bird populations within six years. Stoats are a serious threat to ground- and hole-nesting birds, since the latter have very few means of escaping predation. The highest rates of stoat predation occur after seasonal gluts in southern beechmast (beechnuts), which encourage the reproduction of rodents on which stoats also feed, encouraging stoats to increase their own numbers. For instance, the endangered takahe's wild population dropped by a third between 2006 and 2007, after a stoat plague triggered by the 2005–06 mast wiped out more than half the takahe in untrapped areas.|$|E
25|$|The diet is {{generally}} more diverse {{than any other}} co-existing owl but often focuses predominantly on a particular range of prey species, with two to four species often making {{up the majority of}} the diet. Studies conducted over the course of years has shown that the regional diet often changes dramatically from year to year. This is partially driven by the cyclical population trends of much of their prey as well as by habitat changes, which are often due to human activities. The primary prey species varies by region but is comprised mainly by small mammals such as voles, rats, mice, <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares.</b> In Europe, the five main prey species are, in order of extent of reporting and numeric abundance in dietary studies: the brown rat (Rattus norvegius), which has now occupied edge habitats (although generally associated with man) in almost every part of Europe excluding the colder north; the common vole (Microtus arvalis), often the most abundant native, small mammal in wild portions of Europe; the European hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), which occupies wooded edges across western Europe alongside the eagle-owls; the European water vole (Arvicola amphibius), a unique, large vole occupying the wetland edges often hunted by eagle-owls; and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which has a very close relationship with the eagle-owls found throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the massifs of France. As the distribution of the Eurasian eagle-owls moves west (and south), the primarily prey species gradually change but often continues to be dominated in number by small rodents and in biomass by slightly larger mammals such as hedgehogs and hares and rabbits.|$|E
25|$|The final major hunting {{method is}} the “walk and grab attack”, {{in which the}} eagle walks {{on the ground and}} {{attempts}} to pull its prey out of cover. This has been used for pulling jackrabbits out of brush but has even been utilized to grab the young of large prey (i.e. deer, sheep and badgers) literally right out from under their mother's legs.Handbook of North American birds. Volume 5'. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. pp. 180-231. Tandem hunting may be done regularly, especially with larger prey items. Reportedly, while hunting in pairs, the male golden eagle flies in front of the female at a higher elevation and usually initiates the attack. Breeding pairs have been recorded hunting jackrabbits cooperatively with one individual following the other at different elevations above the ground. The initial pursuer diverts the prey's attention by stooping while the second flies in unseen to make the kill. A study in Idaho showed that the success rate was lower during tandem hunting (9%) than during solo hunting (29%), but this may have been due to the more difficult nature of the prey targeted during tandem hunts. As a whole birds are reportedly more difficult prey to capture than mammals, so hunting success rates may be lower where birds outrank mammals in importance as prey. Golden eagles are not above scavenging for carrion. In fact, it makes up a significant portion (sometimes a majority) of the diet in winter, when ground squirrels are in hibernation and <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares</b> tend to be at population lows. In the Greater Yellowstone area, the golden eagle {{was one of the most}} frequent scavengers to attend wolf kill-sites in winter but, unlike common ravens (Corvus corax) and bald eagles, were not frequent at kills left out by human hunters. In many parts of the range (i.e. Alberta, Scotland, Spain, etc.) carrion was readily fed to the young during the breeding season.|$|E

500|$|The bobcat is able {{to survive}} for long periods without food, but eats heavily when prey is abundant. During lean periods, it often preys on larger animals, which it can kill and return to feed later. The bobcat hunts by {{stalking}} its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce. Its preference is for mammals weighing about [...] Its main prey varies by region. In the eastern United States, it is the eastern cottontail species, and in the north it is the snowshoe hare. When these prey species exist together, as in New England, they are the primary food sources of the bobcat. In the far south, the <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares</b> are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source. Birds up {{to the size of}} a swan are also taken, along with their fledglings and eggs. The bobcat is an opportunistic predator that, unlike the more specialized Canada lynx, readily varies its prey selection. Diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat's principal prey; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet.|$|E

500|$|The bobcat hunts {{animals of}} {{different}} sizes, and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly. With small animals, such as rodents (including squirrels), birds, fish including small sharks, and insects, it hunts in areas {{known to be}} abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand, and wait for victims to wander close. It then pounces, grabbing its prey with its sharp, retractable claws. For slightly larger animals, such as geese, <b>rabbits,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares,</b> it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within [...] before rushing in to attack. Less commonly, it feeds on larger animals, such as young ungulates, and other carnivores, such as fishers (primarily female), foxes, minks, skunks, small dogs, and domesticated cats. Bobcats are considered the major predatory threat to the endangered whooping crane. Bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry. While larger species, such as cattle and horses, are not known to be attacked, bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants, such as sheep and goats. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004, comprising 4.9% of all sheep predator deaths. However, some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified, as bobcats {{have been known to}} scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals.|$|E

2500|$|The family Leporidae (<b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares)</b> {{is easily}} the most {{significant}} prey group, comprising about 32% of prey known to be taken by golden eagles. Twelve out of sixteen dietary studies in North America showed leporids as the most common prey group, in some areas comprising over 75% of prey remains. In the northern Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains areas, the main prey species are the white-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii) and the mountain cottontail (Sylvilagus nuttallii). In the Southwest, the Great Basin, and most of California, the main prey species are the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) and the desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), the former being especially important, comprising {{about a quarter of}} North America prey items in a 1976 study. In two studies in southern Idaho, the black-tailed jackrabbit and the two cottontails dominated the diet, comprising over 70% of nest remains. [...] More locally other jackrabbits and cottontails may be taken in smaller numbers. The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) is thought to be the dominant prey species in the boreal forests of Canada but there have been no dietary studies conducted there. The snowshoe and the larger Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) {{are some of the most}} significant prey species in Alaska, though in one central Alaskan nest they were secondary to ptarmigan and nests in Denali National Park included only 0.4% leporid remains. Nests in Alberta and Washington had almost no leporid remains as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{estimated}} {{typical range}} of weights of hares hunted by golden eagles is , whereas rabbits hunted weigh {{a little under}} [...] on average. Except for the occasional Arctic hare, white-tailed or antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), most leporids hunted in North America weigh [...] or less, including the smallest hare in the world, the [...] snowshoe hare, and the smallest rabbit in the world, the [...] pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). In Europe, where the large brown and mountain hares, both sometimes weighing over , are habitually hunted, the prey may be dismembered before being brought to the nest. Across the golden eagle's range, hares and rabbits are generally known to be hunted via either “high soar with glide attack” or “contour flight with short glide attack”. Leporids are basically solitary animals but they can occur at high densities, such as when jackrabbits are at their peak numbers in brushy areas of Western North America or (historically at least) rabbits in similar brush habitats on the Iberian Peninsula. The goal of the golden eagle while hunting hares and rabbits is to catch the prey when it is foraging out in the open. If the leporid becomes aware of the eagle's descent upon them {{more than a few}} seconds before the strike, they invariably break into a fast, hopping run. Once contact is made, <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares</b> will often kick or try to bite the eagle but escape is unlikely once they are pinned to the ground. In some case they are able to reach vegetative coverage and, if the said cover is sufficiently deep and dense, the eagle cannot pursue them any further. Although rare, golden eagles have been known to use the “walk and grab attack” to pull a leporid out of its cover. Many hunts in Scotland of mountain hare involve a somewhat lengthy tail chase. If the golden eagle is able to intercept a rabbit or hare far out in the open, a twisting and turning tail chase frequently occurs but the odds of survival for the prey are smaller the farther they are from coverage. On occasion, breeding pairs have been observed hunting jackrabbits together, where one will stoop on a gathering of them while the other waits out of sight and assaults one of the jackrabbits being made to run.|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{of southwestern}} Europe, the next closest {{association}} between lagomorphs and this species {{is in the}} arid steppe of southern Russia, hares are apparently the primary prey of the local eagle-owls. Little has been published in recent ornithological review, but old {{studies have indicated that}} the eagle-owls in this region are so dependent on hares, primarily again the mountain hare species, that cyclical reductions in numbers of the hares are followed immediately by a reduction of the local eagle-owls. A similar phenomenon has been noted in the great horned owl in its association with the snowshoe hare in the American boreal forest. The same prey, the mountain hare, was the most important along the Pechora River in Russia, making up 34.1% of prey numbers, although the general habitat is distinctly different from the steppe, as it consists of mountainous sub-taiga dense forests. Together with sizeable numbers of Eurasian red squirrels and large forest grouse which are the next most significant prey types by number, the mean prey size along the Pechora is presumably extremely large. Although in surrounding arid lowlands the food is almost totally dominated by gerbils, jirds and their kin, in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the cape hare (Lepus capensis) was the leading prey species, making up 44% of the prey numbers. In Mongolia, tolai hare (Lepus tolai), of similar size to the cape and Granada hare, were the most significant contributor of prey biomass, making up 30.6% of biomass but only contributed 4% of the prey by number Other than the prior mentioned species, at least five other species of hare have been found as occasional contributors to the eagle-owl’s diet. The only other family in the lagomorph order, the pikas, have been found to factor regularly into the diet of Eurasian eagle-owls as well, mainly in the mountainous regions of Asia. Pikas are much smaller than <b>rabbits</b> <b>and</b> <b>hares,</b> averaging [...] amongst the know prey species. One study in Mongolia found that Daurian pikas (Ochotona dauurica) made up 73% by number of the remains. In the Tibetan Plateau, the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) and gansu pika (Ochotona cansus) were the second and third most numerous prey species.
