40|$|Several {{problems}} <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> {{are discussed}} in the article: a concept <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> in the doctrine of law, preventing it in the judicial practice in capitalist countries and new tendencies in a developement <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> laws. The study is of a comparative character, i. e. laws of the largest capitalist countries and at the same time, principal legal systems are analyzed i. e. French, English and West German regulations, with due regard paid to the systems of the United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden as well as of Poland (on account of the pre-war act of 1926 on preventing <b>unfair</b> <b>competition).</b> A phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> was closely related to economic developpement of the age of early capitalism and fluorishing free competition, its concept in the European doctrine of law had its roots in the protection of exclusive rights falling within the scope of industrial property. In some legal systems the notion <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> was extended {{on the grounds of the}} adopted "right to goodwill" (fr. achalandage), "right to competition" or principle of "fair commercial practices". Preventing <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> in a judicial practice is based either on general principles of liability in torts (England, France) or on special laws designed to prevent <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> (Federal Republic <b>of</b> Germany). Judicial decisions are of significant importance in forming principles <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> prevention, In the United States the concept <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> which is understood to be a tortious act is regulated by anti-trust law; it involves not only actions which are contrary to fair business practices but also activities which can cause restraints of competition. In business practice, signs <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> are not only prejudicing interests of competitors or disturbing the principle of a full play of market forces, but they also prejudice consummers' interests. This aspect <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> is more often noticed in a doctrine of law and in legislational and judicial activities. Interpretation <b>of</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>competition</b> itself developes into widening its scope to include questions of consummer protection. At the same time the tendencies are observed to control market activities in administrational and legal way in order to protect consummers' interests.

Direct regulation is devided into antitrust law, that prevents elimination, restriction or another violation of economic competition, and into competition law, that prohibits the competitors from using unfair practices in the battle for customer.
