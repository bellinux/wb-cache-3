25|$|Since around 2000 BC, stone {{hand tools}} and weapons {{improved}} extraordinarily in both quantity and variety. Pottery <b>reached</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of technique and decoration style. The Vietnamese people were mainly agriculturists, growing the wet rice Oryza, {{which became the}} main staple of their diet. During the later stage {{of the first half}} of the 2nd millennium BC, the first appearance of bronze tools took place despite these tools still being rare. By about 1000 BC, bronze replaced stone for about 40 percent of edged tools and weapons, rising to about 60 percent. Here, there were not only bronze weapons, axes, and personal ornaments, but also sickles and other agriculture tools. Toward the closure of the Bronze Age, bronze accounts for more than 90 percent of tools and weapons, and there are exceptionally extravagant graves – the burial places of powerful chieftains – containing some hundreds of ritual and personal bronze artifacts such as musical instruments, bucket-shaped ladles, and ornament daggers. After 1000 BC, the ancient Vietnamese people became skilled agriculturalists as they grew rice and kept buffaloes and pigs. They were also skilled fishermen and bold sailors, whose long dug-out canoes traversed the eastern sea.|$|E
500|$|The Nice {{evolved from}} Gary Farr and the T-Bones, which keyboardist Keith Emerson and bassist Keith [...] "Lee" [...] Jackson were both members of before the band {{dissolved}} in early 1967. Emerson then briefly {{played with the}} VIPs, who toured the Star-Club in Hamburg, and his playing style became influenced by the organist Don Shinn, including standing up to play the instrument and rocking it on stage. Meanwhile, P. P. Arnold, a performer who <b>reached</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of popularity in the UK than her native U.S., was unhappy with her backing band, The Blue Jays, and wanted a replacement. Her driver suggested Emerson {{would be able to}} put together such a group. Emerson agreed, but only on the condition the band could perform on their own as a warm-up act. Since it effectively meant getting two bands for the price of one, manager Andrew Loog Oldham readily agreed. Emerson recruited Jackson, drummer Ian Hague and ex-the Attack guitarist David O'List, the latter by recommendation from journalist Chris Welch. The name came from Arnold saying, [...] "Here comes the Naz", which the group misheard as [...] "the Nice".|$|E

60|$|They started, and Whitney did {{his best}} as he heard the growl of the surf grow louder. It would be remarkably {{unpleasant}} to find themselves {{cut off from the}} dinghy, and there were several gutters to be crossed, with the tide steadily running up. Andrew seemed to realize this, for he went on a quick trot, the water pumping into his sea-boots. It was easier to make progress with the gale behind them, and Whitney felt relieved when they passed the wreck at some distance. Andrew was heading straight across the sands, though Whitney could not tell what he was steering by. After a time, they came to a stretch of water that widened as they splashed through, but when they had floundered across the soft sand at its edge and <b>reached</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> they were comparatively safe. Breathing hard, they made their way across firmer ground, and Whitney was conscious of keen satisfaction when he saw the dinghy lying a few yards from the glistening water.|$|E

5000|$|Lefkaritika is the characteric type of {{embroidery}} art in Cyprus. It {{falls under}} the category of white embroidery art of Cyprus. It is the evolution of an older type, called [...] "asproploumia". The main stitches of [...] "asproploumia" [...] survived in the newest type of Lefkaritika. New stitches and motifs are added depending on the skill and creativity of the embroideress. Lefkaritika soon <b>reached</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of quality, because of the competition between women, since they were considered to be a center piece of a dowry. Each girl had to have an extended collection ready for exhibition on her wedding day. This way a lot of the traditional elements were past from mother to daughter. Many women practiced embroidery as a profession as well. Women embroideresses in Lefkara, called [...] "ploumarisses" [...] organised their production from home. Men from Lefkara, called [...] "kentitarides", were merchants and they traveled across Europe and Scandinavia. According to tradition, in 15th century Leonardo Da Vinci visited Cyprus and took a Lefkara Lace back to Italy with him, which today decorates Duomo Cathedral in Milan.|$|E
50|$|By {{the age of}} 10, {{individuals}} can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During {{the end of this}} period the individual reaches maturity influencing their cognitive potential, affecting their communication.

Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development which influences the way they communicate. The individual has <b>reached</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of education which has increased their vocabulary and grammar. However, adolescents tend to use colloquial speech (slang) which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. Also, an individual’s interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescences tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage.|$|E
