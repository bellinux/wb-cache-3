5|$|A {{partisan}} Frankfort newspaper implicated Greenup in the Burr conspiracy, but he successfully defended {{himself and}} preserved his reputation. He deployed the Kentucky militia along the Ohio River {{to defend the}} state from any threat that might <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Burr conspiracy, but that threat had largely dissipated by 1807.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 11 {{companies}} were ever granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the model, {{a maximum of}} 3 at any given time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, {{if for no other}} reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history. Audible differences could <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mounting screws, grille fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|E
5|$|Increase in {{capacity}} on the BMT Brighton Line, BMT Sea Beach Line, BMT West End Line, and the BMT Fourth Avenue Line by 8 tph {{in total}} {{by adding a}} connection from the BMT Culver Line to the IND Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue. The additional capacity would <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that trains operating via the former BMT Culver Line would not run through DeKalb Avenue Junction.|$|E
5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through a {{rotating}} speaker cabinet known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its inventor Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating horn over a stationary treble compression driver, and a rotating baffle beneath a stationary bass woofer. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources.|$|E
30|$|As {{a general}} conclusion, Fig.  6 shows that both filters {{successfully}} reduce <b>the</b> errors <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{estimation of the}} target location, but errors <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> localization algorithms are not significantly filtered.|$|R
30|$|<b>Results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{survey and}} the {{interviews}} were interpreted separately first and triangulated at a later stage to see if <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two sources supported {{each other in the}} discussion section.|$|R
30|$|Bone {{insufficiency}} fractures <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bone necrosis {{secondary to}} percutaneous ablation or radiotherapy or <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bone resorption {{as a result}} of tumor metabolism or certain treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, long-term steroid treatment) (Fig.  1).|$|R
5|$|Of the six sites, Cley and Titchwell {{have the}} highest {{proportion}} of pre-planned visits, and Cley, together with neighbouring Blakeney, had the highest per capita spend per visitor. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley area are estimated to <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> £2.45million spent by the visiting public.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium iodides <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oxides and {{aluminium}} iodide or {{ammonium iodide}} heated to 600°C. Protactinium(III) iodide {{was obtained by}} heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is Na3PaF8 where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F− ions which form a nearly perfect cube.|$|E
5|$|September 11, 1960 — Hurricane Donna makes {{landfall}} on Long Island as a Category2 hurricane. Sustained {{winds of}} 100mph (160km/h) on eastern Long Island and 70mph (110km/h) winds on western Long Island are reported, and tides are 6feet (2m) above normal along {{most of the}} coast. Strong waves also cause beach erosion and several homes along the shore to be destroyed. Due to well-executed warnings, damages are extremely low, and it is reported that no deaths <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm.|$|E
50|$|Drivers' Championship {{points were}} awarded on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis {{to the top}} six {{finishers}} in each round.The best seven <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first eight races and <b>the</b> best seven <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> remaining eight races were retained.|$|R
5000|$|Points {{were awarded}} on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis {{to the first}} six {{finishers}} at each round, but only the best placed car for each make was eligible to score points. In 1964 and 1965 only <b>the</b> best six <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> season were retained, and only the best five results for 1966. In 1967 <b>the</b> best five <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first six rounds and <b>the</b> best four <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last five rounds were retained.|$|R

5|$|She was {{supported}} during her career by her friendship with actor Bruce Willis and her positive connections with her sisters. She {{reflects on the}} nature of her marriages and looks back on her prior self-indulgent lifestyle. She explains to the reader how personal achievement may <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> allure of success, and simultaneously cautions against harmful byproducts of behavioral insecurity inherent in the mystique of celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Single cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{cross between}} two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant {{and the other}} recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
3000|$|<b>The</b> {{constant}} <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last A-operation {{is known}} as output fundamental (OF), whereas <b>the</b> constants <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> previous A-operations are non-output fundamentals (NOFs). In a DAG {{that does not have}} the minimum number of A-operations, <b>the</b> constants <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> extra A-operations are referred as non-essential fundamentals (NEFs).|$|R
30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} {{prospective study}} was to compare <b>the</b> pain levels <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> use of the classic pneumatic tourniquet to <b>the</b> pain levels <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> use of this new device in patients undergoing carpal tunnel release.|$|R

5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
