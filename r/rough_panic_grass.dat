50|$|Curvularia protuberata is an endosymbiote of <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> (Dichanthelium lanuginosum) {{that enables}} it to thrive near hot springs in soil {{temperatures}} {{of up to}} 104° F (40° C). The fungus confers this protective effect only when itself infected by the Curvularia thermal tolerance virus (CThTV). Plants unrelated to <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> also experience this protective effect when inoculated with the virus-infected fungus.|$|R
40|$|Salinity of {{soil and}} {{irrigation}} water creates major problems for forage production. This study was aimed to evaluate {{the quality and quantity}} of forage production in intercropping of kochia (Kochia scoparia L.) with blue <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> (Panicum antidotale Retz.) under irrigation with saline water (4. 9 dS. m- 1). The study was performed based on randomized complete block design with three replications during growing season 2010 - 2011 at Salinity Research Field, of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Treatments were five different levels including 100, 75, 50, 25 and 0 percentage of relative composition of the two species. Treatment of 50 % blue <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> and 50 % kochia with an average of 1408 g. m- 2 produced the highest dry matter yield followed by 25 % blue <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> + 75 % kochia and 75 % blue <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> + 25 % kochia produced 1317 and 993 g. m- 2, respectively. Due to lower growth rate of blue <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> in the first year, a large proportion of dry matter in the mixture was associated with kochia and land equivalent ratio was less than one in all intercropping treatments. In the first and the second clippings, there was no significant difference between intercropping treatments in terms of crude protein, ash, NDF and ADF...|$|R

40|$|Percent {{cover of}} seven forage species {{utilized}} by bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) was determined before thinning and 2 and 4 years after thinning a 35 -year-old loblolly pine-hardwood stand. Combinations of three loblolly pine (15, 18, and 21 m 2 /ha) and three hardwood (0, 3. 5, and 7 m 2 /ha) basal areas were replicated three times. Percent cover was determined for American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), blackberry (Rubus spp.), tick trefoil (Desmodium spp.), lespedeza (Lespedeza spp.), <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> (Panicum spp.), yellow wood sorrel (Oxalis stricta), and three-seeded mercury (Acalypha spp.). Percent cover of American beautyberry and blackberry increased with time. Tick trefoil and <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> were {{negatively related to}} time after thinning. However, lespedeza, yellow wood sorrel, and three-seeded mercury were not influenced significantly by time after thinning. Blackberry and <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> were negatively related to pine basal area, while all other plant species were not affected. Three-seeded mercury was the only species not negatively related to hardwood basal area. Canopy cover and relative light intensity in the understory demonstrated an inverse relationship...|$|R

50|$|Palaeoethnobotanists {{have found}} {{evidence}} of the cultivation of millet in the Korean Peninsula dating to the Middle Jeulmun pottery period (around 3500-2000 BC). Millet continued {{to be an important}} element in the intensive, multicropping agriculture of the Mumun pottery period (about 1500-300 BC) in Korea. Millets and their wild ancestors, such as barnyard <b>grass</b> and <b>panic</b> <b>grass,</b> were also cultivated in Japan during the Jōmon period some time after 4000 BC.|$|R
50|$|Cultivars of this grass include 'South African Robusta Blue', 'Witbank', 'Ermelo', 'Kromarrai', 'American Leafy', and 'Renner'. Cultivars may be {{selected}} for yield, palatability for livestock, and drought resistance. It is planted along waterways in Sri Lanka and mountainsides in Japan, {{and it is}} used for oversowing fields in Argentina. In the United States it is often planted alongside Korean lespedeza. It is planted as a nurse crop for sericea lespedeza, coastal <b>panic</b> <b>grass,</b> and switchgrass.|$|R

50|$|Curvularia protuberata is {{a species}} of fungus in the Pleosporaceae family. It forms a mutualistic {{relationship}} with Dichanthelium lanuginosum (<b>panic</b> <b>grass)</b> and Curvularia thermal tolerance virus that allows the grass to grow in soils that are far warmer than it normally tolerates. The mutualism allows the grass to thrive in soil that is 65°C in Yellowstone National Park. Experiments {{have shown that the}} plant can only survive when it is infected by C. protuberata and when C. protuberata is also infected with the virus. This {{is an example of a}} tritrophic interaction, as three organisms are interacting.|$|R
5000|$|Ehrharta erecta, the <b>panic</b> veldtgrass, a <b>grass</b> species {{native to}} Southern Africa and Yemen ...|$|R
50|$|This species {{grows in}} a wide variety of habitat types, {{including}} Ponderosa Pine forests, sagebrush, chaparral, pinyon-juniper woodland, and many types of grassland and prairie. It is drought-tolerant because of its deep roots, though it does become less abundant in times of drought. It is also fire-tolerant, able to resprout from its rhizome and disperse its wind-carried seeds to soil cleared of litter by fire. On plains and prairies it grows with many types of grasses, such as Scribner's <b>panic</b> <b>grass</b> (Panicum scribnerianum) and tumble grass (Schedonnardus paniculatus), and wildflowers such as heath aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides), tick-trefoil (Desmodium sessilifolium), and oldfield goldenrod (Solidago nemoralis). It is a host plant for the hemiparasitic wholeleaf Indian paintbrush (Castilleja integra).|$|R
