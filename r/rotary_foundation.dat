5|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The <b>Rotary</b> <b>Foundation.</b> These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years. In 2015, cases decreased to 98 and further decreased in 2016 to 37 wild cases and 5 circulating vaccine-derived cases.|$|E

500|$|His fellow student, {{historian}} Andrew Roberts, remembers Tomlinson as [...] "a {{bright and}} charming undergraduate, {{popular with the}} boys for his drinking and sporting prowess, and with the girls for his dark good looks." [...] His friends included Gideon Rachman, who wrote him a reference after his tutor refused to do so. Tomlinson completed flying training with Cambridge University Air Squadron and won a Half Blue for Modern Pentathlon. He graduated from the University of Cambridge with a starred First Class honours degree in aeronautical engineering in 1984, and was approached by MI6 shortly afterwards, whose offer he turned down. Following his graduation he took examinations to join the Royal Navy as a Fleet Air Arm Officer, but he failed the medical examination due to childhood asthma. Instead he applied for and was awarded a Kennedy Scholarship, which allowed him to study technology policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with full funding during 1986-7. Following this, he was awarded a prize from the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Foundation,</b> allowing him to study {{in the country of}} his choice for a year. Consequently, he enrolled in a political science course at the University of Buenos Aires, where he became a fluent Spanish speaker. He continued to pursue his aeronautical interests and qualified as a glider pilot with the Fuerza Aérea Argentina. From 1988-9 Tomlinson worked in Mayfair, London, for management consultancy company Booz Allen Hamilton.|$|E

2500|$|The first Irish clubs {{discussed}} admitting {{women as}} members in 1912, but the proposal floundered over issues of social class. Gender equity in Rotary moved beyond the theoretical question when in 1976, the Rotary Club of Duarte in Duarte, California, admitted three women as members. After the club refused {{to remove the}} women from membership, Rotary International revoked the club's charter in 1978. The Duarte club filed suit in the California courts, claiming that Rotary Clubs are business establishments subject to regulation under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, which bans discrimination based on race, gender, religion or ethnic origin. Rotary International then appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The RI attorney argued that [...] "... threatens to force us to take in everyone, like a motel". The Duarte Club {{was not alone in}} opposing RI leadership; the Seattle-International District club unanimously voted to admit women in 1986. The United States Supreme Court, on 4 May 1987, confirmed the Californian decision. Rotary International then removed the gender requirements from its requirements for club charters, and most clubs in most countries have opted to include women as members of Rotary Clubs. The first female club president to be elected was Silvia Whitlock of the Rotary Club of Duarte, California in 1987. By 2007, there was a female trustee of Rotary's charitable wing The <b>Rotary</b> <b>Foundation</b> while female district governors and club presidents were common.|$|E

2500|$|A {{public health}} effort to {{eliminate}} all cases of poliomyelitis (polio) infection around the world, begun in 1988 and led by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Foundation,</b> has {{reduced the number of}} annual diagnosed cases from the hundreds of thousands to 37 confirmed cases in 2016. Of the three strains of polio virus, the last recorded wild case caused by type 2 (WPV2) was in 1999. Type 3 (WPV3) is last known to have caused polio on 11 November 2012, with all wild-virus cases since that date being due to type 1 (WPV1). [...] Mutated vaccine strains can also result in polio, and so-called circulating vaccine-derived cases of type 1 (cVDPV1) and 2 (cVDPV2) continue to be detected. [...] If polio is the next disease to be successfully eradicated, this will represent only the third time this has ever been achieved, after smallpox and rinderpest. The goal of eradicating polio worldwide has attracted international and media attention, with a reduction of some 99% of cases {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century. The first 10 years of the 21st century saw only erratic progress in further reducing the number of cases, which led to getting rid of the last 1% being described as [...] "like trying to squeeze Jell-O to death". Since 2011 incidence rates of the disease have dramatically reduced, and with large reductions continuing through to 2017, hopes for eliminating polio have been rekindled. India is the latest country to have officially stopped endemic transmission of polio—with its last reported case in 2011. Only three countries remain where the disease is endemic—Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. The number of wild polio cases reported in 2015 was less than a third of the previous lowest year, 2012, while 2016 halved this figure to 37 cases.|$|E

30|$|The {{additional}} impact by {{the mechanical}} vibration {{in the working}} load condition was analyzed by the method loading the vibration displacement. The rotating speed of the target vibration machine is 1500  rpm, so the frequency is equivalent to 25  Hz. In Korean Design Criteria, the allowable displacement width of {{the foundation for the}} high-speed <b>rotary</b> machine <b>foundation</b> is specified as maximum 0.06  mm. Based on these criteria, in this study, the load condition of the pile subjected to the working load of 2.1 MN to the foundation was simulated. In order to estimate the dynamic load additionally generated caused by the mechanical vibration in the static equilibrium subjected to the working load, the dynamic numerical analysis that applies the vibration displacement time history of the maximum amplitude (0.06  mm) that can be generated (allowable) on the characteristic of the applicable machine foundation to the pile head, was performed. The response additional load time history at the pile head was obtained from this dynamic numerical analysis results, and the additional dynamic load applied to the pile head by the mechanical vibration, was estimated.|$|R
