30|$|A DNS-based blackhole list (DNSBL) [19] is a {{zone that}} {{contains}} resource {{records for the}} identification of hosts present in the black-list and uses the DNS protocol. The hosts undergo an IP address or domain name transformation to be encoded into DNSBL zones. There is an A record (for IPv 4 address) and TXT record which gives the reason for black-listing for each entry in the DNSBL [19]. The standard value of A <b>record</b> <b>contents</b> is 127.0. 0.2, but they may have other values too. DNSBLs can use the same TXT records for all entries or a different for each entry. A single DNSBL can have both IPv 4 and IPv 6 addresses. Domain names are less frequently used by DNSBLs than the IP addresses. The interpretation of A records and TXT {{are the same as}} the interpretation of the IPv 4 DNSBLs.|$|E
40|$|To {{read and}} {{understand}} are essential competences {{for everyone in}} our society; {{at the same time}} reading comprehension among Swedish pupils is on the decline. The Swedish school must therefore try to improve their instructions to increase the students' reading comprehension. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe how three reading comprehension strategies, if possible, could improve the reading comprehension for the students, including children with learning disabilities, when reading texts of natural science in a third-grade class. The three strategies that were introduced were: to activate prior knowledge, to structure information and to <b>record</b> <b>contents.</b> The questions of the study were: How are the three strategies introduced in the classroom? Can the children with learning disabilities see any benefits for their reading comprehension when working with the strategies? How do the children with learning disabilities experience working with the strategies? Can the teacher see any benefits when working with the strategies? Is it possible to see any differences among the students' results, before and after completed intervention? Method: The results have been collected through observations and qualitative interviews, which make this a qualitative study. The reading test is the quantitative part of the study. The results show that the three strategies, in different ways, support the reading comprehension for all pupils in the class and the children with learning disabilities. The children with learning disabilities mostly find different things in the strategies that can support their reading comprehension. To activate prior knowledge and to structure information were the strategies that the teacher and the children with learning disabilities experienced took too long. Both the teacher and the children with learning disabilities felt that the strategy to <b>record</b> <b>contents</b> was the easiest to follow through. The results from the reading test could unfortunately not say anything about the children's reading comprehension development, since it did not test reading comprehension, but decoding and speed of reading...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{the domain}} of {{computer-based}} patient records had always faced the conflicting demands of efficiency for the practicing physician and suitability of the <b>record</b> <b>contents</b> for data analysis in view of decision support, research, and quality assessment. Interface and contents pose different demands on the data model underlying the record. The challenge is to combine the most suitable model for data representation with the interface that best fits the clinical setting. ORCA (Open Record for CAre) provides a solution by making the distinction between domain dependent and domain independent data and letting domain dependence be decisive for the choice of model. Interactive definition of custom-views provides interface flexibility for domain dependent data. Views on domain independent data need not cope with the limitations of multiple table views in relational DBMSs. A standard set of single table queries can support recording of domain independent data, irrespective of the clinical setting...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is {{an investigation into}} the wealth concentration, and agricultural productivity change experienced by Hampshire County, Massachusetts for the years 1700 - 1779. A discussion of colonial New England sets a backdrop for the study into Hampshire County. Such a historical inspection displays how land ownership progressed from strict church control to individual possession. Breaking probate <b>record</b> <b>contents</b> down into fixed, working, and household capital allows for investigation of wealth composition. Land, on average, accounts for the major portion of the wealth held by an individual, followed by household capital, livestock, agricultural capital, and crops, respectively. The richest ten percent of the society is shown to own 42 percent of the wealth, while one-half of the population owns 85. 5 percent. All but approximately four ' percent of society's wealth for this period is owned by the richest 75 percent of the population. Placing total wealth in real terms demonstrates that the real wealth of the society increased somewhere between 0. 3 and 0. 54 percent per year, on average. Real wealth is computed by two different standards. The first employes a Consumer Price Index while the second uses a composite value adjuster. This second method adjusts the value of each capital grouping according to the index of items which compose that group. Through the use of regression analysis, agricultural productivity change over the eighty year period is found hot to be significantly different than zero. All economic indicators point to a general stagnation of the county's economy between 1700 and 1779. Such a conclusion is consistent with other research studies conducted on New England for this time period...|$|E

The response to the socioeconomic and environmental problems in the basin {{has been among the}} endeavors of Conservation and Development Interventions (CDIs). This study was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} CDIs on livelihoods and forest resources management at Pangani River Basin in Muheza District, Tanzania. Sustainable livelihood approach was employed to gather livelihoods data. Livelihoods attributes were collected using a number of PRA techniques, questionnaire, focus group discussion, key informant and field observation. Forest inventory was carried out in Kwamkoro forest reserves by laying out 50 sample plots systematically from the forest edge. Different forest parameters were compared to the 1998 <b>record.</b> <b>Contents</b> and structural-functional analyses were applied to analyse socioeconomic qualitative data. Statistical Package for Social Science and Macro soft excel was used to analyse the socio-economic various forest parameters data. The study found out that EUCAMP was the major CDIs in the study area. Butterfly farming, fish farming, bee keeping, energy saving stove, collecting and selling of Allanblackia stulhminii seeds, biointensive gardening, zero grazing dairy cattle, spice cultivation and ecotourism were the livelihoods strategies adopted from CDIs. Land size, household income, forest restoration and livelihood improvement were statistically significantly correlated with CDIs activities at (p< 0. 01). Further, stems per hectare obtained in 2005 were low compared to stems per hectare observed in 1998 indicating significant decrease. The basal area and wood volume decreased while species diversity indices indicate a slight increase from 3. 4 to 3. 5 between 1998 and 2007 suggesting that the forest is still facing disturbance. It was concluded that CDIs interventions have not adequately improved people’s livelihoods or reduced pressure toward forest resources utilization. This thesis is also available in prin...|$|E

The basic conventions followed at the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC), which are compatible with the maintenance and updating of and retrieval from the Nuclear Science References (NSR) file, are outlined. The NSR database originated at the Nuclear Data Project (NDP) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as part of a project for systematic evaluation of nuclear structure data. 1 Each entry in this computer file corresponds to a bibliographic reference that is uniquely identified by a Keynumber and is describable by a Topic and Keywords. It has been used since 1969 to produce bibliographic citations for evaluations published in Nuclear Data Sheets. Periodic additions to the file were published as the ''Recent References'' issues of Nuclear Data Sheets prior to 2005. In October 1980, the maintenance and updating of the NSR file became the responsibility of the NNDC at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The basic structure and contents of the NSR file remained unchanged during the transfer. In Chapter 2, the elements of the NSR file such as the valid record identifiers, <b>record</b> <b>contents,</b> and text fields are enumerated. Relevant comments regarding a new entry into the NSR file and assignment of a keynumber are also given in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, the format for keyword abstracts is given followed by specific examples; for each TOPIC, the criteria for inclusion of an article as an entry into the NSR file as well as coding procedures are described. Authors preparing Keyword abstracts either to be published in a Journal (e. g., Nucl. Phys. A) or to be sent directly to NNDC (e. g., Phys. Rev. C) should follow the illustrations in Chapter 3.

Useful information regarding permitted character sets, recommended abbreviations, etc., is given in the Appendices. The NSR database has been in existence for decades, and responsibility for its upkeep has passed through many hands. Those familiar with the contents of NSR will note that not all of the formats and conventions discussed in this manual have always been adhered to. In recent years, however, these conventions have been followed fairly consistently, and it is expected that the preparation of new entries will follow these guidelines.
