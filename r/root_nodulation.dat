Isoflavonoid determination was performed using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric and UV absorbance detection. In response to waterlogging, the concentrations of biochanin A and biochanin A- 7 -O-glucoside-malonate, biochanin A- 7 -O-glucoside, and genistein- 7 -O-glucoside in the leaves increased two- to threefold after a lag period of 3 wk because of disturbed <b>root</b> <b>nodulation.</b> The other isoflavones detected-formononetin, formononetin- 7 -O-glucoside-malonate, and formononetin- 7 -O-glucoside-did not show any significant changes related to waterlogging.

Growth (dry matter yield) and N 2 fixation were largely unaffected by pO 2 from 10 to 40 %. Decrease in fixation at pO 2 below 5 % was due to lower nodulation and nodule mass and, at pO 2 above 60 %, to a fall in specific N 2 -fixing activity of nodules. Root:shoot ratios were significantly lower at pO 2 below 2. 5 %. The effect of pO 2 on nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction), both of whole nodulated root systems and crown <b>root</b> <b>nodulation</b> zones, varied with plant age but was generally lower at supra- and subambient extremes of O 2.

Additionally, the interactive effects of multiple factors associated with climate change such as elevated temperature (eT) and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO 2) are untested. We investigated how eT and eCO 2 affected larval development of the lucerne weevil (Sitona discoideus) and colonisation by the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), on three cultivars of a common host plant, lucerne (Medicago sativa). Sitona discoideus larvae feed on root nodules housing N 2 -fixing rhizobial bacteria, allowing us to test the effects of eT and eCO 2 on three trophic levels. Moreover, we assessed the influence of these factors on plant growth. eT increased plant growth rate initially (6, 8 and 10 weeks after sowing), with cultivar ‘Sequel’ achieving the greatest height. Inoculation with aphids, however, reduced plant growth at week 14. eT severely reduced <b>root</b> <b>nodulation</b> by 43 %, whereas eCO 2 promoted nodulation by 56 %, but only at ambient temperatures. Weevil presence increased net root biomass and nodulation, by 31 and 45 %, respectively, showing an overcompensatory plant growth response.

We studied {{the role of}} CLE peptides during indeterminate nodule development and identified 25 MtCLE peptide genes in the Medicago truncatula genome, of which two genes, MtCLE 12 and MtCLE 13, had nodulation-related expression patterns that were linked to proliferation and differentiation. MtCLE 13 expression was up-regulated early in nodule development. A high-to-low expression gradient radiated from the inner toward the outer cortical cell layers in a region defining the incipient nodule. At later stages, MtCLE 12 and MtCLE 13 were expressed in differentiating nodules and in the apical part of mature, elongated nodules. Functional analysis revealed a putative role for MtCLE 12 and MtCLE 13 in autoregulation of nodulation, a mechanism that controls the number of nodules and involves systemic signals mediated by a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, SUNN, which is active in the shoot. When MtCLE 12 and MtCLE 13 were ectopically expressed in transgenic <b>roots,</b> <b>nodulation</b> was abolished {{at the level of}} the nodulation factor signal transduction, and this inhibition involved long-distance signaling.

The root-colonizing soil actinomycete S. lydicus WYEC 108 influences pea <b>root</b> <b>nodulation</b> by increasing <b>root</b> <b>nodulation</b> frequency, possibly at the level of infection by Rhizobium spp. S. lydicus also colonizes and then sporulates within the surface cell layers of the nodules.

Bacteroid accumulation of the carbon storage polymer, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate, is reduced in colonized nodules. Root nodules of peas taken from agricultural fields in the Palouse hills of northern Idaho were also found to be colonized by actinomycete hyphae.

The information on interaction of beneficial nitrogen fixing rhizobia with particular reference to arid legumes of the region is limited.

Transcripts were annotated using Gene Ontology (GO), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways analysis. Differential expression analysis revealed that a total of 3760 transcripts were differentially expressed in at least one of three stages, whereas 935, 117 and 2707 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in the early, middle and late stages of nodule development respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Pasture {{decline is}} {{considered}} to be a serious challenge to agricultural productivity of subterranean clover across southernAustralia. Root disease is a significant contributing factor to pasture decline. However, root disease assessments are generally carried out in the early part of the growing season and in areas predominantly sown to permanent pastures. For this reason, in spring 2004, a surveywas undertaken to determine the severity of root disease inmature subterranean clover plants in pastures located in thewheatbelt ofWesternAustralia. DNA-based soil assayswere used to estimate population density in the soil of a variety of soil-borne pathogens known to commonly occur in theMediterranean-type environments of southern Australia. The relationships between severity of disease on tap and lateral roots and root diameter, <b>root</b> length, <b>nodulation,</b> and total rainfallwere determined. The survey showed, for thefirst time, that severe root disease iswidespread in spring across the wheatbelt of Western Australia. There was a positive correlation between rainfall and tap root disease, and between tap root disease and average root diameter of the entire root system.

Reciprocal grafting of brush with wild-type plants indicated that this genotype only affected the root and that the shoot phenotype was a secondary effect. The <b>root</b> and <b>nodulation</b> phenotype cosegregated as a single Mendelian trait and the BRUSH gene could be mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2. At 18 °C, the brush root anatomy was rescued and similar to the wild type, and primary root length, number of infection threads, and nodule formation were partially rescued. Superficially, the brush root phenotype resembled the ethylene-related thick short root syndrome. However, treatment with ethylene inhibitor did not recover the observed phenotypes, although brush primary roots were slightly longer. The defects of brush in root architecture and infection thread development, together with intact nodule architecture and complete absence of symptoms from shoots, suggest that BRUSH affects cellular differentiation in a tissue-dependent way...|$|R
