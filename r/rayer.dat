Stephen Thomas Erlewine, a writer for Allmusic, commented that Invincible was [...] "highlighted" [...] by [...] "lovely ballads" [...] such as [...] "Break of Dawn" [...] and [...] "Butterflies". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote in his review for Invincible that, [...] "The ballads are a squishy bunch with glaringly banal lyrics, pleasantries like 'Butterflies' and 'Break of Dawn' that could emanate from just about" [...] anyone. A journalist for The Philadelphia Inquirer called the track [...] "gorgeous" [...] and Bomani Jones of Salon.com called [...] "Butterflies" [...] a [...] "sparkling" [...] track. Ben <b>Rayer</b> of the Toronto Star wrote that Jackson [...] "fares best" [...] on [...] "Butterflies".|$|E
