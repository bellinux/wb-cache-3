40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to investigate manufacturing improvements for wind turbine blades. The program included a series of test activities to evaluate the strength, deflection, performance, and loading characteristics of the prototype blades. The original contract was extended {{in order to continue}} development of several key blade technologies identified in the project. The {{objective of}} the <b>remote</b> <b>build</b> task was to demonstrate the concept of manufacturing wind turbine blades at a temporary manufacturing facility in a rural environment. TPI Composites successfully completed a remote manufacturing demonstration in which four blades were fabricated. The remote demonstration used a manufacturing approach which relied upon material ''kits'' that were organized in the factory and shipped to the site. Manufacturing blades at the wind plant site presents serious logistics difficulties and {{does not appear to be}} the best approach. A better method appears to be regional manufacturing facilities, which will eliminate most of the transportation cost, without incurring the logistical problems associated with fabrication directly onsite. With this approach the remote facilities would use commonly available industrial infrastructure such as enclosed workbays, overhead cranes, and paved staging areas. Additional fatigue testing of the M 20 root stud design was completed with good results. This design provides adhesive bond strength under fatigue loading that exceeds that of the fastener. A new thru-stud bonding concept was developed for the M 30 stud design. This approach offers several manufacturing advantages; however, the test results were inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|AAA game {{development}} studios {{often use}} continuous integration {{to monitor the}} state of development. The continuous integration processes usually run on a build farm. To prevent faulty changes from reaching the build farm the developers {{have the option to}} compile and test their work locally. Developers do not always consistently test. Faulty work can cause company-wide delays. We present a novel framework that distributes and performs these personal tasks on a remote machine. This makes it easier for developers to test their work. Only a limited amount of machines are available for the remote personal tasks. This presents a scheduling problem. We build a framework to facilitate both the distribution and scheduling of these tasks. The framework allows for comparison between different scheduling algorithms, is light-weight, scalable, and can reliably distribute tasks to <b>remote</b> <b>build</b> machines. We ask what scheduling algorithm presents the lowest average time a task spends in the scheduling queue. Three scheduling algorithms are implemented to answer this question. Random scheduling, the Highest Response Ratio Next algorithm (HRRN), and a derivative of the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time algorithm (NHEFT). We test these scheduling algorithms to determine which has the shortest average waiting time. Experiments are run using different amounts of build machines and different orders in which requests are made. A second experiment is run using five times the amount of tasks to find further data comparing random scheduling to HRRN. The first experiment shows significantly longer average waiting time for NHEFT compared to both other algorithms. No significant differences are found between HRRN and random scheduling. The second experiment shows significantly shorter average waiting time for HRRN. We conclude that HRRN results in shorter average waiting time than random scheduling. NHEFT was implemented with a bug which caused higher average waiting time. No conclusions can be made regarding NHEFT...|$|E

40|$|Haptic Collaboration Virtual Environment (HCVE) is an {{enhanced}} virtual reality space that supports sense of touch, {{which is called}} “haptic”. In HCVE, remote users connected over networks are able to collaborate by sharing touching experiences in addition to well-established audio and visual interfaces.

However, {{the fact that the}} data generation frequency of haptic interface devices is extremely high, e. g. 1 KHz, makes the realization of successful HCVE more challenging. For seamless haptic data communication even under adverse network conditions, we propose a linear prediction algorithm and a buffering scheme.

One of the many applications derived from EOS is the advancement of archaeological research and applications. Using satellites, manned and unmanned airborne platform, NASA scientists and their partners have conducted archaeological research using both active and passive sensors. The NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) located in south Mississippi, near New Orleans, {{has been a leader}} in space archaeology since the mid- 1970 s. Remote sensing is useful {{in a wide range of}} archaeological research applications from landscape classification and predictive modeling to site discovery and mapping. Remote sensing technology and image analysis are currently undergoing a profound shift in emphasis from broad classification to detection, identification and condition of specific materials, both organic and inorganic. In the last few years, remote sensing platforms have grown increasingly capable and sophisticated. Sensors currently in use, including commercial instruments, offer significantly improved spatial and spectral resolutions. Paired with new techniques of image analysis, this technology provides for the direct detection of archaeological sites. As in all archaeological research, the application of remote sensing to archaeology requires a priori development of specific research designs and objectives. Initially targeted at broad archaeological issues, NASA space archaeology has progressed toward developing practical applications for cultural resources management (CRM). These efforts culminated with the Biloxi Workshop held by NASA and the University of Mississippi in 2002. The workshop and resulting publication specifically address the requirements of cultural resource managers through the use of remote sensing. In 2007, NASA awarded six competitively chosen projects in Space Archaeology through an open solicitation whose purpose, among several, was to addresses the potential benefits to modern society that can be derived through a better understanding of how past cultures succeeded or failed to adapt to local, regional, and global change. A further objective of NASA's space archaeology is the protection and preservation of cultural heritage sites while planning for the sustainable development of cultural resources. NASA s archaeological approach through <b>remote</b> sensing <b>builds</b> on traditional methods of aerial archaeology (i. e. crop marks) and utilizes advanced technologies for collecting and analyzing archaeological data from digital imagery. NASA s archaeological research and application projects using remote sensing have been conducted throughout the world.

Both accept that {{there are any number}} of creative and expansive solutions and possibilities to identified challenges — in this case, the challenge of improving education in very remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island schools. However, the authors believe that creative thinking needs to be grounded in the reality of the local community context in order to be relevant. This article draws on emerging data from the Remote Education Systems project (a project within the Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation — CRC-REP) and highlights further questions and challenges we wish to address across the life of the project. It is part of a collection of papers presented on the theme ‘Red Dirt Thinking’. The red dirt of remote Australia is where thinking for the CRC-REP 2 ̆ 7 s Remote Education Systems research project emerged. This article will examine the various public positions that exist in regard to the aspirations of young remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and consider the wider views that are held in terms of what constitutes educational ‘success’. We explore the models of thinking and assumptions that underpin this public dialogue and contrast these ideas to the ideas that are being shared by remote Aboriginal educators and local community members through the work of the Remote Education Systems project. We will consider the implications and relevance of the aspiration and success debate for the remote Australian context and propose approaches and key questions for improved practice and innovation in relation to delivering a more ‘successful’ education for remote students. The authors begin by posing the simple question: How would, and can <b>remote</b> educators <b>build</b> aspiration and success? The wisdom of several commentators on remote education in Australia is presented in terms of a set of simple solutions to a straightforward problem. The assumptions behind these simple solutions are often unstated, and part of this article 2 ̆ 7 s role is to highlight the assumptions that common arguments for solutions are premised on. Further to the above question, we will also consider the question: In remote communities where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students live and learn, how is success defined? Is there language that corresponds to the western philosophical meanings of success? Having considered some possible alternatives, based on the early findings of the Remote Education Systems project research, the authors then pose the question: How would educators teach for these alternative measures of success? The answers to these questions are still forthcoming. However, as the research process reveals further insights in relation to these questions, it may be possible for all those involved in remote education to approach the ‘problem’ of remote education using a different lens. The lens may be smeared with red dirt, but it will enable people involved in the system to develop creative solutions in a challenging and rich environment...|$|R
