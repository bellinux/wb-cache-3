40|$|Background: At KIST Medical College, Lalitpur, Nepal, a Medical Humanities module {{for first}} year medical {{students}} has been conducted. <b>Role</b> <b>plays</b> {{are used to}} explore social, medical and sexual issues in the Nepalese context. The present study obtained student feedback about the <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> used in the module, the difficulties faced, and obtained suggestions for further improvement. Method: The module was conducted from January to August 2011 using a total of 15 <b>role</b> <b>plays.</b> Student feedback was obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire. Informal discussions were held and a questionnaire was circulated among the first year students {{who had participated in}} the module. Results: Ninety-eight of the 100 students in the module participated in the study. The overall opinion regarding the <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> was positive. Students stated <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> helped to make module objectives concrete and interesting, made students identify with the problem being investigated and improved communication skills. <b>Role</b> <b>plays</b> were designed to address important health issues in Nepal and prepare students for addressing these issues in future practice.

I have deliberately chose to analyze these games in terms of enterprise gamification, that is to say considering that a game structure (i. e. <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> games) is brought from games to be adapted to the context of work and its organization. This choice will lead us to debate in what way and how a <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> game may integrate the concept of gamification. It will also lead us to question the concept of game, considering like Mollick and Werbach (2014, 440) that “given the confluence of approaches in enterprise settings” it would be quite artificial to separate games and gamification (understood as gameful elements or game-like mechanisms). Studying several cases of <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> games for managers, my article will analyze two structural aspects attached to <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> games: the question of roles and the question of fiction.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1978. Bibliography: leaves 116 - 125. Microfiche. x, 125 leaves illThe present work {{investigated}} whether untrained {{people can}} encode and decode "happiness" and "depression" within a social context {{by developing a}} <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> method. It also examined personality variables of the encoders {{and the effects of}} encoding on their self-ratings of affect. Forty-three female students served as <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> subjects (encoders). They were divided into three groups {{on the basis of their}} scores on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Subjects were individually interviewed three times. The first interview served as its own control. The interviewer asked about the subjects' school work, family, and friends for about three minutes. The second and third interviews involved subjects' <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> under "happy" and "depressed" instructions. Subjects were told to remember a time when they felt very "depressed" or "happy" and act as if very "depressed" or "happy" while being interviewed. The order of <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> was counterbalanced. The design of the study was a 3 X 2 X 2 (Zung SDS group, <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> condition, order of <b>role</b> <b>playing)</b> factorial design with repeated measures across <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> conditions. Immediately after each interview, subjects rated themselves on the four S-point affect scales: "happy," "depressed," "pleasant," and "anxious. " Scores on these self-rating dependent measures in each <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> condition were converted to change scores from baseline to each <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> condition and they were entered into four separate analyses of variance. The results indicated that <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> subjects' self-report on three of the four dependent measures changed significantly (p <. 001) according to their role enactment under "happy" and "depressed" instructions. Subsequent tests revealed that the changes were in the predicted directions. There was no significant effect of the Zung group. These results support the hypothesis that untrained people can act "happy" and "depressed" and these enactments have a significant impact on self-reported ratings of affect. Videotape segments of subjects' baseline and their <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> under "happy" and "depressed" instructions were made and randomized in order. They were subjected to an independent validation by 9 groups of untrained observer-judges (N = 108 females). Observer-judges rated subjects' baseline and their <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> under "happy" and "depressed" instructions on 9 affect scales. For the purpose of the present work the four scales which corresponded to the self-ratings ("happy," "depressed," "anxious," and "pleasant") were examined and the scores were entered into four separate analyses of variance using the same design as that of <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> subjects. The results indicated that the ratings made by observer-judges of the subjects in the three independent conditions of baseline, "happy" and "depressed" were significantly different at p <. 001. Subsequent tests revealed that the differences were in the predicted direction. These results offered a strong validation of the subjects' <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> by observer-judges independent of the subjects' self-report and supported the hypothesis that untrained people can decode "happiness" and "depression. " Personality measures, such as the Zung Scale, Beck Inventory for Measuring Depression, Taylor MAS, and Pullman Facilitation-Inhibition Scale, were most significantly correlated to subjects' baseline but not to scores in <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> conditions. When the situation changed from baseline to <b>role</b> <b>playing</b> "happy" and "depressed," the personality measures were not consistent. The present study demonstrated that untrained people can communicate affect via overt behavior within a social context. <b>Role</b> <b>playing</b> has a significant effect upon self-ratings of affect. The results also indicated that within the population sampled there is a social consensus on what behaviors are considered as "happy" and "depressed. " It remains to be studied what specific behaviors communicate "happiness" and "depression" among people at large...|$|R
