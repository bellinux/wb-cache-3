40|$|This Article {{provides}} new {{predictions for}} selectivity in batch reactive distillation, identifying the reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio and a Damkhler number (Da) {{as the key}} operating parameters. The dimensionless Da incorporates the influence of liquid holdup, vapor rate, and rate of reaction. Example results for a system of serial isomerization reactions and for the synthesis of ethylene glycol are provided. The results show that selectivity improvements in BRD are limited for high values of Da or for high values of the reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio and that selectivity is enhanced as Da or reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio is decreased. However, decreasing Da can cause conversion loss, which can be mitigated by increasing the reflux (or <b>reboil)</b> ratio {{at the expense of}} selectivity. Consequently, there is an optimum value of reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio that gives a maximum yield for systems operated at low or moderate Da. For the isomerization in a BRD, the heat released by reaction can improve selectivity at the expense of conversion. For ethylene glycol synthesis at a low <b>reboil</b> ratio, BRD has a negative impact on both conversion and selectivity by causing separation of the reactants. We also show that decreasing the <b>reboil</b> ratio {{near the end of the}} BRD can increase the removal rate of EG and thereby improve selectivity. This operating strategy is different from a common operating strategy in distillation of increasing <b>reboil</b> ratio near the end of a batch or cut. We also find that an operation with a constant volumetric liquid flow rate provides lower selectivity than a constant molar liquid flow rate...|$|E

Reflux stills incorporate a fractionating column, commonly created by filling copper vessels with glass beads to maximize available surface area.

40|$|Batch {{reactive}} distillation (BRD), {{combines the}} flexibility of batch processing with the advantages of reactive distillation and can offer advantages over conventional batch processing for small to medium volume production. BRD is also important in process development for reactive distillation. ^ The essence of reactive distillation is the integration between reaction and distillation. There are two limiting cases for integration between reaction and distillation, (1) no integration and (2) full integration. In this thesis, we have shown that by analyzing these two limiting cases, and combining the information obtained from two limiting cases in a novel way, we can develop a partial integrated design with an appropriate amount of integration and an appropriate operation mode, which can provide advantages over both conventional design without integration and a fully integrated design. ^ We apply this approach in two realistic examples, i. e. (1) isopropyl acetate synthesis and (2) 1, 1 -dimethoxyethane production. For the isopropyl acetate synthesis, we compare the vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid features of the phase equilibrium to nbutyl acetate and amyl acetate systems, and show {{the similarities and differences}} among them. In particular, we show why the isopropyl system is more difficult than the others and how to use the known information in two limiting cases to develop a semi-batch reactive distillation (SBRD) with partial integration, which overcomes the reactive azeotrope brought by full integration and results in a more efficient process for the production of isopropyl acetate than has been previously known. In SBRD, the loss of isopropanol can be substantially decreased, the purity of water can be improved, and the total refluxing or recycling of organic distillate can be avoided. The resulting SBRD can provide 20 % higher production efficiency than BRD. ^ For the example of 1, 1 -dimethoxyethane (DMA) synthesis, following the approach, we develop a partially integrated BRD, which can take advantage of integration to overcome the reaction equilibrium limitation, meanwhile avoid a distillation boundary brought by over-integration. This leads to a high-purity product, which is unattainable in a fully integrated reactive distillation process without special and expensive treatment of the methanol/DMA azeotrope. ^ In this thesis, we also address selectivity issues in BRD, and provide new results describing the impact of key operating parameters: the reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio and the Damköhler number (Da). ^ We show that selectivity improvements in BRD are limited for high values of Da or for high values of the reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio and that selectivity is enhanced as Da or reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio is decreased. However, decreasing Da will cause conversion loss, which can be mitigated by increasing reflux ratio (or <b>reboil</b> ratio) at expense of selectivity. Consequently, there is an optimum value of reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio that gives a maximum yield for systems operated at low or moderate Da. ^ We show sample results for a system of serial isomerization reactions and for the synthesis of ethylene glycol. For the isomerization, we show that for BRD with a constant heating rate, the additional heat released by reaction can improve selectivity at expense of conversion. For ethylene glycol synthesis, we show that at a low <b>reboil</b> ratio, integration between reaction and distillation has a negative impact on both conversion and selectivity by causing separation of the reactants. We also show that decreasing the <b>reboil</b> ratio {{near the end of the}} BRD can increase the removal rate of ethylene glycol and thereby improve selectivity. This operating strategy is different from the common practice in distillation of increasing the <b>reboil</b> ratio near the end of a batch or cut. ...|$|E

40|$|The FCC process {{continues}} {{as one of}} the major refinery technologies despite changes in refinery operations. The main fractionator/vapor recovery systems associated with many FCC units have the potential for significant gains in energy efficiency and product recovery through revamping. Older FCCU designs did not take full advantage of the heat available in the main fractionator. These older designs typically reject large amounts of heat to air or water cooling while using steam to <b>reboil</b> towers in the vapor recovery unit. By selecting the proper location and rates of side pump around streams, heat available in the main column can be used to <b>reboil</b> most or all of the VRU towers. Revamps of this type may be undertaken as stand alone energy conservation projects or {{as part of a larger}} revamp aimed at improving the recovery of marketable products. This paper will give examples of an older design with relatively inefficient heat utilization and a newer design incorporating recent trends in heat recovery.

5000|$|Sometimes, {{conductivity}} {{measurements are}} linked with other methods {{to increase the}} sensitivity of detection of specific types of ions.

This is a sensitive method of monitoring anion impurities in the boiler water in the presence of excess cations (those of the alkalizing agent usually used for water treatment). The sensitivity of this method relies on the high mobility of H+ in comparison with the mobility of other cations or anions. Beyond cation conductivity, there are analytical instruments designed to measure Degas conductivity, where conductivity is measured after dissolved carbon dioxide has been removed from the sample, either through <b>reboiling</b> or dynamic degassing.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to optimize the thermal performance of a fractionation unit within a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. Typical fractionation units in an LNG facility consisting of three distillation columns, namely de-ethanizer, de-propanizer and de-butanizer were used in this study. A hierarchical approach is developed to optimizing the system. In this approach, increasing levels of model complexity are used and various thermal targets are set and implemented. The column targeting tool available within the simulation package of Aspen Plus software was used to optimize a fractionation unit in an LNG facility. First, integrated thermal analysis was used in identifying design targets for improvements in energy consumption and efficiency. The column targeting tool is used in the design of distillation columns by setting targets to reduce utility cost, improve energy efficiency, reduce capital investment and facilitate column debottlenecking. Starting from a short-cut distillation design calculation using the DSTWU method which is based on the well-known Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland correlations, the minimum and actual reflux ratios, minimum and actual number of stages, optimum feed location and condenser and reboiler duties were estimated. These estimates were used as starting points in the rigorous fractionation column design method RADFRAC available in Aspen Plus. The column Grand Composite Curve (CGCC) for each column was generated to give an insight of the actual operation and guide the optimization process. Starting with appropriate feed placement, the CGCC will show the scope for reflux ratio modification by increasing the number of stages. Feed would be either preheated or precooled due to the availability of sharp enthalpy change in the condenser or reboiler side. Finally, the scope for a side condensing or side <b>reboiling</b> can be identified from the area beneath or above the CGCC pinch point...|$|R
6000|$|Ever since {{receiving}} {{and reading}} your elegant volume of short tales--the arrival of which from you was affecting and delightful to me--I've meant {{to write to}} you, but the wish has struggled in vain with the daily distractions of a tolerably busy summer. I should blush, however, if the season were to melt away without my greeting and thanking you. I read your book with joy and found in it recalls from far far away--stray echoes and scents as from another, the American, the prehistoric existence. The thing that most took me was that entitled A Difficult Case, which I found beautiful and admirable, ever so true and ever so done. But I fear I more, almost, than anything else, lost myself in mere envy of your freedom to do, and, speaking vulgarly, to place, things of that particular and so agreeable dimension--I mean the dimension {{of most of the}} stories in the volume. It is sternly enjoined upon one here (where an agent-man does what he can for me) that everything--every hundred--above 6 or 7 thousand words is fatal to [...] "placing"; so that I do them of that length, with great care, art and time (much <b>reboiling,)</b> and then, even then, can scarcely get them worked off--published even when they've been accepted.... So that (though I don't know why I inflict on you these sordid groans--except that I haven't any one else to inflict them on--and the mere affront--of being unused so inordinately long--is almost intolerable) I don't feel incited in that direction. Fortunately, however, I am otherwise immersed. I lately finished a tolerably long novel, and I've written a third of another--with still another begun and two or three more subjects awaiting me thereafter like carriages drawn up at the door and horses champing their bits. And àpropos of the first named of these, which {{is in the hands of}} the Harpers, I have it on my conscience to let you know that the idea of the fiction in question had its earliest origin in a circumstance mentioned to me--years ago--in respect to no less a person than yourself. At Torquay, once, our young friend Jon. Sturges came down to spend some days near me, and, lately from Paris, repeated to me five words you had said to him one day on his meeting you during a call at Whistler's. I thought the words charming--you have probably quite forgotten them; and the whole incident suggestive--so far as it was an incident; and, more than this, they presently caused me to see in them the faint vague germ, the mere point of the start, of a subject. I noted them, to that end, as I note everything; and years afterwards (that is three or four) the subject sprang at me, one day, out of my notebook. I don't know if it be good; at any rate it has been treated, now, for whatever it is; and my point is that it had long before--it had in the very act of striking me as a germ--got away from you or from anything like you! had become impersonal and independent. Nevertheless your initials figure in my little note; and if you hadn't said the five words to Jonathan he wouldn't have had them (most sympathetically and interestingly) to relate, and I shouldn't have had them to work in my imagination. The moral is that you are responsible for the whole business. But I've had it, since the book was finished, much at heart to tell you so. May you carry the burden bravely!--I hope you are on some thymy promontory and that the winds of heaven blow upon you all--perhaps in that simplified scene that you wrote to me from, with so gleaming a New England evocation, last year. The summer has been wondrous again in these islands--four or five months, from April 1st, of almost merciless fine weather--a rainlessness absolute and without precedent. It has made my hermitage, as a retreat, a blessing, and I have been able, thank goodness, to work without breaks--other than those of prospective readers' hearts.--It almost broke mine, the other day, by the way, to go down into the New Forest (where he has taken a house) to see Godkin, dear old stricken friend. He gave me, in a manner, news of you--told me he had seen you lately.... I am lone here just now with my sweet niece Peggy, but my brother and his wife are presently to be with me again for fifteen days before sailing (31st) for the U.S. He is immensely better in health, but he must take in sail hand over hand at home to remain so.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{continuous}} extractive distillation of minimum- and maximum-boiling azeotropic mixtures with a light entrainer. The ternary mixtures belong to class 1. 0 - 2 and 1. 0 - 1 a diagrams, each with two subcases depending on {{the location of the}} univolatility line. The feasible product and feasible ranges of the operating parameters <b>reboil</b> ratio (S) and entrainer/feed flow rate ratio for the continuous process (FE/F) were assessed. Equations were derived for the composition profiles of the stripping, extractive, and rectifying sections in terms of S and FE/F. Class 1. 0 - 1 a processes enable the recovery of only one product because of the location of the univolatility line above a minimum value of the entrainer/feed flow rate ratio for both batch and continuous processes. Given a target purity, a minimum <b>reboil</b> ratio S also exists; its value is higher for the continuous process than for the batch process, for the continuous process where stricter feasible conditions arise because the composition profile of the rectifying section must intersect that of the extractive section. Class 1. 0 - 2 mixtures allow either A or B to be obtained as a product, depending on the feed location on the composition triangle. Then, the univolatility line location sets limiting values for either the maximum or minimum of the feed ratio FE/F...|$|E
40|$|Interest {{in batch}} {{processes}} has increased {{with the growing}} importance of specialty chemicals, characterized by high-value, low-capacity, short-term production and strongly nonideal mixtures. While separation {{is an important step}} in these processes, few publications deal with the feasibility and design aspects of batch distillation for azeotropic mixtures. ^ In this dissertation, a simple dynamic model is developed to describe composition changes in batch distillation by decoupling the variations in flows and compositions through a dimensionless warped time. The model is based on constant molar overflow and quasi-steady state assumptions in the column and on a differential model for the batch tank. Two types of batch distillation columns are presented: the batch rectifier, where products are withdrawn at the distillate, and the batch stripper, where products are withdrawn at the bottom. ^ Composition changes for azeotropic mixtures are complex because the sequence of cuts collected depends on the relative amount of each component in the feed. However, in the limiting case of large number of stages and large reflux or <b>reboil</b> ratio, a method is presented to predict the variation of the batch and product compositions as a function of time. As a result, the composition space is divided into regions leading to the same set of fractions. The method is geometrical and requires little or no computation. ^ A systematic procedure to devise a feasible sequence is proposed. This procedure includes determining suitable entrainers to break binary azeotropes. It is shown that the use of a batch stripper is essential in breaking minimum boiling binary azeotropes. The techniques developed are illustrated on the separation of methyl acetate from a quaternary azeotropic feed coming from a transesterification reactor. ^ A simple, tractable, design method is presented to estimate flows, equipment sizes, utility loads and costs for any batch column. This method provides a rapid estimate of the design targets for a variable reflux (or <b>reboil)</b> policy without the need of integrating the column model numerically. This policy, which approximates the constant distillate (or bottom) composition policy, shows significant cost savings over the constant reflux (or <b>reboil)</b> policy. ...|$|E

The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating heat medium loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The heat medium chosen is turbine fuel. It is pumped around the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used to <b>reboil</b> a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed Water. The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day. An energy conservation project at Shell's Norco (Louisiana) Manufacturing Complex involves several processing units and recovers heat that was previously lost to air or cooling water.

In this work, we incorporate multistage reactive rectification and reactive stripping models with total reflux and total <b>reboil,</b> respectively. We further define the respective vectors, which justify the need of the corresponding units in the RD network.

These feeds were subjected to thermal gravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, evolved gas analysis with volume-expansion monitoring, modified <b>reboil</b> test, quantitative X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, wet chemical analysis, and M?ssbauer spectroscopy. Glass viscosity was also measured. Finally, it was recommended to use melt-rate furnace test data to measure thermal diffusivity of the feed. Though both feed were reduced to prevent oxygen evolution from the melt, oxygen evolved form one of the melts and COx evolved from both. Hence, foam is likely to form under the cold cap even when the feed is reduced. An important difference between the feeds was in the melt viscosity at the temperature at which the melt interfaces the cold cap. It was suggested that low viscosity destabilizes foam under the cold cap, thus enhancing the rate of melting...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, {{reactive}} distillation {{has become increasingly}} attractive as a potential process alternative for simultaneously conducting liquid-phase reaction and vapor-liquid separation, {{with the potential to}} overcome chemical equilibrium limitations and to simplify flowsheets. This dissertation develops a systematic steady-state design methodology for kinetically controlled, stagewise reactive distillation columns, taking into account a single isomolar or non-isomolar liquid phase reaction, heat effects, nonideal vapor-liquid equilibrium, and a distribution of liquid holdups on the reactive stages. “Kinetically controlled” means that chemical reaction equilibrium is not obtained on every tray, although vapor-liquid equilibrium is assumed. “Stagewise” implies a column consisting of discrete trays. The method is useful for developing a spectrum of feasible designs over a range of design conditions, which provides insight into the effect of such variables as <b>reboil</b> ratio, heat of reaction and Damkohler number on the total number of stages. The method is demonstrated by developing feasible column designs for the dehydration of methanol, the metathesis of 2 -pentene, and the production of ethylene glycol. ^ The influence of azeotropes on the design of ordinary distillation columns has been widely studied for many years. Azeotropes alter product distributions and attainable regions; cause distillation boundaries to occur; and have {{led to the creation of}} extractive and azeotropic distillation technology. It can be expected that reactive azeotropes have a similar impact on reactive distillation design. However, the influence that key physical property parameters (such as the reaction equilibrium constant) exert on reactive azeotropes is relatively unknown. New tools are needed to determine when reactive systems will exhibit reactive azeotropes and how these azeotropes will influence designs. Such a tool is described in this dissertation: an arc-length continuation technique used to determine the existence and location of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactive azeotropes in an equilibrium reactive system. ^ Using the techniques and methods developed, the use of reactive distillation in nontraditional applications are explored, such as in a system possessing a small reaction equilibrium constant (Keq 2 ̆ 6 Lt; 1) or kinetically resolving enantiomers from a racemic mixture. ...|$|E
40|$|The figure shows {{components}} of a distillation column intended for use {{as part of a}} system that produces high-purity liquid oxygen (LOX) from air by distillation. (The column could be easily modified to produce high-purity liquid nitrogen.) Whereas typical industrial distillation columns for producing high-purity liquid oxygen and/or nitrogen are hundreds of feet tall, this distillation column is less than 3 ft (less than about 0. 9 m) tall. This column was developed to trickle-charge a LOX-based emergency oxygen system (EOS) for a large commercial aircraft. A description of the industrial production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen by distillation is prerequisite to a meaningful description of the present miniaturized distillation column. Typically, such industrial production takes place in a chemical processing plant in which large quantities of high-pressure air are expanded in a turboexpander to (1) recover a portion of the electrical power required to compress the air and (2) partially liquefy the air. The resulting two-phase flow of air is sent to the middle of a distillation column. The liquid phase is oxygen-rich, and its oxygen purity increases as it flows down the column. The vapor phase is nitrogen-rich and its nitrogen purity increases as it flows up the column. A heater or heat exchanger, commonly denoted a reboiler, is {{at the bottom of the}} column. The reboiler is so named because its role is to <b>reboil</b> some of the liquid oxygen collected at the bottom of the column to provide a flow of oxygen-rich vapor. As the oxygen-rich vapor flows up the column, it absorbs the nitrogen in the down-flowing liquid by mass transfer. Once the vapor leaves the lower portion of the column, it interacts with down-flowing nitrogen liquid that has been condensed in a heat exchanger, commonly denoted a condenser, at the top of the column. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen products are obtained by draining some of the purified product at the bottom and top of the column, respectively. Because distillation is a mass-transfer process, the purity of the product(s) can be increased by increasing the effectiveness of the mass-transfer process (increasing the mass-transfer coefficient) and/or by increasing the available surface area for mass transfer through increased column height. The diameter of a distillation column is fixed by pressure-drop and mass-flow requirements. The approach taken in designing the present distillation column to be short yet capable of yielding a product of acceptably high purity was to pay careful attention to design details that affect mass-transfer processes...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{continuous}} extractive distillation of minimum and maximum boiling azeotropic mixtures A-B {{with a heavy}} or a light entrainer E, intending to assess its feasibility based on thermodynamic insights. The ternary mixtures belong to the common 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 class ternary diagrams, each with two sub-cases depending on the univolatility line location. The column has three sections, rectifying, extractive and stripping. Differential equations are derived for each section composition, depending on operating parameters: distillate product purity and recovery, reflux ratio R and entrainer – feed flow rate ratio FE/F for the heavy case; bottom product purity and recovery, <b>reboil</b> ratio and entrainer – feed flow rate ratio for the light entrainer case. For the case with a heavy entrainer fed as a boiling liquid above the main feed, the feasible product and operating parameters R and FE/F ranges are assessed under infinite reflux ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res, 2009, 48 (7), 3544 – 3559). For the 1. 0 - 1 a class, there exists a minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio to recover the product, and also a minimum reflux ratio. The minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio is higher for the continuous process than for the batch because of the additional requirement in continuous mode that the stripping profile intersects with the extractive profile. For the 1. 0 - 2 class both A and B can be distillated. For one of them there exists a maximum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio. The continuous process also has a minimum entrainer - feed flow rate ratio limit for a given feasible reflux ratio. For the case with a light entrainer fed as saturated vapor below the main feed, the feasible product and operating parameters S and FE/F ranges are assessed under infinite reflux ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res, 2012, 51, 4643 – 4660), Compared to the heavy entrainer case, the main product {{is removed from the}} column bottom. Similar results are obtained for the 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 class mixtures whether the entrainer is light or heavy. With a light entrainer, the batch insight about the process feasibility holds for the stripping and extractive sections. Now, an additional constraint in continuous mode comes from the necessary intersection between the rectifying and the extractive sections. This work validates the proposed methodology for assessing the feasibility of continuous extractive distillation processes and enables to compare entrainers in terms of minimum reflux ratio and minimum entrainer feed flow rate rati...|$|E
