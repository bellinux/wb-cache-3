50|$|The {{complex is}} site to large populations of migratory birds during {{spring and fall}} migrations. Over 250,000 ducks and 177,000 geese have been {{observed}} during a single migration. It lies {{on the path of}} three waterfowl flyways, the Pacific, Central and Mississippi, making it an important moulting and staging area for numerous waterfowl species, the primary factor leading to its <b>Ramsar</b> <b>designation.</b>|$|R

It {{was incorporated into}} the Christmas Island National Park in 1989, and listed on 11 December 1990 as Ramsar site 512, one of two such sites {{on the island and}} the smallest in the world. In 2010 a proposal was made to increase the area of the Ramsar site to 202 ha. Justification for its <b>Ramsar</b> <b>designation</b> is because it: ...|$|R
50|$|Established in 1960 {{under the}} Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations of the Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1917, the {{sanctuary}} is privately {{owned by the}} Inuit of Nunavut. It received <b>Ramsar</b> Convention <b>designation</b> May 24, 1982, making it Canada's 14th Ramsar site.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} smaller islands, islets, rocks and reefs in Guernsey waters. Combined with a tidal range of 10 m and fast {{currents}} {{of up to}} 12 knots, this makes sailing in local waters dangerous. The very large tidal variation provides an environmentally rich inter-tidal zone around the islands, and some sites have received <b>Ramsar</b> Convention <b>designation.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how the Ramsar Convention, a key {{multilateral}} {{environmental agreement}} for the world's wetlands, influences the allocation {{and use of}} ecosystem goods and services. Focusing on the world's second largest uninhabited mangrove island, Pulau Kukup, this study illustrates the social and ecological risks and opportunities surrounding protected wetlands. Interviews with, and observations of, nearby communities reveal that Pulau Kukup has continued to render regulatory, cultural, provisioning and supporting ecosystem services under different governance regimes and institutional arrangements. Under the current governance regime, national conservation agencies focus largely on conservation and have struggled to implement the principles of wise use as specified by the Ramsar Convention. Nevertheless, such strict local (formal) conservation rules restricting public access have improved the ecological integrity of the mangrove island, with little {{negative impact on the}} locals. While restrictions in access may be seen as a trade-off for local communities wishing to pursue cultural activities, tourism linked to the island's <b>Ramsar</b> <b>designation</b> has boosted the local economy. Despite these benefits, changes in property rights and growing influxes of tourists visiting the protected wetland may affect the long-term ecological integrity and the balance between wetlands, communities, livelihood options, and sustainability. Such challenges demand governance that recognises and responds to these emerging issues...|$|R
50|$|Lake Warden is a {{salt lake}} in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. It and its {{associated}} wetlands are protected in a nature reserve; they were recognised as being of international importance under the <b>Ramsar</b> Convention through <b>designation</b> of the Lake Warden System on 7 June 1990 as Ramsar Site 485. The lake is also a DIWA-listed wetland.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the baseline surface water environment, assesses the potential {{impacts of the}} proposed scheme during both construction and operational phases, and outlines measures for mitigating these impacts. The assessment considers the potential impacts of the proposed scheme in terms of surface water hydrology, flood risk, coastal and fluvial geomorphology and water quality. There are several environmentally sensitive waterbodies within the study area. These include the Firth of Forth which has two SPA designations (the Firth of Forth SPA and Forth Islands SPA), along with a <b>Ramsar</b> <b>designation</b> {{and a number of}} smaller SSSI designations. St. Margaretâ€™s Marsh is designated as a SSSI due to saltmarsh wetland and reedbed habitat, which in turn provide important habitats for breeding and migratory wintering birds. The River Almond is designated as salmonid waters as is one of its tributaries within the study area, i. e. Niddry Burn. Identification of baseline conditions and the impact assessment were carried out using a range of sources including consultation, desk-based assessments, site walkover and topographic survey. Hydrodynamic modelling of Swine Burn and Niddry Burn was undertaken {{to assess the impact of}} flood risk where new and extended culverts are proposed. In addition, coastal modelling was carried out to assess potential impacts of sediment release during dredging and piling works within the Firth of Forth. Mitigation during construction will include adherence to relevant SEPA Pollution Prevention Guidelines (PPGs). With the implementation of the proposed mitigation during construction, residual impacts on all waterbodies would be reduced to Slight or Negligible significance. Mitigation for the operational phase will include Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS) for receiving waterbodies and provision of appropriate compensatory flood storage. With the inclusion of the proposed mitigation measures during operation, residual impacts on all waterbodies would be reduced to either Slight or Negligible significance. 9. ...|$|R
50|$|The Islands {{are home}} to 44 {{different}} species of plants and wildlife. This {{has led to the}} inclusion of National Park in <b>RAMSAR</b> sites its <b>designation</b> as a UNESCO MAB Biosphere Reserve. Many species of seabirds use the location as feeding and breeding grounds, these include blue-footed boobies as well as the red-billed tropicbirds. It also has many different varieties of coral, which, in turn, is home to a large variety of reef fish species. The island ecosystem is also home to dolphins, Manta Rays and a number of tropical fish. Eels and many species of sea turtles are also found in the reefs and the many caves that dot the site. During the winter months humpback whales arrive at the islands and can be observed all through winter.|$|R
40|$|Wetlands {{are a key}} {{livelihood}} {{resource in}} southern Africa. Historically they have been managed using local knowledge systems, but these systems have in many instances been undermined by colonial and postcolonial legal requirements. The IUCN's Ramsar initiative, supported by organisations such as BirdLife International and the WWF, seeks to protect wetland resources. This qualitative study examined the political ecology of the Kapukupuku and Waya areas of the Lukanga wetlands in Zambia, designated a <b>Ramsar</b> site. This <b>designation</b> {{has given rise to}} competing 'narratives' by politicians and local community leaders over how Lukanga should be managed and used, and the resulting conflict is threatening its sustainability. The paper warns that the various parties' arguments are value-laden and that power asymmetry threatens to exclude poor local communities. Policy must take power interests into account to ensure that developments {{in the name of the}} poor really do benefit the poor...|$|R
