5|$|Our World {{producers}} selected each episode's subject {{time period}} {{with the help}} of consultants from the Smithsonian Institution and Columbia University. The show was limited in its choices by the available footage for the given time period. Ellerbee <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> viewer-submitted proposal for an episode on the American Civil War, which could not be made because of the non-existence of archive footage from the 1860s and the lack of any living eyewitnesses.|$|E
5|$|Id Software's use of {{texture mapping}} in Catacomb 3-D, a {{precursor}} to Wolfenstein 3D, was influenced by Ultima Underworld. Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book Masters of Doom, author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Doug Church has said that John Carmack saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper. Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly, with both Carmack and Romero present.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{was lucky}} during the few gun fights he {{took part in}} from his {{earliest}} job as an assistant police officer in Wichita to Tombstone, where he was briefly deputy U.S. marshal. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and his saddle were shot through with bullet holes. According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened {{when he was on}} the street, alone in his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs and surprised Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.|$|E

5|$|Booth {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for New South Wales against Queensland in the 195455 Sheffield Shield. He made a duck {{in the first}} innings before adding 19 in the second. New South Wales won, but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty. Booth was <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> month later for a match against Len Hutton's English cricket team at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Arthur Morris and Bill Watson had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at Hurlstone Agricultural College. He caught a train and arrived at the ground {{more than half an}} hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with a borrowed cap and bat to join Peter Philpott. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172. Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign, and the last match in Booth's debut season.|$|E
5|$|The umpires {{reported}} Waddington to the cricket {{committee of}} the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him {{to write a letter}} of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned {{at the end of the}} season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.|$|E

In a 2007 news story, he <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> time that he sucker-punched enforcer Kevin Maguire of the Buffalo Sabres (December 23, 1987) after Maguire attacked Yzerman. Maguire then unsuccessfully attempted to avoid Probert.|$|E
25|$|The {{best that}} may be said of Hywelâ€™s {{association}} with the law is that a folk memory <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> revision and rejuvenation of the law during his reign.

25|$|During {{the first}} {{performance}} of the symphony, people {{were reported to have}} wept during the Largo movement. The music, steeped in an atmosphere of mourning, contained echoes of the panikhida, the Russian Orthodox requiem. It also <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> genre of Russian symphonic works written in memory of the dead, including pieces by Glazunov, Steinberg, Rimsky-Korsakov and Stravinsky. Typical of these works is the use of the tremolo in the strings as a reference to the hallowed ambience of the requiem.|$|E

25|$|Harris {{read the}} poems with, as he later <b>recalled,</b> <b>a</b> {{mounting}} sense of excitement. Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet {{in the same}} class as W. H. Auden or Dylan Thomas. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of Angry Penguins and commissioned a painting by Sidney Nolan, based on the poems, for the cover.|$|E
25|$|Elected local {{government}} officials may be <b>recalled.</b> <b>A</b> recall election {{may be called}} {{if there is a}} petition of at least 25% of the registered voters in that LGU. An amendment to the law where a majority of all members of a preparatory recall assembly, composed of all elected local officials within a {{local government}} unit (LGU), endorse a recall, was repealed. The recalled official is not allowed to resign when facing a recall election, but may participate in it; the candidate with the highest number of votes wins the recall election.|$|E
25|$|Hayek {{displayed}} {{an intellectual}} and academic bent {{from a very}} young age. He read fluently and frequently before going to school. At his father's suggestion, Hayek, as a teenager, read the genetic and evolutionary works of Hugo de Vries and the philosophical works of Ludwig Feuerbach. In school Hayek was much taken by one instructor's lectures on Aristotle's ethics. In his unpublished autobiographical notes, Hayek <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> division {{between him and his}} younger brothers who were only few years younger than he, but he believed that they were somehow of a different generation. He preferred to associate with adults.|$|E

Conversely, participants preferred unhealthy over healthy food options when they <b>recalled</b> <b>an</b> altruistic deed. Consistent with this choice pattern participants {{were willing to}} pay more for healthy than for unhealthy options. This experiment extends the self-licensing literature...|$|R

Millais (Ted Millais), a leading rhododendron and azalea propagation specialist. The vast collection of animal and bird skins was dispersed and sold. The local Horsham Museum retains a number of skins and sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{decided to}} develop a story with a similar {{character}} at its center, but was unsure what other elements to add. He <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who felt {{he had a good}} ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first instinct was to create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had a way with words but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.|$|E
25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> previous life.|$|E

25|$|Pattern {{completion}} is {{the ability}} to <b>recall</b> <b>an</b> entire memory from a partial or degraded sensory cue. Place cells are able to maintain a stable firing field even after significant signals are removed from a location, suggesting that they can <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> pattern from only some of the original input. Furthermore, pattern completion can be symmetric in that an entire memory can be retrieved from any part of it. For example, in an object-place association memory, spatial context can be used to <b>recall</b> <b>an</b> object and the object can be used to recall the spatial context.|$|R

25|$|In recent research, a {{group of}} {{subjects}} was faced with remembering a list of items and then measured when trying to recall said items. The evoked potentials and hemodynamic activity measured during encoding were found to exhibit reliable differences between subsequently recalled and not recalled items. This effect has been termed the subsequent memory effect (SME). This difference in these specific brain regions determines whether or not an item is <b>recalled.</b> <b>A</b> study by Fernandez et al. {{has shown that the}} differences that predict recall appear both as a negative deflection in the rhinal cortex of an event-related potential (ERP) 400ms after stimulus exposure, and as a positive hippocampal ERP beginning 800ms after stimulus onset. This means that recall only occurs if these two brain regions (rhinal cortex and hippocampus) are activated in synchrony.|$|E
25|$|The {{recollection}} of dreams is extremely unreliable, {{though it is}} a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming. Women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men. Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. The salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently <b>recalled.</b> <b>A</b> dream journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes.|$|E
25|$|On his mother's side, Hayek {{was second}} cousin to the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. His mother often played with Wittgenstein's sisters, and had known Ludwig well. As {{a result of}} their family relationship, Hayek {{became one of the first}} to read Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus when the book was {{published}} in its original German edition in 1921. Although Hayek met Wittgenstein on only a few occasions, Hayek said that Wittgenstein's philosophy and methods of analysis had a profound influence on his own life and thought. In his later years, Hayek <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> discussion of philosophy with Wittgenstein, when both were officers during World War I. After Wittgenstein's death, Hayek had intended to write a biography of Wittgenstein and worked on collecting family materials; and he later assisted biographers of Wittgenstein.|$|E
