40|$|Economic engagements {{between the}} European Union (EU) and some {{developing}} countries within the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region have been characterised by exploitative traits {{to the advantage}} of the former. This study argues that internal and external factors have severely hindered the conclusion of EPAs between ESA states and the EU. Internal issues of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPAs) such as contentious issues, lack of funding and new emerging issues {{in the form of the}} Turkey clause have created an unfavorable negotiating atmosphere. External forces manifested in the form of the global financial crisis and the economic rise of non EU member states (China, Brazil and India) have shifted the priority options of both the EU and <b>ACP</b> <b>states.</b> To <b>ACP</b> <b>states,</b> EPAs appear to tighten the neo-colonial wave of the developed EU and also cause regional disintegration among the ACP region. With the use of documentary search and in-depth interviews with key informants, this study established that EPAs have cemented dependency of <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> on the EU and have not resulted in sustainable economic development. It recommends the need for <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> to be given enough policy space in the negotiations while new issues need to be shelved until the already contentious issues have been resolved. <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> should also address internal political issues before committing to multiple economic fronts such as the EPAs...|$|R

Specific examples of the wielding of each mechanism are assessed based upon two criteria: a) the extent to which the wielding of the mechanism by the EU is a manifestation of “good governance”, and b) the extent to which the EU’s wielding of the mechanism has resulted, or is likely to result, in the sustainable development of and reduction of poverty in ACP countries. The examples are chosen to illustrate contradictions between rhetoric and practice and the consequential negative (actual and potential) impact upon development in <b>ACP</b> <b>States.</b> The final section offers suggestions for improving the EU’s governance processes and their outcomes for development...|$|R

Not only has the number of countries associated with the EEC been raised from the nineteen involved in the earlier Yaoundé Convention, but the ACP countries as a group now appear to enjoy more favourable provisions for trade and aid than those obtained under earlier agreements. Among the new <b>ACP</b> <b>States</b> is Ethiopia, a country neither connected with the EEC through previous arrangements nor having any historical links with Europe apart from a brief period of colonial rule by the Italians during 1936 – 41.

In addition to addressing the major question of local concern, i. e. whether or not Ethiopia is likely to benefit from association, a case study of this country is of more widespread interest. The lessons for Ethiopia may be applicable to other countries with similar circumstances. In addition, on the grounds of absolute poverty the Lomé Convention provides preferential treatment in some areas for certain of the least developed ACP countries, of which Ethiopia is one.

40|$|The {{economic}} benefits from international rules on government procurement flow mostly from increased specialisation and competition within national markets {{as well as}} more efficient purchasing. Cross border supply of procurement markets is limited even within the EU, which has comprehensive rules. In government procurement, as in other policy areas, economic gains from reform can be achieved through unilateral measures. Most <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> have initiated reform of government procurement based on international guidelines such as the UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Services and Works. From an ACP point of view, inclusion of government procurement in the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) may be beneficial if this helps to maintain the momentum of the existing domestic reform processes or promotes open procurement markets in the ACP regions. There are unlikely to be gains from trade for most ACP economies. Given the limited size of their national markets and capacity of their manufacturing and service sectors to supply EU procurement markets, the priority for most <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> is likely to be opening the regional ACP procurement markets before making commitments to open to the EU. For the <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> the potential costs of including provisions on procurement in the EPAs come in two forms. First, any commitments on national treatment (liberalisation) will prohibit the use preferences for national suppliers as a policy instrument. Second, there will be costs complying with framework (transparency) rules. The only EPA to include substantive provisions on procurement is the CARIFORUM – EC text. This provides for national treatment commitments, but leaves the decision on which procurement will be covered by such commitments to the Joint CARIFORUM – EC Council.

40|$|Agricultural {{research}} and genetic manipulation can produce varieties of food, fodder and industrial crops for both local consumption and marketing which are adapted to different farming and production systems. Although such research programmes are no novelty, numerous studies (such as Seed programmes for ACP countries by Van Amstel and Van Gastel, produced {{on behalf of}} CTA in 1985) {{point to the fact}} that ACP farmers still do not take advantage of the plant varieties which would have the best potential for their particular circumstances. Difficulties arise in most ACP countries because some links in the seed chain (that is, the whole process from production, through quality control, seed technology, training of seed technicians and extension, to marketing and distribution) are missing. Although many agricultural sectors are adopting the new technologies fast, the whole area of seed production and distribution is still very backward, especially in the use of improved varieties. In view of the growing consumer demand for quality agricultural products, this is something of a paradox. The explanation for this probably lies in the extreme complexity of setting up and maintaining a seed distribution system. Nevertheless, several ACP countries have been experimenting at different levels and with varying success with these complexities and have been able to set up good, or at least workable, seed distribution networks. During a CTA seminar in Cameroon in 1985 many <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> wanted further information on existing operations. CTA made a commitment to gather the relevant data.
