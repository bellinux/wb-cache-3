His international call-ups along with other internationals at Leeds resulted in games against Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers being postponed. Kisnorbo missed the games against Kettering Town, Oldham Athletic and local rivals Huddersfield Town through an injury he picked up in training. He had not recovered from injury {{to be able to}} have a part in the squad in the FA Cup replay to Kettering.

Under dark conditions, rats foraged for randomly located food pellets (Experiment 1). Blindfolded humans were instructed to search for an ostensible hidden coin using a metal detector (Experiment 2). After locating the food pellet, rats carried it back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> refuge, and after a designated searching time, humans were instructed <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> location. Although both species exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity in searching path movement organization and ability <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> location, disruption of human searching path organization was associated with impairments in <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> location. These results support the vestibular “gain ” account of movement organization during dead-reckoning-based navigation...|$|R

Miles and Kevin Seraphin sidelined, Robinson {{started and}} posted a double double with 16 points and 11 rebounds in an overtime win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He got his second {{start of the}} season on November 25 and finished with a team high and career-high 20 points and five rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets. Those two starts were regarded as the best two performances of his career up to that date. Robinson returned to the starting lineup when Monta Ellis was injured in mid-December. He posted a season-high rebounding performance in a 12-point, 12-rebound double double against the Detroit Pistons in his fourth start in his <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> lineup. During the 2017 All-Star Weekend, Robinson became the first Pacers player since Fred Jones (in 2004) to win the Slam Dunk Contest. On March 24 with less than 3 weeks left in the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for at least two weeks with a calf strain. After missing the final 11 games of the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for {{the first game of the}} 2017 NBA Playoffs on April 15 against Cleveland, but he returned to the lineup for game 2 on April 17.|$|E

25|$|Jordan {{announced}} he would return for the 2002–03 season, {{and this time he}} was determined to be equipped with reinforcements, as he traded for All-Star Jerry Stackhouse and signed budding star Larry Hughes. Jordan even accepted a sixth-man role on the bench in order for his knee to survive the rigors of an 82–game season. A combination of numerous team injuries and uninspired play led to Jordan's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> lineup, where he tried to rebound the franchise from its early-season struggles. By the end of the season, the Wizards finished with a 37–45 record once again. Jordan ended the season as the only Wizard to play in all 82 games, as he averaged 20.0 points, 6.9 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals in 37.0 minutes per game.|$|E

Arsenal were expected to line up slightly different to Manchester United, with Thierry Henry and José Antonio Reyes as the two centre-forwards in a traditional 4–4–2 formation. Vieira was expected to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> XI; {{earlier in the week}} Wenger rated his chances of playing as [...] "80 per cent" [...] after he sprained his ankle against Aston Villa.

Hennessey was called up on April 16 due to an injury to Noah Lowry. After posting a 21 record and a 3.33 ERA, {{he was sent to}} the bullpen upon Lowry's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> rotation on May 9, though Hennessey was frequently called upon to make spot starts. He got his first career save on June 5, pitching the final four innings of the Giants' 142 victory over the Florida Marlins. On August 11, Giants' manager Felipe Alou announced that Hennessey would replace the struggling Wright in the rotation. In his first start since rejoining the rotation on August 14, he threw [...] shutout innings, earning the win in a 10 victory over the San Diego Padres.

500|$|Following the 2011 NBA draft {{selection}} of Iman Shumpert, Rice {{was the leading}} returning scorer for the 201112 Yellow Jackets. He was suspended {{for the first three}} games of the 2011–12 season for an undisclosed violation of team rules. When he returned to the lineup following his suspension on November 18, he assumed the role of a sixth man. In his <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> lineup on December 3 against the , Rice not only posted his first double-double of the season with 11 points and 11 rebounds, but also had his first career 4-blocked shot effort.

Rice followed that with a double-double in his next outing on December 22 against Mercer when he posted 19 points and 11 rebounds. The ACC requires that a player play in 75% of his team's games to be qualified for statistical rankings. After his 9th game on December 22, Rice qualified despite the three game suspension, Rice ranked among the conference leaders in points, rebounds, blocks and steals per game [...] plus field goal percentage. On December 29, Rice had a scoreless night during a loss to Fordham. On January 7 against #3 Duke, he posted a career-high-tying 28 points with 8 rebounds. On January 11, against NC State, he had 22 points to mark his second career back-to-back 20-point performances.

He returned to the lineup for three games before being suspended indefinitely for non-basketball issues. The suspension was Rice's second of the season and third in his college career. Coach Brian Gregory dismissed him from the team on March 13 following an incident involving driving under the influence and discharging a firearm while under the influence in which Rice was charged with permitting unlawful operation. Following the bad publicity Bo Ryan received about blocking a transfer, Gregory stated that he would not block a transfer to any university. Following his dismissal, CBS Sports regarded him {{as one of the top}} 20 potential transfers in the country.|$|E

[...] "I've had three pretty good years in a row", he said, [...] "I feel I can do the job." [...] Womack received his wish, as he was assigned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens on May 3.

In 145 innings, he allowed 110 hits and 41 walks, striking out 73 batters. Though he did not lead the International League or his team in any categories, he finish second on the squad in victories (tied with Jack Curtis), winning percentage (.714), shutouts (three), innings pitched, walks and wild pitches (five, tied with Tom Dukes).
