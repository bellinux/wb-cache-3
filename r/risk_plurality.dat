40|$|The first {{environmental}} {{case before}} the United States Supreme Court {{after the death of}} Justice Antonin Scalia, Sturgeon v. Frost, involved the National Park Service’s authority to regulate hovercraft use over a segment of river running through lands under its authority pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The plaintiff sought to show that the State held title to navigable waters within the State, and that, therefore, the National Park Service did not have authority to enforce its regulation. The parties invoked precedent and argued for textual analysis of the at-issue statute, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit forged its own interpretation of the statute to find for the National Park Service. On review, the United States Supreme Court invalidated the Ninth Circuit’s holding as incongruous with the context of the statute. However, despite a sufficient record, the Court did not articulate the correct interpretation, suggesting a Court hesitant to <b>risk</b> <b>plurality...</b>|$|E
50|$|At the EU level, the {{legislative}} competence concerning media ownership transparency is controversial. However, the European Commission has promoted {{a number of}} initiatives to improve citizens' awareness of media pluralism, such as the Media Pluralism Monitor, a monitoring tool for assessing risks and threats for media pluralism in the EU member states {{on the basis of}} a set of legal, economic and socio-cultural indicators. According to the Media Pluralism Monitor the lack of media ownership transparency is identified as a <b>risk</b> for media <b>plurality.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Although {{upholding}} the [...] "essential holding" [...] in Roe, and recognizing {{that women have}} some constitutional liberty to terminate their pregnancies, the O'Connor–Kennedy–Souter plurality overturned the Roe trimester framework {{in favor of a}} viability analysis. The Roe trimester framework completely forbade states from regulating abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, permitted regulations designed to protect a woman's health in the second trimester, and permitted prohibitions on abortion during the third trimester (when the fetus becomes viable) under the justification of fetal protection, and so long as the life or health of the mother was not at <b>risk.</b> The <b>plurality</b> found that continuing advancements in medical technology had proven that a fetus could be considered viable at 22 or 23 weeks rather than at the 28 weeks previously understood by the Court in Roe. The plurality thus redrew the line of increasing state interest at viability because of increasing medical accuracy about when viability takes place. Likewise, the authors of the plurality opinion felt that viability was [...] "more workable" [...] than the trimester framework.|$|R
40|$|Paul Ricoeur and Jacques Derrida {{agree that}} {{translation}} is a tensive activity oscillating between the possible and the impossible {{with reference to}} the transposition of meaning among diverse systems of discourse. Both acknowledge that <b>risk,</b> alterity, and <b>plurality</b> accompany every attempt at paraphrasing language “in other words. ” Consequently, their positions adhere to the traditional adage that “the translator is a traitor,” precisely because something is always lost in the semantic transfer. Yet, Derrida notes an important disagreement between their respective approaches to translation and accuses Ricoeur of harboring a nostalgia for unitive meaning and of promoting the possibility of a transcendental signified that could produce a “pure” translation. In this essay, I critique Derrida’s interpretation of Ricoeur specifically by examining their individual interpretations of the Tower of Babel myth. I argue that Ricoeur’s theory of Babel as a non-punitive celebration of diversity and the open play of meaning “out-deconstructs” Derrida’s own notion of dissemination...|$|R
40|$|In their essay, Davison and Martinsons make a {{compelling}} {{argument for the}} information systems (IS) community to be more responsive to the ‘adverse consequences of epistemological and methodological monism’. Although {{there has always been}} a diversity of topics and theoretical orientations in the IS discipline (Culnan, 1986; Orlikowski and Baroudi, 1991), we still lack a plurality of research traditions to explore the IS phenomenon from multiple perspectives. Davison and Martinsons eloquently advance the call for such plurality. Their main argument is that the prevailing dominant perspective is unethical and produces less value to practice. These are important points. In this paper, we seek to complement their argument by reflecting not so much on methods as on the development of the wider IS field within which such methods are applied and ultimately legitimated. Our argument, in broad terms, is that the development of IS as a discipline faces important challenges that arise both from the domain of practice and from its own intellectual evolution. We see a greater plurality of methods as one strand in the discipline's ability to overcome these challenges. However, without changes in the wider discipline itself, such <b>plurality</b> <b>risks</b> becoming a token of diversity and not the driver for the more engaged and questioning scholarship that Davison and Martinsons advocate...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{welcome the}} {{opportunity}} to respond to Ofcom’s invitation {{to comment on the}} application of the public interest test to the proposed Sky/ 21 st Century Fox transaction. There already exists an abundance of evidence relating to Sky’s news production and distribution, as well as the prominence of its news content and that of the other news companies run by its senior management, which raise media plurality concerns in relation to this deal. 1 We trust that Ofcom will be diligent and creative in assessing the <b>risks</b> to media <b>plurality</b> in terms of citizens’ access to news and information, going well beyond consumption data and perhaps revising its “share of references” metric. However, the role of media in our society is not solely the provision of news and the representation of various groups and viewpoints within that news. It is also to provide a variety of content through which our norms, values, and identities are negotiated. Therefore our contribution will focus on two other issues that we believe are crucial to the media plurality public interest test and have broader implications: (1) Sky’s position as an internet service provider (ISP), and (2) the relationship between this public interest test and the concurrent “fit and proper” test. The response affords separate consideration to (3) the scope of the ‘commitment to broadcasting standards’ public interest ground...|$|R
5000|$|Public sphere {{pedagogy}} inherently {{is subject}} {{to many of the}} criticisms of Habermas' conception of the public sphere. Chief among them is the traditionally exclusionary nature. The bourgeois public sphere, as introduced by Habermas, has been characterized as highly patriarchal, and oblivious to the existence of female and plebeian styles of discourse. The concern here is that as a model of the bourgeois public sphere, applications of public sphere pedagogy might alienate students and community members unaccustomed to this type of dialectic experience.In addition to its exclusionary nature, attention has also been called to Habermas' privileging of a hegemonic public sphere. Michael Warner argues that the bourgeois public sphere was structured to be affable to those privileged few who made up the powerful upperclass. While students participating in public sphere pedagogy application receive special training in their classrooms, the same is not necessarily true of community members who participate. This specialized student training draws two critiques. First, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of instruction <b>risks</b> erasing the <b>plurality</b> that is central to being a public. Training individuals how to be [...] "good" [...] citizens prescribes action in a way that limits the scope of politics and the public sphere. Second, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of learning risks eclipsing politics with education. Turning political and social issues into learning problems individualizes the issues instead of making them the responsibility of the public.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{examine the}} rate of {{cerebral}} palsy in twins and triplets in births from 1980 to 1989 in Western Australia and to identify factors associated with increase in <b>risk.</b> DESIGN [...] <b>Pluralities</b> for all births in Western Australia were identified through the standardised midwives' notification system, and cases of cerebral palsy were identified from the Western Australian cerebral palsy register. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Multiple births, cerebral palsy, excluding postneonatal cause. RESULTS [...] The prevalence of cerebral palsy in triplets, of 28 per 1000 survivors to 1 year (95 % confidence interval 11 to 63) exceeded that in twins (7. 3; 5. 2 to 10) and singletons (1. 6; 1. 4 to 1. 8). Although twins and triples {{were more likely than}} singletons to be low in birth weight, their risks of cerebral palsy if low in birth weight were similar. In contrast, in normal birthweight categories twins had a higher rate of cerebral palsy (4. 2; 2. 2 to 7. 7) than singletons (1. 1; 1. 0 to 1. 3). The prevalence of cerebral palsy was similar in twins of unlike sex pairs, all of whom are dizygotic, and in like sex pairs. A twin pair in which one member died in utero was at higher risk of cerebral palsy: 96 per 1000 twin pairs (36 to 218) compared with 12 (8. 2 to 17) for twin pregnancies in which both survived. There was a similar but non-significant trend for death of one triplet to be associated with increased risk of cerebral palsy in the survivors of the set. CONCLUSION [...] Triplet pregnancies produced a child with cerebral palsy 47 times more often than singleton pregnancies did and twin pregnancies eight times more often. Eighty six per cent of cerebral palsy in multiple births was in twins. As multiple births are increasing mainly because of personal and medical decisions the increased risk of cerebral palsy in multiple births is of concern...|$|R
