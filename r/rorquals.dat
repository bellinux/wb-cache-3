5|$|<b>Rorquals</b> use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, <b>rorquals</b> need to build up water {{pressure}} in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. <b>Rorquals</b> generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (<b>rorquals),</b> Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while <b>rorquals</b> and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. <b>Rorquals</b> {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Humpback {{whales are}} <b>rorquals</b> (Balaenopteridae, {{a family that}} {{includes}} the blue, fin, Bryde's, sei and minke whales).

50|$|In January 1941 <b>Rorqual</b> {{attacked}} the tug Ursus and a floating battery {{mounted on a}} lighter. The lighter could not be torpedoed, as she was of too shallow draught for the normal depth setting of the torpedoes, and the only other weapon the <b>Rorqual</b> had was her single 4-inch gun. <b>Rorqual</b> surfaced at about 500 yards range. Her opening attack hit the Ursus and damaged the battery. Heavy fire from the damaged tug forced <b>Rorqual</b> to shift her fire from the battery and engage the Ursus again, forcing her crew to abandon her. Though badly damaged, the floating battery opened fire and forced the <b>Rorqual</b> to dive. She then fired a torpedo set to run on the surface, {{only to find that}} the torpedo developed a gyro failure and returned on its own tracks. <b>Rorqual</b> had to dive deep to avoid it. When last seen, the Ursus was sinking and the battery was on fire. The battery however did not sink, and was later towed to Dubrovnik.|$|R

5|$|Though clearly {{related to}} the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the {{humpback}} is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the humpback is {{more closely related to}} certain <b>rorquals,</b> particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly to the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to other <b>rorquals</b> such as the minke whales.|$|E

5000|$|HMS <b>Rorqual</b> (S02) was a Porpoise-class {{submarine}} {{launched in}} 1956. She {{was built by}} the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England.

5000|$|The Italian {{merchant}}s Caffaro, Ischia and {{the brand-new}} Italian merchant Carbonello A. were damaged by mines laid by <b>Rorqual.</b> <b>Rorqual</b> was also active in attacking enemy shipping herself, torpedoing and sinking the Italian tanker Laura Corrado; the Italian submarine Pier Capponi; the Italian merchants Cilicia and the German tanker Wilhemsburg and the French merchant (in German service) Nantaise. <b>Rorqual's</b> torpedoes also damaged the Italian auxiliary cruiser Piero Foscari, unsuccessfully attacked an Italian submarine and the Italian merchant Securitas, and sunk two Greek sailing vessels with gunfire.|$|R

5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain <b>rorquals,</b> such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other <b>rorquals,</b> such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E
5|$|Ventral grooves {{run from}} the lower jaw to the umbilicus, about halfway along the {{underside}} of the body. These grooves are less numerous (usually 14–22) than in other <b>rorquals,</b> but are fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. <b>Rorquals</b> have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the <b>rorquals,</b> their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

5|$|Balaenopterids are the <b>rorquals.</b> These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} <b>rorquals,</b> {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales.

5|$|<b>Rorquals</b> {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: the fin whale (B. physalus), the Sei whale (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. brydei), Eden's whale (B. edeni), the blue whale (B. musculus), the common minke whale (B. acutorostrata), the Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), Omura's whale (B. omurai), and the {{humpback}} whale (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of <b>rorquals.</b> They recommend that the genus Balaenoptera {{be limited to the}} fin whale, have minke whales fall under the genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain the Sei whale, Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, the blue whale, and Omura's whale.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (<b>rorquals),</b> Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and <b>rorquals.</b> In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E
