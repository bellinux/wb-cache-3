40|$|Sedimentation {{and erosion}} can {{significantly}} affect {{the performance of}} river <b>regulated</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> In the vicinity of flow control structures, {{the interaction between the}} hydrodynamics and sediment transport often induces complex morphological processes. It is generally very challenging to accurately predict these morphological processes in real applications. Details are given of the refinement and application of a three-dimensional (3 -D) layer integrated model to predict the morphological processes in a river <b>regulated</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The model employs an Alternating Direction Implicit finite difference algorithm to solve the mass, momentum and suspended sediment transport conservation equations, and an explicit finite difference scheme for the bed sediment mass conservation equation for calculating bed level changes. The model is verified against experimental data reported in the literature. It is then applied to a scaled physical model of a <b>regulated</b> <b>reservoir,</b> including the associated intakes and sluice gates, to predict the velocity distributions, sediment transport rates and bed level changes {{in the vicinity of the}} hydraulic structures. It is found that the velocity distribution near an intake is non-uniform, resulting in a reduction in the suspended sediment flux through the intake and the formation of a sedimentation zone inside the reservoir...|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the large}} {{difference}} between topography and rainfall in China, the geographical distribution of hydropower is unbalanced, with most distributed in the west of China. In addition, China is located in southeastern Asia and is on verge of the world’s largest ocean, which causes a characteristic monsoon climate. Thus, the runoff distributions of most rivers are uneven throughout a year and seasonal flow becomes disparate, so high-performance <b>regulating</b> <b>reservoirs</b> need to be constructed.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} layer integrated morphodynamic {{model has}} been developed to predict the hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological processes in a <b>regulated</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The model {{was based on an}} existing sediment transport model, with improvements being made. A bed evolution module based on the mass balance equation has been developed to determine the bed level change due to sediment transport. The horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient was equated to the depth averaged eddy viscosity, based on the horizontal velocity distribution while the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient was evaluated using the layer integrated form of the - equations. This scheme enhances the accuracy of the computed velocity and suspended sediment concentration distributions. The highly accurate ULTIMATE QUICKEST scheme was used to represent the advective terms in solving the advective-diffusion equation for suspended sediment transport. An explicit finite difference scheme has been developed for the bed sediment mass balance equation to calculate bed level changes. The numerical model was verified against laboratory data obtained from experiments in a trench and a partially closed channel. A physical model was constructed to represent the flow, sediment transport and morphodynamic processes in Hamidieh <b>regulated</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The physical model was designed based on the Froude similarity law and was undistorted. The model sediment size was determined in such a manner that the same ratio of particle fall velocity to shear velocity is maintained for both the model and prototype reservoir. Stokes law was used in calculating the particle fall velocity. The physical model results confirmed that the normal water surface elevation in the reservoir should increase by up to 25 cm in order to reach the nominal flow discharge diverted to the intakes. The numerical model was then applied to the scaled physical model of the reservoir and the associated water intakes and sluice gates. Various scenarios were tested to investigate the effects of different situations of diverting flow and sediment transport regimes, as well as to establish how these operations affect the morphodynamic processes in the reservoir and the vicinity of hydraulic structures. The model predictions agreed with measured data generally well. The numerical model results revealed the possibility of forming sedimentary islands in the <b>regulated</b> <b>reservoir</b> and it is uneconomical to set up a dredging zone near the one of the intakes. In summary, the integrated numerical and physical modelling approach showed many benefits and could help to optimize time and budget for design hydraulic structures.

5000|$|As {{demand for}} water {{increased}} {{it was necessary}} to increase the storage on the River Dee and the next development was Llyn Celyn (...) , a new 81,000,000-cubic-metre capacity <b>regulating</b> <b>reservoir</b> within the Bala Lake catchment area. This was completed in 1967 by Liverpool Corporation, and designed to operate in conjunction with the Bala Lake Scheme. This enables additional Dee abstractions of 327,000 cubic metres litres per day together with additional flood control storage. In summer time the impact was to increase threefold the dry-weather flow for most of the length of the river. This development was hugely controversial at the time and remains politically fraught to this day since the construction of the reservoir involved flooding the Tryweryn Valley and the village of Capel Celyn and twelve farms. Local people saw this a destruction of part of the Welsh culture in order to supply England with water. This caused a great deal of controversy, resentment and protest. To try to offset some of the environmental concerns associated with the scheme, some of the stored water was specifically set aside to make special releases to help fisheries, to provide recreational opportunities (canoeing and white-water rafting on the Afon Tryweryn) and to disperse pollution events should they occur.|$|E

After impounding, several sinkholes developed within the vicinity of the dam site. The surface expression of the sinkholes suggests that they are caused by underground collapse.

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{addresses}} the numerical prediction {{of the behavior}} of a ground and a reservoir dyke with a retaining wall at the site of a <b>regulating</b> <b>reservoir</b> whose soft soil foundation is improved by using both the usual embankment preloading and vacuum consolidation. To evaluate the settlement, the lateral deformation, and the dissipation of pore pressure during vacuum preloading, a numerical analysis using an elasto-plastic FEM for soil–water coupled problems, incorporating the SYS Cam-clay model, is carried out in two dimensions. However, a change in the soil parameters during the vacuum preloading leads to a less accurate computation. To account for the uncertainties in the input parameters of the constitutive model for the improved ground, an inverse analysis approach is adopted. The particle filter is used to identify the compression index of the clay layers and the coefficient of permeability of the organic soil layer based on the measured settlement {{at the bottom of the}} preloading embankment during the vacuum consolidation. The reservoir dyke with a retaining wall is constructed on an improved foundation after removing the preloading embankment, and an attempt is made to predict its performance after construction by an elasto-plastic FEM for soil–water coupled problems using the identified parameters...|$|E

The decision variables are releases, storage volume, water level and outlet (demand) from the reservoir. The results of the GA model gave a good agreement during the comparison with the actual rule curve and the designed rating curve of the reservoir.
