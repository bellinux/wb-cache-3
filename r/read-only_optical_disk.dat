40|$|In this work, {{light beam}} is {{simulated}} through nonlinear super-resolution films by the finite element method. The {{results indicate that}} the transmitted beam can be reshaped and the light spot can be smaller than the diffraction limit due to the reshaping effect of strong nonlinear saturatable absorption. However, the size of the transmitted light spot cannot be decreased continuously with the increase of the film thickness, and the light spot size then decreases with the increase of the film thickness. The simulated results mean that the carrier-to-noise-ratio first increases, and then decreases with the film thickness, and there is an optimum film thickness for the <b>read-only</b> nonlinear super-resolution <b>optical</b> <b>disks,</b> which is consistent with the reported experimental results...|$|R

40|$|In {{the near}} future, large digital media servers are {{expected}} to offer storage capacities {{in the order of}} petabytes. Servers made of clusters of PC's connected to jukeboxes may represent an interesting alternative compared with servers made of arrays of magnetic disks.

In the present contribution, we analyze the benefits and limitations of striping files across multiple <b>optical</b> <b>disks</b> in order to speedup the retrieval of large pieces of information.
