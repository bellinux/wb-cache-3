5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by <b>rough-stalked</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include meadow brome Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, Yorkshire-fog grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and meadow-sweet Filipendula ulmaria. Associated calcicole species include meadow cranesbill Geranium pratense, clustered bell-flower Campanula glomerata, cowslip Primula veris, hoary plantain Plantago media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor and lady’s bedstraw Galium verum.The meadow is surrounded by old hedgerows with a variety of species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, field maple Acer campestre, spindle Euonymus europaeus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, and buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus. A drainage ditch along two sides of the site supports five species of willow including purple willow Salix purpurea and almond willow Salix triandra. Common comfrey Symphytum officinale, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, cyperus sedge Carex pseudocyperus and the uncommon aquatic liverwort Riccia fluitans...along this ditch.

40|$|A {{collection}} of 51 Xanthomonas campestris strains {{from throughout the}} world was studied to detect and assess genetic diversity among pathogens of small grains. Isolates from barley, bread wheat, bromegrass, canary grass, cassava, maize, orchard grass, rice, <b>rough-stalked</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>grass,</b> rye, timothy, and triticale were analyzed by pathogenicity tests on bread wheat cv. Alondra and barley cv. Corona, indirect immunofluorescence, and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP). Three probes were used for the RFLP analysis. They were an acetylaminofluorene-labelled 16 S+ 23 S rRNA probe from Escherichia coli and two (sup 32) P-labelled restriction fragments from either plasmidic (pBSF 2) or chromosomal (pBS 8) DNA of X. campestris pv. manihotis. Strains clustered in 9 and 20 groups with the rRNA probe and the pBSF 2 DNA probe, respectively. Strains of X. campestris pv. graminis, X. campestris pv. phleipratensis, and X. campestris pv. poae are shown to be related but are also distinguishable by RFLP patterns, serology, and pathogenicity on bread wheat. Strains pathogenic only for barley and not for wheat grouped together. Another group is temporarily designated deviant X. campestris pv. undulosa. These South American isolates from bread wheat did not react by indirect immunofluorescence and produced atypical lesions in pathogenicity tests. The results stress the need to perform pathogenicity tests before strains are named at the pathovar level. The importance of the different probes used for epidemiological studies or phylogenetic studies of closely related strains is underlined...|$|E

40|$|The {{vesicular-arbuscular}} mycorrhizal fungus Glomus monosporum was inoculated on grapevine (Vitis vinifera), {{red clover}} (Trifolium pratense), <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) and onion (Allium cepa) as hosts in two experiments {{carried out in}} different environments. Grapevine and clover showed the largest growth response and spore production. Mycorrhizal infection was lowest in <b>meadow</b> <b>grass.</b> Very poor correlations were observed, on an overall basis, between spore production and per cent root infection or infected root length. Spore production per unit infected root length for each host species was a comparatively stable parameter; it was largest for grapevine and smallest for <b>meadow</b> <b>grass</b> in both experiments. Sporulation {{was positively correlated with}} growth enhancement by mycorrhizal plants, and growth increments per unit infected root followed the same trend as spore numbers per unit infected root, i. e. largest for grapevine and lowest for meadow-grass.

40|$|Surface {{wastewater}} is consideredas effluents, {{which are}} formed {{on the surface}} of urbanized areas. Stormwater treatment is performed out using a variety of filters: sand, grass. Wastewater penetration into the deeper layers is called hydraulic conductivity. After evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity, it is possible to determine the ability of the investigated fillers to entrap the stormwater flow. The hydraulic conductivity tests can indicate which fillers of stormwater filters may influence the more effective stormwater cleaning. Four stormwater filters were tested: crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter; crushed autoclaved aerated concrete with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer; silica sand filter. Under in-situ conditions hydraulic conductivity in filters is investigated using Constant-head method. Mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D presentsthe changes of hydraulic conductivity in each filler layer of the filter. Assessed hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions hasn‘t changed only in crushed autoclaved aerated concrete filter (30 000 mm/d). The smallest hydraulic conductivity in filters under in-situ conditions was estimated in silica sand filter with <b>Meadow</b> <b>grass</b> (Poa pratensis) layer, here it was equal to 209. 3 mm/d. With mathematical modeling program Hydrus- 1 D {{it was found that the}} hydraulic conductivity in each filter decreases, depending on the depth of filler in the filter...|$|R
