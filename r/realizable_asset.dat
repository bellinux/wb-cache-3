40|$|This article explores actors' {{rationales}} {{regarding their}} participation in rural land sales and tenancy markets {{in the context of}} Transylvania (Romania). The analysis of land practices highlights the low dynamism of the land sales market, linked to a thin supply. The landowners potentially most likely to sell - those who lack the means to directly use their land, or are involved in off-farm activities - very often favor leasing out their land. This ensures them a regular source of income or product (in the case of in-kind leases), supplementing the household's often meager revenues, and maintains the land patrimony (including land property as a <b>realizable</b> <b>asset</b> in case of necessity). Other landowners plan to sell their land but prefer to rent it out on the short run, because of an expected increase in land prices. Facing a lack of supply on the sales market, the potential buyers of land have to lease in land. This is particularly the case of commercial companies, and of market-oriented family farms. This situation has led to the emergence of reverse tenancy configurations...|$|E

25|$|The {{municipal}} council voted on 19 June 2008 to not give further subsidies to the airport. Upgrades for NOK8 million {{were needed to}} meet safety standard. The airport operator had debt of NOK12 million, and no <b>realizable</b> <b>assets.</b> Vildanden was under certain conditions willing to pay some of the capital needed to perform the upgrades. The {{municipal council}} changed their opinion and voted—with a single decisive vote—to keep the airport running in July. The financial risk would {{be taken over by}} the municipal-owned Kontorbygg, who operate a range of offices and commercial buildings in Skien. The proposal was supported by the right-winged parties, and opposed by the socialist parties, as well as the chair of Kontorbygg. As a response, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries reported the municipality to ESA, and demanded that NOK20 million in illegal subsidies be repaid by Vildanden and the airport operator.|$|R
5000|$|Net <b>realizable</b> {{equity in}} <b>assets</b> is the quick sale {{value of the}} asset (often 80% of Fair Market Value (FMV)) minus any {{liabilities}} which are secured by the asset (e.g., a loan). As an example, if a taxpayer has a home worth $100,000 and owes $50,000 on the home, the IRS will calculate the net realizable equity in the asset as follows: ($100,000 x [...]80) - $50,000 = $30,000. The IRS expects, in this example, that the $30,000 {{will be included in}} the Offer amount.|$|R
40|$|Personal {{preferences}} and financial incentives make homeownership desirable for most families. Once a family purchases a home {{they find it}} impractical (costly) to frequently change their ownership of residential real estate. Thus, by deciding how much home to buy, a family constrains their ability to adjust their asset allocation between residential real estate and other assets. To analyze {{the impact of this}} constraint on consumption, welfare, and post-retirement wealth, we first investigate a representative individual’s optimal asset allocation decisions when they are subject to a “homeownership constraint. ” Next, we perform a “thought experiment” where we assume the existence of a market where a homeowner can sell, without cost, a fractional interest in their home. Now the housing choice decision does not constrain the individual’s asset allocations. By comparing these two cases, we estimate the differences in post-retirement wealth and the welfare gains potentially <b>realizable</b> if <b>asset</b> allocations were not subject to a homeownership constraint. For realistic parameter values, we find that a representative homeowner would require a substantial increase in total net worth to achieve the same level of utility as would be achievable if the choice of a home could be separated from the asset allocation decision...|$|R
