40|$|Natural gas {{is usually}} {{transferred}} to consumers through pipelines, which may cover distances {{of thousands of}} kilometers. In some cases, however, when {{the path of the}} pipelines crosses seas or countries where the politic situation does not ensure a continuous and reliable flow, other means of transportation are preferred. In these cases, the natural gas is liquefied and transported in tankers, which load the tanks at liquefaction plants and discharge them at <b>regasification</b> <b>plants.</b> This gives a considerable chance to differentiate supply sources and allows gas imports from producing countries that are otherwise inaccessible via pipeline. The aim of this paper is the study of systems, which carry out liquefied natural gas (LNG) vaporization using cogenerative solutions. The following configurations were studied in particular: • Gas-steam combined cycles; • Closed gas-gas combined cycles using three different working fluids. Two typical plant sizes and two gas pressure sendout levels (7. 3 MPa for long distance pipeline networks and 2. 5 MPa for terminals linked to power production plants with combined cycles) have been analyzed.

40|$|A LNG {{regasification}} {{system with}} intermediate fluid vaporizer is studied. Two different intermediate fluids (IF), propane and {{a mix of}} mono-ethylene glycol and water, are compared {{for use in the}} system. The regasification system consists of two tube-in-tube heat exchangers, where the IFs flow between the two. Liquid nitrogen (used instead of LNG for safety and practicality) is evaporated and heated in the cold side heat exchanger by the IF, while water heats the IF in the second, warm side heat exchanger. Neither IF change phase during the loop. The work presented is conducted at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. A small-scale rig is built in the campus laboratory and experiments are conducted with the two IFs. Simultaneously computer simulations with Ansys FLUENT are verified by the experiments. The thesis presents a relevant background for LNG terminals and import in China and explains the fundamental mathematics used by the simulation software. The simulation, including building geometry and mesh grids, conducting independence studies, setting up the simulation case and boundary conditions, solving and reaching convergence are thoroughly explained. The experiment build and performance is outlined as well, and is further detailed in the appendices. The simulations, when verified by experiments, are used to compare propane and glycol as heat transfer fluids under exactly equal conditions.

40|$|Context: Colombia consumes {{natural gas}} in {{different}} sectors, {{especially in the}} ones that are residential and vehicular transport. Gas consumption serves as backup for power generation in situations of reduced hydroelectric capacity. Nowadays, gas reserve levels have been reduced and it is essential to ensure the uninterrupted supply of the resource. To achieve such objective, there are some alternatives which are difficult to implement at the same time, given the limited financial budget and implementation times that they demanded. In this way, several studies have advanced in the application of models to prioritize alternatives for both supplying power and reducing emissions in the generation, especially regarding the evaluation of energy sources and technology selection for supply. Method: The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based in the Delphi method to define preferences according to the experts judgment, was applied to evaluate the selection of alternatives supply of natural gas in Colombia, considering technical, environmental and social criteria, which is reliable and policy oriented to guarantee supply of resources in the country. Results: Once the model was applied, we evaluated the criteria and alternatives for infrastructure to support gas supply, finding that reliability is the most relevant criterion as well as alternative of building the ‘Regasification Pacific Plant’ followed by the construction of the ‘Buenaventura-Cali pipeline’ and the ‘Storage Plant in Bogotá'. Conclusions: As the results indicate, in Colombia efforts should be focus on imports of the resource through the construction of <b>regasification</b> <b>plants</b> and pipelines to facilitate transport inland to demand points. The latter may help decision makers facing various alternatives to ensure the supply of this resource, which is relevant to various economic sectors, including generation of electricity in the country.

40|$|Due to {{a global}} {{increasing}} demand for efficient clean energy sources the demand for natural gas is predicted to grow considerably this decade. Natural gas is transported by pipeline on the shorter distances and as LNG on longer distances. LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) is produced by cooling natural gas to just below its boiling point at - 162 ·C. It is stored and transported in thermally insulated tanks at ambient pressure. Currently the LNG fleet exists of 127 vessels of which the majority have a capacity between 125, 000 m 3 and 135, 000 m 3. The majority of the vessels are project controlled in long-term lease contracts: cuurentlyanother 54 vessels are on order to expand the fleet {{in order to meet}} the expected growth in transport volume. At this moment there are 39 reception terminals, of which 23 are located in Japan the largest importer of LNG, and there are plans for another 25 terminals. The main emerging markets for LNG are the U. S., India and China. In a conventional reception terminal, an LNG carrier is moored to a jetty. When the LNG carrier is offloaded the vapour that is suppressed from the storage tanks is send to the ship. The investment costs for conventional terminals vary between USD 180 mln and USD 650 mln, depending on the annual throughput, storage capacity and location.

In their place, the new politics promoted the idea that any injustice produced by urban transformations could be accepted as long as citizens were provided with the opportunity of forgetting their despair, by “feeling good” in a new park or a regenerated public space-although temporarily. It was clear that the new urban politics would erase injustice and, simultaneously, instil a new idea into the city: that of injustice as a natural fact and, hence, as an acceptable phenomenon.|$|E
30|$|In 2006, things changed. In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} the sustainability of its new energy policy, the Regional Government decided to construct two regasification plants, {{one of them to}} be localised in Taranto on a dismissed industrial site in between the steel plant and the ENI refinery.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{cross-section}} infrastructural and regulatory {{analysis of the}} European LNG sector is presented. The LNG chain is maintained as being a good tool to enlarge the number of natural gas exporters to Europe, adding in this way to competition and to {{the achievement of the}} targets of the liberalisation process, that is a decrease in price for final customers and security of supply. The main reason for this is to be identified in the minor specificity of the <b>regasification</b> <b>plant</b> related investment compared to pipeline transportation. The latter, in fact, brings about, once built, a physical tie between producers and importers that prevents the buyer from changing supplier, in order to recover the high fixed sunk costs connected with the pipeline investment, and effective competition from developing. A regasification terminal, on the contrary, is theoretically able to receive cargoes from whatever source of supply according to the relative conveniences. Nevertheless in order to develop its potential the LNG market needs to be well designed and regulated. More particularly, regulation is meant to {{play a key role in}} promoting regasification investments without hindering competition...|$|E

In spite of these differences, the need to break free from the conception of Taranto as an inevitable casualty of local and national economic growth had the effect of binding local population.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of cold energy during the regasification of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has gained attention {{in recent years}} due to the fast growth of the LNG trade market and the increasing importance that governments are giving to energy efficiency and sustainability.

40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) {{presents}} clean, cost-effective solution for transportation/ shipping {{of natural gas}} from remote reservoirs to consumer market. Until recently, the limits of natural gas properties, acceptable to LNG importers, had been lenient, as it was generally used for power production. However, new markets, as they use LNG to supplement their current supplies, demand an LNG with characteristics/ quality compatible to their existing pipeline grid and clientele specifications. This raises natural gas harmonization, interoperability and interchangeability issues in potential LNG importers, such as Finland which is wholly reliant on single natural gas source from Russia. Rising environmental concerns, stiffening emission regulations and energy security drive Finland to import LNG. This thesis is aimed at identifying the world LNG sources suitable for import to Finnish market based on specifications required by natural gas applications in Finland. The thesis also studies the LNG value chain {{in general and the}} LNG quality modification at import terminal/ <b>regasification</b> <b>plant.</b> Production, liquefaction, storage, transportation, and regasification are core components of LNG value chain besides numerous minor constituents including LNG liquid fuel engines. Finnish natural gas market is divided into broad segments of traffic, off-grid industry and existing gas grid users. Specification-data of all three designated sectors was collected from the manufacturers and industry. By considering three interchangeability parameters of natural gas: methane number, Wobbe index (lower), and lower heating value, this data was mapped on charts to determine the requirement of each sector and finally the common demand band (common window) of all the sectors. Similarly, the data of 27 available LNG sources and 3 European LNG re-export terminals was gathered and graphically analyzed. A preliminary simulation of 3 alternative processes, by means of Aspen HYSYS software, and their subsequent comparison resulted in selection of LPG Extraction as the most feasible LNG de-richment technique employed at a receiving terminal LNG re-vapourization plant. As per the current Finnish market requirement and grid conditions, out of 27 global LNG sources, the number of feasible sources remains 3; however, it could be increased to 7 by compromising land traffic sector methane number demand, and to 11 if the upper bounds for heating value are relaxed up to + 3 %.

40|$|LNG, Competition and Security of Supply: the Role of Shipping - In {{the last}} few years, {{one of the main}} {{concerns}} of European Union in the energetic field has been that of facilitating the safeguard of raw materials’ security of supply, especially that of natural gas. Import through LNG chain, that is, through the employment of LNG tankers for gas transportation, has been identified by the European Council as one of the instruments to achieve these goals. In fact, import via LNG does not require, for the importer, such investments as to determine an indissoluble physical tie between producer and buyer, as happens for transport via pipeline (Chernyavs’ka et al., 2002). In other words, investments in pipelines are very specific. Moreover, as they are made in order to support specific transactions, contracts usually take the form of long-term agreements with minimum offtake requirements (take or pay clauses) : such contracts definitely contribute to the "cartelization" of the market, hindering competition. Unlike investments in pipelines, those in the LNG chain present a much lower degree of specificity: in fact, even though the construction of a <b>regasification</b> <b>plant</b> is generally tied to the stipulation of a long-term agreement (with take or pay clause), LNG chain costs have significantly decreased over time (until a few years ago) and, moreover, it is getting increasingly common that part of plant capacity is made available for spot transactions. What’s more, once the contract is expired and the investment is sunk, the importer may satisfy his gas supply needs {{on the basis of his}} relative gains. As far as LNG import contractual practices are concerned, significant changes have started to take places in {{the last few}} years, both in terms of agreements’ length - average duration has significantly decreased - and in terms of price indexation - in the most developed markets LNG price is tied to gas spot price (IEA, 2006). One of the many possible advantages of transport via LNG is that liquefied gas enables European importers to widen their gas suppliers portfolio. Increased possibilities of choice for importers, the widening of the group of exporting countries, and the increased integration of the European market, thanks to the possibility of redirecting cargoes depending on single countries’ supply-demand balance, would contribute decisively to security of supply, market globalization and competition (between importers) in the industry (IEA, 2004). Yet, it must be stressed that import via tanker appears to be competitive with import via pipe only for the medium-long distances. As far as LNG chain is concerned, the element that so far has attracted the least attention, though being not less important than the other two, is certainly shipping. Being the link between the producing/exporting country and the importing country, and having been subject to major changes in the last few years, it is particularly interesting to analyze it singularly, aiming to understand how it is linked to the other elements of LNG value chain, besides studying industry dynamics. This paper will address this issue, aiming also to understand what has been and what will be in the future the evolutionary trajectory of this segment, starting from an analysis of operative and planned gas tankers, their size, their routes and their contractual situation. This analysis can be useful to make hypothesis about the growth of the spot market and, consequently, of market liquidity.
