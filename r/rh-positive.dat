50|$|The Rosette test is {{performed}} on postpartum maternal blood {{to estimate the}} volume of fetal-maternal hemorrhage {{in case of an}} Rh negative mother and an Rh positive child.

In this test, a sample of maternal blood is incubated with Rho(D) immune globulin, which will bind to any fetal Rh positive red blood cells, if present. Upon addition of enzyme-treated cDE indicator cells, the presence of Rh positive fetal blood causes rosetting, which can be seen by light microscopy. The test is recommended for Rh negative mothers within 72 hours of giving birth to an <b>Rh-positive</b> infant.

40|$|Billingham et al. [1] {{reported}} that mice and chickens injected as embryos with cells from other strains acquired a persistent tolerance to later skin grafts from the donor strains. It seemed possible {{to us that}} a similar, but naturally acquired, tolerance might be in part responsible for the variation in response of Rh-negative persons exposed to the Rh antigens. [2] The hypothesis to be tested was that Rh-negative children of <b>Rh-positive</b> mothers might, {{as a result of}} their exposure as embryos to the maternal Rh antigen, acquire a degree of persistent tolerance toward the antigen. Rh-negative children of Rh-negative mothers, on the other hand, could have had no similar embryonic exposure and might therefore be expected to react more easily upon encountering an <b>Rh-positive</b> antigen in later life. We have collected data on the mothers of two groups of Rh-negative women: first, those in whom there is no evidence of Rh sensitization within three <b>Rh-positive</b> pregnancies and, second, those who have developed evidence of Rh sensitization during or before their third <b>Rh-positive</b> pregnancy. The first-group we classify as relatively "tolerant" and the second as relatively "intolerant" to Rh antigens. Table 1 lists the Rh types of the mothers of women in these two groups. A simple χ^ 2 test for homogeneity yields a probability of less-than 0. 01 that the two samples of mothers could have been drawn by chance from the same population. In other words, these data seem to offer good reason to believe that the degree of Rh tolerance displayed by Rh-negative women is indeed related to their mothers' Rh types. A number of cases included in the study have been omitted from Table 1 because of uncertainties in their classification. For example, stillbirths or miscarriages of unknown Rh type made it impossible to classify some of them according to the criteria of tolerance we have employed. Some of the data that are included in Table 1 are open to question on other grounds. Ten of the women were given transfusions or injections of blood at some time prior to their third <b>Rh-positive</b> pregnancy. Some of these transfusions were with <b>Rh-positive</b> blood, others with blood of unknown Rh type, and others probably with Rh-negative blood. Two additional women believed that they might have received injections or transfusions of blood but were not certain that they had. It is difficult to evaluate the number of exposures of these twelve women to Rh antigens or to weigh the sensitizing significance of blood injections or transfusions relative to the importance of an <b>Rh-positive</b> pregnancy. Table 2 lists the data after the exclusion of all cases in which there is a record suggesting that blood may have been transfused or injected. A χ^ 2 test for homogeneity on the data of Table 2 yields a probability of less than 0. 001. It should be noted that transfusions or injections with <b>Rh-positive</b> blood appear to provide a very effective stimulus to Rh sensitization and that a considerable number of the Rh-negative daughters of <b>Rh-positive</b> women who fall in the "intolerant" class have been stimulated by this route...|$|E

This paper is a continuation of these studies on Rh sensitization and will present the results of observations on the effect of pregnancies with <b>Rh-positive</b> fetuses and birth of <b>Rh-positive</b> babies on the maternal Rh antibody titer. As will be pointed out, these findings have important implications with regard to the frequency with which pregnant Rh-negative women are apt to be-come isosensitized and give birth to erythroblastotic babies.

We found that <b>Rh-positive</b> and Rh-negative subjects responded differently to toxoplasmosis. In addition to the already known effects of toxoplasmosis on novelty seeking, self transcendence, superego strength and protension, we also found effects of RhD phenotype on ego strength, protension, and praxernia, as well as opposite effects of toxoplasmosis on ego strength, praxernia, ergic tension and cooperativeness in <b>Rh-positive</b> and Rh-negative subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND During pregnancy, a Rhesus {{negative}} (Rh-negative) {{woman may}} develop antibodies when her fetus is Rhesus positive (<b>Rh-positive).</b> These antibodies may harm <b>Rh-positive</b> babies. OBJECTIVES To assess {{the effects of}} antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin on the incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation when given to Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised trials in Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies given anti-D after 28 weeks of pregnancy, compared with no treatment, placebo or a different regimen of anti-D. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. MAIN RESULTS Two trials with moderate to high risk of bias, involving over 4500 women, compared anti-D prophylaxis with no anti-D during pregnancy. When women received anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks' gestation, risks of immunisation {{were not significantly different}} than for women not given antenatal anti-D: risk ratio (RR) of immunisation during pregnancy was 0. 42 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 15 to 1. 17); after the birth of a <b>Rh-positive</b> infant the RR was 0. 42 (95 % CI 0. 15 to 1. 17); and within 12 months after birth of a <b>Rh-positive</b> infant the RR was 0. 39 (95 % CI 0. 10 to 1. 62). However, women receiving anti-D during pregnancy were significantly less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test (which detects fetal cells in maternal blood) in pregnancy (RR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 41 to 0. 88) and at the birth of a <b>Rh-positive</b> infant (RR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 46 to 0. 79). No data were available for the risk of Rhesus D alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy. No significant differences were seen for neonatal jaundice, and no adverse effects were reported in either trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The risk of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during or immediately after a first pregnancy is about 1 %. Administration of 100 µg (500 IU) anti-D to women in their first pregnancy can reduce this risk to about 0. 2 % without, to date, any adverse effects. Although unlikely to confer benefit in the current pregnancy, fewer women may have Rhesus D antibodies in any subsequent pregnancy, but the effects of this needs to be tested in studies of robust design.

To assess {{the effects of}} antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin on the incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation when given to Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised trials in Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies given anti-D after 28 weeks of pregnancy, compared with no treatment, placebo or a different regimen of anti-D. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We included two trials involving over 4500 women, comparing anti-D prophylaxis with no anti-D during pregnancy in this review. Overall, the trials were judged to be at moderate to high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for pre-specified outcomes was also assessed using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. In regards to primary review outcomes, there {{did not appear to}} be a clear difference in the risks of immunisation when women who received anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks' gestation were compared with women who were not given antenatal anti-D: risk ratio (RR) for incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during pregnancy was 0. 42 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 15 to 1. 17, two trials, 3902 women; GRADE: low quality evidence); at birth of a <b>Rh-positive</b> infant the RR was 0. 42 (95 % CI 0. 15 to 1. 17, two trials, 2297 women); and within 12 months after birth of a <b>Rh-positive</b> infant the average RR was 0. 39 (95 % CI 0. 10 to 1. 62, two trials, 2048 women; Tau²: 0. 47; I²: 39 %; GRADE: low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation in subsequent pregnancies. Considering secondary outcomes, in one trial, women receiving anti-D during pregnancy were shown to be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test (which detects fetal cells in maternal blood) in pregnancy (at 32 to 25 weeks) (RR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 41 to 0. 88; 1884 women; GRADE: low quality evidence) and at the birth of a <b>Rh-positive</b> infant (RR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 46 to 0. 79; 1189 women; GRADE: low quality evidence). No clear differences were seen for neonatal jaundice (RR 0. 26, 95 % CI 0. 03 to 2. 30; 1882 infants; GRADE: very low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on adverse effects associated with anti-D treatment. Existing studies do not provide conclusive evidence that the use of anti-D during pregnancy benefits either mother or baby in terms of incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during the pregnancy or postpartum, or the incidence of neonatal morbidity (jaundice) (low to very low quality evidence). However women receiving anti-D may be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test in pregnancy and at the birth of a <b>Rh-positive</b> infant (low quality evidence). Fewer women who receive anti-D during pregnancy may have Rhesus D antibodies in a subsequent pregnancy, with benefits for the baby, however this needs to be tested in studies of robust design...|$|E

40|$|Observations are {{described}} of the incidence among Caucasians and Negroes {{of the blood}} factors RhA, RhB and RhC which occur associated with the Rh 0 factor in typical <b>Rh-positive</b> blood. The antiserums used for the tests were derived from <b>Rh-positive</b> patients who had had hemolytic transfusion reactions or erythroblastotic babies. Among a large series of individuals, {{it was found that}} only rarely is any of the blood factors RhA, RhB, or RhC lacking from "standard" Rh 0 -positive blood. On the other hand, about half of the specimens of Rh 0 variant blood lack {{one or more of the}} factors RhA, RhB, and RhC, which, when present in such blood, are also almost always variants. Judging from the incidence of specimens lacking one or more of these factors, RhA, RhB, and RhB appear to be relatively independent of one another despite their association with blood factor Rh 0. Tests for factors RhA, RhB, and RhC distinguish new rare varieties of Rh and ℜh agglutinogens, each genetically determined by corresponding allelic genes. There is no doubt that more clinical cases will be found in which sensitized <b>Rh-positive</b> individuals have antibodies resembling anti-Rh 0 in specificity. Four such cases have already been studied by the present authors, and in each case the antibodies were shown to be different from anti-Rh 0 in specificity. Since they were also different from one another, they have been assigned the symbols anti-RhA, anti-RhB, anti-RhC, and anti-RhD, respectively, the first three being the antiserums used in the present study. Obviously, in order to avoid confusion of nomenclature, the specificity of antiserums from other similar cases will have to be compared with anti-RhA, anti-RhB, anti-RhC, and anti-RhD and shown to be different from all four, as well as anti-Rh 0, before a distinctive symbol is assigned to them...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Cold {{agglutinin}} disease usually develops as {{a result}} of the production of a specific immunoglobulin M auto-antibody directed against the I/i and H antigens, precursors of the ABH and Lewis blood group substances, on red blood cells. Autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other infections can be associated with the production of cold agglutinins. In its classic presentation with haemolytic anaemia and Raynaud's syndrome, cold agglutinin disease is usually idiopathic. Several factors play a role in determining the ability of a cold agglutinin to induce a haemolytic anaemia such as antibody concentration and temperature range, in particular the highest temperature at which antibodies interact with red blood cells. Case presentation A 48 -year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital with symptoms of extreme asthenia caused by severe anaemia. The transfusion of red blood cells (O <b>Rh-positive),</b> started as prescribed by the emergency guidelines in force without pre-transfusion tests, induced fatal haemolysis because of the presence of high levels of anti-H antibodies in his blood, that reacted with the large amount of H antigen in universal (0) red blood cells. Conclusion Emergency transfusion of universal red blood cells (0 <b>Rh-positive</b> or negative) is usually accepted by the international guidelines in force in emergency departments. In this report we describe a rare complication caused by the very high concentration in the recipient of cold agglutinins and the activation of the complement system, responsible for red blood cell lysis and consequent fatal cardiovascular shock. We conclude that emergency transfusion of universal red blood cells (0 <b>Rh-positive</b> or negative) may be dangerous and its risk should be assessed against the risk of delaying transfusion until the pre-transfusion tests are completed. </p...|$|E

(See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) RhoGAM or	MICRhoGAM	should	be	administered	within	 72 	hours	of	delivery	or	known	or suspected exposure	to	<b>Rh-positive</b>	red	blood	cells. There	is	little	information	concerning the effectiveness	of	Rho(D) 	 Immune	Globulin	(Human) 	 when	given	beyond	this	 72 	hour period. In	one	study,	 Rho(D) 	 Immune	Globulin	(Human) 	 provided	protection	against	Rh immunization in	about	 50 %	 of	subjects	when	given	 13 	days	after	exposure	to	<b>Rh-positive</b> red blood	cells. 1 	Administer	every	 12 	weeks	starting	from	first	injection	to	maintain	a	level of passively	acquired	anti-D. 	If	delivery	occurs	within	three	weeks	after	the	last	antepartum dose,	 the	postpartum	dose	may	be	withheld,	 but	a	test	for	fetal-maternal	hemorrhage should be	performed	to	determine	if	exposure	to>	 15 	mL	of	red	blood	cells	has	occurred. 2 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter, discoloration and syringe damage prior to administration. Do not use if particulate matter and / or discoloration are observed. The solution should appear clear or slightly opalescent...|$|E
40|$|A male infant {{weighing}} 3400 g {{was born}} at 37 weeks ’ gestation after an uncompli-cated pregnancy. The mother is a 24 -year-old primipara who has type A <b>Rh-positive</b> blood. The infant’s course in the hospital nursery was uncomplicated. Although his mother needed considerable help in establishing effective breast-feeding, he was ex-clusively breast-fed. Jaundice was noted {{at the age of}} 34 hours. The total serum bili-rubin level was 7. 5 mg per deciliter (128 μmol per liter). The infant was discharged at the age of 40 hours and is seen in the pediatrician’s office 2 days later, now with marked jaundice. The results of his physical examination are otherwise normal, but his weight, at 3020 g, is 11 % below his birth weight. His total serum bilirubin level is 19. 5 mg per deciliter (333 μmol per liter), and his conjugated (direct) bilirubin level 0. 6 mg per deciliter (10 μmol per liter). The complete blood count and peripheral-blood smear are normal. The infant has type A <b>Rh-positive</b> blood. The pediatrician consults a neonatologist regarding the need for phototherapy.

40|$|Rho(D) -Immune Globulin {{was given}} to 322 Rh-negative women {{delivered}} of ABO-compatible, <b>Rh-positive</b> infants with no apparent failures to suppress Rh sensitization. In contrast, 32 of 305 mothers of a control group made Rh antibody during the six months following delivery. In subsequent pregnancies, 69 women administered RhoGAM had no evidence of isoimmunization after delivery while six of forty mothers of the control study produced anti-Rh. RhoGAM, given within 72 hours of delivery in the amounts employed, was effective for suppression of Rh immunization...|$|E

40|$|An Rh immune {{globulin}} [Rh IgG] for intravenous use, WinRho, {{has been}} {{prepared by the}} Winnipeg Rh Institute by a modification of the ion-exchange column method of Hoppe and colleagues. When administered to Rh-negative male and nonpregnant female volunteers WinRho {{was found to be}} nonpyrogenic, nontoxic, safe and protective against Rh alloimmunization. In a clinical trial with 240 microgram given at about 28 weeks' gestation and 120 microgram given after delivery to Rh-negative women at risk of Rh immunization WinRho was effective in preventing Rh immunization. Of the 870 women carrying <b>Rh-positive</b> fetuses who were treated with WinRho during pregnancy and were not tested several months after delivery 14 would have shown evidence of Rh immunization by the time of delivery if WinRho had been ineffective; none showed such evidence. Of the 1122 women carrying <b>Rh-positive</b> fetuses who were retested 4 to 6 months after delivery 83 would have shown evidence of Rh immunization at that time if WinRho had been ineffective; only 1 showed such evidence. The efficiency of yield of anti-D with the modified method of production, the fct that it can be given intravenously (a route that causes the patient less discomfort and immediately results in high anti-D levels) and the lower levels of contaminating IgA and IgM make WinRho the preparation of choice for preventing Rh immunization...|$|E
