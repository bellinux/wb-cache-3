40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} thermoelectric properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons {{in the presence}} of extended line defects, substrate impurities and edge <b>roughness</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> nanoribbon's length. A nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for the electronic structure and a fourth nearest- neighbor force constant model for the phonon bandstructure are used. For transport we employ quantum mechanical non-equilibrium Green's function simulations. Starting from the pristine zigzag nanoribbon structure that exhibits very poor thermoelectric performance, we demonstrate how after a series of engineering design steps the performance can be largely enhanced. Our results could be useful in the design of highly efficient nanostructured graphene nanoribbon based thermoelectric devices. Comment: 27 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

In this paper an algorithm for the automated estimation of road roughness from MLS data is presented, where a surface grid is fitted to the lidar points associated with the road surface.

We study the electron evolution both in single and coupled quantum wires in the case where the electron freely move through the channel and in the case where transport is assisted by surface acoustic waves. It has been shown that systems of coupled quantum wires can realize a complete set of quantum logic gates. However, its physical implementation is severely limited by the spreading of the wave packet and by the presence of interface roughness. Our results show that the potential of the surface acoustic wave succeeds in confining the electron wavefunction and in driving it <b>along</b> <b>the</b> channels also when interface roughness is introduced. This suggests that electron transport assisted by surface acoustic waves could be a very efficient way to realize quantum solid state devices...|$|R

The model could be used in the design stages of countersunk culvert installations to determine what proportion of the culvert cross-section will be within a swimming velocity of a fish species and age class of interest at a specific fish passage design discharge. Natural channel roughness equations were examined for application to countersunk culverts, which is a stream simulation design.

40|$|Many {{passerine}} species {{lay eggs}} that are speckled with dark protoporphyrin pigmentation. Because protoporphyrin is mainly {{derived from the}} blood, we here formulate and test a new hypothesis that links an increase in anaemia <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence to within-clutch variation in egg pigmentation. More intense pigmentation is expected if pigments accumulate during enhanced red blood cell production in response to anaemia. Reduced pigmentation is expected if pigments are derived from the degradation of red blood cells that circulate in smaller numbers due to blood loss. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated anaemia in great tit (Parus major) females by infesting the nests with hen fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae) prior to egg laying. Polychromatophil (i. e., immature red blood cells) percentage, {{as a measure of}} blood cell production, was positively correlated with parasite load confirming that female great tits experienced stronger anaemia when infested with haematophagous parasites during egg laying. We found a positive relationship between spot darkness and laying order that weakened under high parasite load. This result suggests that anaemia in females due to blood-sucking parasites led to diminished protoporphyrin from disintegrated red blood cells and hence a decreased deposition of protoporphyrin. However, the overall increase in pigment darkness <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence suggests that pigments also accumulate by enhanced red blood cell production caused by anaemia due to egg production itself...|$|R

The LASRE experiment is a flight test of a roughly 20 -percent scale model of an X- 33 forebody with a single aerospike engine at the rear. The experiment apparatus is mounted {{on top of an}} SR- 71 aircraft. This paper suggests a method for reducing base drag by adding surface <b>roughness</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> forebody. Calculations show a potential for base drag reductions of 8 to 14 percent. Flight results corroborate the base drag reduction, with actual reductions of 15 percent in the high-subsonic flight regime. An unexpected result of this experiment is that drag benefits were shown to persist well into the supersonic flight regime. Flight results show no overall net drag reduction. Applied surface roughness causes forebody pressures to rise and offset base drag reductions. Apparently the grit displaced streamlines outward, causing forebody compression. Results of the LASRE drag experiments are inconclusive and more work is needed. Clearly, however, the forebody grit application works as a viable drag reduction tool...|$|R
40|$|Rough roads {{influence}} {{the safety of}} the road users as accident rate increases with increasing unevenness of the road surface. Road roughness regions are required to be efficiently detected and located in order to ensure their maintenance. Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems provide a rapid and cost-effective alternative by providing accurate and dense point cloud data along route corridor. In this paper, an automated algorithm is presented for detecting road roughness from MLS data. The presented algorithm is based on interpolating smooth intensity raster surface from LiDAR point cloud data using point thinning process. The interpolated surface is further processed using morphological and multi-level Otsu thresholding operations to identify candidate road roughness regions. The candidate regions are finally filtered based on spatial density and standard deviation of elevation criteria to detect <b>the</b> <b>roughness</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> road surface.

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{is one of}} the key parameters {{affecting the}} surface finish quality in ultra-precision turning. As conventional surface roughness measurement is merely a statistical representation of the surface condition, it does not represent the dynamic relative movement between a workpiece and a tool.

It was found that the changes of cutting force along CD had a much higher impact on the surface generation than those along FD and TD. Based on the analysis of the spatial power spectral density (PSD), it was found that the surface generation is mostly affected by <b>the</b> tool-work vibration <b>along</b> <b>the</b> cutting trajectory. Cross-correlation of the spatial PSD and force PSD also revealed that when the depth of cut was greater than 5 mu m, more similarities were found between these two PSDs.

40|$|Abstract Background Maternal effects {{mediated}} by egg size and quality may profoundly affect offspring development and performance, and mothers may adjust egg traits according to environmental or social influences. In avian species, context-dependency of maternal effects {{may result in}} variation in egg composition, {{as well as in}} differential patterns of covariation among selected egg components, according to, for example, position in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence or offspring sex. We investigated variation in major classes of egg yolk components (carotenoids, vitamins and steroid hormones) in relation to egg size, position in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence and embryo sex in clutches of the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis). We also investigated their covariation, to highlight mutual adjustments, maternal constraints or trade-offs in egg allocation. Results Laying sequence-specific patterns of allocation emerged: concentration of carotenoids and vitamin E decreased, while concentrations of androgens increased. Vitamin A, estradiol and corticosterone did not show any change. There was no evidence of sex-specific allocation or covariation of yolk components. Concentrations of carotenoids and vitamins were positively correlated. Egg mass decreased <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence, and this decrease was negatively correlated with the mean concentrations of carotenoids in clutches, suggesting that nutritionally constrained females lay low quality clutches in terms of carotenoid content. Finally, clutches with smaller decline in antioxidants between first- and last-laid eggs had a larger increase in yolk corticosterone, suggesting that a smaller antioxidant depletion <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> sequence may entail a cost for laying females in terms of increased stress levels. Conclusions Since some of the analyzed yolk components (e. g. testosterone and lutein) are known to exert sex-specific phenotypic effects on the progeny in this species, the lack of sex-specific egg allocation by mothers may either result from trade-offs between contrasting effects of different egg components on male and female offspring, or indicate that sex-specific traits are controlled primarily by mechanisms of sexual differentiation, including endogenous hormone production or metabolism of exogenous antioxidants, during embryonic development. </p...|$|R
30|$|Examination of <b>the</b> surface <b>roughness</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> {{length of}} the SiNWs reveals the {{characteristic}} increase in porosity from the base {{to the tip of}} highly doped SiNWs fabricated with MACE [16, 19], as shown in Fig.  7 f–k (also in Additional file 1 : Figure S 8). The increase in porosity towards the tip of the SiNWs is due to the longer exposure time of these portions in the etchant solution [19]. Figure  6 f–k and Additional file 1 : Figure S 8 also show that the SiNWs are tapered, with the tapering being more severe in SiNWs which are more porous (Fig.  7 i–k and Additional file 1 : Figure S 8 a–c). This is expected considering that porosification {{is directly related to the}} amount of dissolution of the metal catalyst at the SiNW base [15, 17]. However, a closer look at the SiNWs reveals that some nanowires exhibit a slightly biconic or hourglass longitudinal profile, which seems to occur more often among those with higher porosity. Likewise, more porous SiNWs generally have larger diameters than the less porous ones (see Additional file 1 : Figure S 7). In order to achieve highly porous SiNWs with smaller diameters, it might be necessary to use a more inert catalyst like Au [32].|$|R

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the behavior of}} the flow between a slider bearing and a hard-drive magnetic disk under two types of surface roughness. For both cases the length scale of <b>the</b> <b>roughness</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> surface is small as compared to the scale of the slider, so that a homogenization of the governing equations was performed. For the case of longitudinal roughness, we derived a one-dimensional lubrication-type equation for the leading behavior of the pressure in the direction parallel to the velocity of the disk. The coefficients of the equation are determined by solving linear elliptic equations on a domain bounded by the gap height in the vertical direction and the period of the roughness in the span-wise direction. For the case of transverse roughness the unsteady lubrication equations were reduced, following a multiple scale homogenization analysis, to a steady equation for the leading behavior of the pressure in the gap. The reduced equation involves certain averages of the gap height, but retains the same form of the usual steady, compressible lubrication equations. Numerical calculations were performed for both cases, and the solution for the case of transverse roughness was shown be in excellent agreement with a corresponding numerical calculation of the original unsteady equations...|$|R

40|$|Under certain conditions, a fully {{developed}} turbulent flow {{in a straight}} pipe may show a secondary flow; for instance, when non-circular cross-section or non-uniform wall roughness {{around the perimeter of}} the duct are considered. In horizontal pipe particle-laden gas flow, the non-uniform forcing of the flow by the solids entrained in the gas core may also drive a secondary flow, even with uniform wall <b>roughness</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> circumferential direction. In this paper, the effects of wall roughness, particle size and particle mass loading ratio on the secondary flow developing in a horizontal pipe of circular cross-section under turbulent conditions are analysed. The computations are based on the Euler-Lagrange approach accounting for wall roughness and inter-particle collisions (i. e., four-way coupling). In the case of inertial particles, if inter-particle collisions are disregarded, the secondary flow consists of two recirculation cells with an upward flow near the vertical (symmetry) axis and a downward flow close to the walls. On the other hand, when inter-particle collisions are accounted for, the pattern depends on the particle concentration profile: with relatively smooth walls (low roughness), two recirculation cells are found, but with rough walls four recirculation cells are generated. For smaller particles, a transition between two and four recirculation cells in the secondary flow is observed by increasing the mass loading ratio...|$|R

Indenter {{experiments have}} been performed at 350 °C and 20 - 120 MPa during months with differential stress varying from 25 to 350 MPa. Several experimental parameters were varied: nature of quartz (synthetic or natural), nature of fluid, manner the solid/solution/solid interface was filled, orientation of the indented surfaces versus quartz crystallographic c-axis. Significant strain rates could only be obtained when using high solubility solutions (NaOH 1 mole/l). Displacement rates of the indenter were found activated by differential stress, with exponential dependence, as theoretically predicted. The mean thickness of the trapped fluid phase below the indenter was estimated in the range 2 - 10 nanometers. Moreover, the development of this trapped fluid phase was relatively fast, and allowed fluid penetration into previously dry contact regions by marginal dissolution. The indenter displacement rate was driven by differential stress and its kinetics was controlled by diffusion <b>along</b> <b>the</b> trapped fluid {{and the development of a}} morphological <b>roughness</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> interface.
