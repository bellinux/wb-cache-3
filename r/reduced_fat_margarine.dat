40|$|Dietary {{fat intake}} has {{been implicated in}} the {{causation}} of major diseases including coronary heart disease and cancer. Hence, current recommendations to improve health emphasise the reduction of fat intake (COMA, 1991). The present study investigated the effect of perceived need to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> intake and past behaviour on peoples' expectations of <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> intake, using {{the framework of the}} Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985; 1991). The effects of estimated fat intake and body weight on perceived need to reduce were also investigated. One hundred and fifty-two adults completed a four-day weighed dietary record and completed a questionnaire based on the TPB. Perceived need to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> intake, cognitive and affective components of attitude and past behaviour were found to be significant predictors of expectation of <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Perceived body weight and estimated fat intake were significant predictors of perceived need to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> intake.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} effects of free access to <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> {{products}} or their full fat equivalents on fat and energy intake, body weight, plasma lipids and fat-soluble antioxidants concentrations and haemostasis variables. Design: A multicentre open randomised controlled trial in which intervention and control groups were followed in parallel for six months. Volunteers had free access to 44 different foods either in <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> or full fat version, covering between 30 and 40 % of energy intake. The remainder of energy intake was covered by foods bought in regular shops. Setting: Zeist, Wageningen and Maastricht, The Netherlands. Subjects: Two hundred and forty-one non-obese healthy volunteers who had no intention to lose weight. Main outcome measures: Food intake, body weight, plasma lipid, vitamin E, β-carotene, lycopene and fibrinogen concentrations, plasma factor VII clotting activity, and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-I antigen level. Results: One hundred and three volunteers in the full fat group and 117 volunteers in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group completed the study. Energy and fat intake from the free access products was lower in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group, but no difference in energy and fat intake of other products occurred. Body weight, energy-, fat- and vitamin E intake and percentage of energy derived from fat decreased in the <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> group. No other statistical significant intervention effects were observed. Blood lipid concentrations, factor VII activity and plasminogen-inhibitor-activator- 1 level were reduced after consumption of <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products. Conclusions: When subjects without intention to lose weight limit fat intake by switching from ad libitum consumption of full <b>fat</b> products to <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products body weight gain is prevented, and fat and energy intake are reduced. Such a switch may have beneficial effects on biochemical cardiovascular risk factors. We concluded that <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products will help in a population strategy aimed at preventing overweight and obesity, they will also be effective in maintaining a lower body weight after slimming. Ad libitum consumption of <b>reduced</b> <b>fat</b> products will be ineffective for those individuals that want to reduce body weight because they are currently overweight or obese.

40|$|The {{majority}} of consumers refuse meat {{with higher levels}} of fat, because of possible association between high levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and heart disease. The meat production tries to fit consumers preferences with lowering fat content of meat. Such meat should also contain less cholesterol. In the following contribution the possibilities for <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> and cholesterol content and altering fatty acid composition of meat are discussed. In meat animals the estimated heritability for fat content is relatively high (between 0. 3 and 0. 6). This means that selection represents a powerful tool for fat reduction. Even better possibility for <b>reducing</b> <b>fat</b> and altering fatty acid composition is adequate nutrition. The decrease of animal age and weight at slaughter can also <b>reduce</b> carcass <b>fat</b> content. Also the use of transgenic animals and different growth stimulators represents a wide range of possibilities to <b>reduce</b> <b>fat</b> content in farm animals. ...|$|R
