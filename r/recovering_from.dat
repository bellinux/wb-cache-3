Some germanium is also <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> aluminum smelting. In previous years, indium and thallium were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> zinc smelting, but as of 2015, they were not being <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> American zinc smelters.|$|R
40|$|A fatal case of Trichosporon inkin {{prosthetic}} endocarditis is reported. The isolation {{sites and}} susceptibility profiles of 10 other isolates are also reviewed. Four strains were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> cutaneous or subcutaneous samples, four were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> urine, one was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> peritoneal liquid, {{and one was}} <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> bone.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  3, the implied WTP {{to avoid a}} minute of wait ranges between 0.59 and 0.86 Mexican pesos, while for the CV sample, it ranges from 0.33 to 0.48 Mexican pesos. The WTP <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the {{hypothetical}} survey is considerably lower than the one <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> true choices. While we cannot reject {{the hypothesis that the}} WTP <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the field differs significantly <b>from</b> that <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the CV exercise, taking the results from column 2, we can reject the hypotheses that individuals respond similarly to price and announced waiting time in a hypothetical setting and when facing true choices. The results then cast doubt on the validity of WTP measures <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> hypothetical choices.|$|R

5|$|After <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> his hip surgery, Costello {{returned}} to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living.

40|$|Emergence and {{distribution}} of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria in environments pose a risk to human and animal health. A total of 82 isolates of Escherichia spp. were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> cloacal swabs of migrating and non-migrating wild birds. All bacterial isolates were identified and characterized morphologically and biochemically. 72 % and 50 % of isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating and migrating birds, respectively, showed positive congo red dye binding (a virulence factor). Also, hemolysin production (a virulence factor) was showed in 8 % of isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating birds and 75 % of isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> migrating birds. All isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating birds were found resistant to Oxacillin while all isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> migrating birds demonstrated resistance to Oxacillin, Chloramphenicol, Oxytetracycline and Lincomycin. Some bacterial isolates <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> non-migrating birds and migrating birds exhibited MDR phenotype. The MDR isolates were further characterized by API 20 E and 16 S rRNA as E. coli and E. vulneris. MDR Escherichia isolates contain ~ 1 - 5 plasmids of high-molecular weights. Accordingly, wild birds could create a potential threat to human and animal health by transmitting MDR bacteria to water streams and other environmental sources through their faecal residues, and to remote regions by migration...|$|R
40|$|An {{isolated}} pterosaurian caudal cervical (~ postcervical) vertebra was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the Upper Cretaceous Lapurr sandstone ofWest Turkana, northwestern Kenya. The vertebral centrum is short, wide, and dorsoventrally compressed. Although {{the specimen}} is lightly built similar to most pterosaurs, {{it is here}} referred to Pterodactyloidea and tentatively to the Azhdarchidae in that it lacks pneumatic features on both the centrum and neural arch. This {{represents one of the}} few pterosaurs <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the entirety of Afro-Arabia, the first pterosaur <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> the Cretaceous of East Africa, and, significantly, a specimen that was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> fluvial deposits rather than the near-shore marine setting typical of most pterosaur discoveries...|$|R
