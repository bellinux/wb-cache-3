5000|$|The seventh commandment forbids {{unjustly}} taking or {{keeping the}} goods of one's neighbor and wronging {{him in any}} way with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity {{in the care of}} earthly goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good, it requires respect for the universal destination of goodsand respect for the right to private property. Catechism of the Catholic Church Catholic teaching states that in economic matters, respect for human dignity requires practicing temperance, a virtue that moderates attachment to worldly goods; justice, a virtue that preserves our neighbors rights and renders what is due; and solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule. [...] Even if it does not contradict explicit provisions of civil law, any form of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another. The following are also considered morally illicit: speculation in which one contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation.In addition, Catholic teaching demands that contracts and promises be strictly observed. Injustices require restitution to the owner. Promises must be kept and contracts strictly observed {{to the extent that the}} commitments made in them are morally just. A significant part of economic and social life depends on the honoring of contracts between physical or moral persons - commercial contracts of purchase or sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts must be agreed to and executed in good faith. Contracts are subject to commutative justice which regulates exchanges between persons and between institutions in accordance with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice obliges strictly; it requires safeguarding property rights, paying debts, and fulfilling obligations freely contracted. Without commutative justice, no other form of justice is possible. Catechism of the Catholic Church Catholic teaching reminds that Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them [...] "renounce all that have" [...] for his sake and that of the Gospel. Jesus gave his disciples the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who gave out of her poverty all that she had to live on. [...] Detachment from riches is portrayed as obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven. [...] "Blessed are the poor in spirit" [...] represents the expectation that those who do not receive all their physical longings are more inclined to seek fulfillment of their spiritual longings through Jesus Christ. “The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their consolation in the abundance of goods.”"I want to see God" [...] expresses the true desire of man. The water of eternal life quenches the thirst for God. [...] Attachment to the goods of this world are a bondage. The Scriptural remedy is the desire for true happiness that is found in seeking and finding God. Holy people must struggle, with grace from on high, to obtain the good things God promises. Faithful Christians put to death their cravings and, with the grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power.

40|$|An in situ {{hybridization}} technique has been developed {{for the detection of}} immunoglobulin light chain mRNA in routine pathology specimens. The method detects kappa or lambda constant region sequences using a cocktail of synthetic oligonucleotide probes labelled with biotin or fluorescein 5 -isothiocyanate (FITC) reporter molecules. The probes were labelled at flanking sites chemically by primary amine directed acylation and by 'homopolymer tailing' with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase using non-radioactive nucleotide analogues. The mRNA was unmasked in the formalin-fixed tissue sections by digestion with varying concentrations of proteinase K, and the hybrids were demonstrated using alkaline phosphatase with either a streptavidin/biotin based four-stage system or an anti-FITC antibody based detection system. Alkaline phosphatase was visualized using a Fast Red naphthol-capture method and the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. The results confirm that the method is specific for kappa or lambda mRNA and show that specific mRNAs can be detected in routine formalin-fixed sections using non-radioactive techniques with <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> morphology.

40|$|A new high-temperature-strength, high-conductivity Cu-Cr-Nb alloy with a CrNb {{ratio of}} 2 : 1 was {{developed}} to achieve improved performance and durability. The Cu- 8 Cr 4 Nb alloy studied has demonstrated remarkable thermal and microstructural stability after long exposures at temperatures up to 0. 98 T(sub m). This stability was mainly attributed to the slow coarsening kinetics of the Cr 2 Nb precipitates present in the alloy. At all temperatures, the microstructure consists of a bimodal and sometimes trimodal distribution of strengthening Cr 2 Nb precipitates, depending on precipitation condition, i. e. from liquid or solid solution, and cooling rates. These precipitates remain in the same size range, i. e. large precipitates of approximately I pm, and small precipitates less dm 300 nm, and effectively pin the grain boundaries thus retaining a fine grain size of 2. 7 micro-m after 100 h at 1323 K. (A {{relatively small number of}} Cr-rich and Nb-rich particles were also present.) This grain boundary pinning and sluggish coarsening of Cr 2 Nb particles explain the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> mechanical properties after prolonged holding at very high temperatures, e. g., 75 % of the original hardness after aging for 100 h at 1273 K.

Patients were followed {{for a minimum of}} 4 years with an average duration of follow-up of 7. 1 years. Loss of central vision, defined by permanent reduction of visual acuity to {{less than or equal to}} 20 / 200, occurred with equal frequency in eyes treated medically (15. 8 %) or surgically (13. 6 %) for glaucoma. Sudden loss of central vision also occurred following cataract extraction (8. 7 %). No patient lost central vision suddenly following surgery when central vision was spared at the time of operation. In addition, all cases that eventually lost central vision, either medically or surgically, demonstrated field defects which split fixation prior to its loss. Loss of central vision is seen rarely when medical therapy maintains the average intraocular pressure below 18 mm Hg, but increases markedly with higher pressures, reaching approximately 30 % when average intraocular pressure is above 22 mm Hg. Progression in field loss is rare after successful glaucoma surgery, although cataracts develop in about 32 % of such eyes. Cataracts also develop in 21 % of medically treated eyes. In addition, about 50 % of unoperated eyes demonstrate further field loss even when central vision is maintained.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{tropical}} {{countries like}} Nigeria, egg preservation {{is a serious}} problem. The common practice is to store under ambient condition {{due to lack of}} refrigeration facilities and erratic power supply. Four crates of fresh table eggs were bought from the University of Agriculture, Makurdi farm and preliminary investigations of egg weights, Haugh unit, pH and yolk index were carried out before storage and found to be within standard. Thirty eggs were stored under ambient condition with and without application of oil respectively. The other group of thirty eggs was refrigerated. The initial weights were in the range of 60 – 69 g which reduced drastically. All other quality indices like the Haugh unit, the yolk index and pH declined drastically within the four weeks of the storage especially those that were stored under the ambient conditions. Those stored under refrigeration and those that were oiled and stored under ambient conditions (32 + 2 °C) maintained high quality standards in all the quality indices evaluated. The microbiological result also showed higher bacteria, yeast and mould count on those stored under ambient condition with the initial count of 5. 0 × 103 at first week and 2. 8 × 107 at the fourth week while the oiled and refrigerated eggs had values of 5. 0 × 103 at week zero and 7. 2 × 104 at week four of storage respectively.

Whereas best corrected visual acuity was 20 / 100 or better in over half the patients 1 - 2 months after operation, there was a distressing decrease in acuity by 6  months, owing {{to a variety of}} factors. Patients operated on before macular detachment did not have significantly better postoperative vision than those operated within a week after macular detachment. Almost all patients who had already lost vision in the fellow eye and many who had cytomegalovirus retinitis in the fellow eye with <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> vision had their quality of life improved by the surgery in that the operated eye eventually became the better seeing eye. In no patient whose fellow eye was normal and free of retinitis, however, did the operated eye ever become the better eye.  CONCLUSIONS—Although the majority of patients recovered macular vision in the first 1 - 2 months after operation, there was a gradual decline in acuity thereafter, sometimes without obvious cause. The results of this series suggest that it may be reasonable to postpone surgery until the macula detaches and that patients whose fellow eye is free of retinitis with normal vision are unlikely to have their quality of life improved significantly by the surgery. ...|$|R

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify the factors influencing visual acuity after 163 completed local resections for choroidal melanoma in patients with a preoperative visual acuity of counting fingers or better. The variables included in the analyses were patient age and sex; eye laterality and preoperative visual acuity; location of anterior and posterior tumour margins; tumour location (coronal and sagittal); tumour diameter, thickness, and cell type; ocular decompression by vitrectomy; and adequacy of surgical clearance. The surgical resections were performed using a lamellar scleral flap for eye closure, hypotensive anaesthesia for haemostasis, and, in the later years, ocular decompression by pars plana vitrectomy to improve access. The patients (94 men, 69 women) had {{a mean age of}} 50 years. The tumours had a mean diameter of 13. 3 mm and a mean thickness of 7. 4 mm, with 38 tumours extending to within 1 disc diameter (DD) of the optic disc, fovea or both (that is, 'posterior tumour extension'). Cox multivariate analysis showed that the most significant preoperative factors for predicting <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> vision (6 / 12 or better) were nasal tumour location (p = 0. 002) and distance of more than 1 DD between the tumour and the optic disc or fovea (p = 0. 010). The most significant predictive risk factor for severe visual loss (hand movements or worse) was posterior tumour extension to within 1 DD of the optic disc and/or fovea (p = 0. 009). One year post-operatively, all 28 patients with nasal tumours not extending to within 1 DD of the optic disc or fovea retained the eye with 57 % having vision of 6 / 12 or better and 93 % having vision of counting fingers or better. In 68 patients with temporal tumours, 90 % retained the eye at 1 year with preservation of vision of counting fingers or better in 82 % of 56 eyes without posterior tumours extension and in 50 % of 12 eyes with posterior tumour extension.

Techniques such as sediment trend analysis and sediment tracing using fluorescent sands are well established for the silt and sand fraction but are unsuitable for clay sediments due to their cohesive nature. Geochemically labelled clays have been used as fine sediment tracers in freshwater nvironments with some success, although little is known about their chemical or physical behaviour once released in saline environments. A number of pure clays and natural estuarine sediments were labelled with La following agitation in a 0. 01 M solution of La CI 3. In order to examine the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> La on the clay mineral surface the labelled sediment was washed sequentially four times using both de-ionised water and artificial seawater. A labelled bentonite retained 43000 gg g-i La and this was only reduced to 36000 gg g-l La after washing in seawater. This suggests that <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> La is <b>good</b> even in saline conditions and concentrations of La are hig...|$|R
40|$|Social norms {{have been}} claimed to {{influence}} customer retention when {{the social network}} the customer engages with {{is well aware of}} a customer’s use of the product or service. This research investigates whether social norms will also influence customer retention for services that are used so infrequently that the social network the customer engages with is not aware that the customer has the product or service. The specific services investigated are also impacted {{by the fact that the}} customers themselves are not entirely certain as to their individual need of the product, namely credence <b>goods.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this research is to provide a profile of a customer that would be more influenced by social norms; which knowledge would allow organisations to target specific customers. Using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, hypotheses were tested by analysing questionnaire feedback data on 100 active insurance customers and 100 inactive insurance customers from within the South African financial services market. Empirical support for the effect of social norms on customer <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> credence <b>goods</b> is found. Empirical proof that females are more influenced by social norms than males was found as well as the link between culture value orientation to social norms. In this research a link between a customer’s age to social norm influence was not found.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic pseudophacocele. Methods: In this retrospective, interventional case series, scleral wound repair with pars plana vitrectomy and glued intrascleral fixation of an intraocular lens (glued IOL) was performed in 5 eyes of 5 patients. Pupilloplasty was performed in 3 cases whereas aniridia glued IOL fixation was done in 1 case that had total avulsion and loss of iris tissue. The main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraoperative and postoperative complications during the entire follow-up period. Results: The preoperative vision ranged from hand movement to perception of light in all the patients. The mean postoperative BCVA was 0. 42 ± 0. 21 Snellen's decimal equivalent (SDE) at final follow-up. Postoperatively, all the cases retained good visual acuity with case 1 and case 2 reporting 0. 5 SDE, case 3 had 0. 33 SDE, case 5 had 0. 67 SDE whereas case 4 had a final visual acuity limited to 0. 1 SDE due to associated corneal opacity. The mean follow-up period was 20. 2 ± 11. 7 months (range from 9 months to 36 months). The IOL was well centered, all the wounds were well apposed and the mean postoperative intraocular pressure was 14. 6 ± 1. 95 mm Hg. No complications were reported in the entire follow-up period. Conclusion: The clinical outcomes of management of pseudophacocele were encouraging with <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> reasonably <b>good</b> visual potential in all cases...|$|R

40|$|While {{the desire}} for limited {{liability}} has played its part in increasing {{the use of the}} corporate device among the smaller industrial units, it alone is not responsible for such extensive use of the corporation among the larger industrial units. A primary factor there has been absentee ownership, attendant on the wide distribution of securities. The corporate device has lent itself peculiarly well to the public marketing of securities and to the evolution of a management structure in which the so-called owners play insignificant roles. The factor of limited liability has not been unimportant. It merely has not been paramount. The same can be said for the evolution that has taken place within the business units using the corporate form. Recent years especially have seen an increasing use of the subsidiary- parent structure. The farthest point along this line of evolution has been reached in the public utility field. But other businesses have adopted it and used it extensively. The reasons for the use of this structure are manifold. The increased facility in financing; the desire to escape the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of qualifying the parent company as a foreign corporation in a particular state; the avoidance of complications involved in the purchase of physical assets: the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good</b> will <b>of</b> an established business unit; the avoidance of taxation; the avoidance of cumbersome management structures; {{the desire for}} limited liability, are among the primary motives. The desire for limited liability has been merely one among many factors. And at times it has appeared to reced...|$|R
