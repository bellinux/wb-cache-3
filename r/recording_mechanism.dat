Recording with p-polarized light is much more efficient than with s-polarized light. Introduction of Si atoms in organic glass molecules can improve the recording efficiency.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to examine the}} {{properties}} of <b>recording</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which are common to continuously recording high-resolution natural systems in which climatic signals are imprinted and preserved as proxy records. These systems produce seasonal structures as an indirect response to climatic variability over the annual cycle. We compare the proxy records from four different high-resolution systems: the Quelccaya ice cap of the Peruvian Andes; composite tree ring growth from southern California and the southwestern United States; and the marine varve sedimentation systems in the Santa Barbara basin (off California, United States) and in the Gulf of California, Mexico. An important focus of this work is to indicate how the interannual climatic signal is recorded in a variety of different natural systems with vastly different <b>recording</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and widely separated in space. These high-resolution records are the products of natural processes which should be comparable, to some degree, to human-engineered systems developed to transmit and record physical quantities. We therefore present a simple analogy of a data recording system as a heuristic model to provide some unifying concepts with which we may better understand the formation of the records. This analogy assumes special significance when we consider that natural proxy records are the principal means to extend our knowledge of climatic variability into the past, beyond the limits of instrumentally recorded data. ...|$|R

5000|$|Star {{trackers}} were {{an important}} part of early long-range ballistic missiles, in the era when inertial navigation systems (INS) were not sufficiently accurate for intercontinental ranges. Selecting a guide star depends on the time, due to the Earth's rotation, and the location of the target. Generally, a selection of several bright stars would be used. For pure star tracking systems, some sort of <b>recording</b> <b>mechanism,</b> typically a magnetic tape, was pre-recorded with a signal that represented the angle of the star over the period of a day, and at launch, the tape was forwarded to the appropriate time. During the flight, the signal on the tape was used to roughly position a telescope so it would point at the expected position of the star. At the telescope's focus was a photocell and some sort of signal-generator, typically a spinning disk known as a chopper. The chopper caused the star to repeatedly appear and disappear on the photocell, a signal that was then smoothed to produce an alternating current output. The phase of that signal was compared to the one on the tape to produce a guidance signal. The system could be further improved by combining it with an INS, in which case additional circuitry on the INS generated the reference signal, eliminating the need for the separate tape. These [...] "stellar inertial" [...] were especially common from the 1950s through the 1980s, although some systems use it to this day.|$|E
