40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The goal of {{the project}} was to develop a {{functional}} prototype of an environmental risk assessment parameter database on the World-Wide Web. The ability to develop a consolidated environmental database has become possible due to the phenomenal growth of the Internet and the World-Wide Web over the past few years. A large number of environmental resources do currently exist; however, with the large volume of information available, access, management, reliability, and retrievability have become increasingly difficult. To illustrate the prototype database, a practical environmental concern and the tools necessary to evaluate and characterize that concern were needed. Uranium (²³⁸U) daughters leaching from abandoned mill tailing piles at three abandoned uranium mines in southwestern Colorado were chosen to demonstrate the database concept. The RESRAD environmental pathway modeling code served as the evaluation and characterization tool. Due to the size and complexity of RESRAD, a single radionuclide release rate equation was isolated as a controllable component of the code. The equation was {{a small part of the}} water pathway factor and examined the rate at which <b>radionuclides</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> soil were leached by infiltrating water. This serves as the source term for groundwater contamination and directly applies to the ²³⁸U progeny leaching from mill tailing piles scenario. Parameters selected from the equation dealt with the background data that directly influenced the mobility of contaminates in the environment. Environmental data for the three Colorado sites were gathered and interpreted. Probability Density Functions (PDFs) were developed for input parameters and the results were then incorporated into the web site...|$|R

50|$|The mass average can be {{important}} in evaluating the risks of radiotherapy treatments, since {{they are designed to}} target very specific volumes in the body, typically a tumour. For example, if 10% of a patient's bone marrow mass is irradiated with 10 Gy of radiation locally, then the <b>absorbed</b> dose <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow overall would be 1 Gy. Bone marrow makes up 4% of the body mass, so the whole-body absorbed dose would be 0.04 Gy. The first figure (10 Gy) is indicative of the local effects on the tumour, while the second and third figure (1 Gy and 0.04 Gy) are better indicators of the overall health effects on the whole organism. Additional dosimetry calculations would have to be performed on these figures to arrive at a meaningful effective dose, which is needed to estimate the risk of cancer or other stochastic effects.|$|R

For this reason, the interaction of 137 Cs and 90 Sr with soil sample has been examined. The study performed at trace concentration (~ 10 - 8 M) of CsCl and SrCl 2, and batch method was used. NaCl has been selected {{as a representative of the}} ionic strength with 0. 1; 0. 5 and 1. 0 M concentrations. Concentration of 10 - 8 ~ 10 - 4 M CsCl and SrCl 2 were used for study the effect of Cs and Sr concentrations in solution. Apparent distribution coefficient was used to predict the sorption behavior. The sorption equilibrium of 137 Cs and 90 Sr into soil was attained after 5 days contacted with Kd value around 3300 - 4200 mL/g, where Kd was defined as the ratio of number of <b>radionuclide</b> activity <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> solid phase per-unit mass to the number of radionuclide activity remains is solution per-unit volume. Presence of NaCl as background salt in the solution affected Kd values due to competition among metal ions into soil samples.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the suitability of several detectors for the determination of <b>absorbed</b> dose <b>in</b> bone.; Methods: Three types of ultrathin LiF-based thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) two LiF:Mg,Cu,P-based (MCP-Ns and TLD- 2000 F) and a Li- 7 -enriched LiF:Mg,Ti-based (MTS- 7 s) -as well as EBT 2 Gafchromic films were used to measure percentage depth-dose distributions (PDDs) in a water-equivalent phantom with a bone-equivalent heterogeneity for 6 and 18 MV and a set of field sizes ranging from 5 x 5 cm(2) to 20 x 20 cm(2). MCP-Ns, TLD- 2000 F, MTS- 7 s, and EBT 2 have active layers of 50, 20, 50, and 30 mu m, respectively. Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations (PENELOPE code) were used as the reference and helped to understand the experimental results and to evaluate the potential perturbation of the fluence <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> caused by the presence of the detectors. The energy dependence and linearity of the TLDs' response was evaluated.; Results: TLDs exhibited flat energy responses (within 2. 5 %) and linearity with dose (within 1. 1 %) within the range of interest for the selected beams. The results revealed that all considered detectors perturb the electron fluence with respect to the energy inside the bone-equivalent material. MCP-Ns and MTS- 7 s underestimated the <b>absorbed</b> dose <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> by 4 %- 5 %. EBT 2 exhibited comparable accuracy to MTS- 7 s and MCP-Ns. TLD- 2000 F was able to determine the dose within 2 % accuracy. No dependence on the beam energy or field size was observed.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{study for}} pain relief therapy with 188 Re-HEDP was done <b>in</b> {{patients}} with <b>bone</b> metastases secondary to breast and prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Patients received 1. 3 or 2. 2 GBq, in single or multiple doses. Platelets, {{white and red}} cells were evaluated during 11 weeks. Pharmacokinetic characterization was done from blood and urine samples for 5 patients along 24 hours. Urinary excretion was evaluated in other 16 patients during 6 hours. Bone uptake was estimated as remaining activity in whole body. Scintigraphic images were acquired at 2 and 24 hs post-administration. <b>Absorbed</b> dose <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow was estimated with Mirdose 3. Analgesics intake and pain score were daily recorded. Tumour markers (PSA, and Tn-structure) were monitored in 9 patients during 4 to 6 months. Single doses of low activity (1. 3 GBq) were given to twelve patients. Nine patients received multiple doses. Results All except one patient had normal levels of platelets, white and red cells. Remaining dose in blood at 2 hours was 9 %. Urinary elimination was 58 %. Bone uptake at 24 hours was 43 % (mean value; n = 5). No changes of the haematological parameters were detected along follow-up period. Pain relief was evidenced by decrease or supression of opioid analgesic and by subjective index. PSA showed a decrease in prostate cancer patients (n = 4). Tn-structure showed a significant increase after 4 to 8 months.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve {{outcomes}} for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we conducted a phase 1 / 2 study in which targeted irradiation delivered by 131 I–anti-CD 45 antibody was combined with targeted busulfan (BU; area-under-curve, 600 - 900 ng/mL) and cyclophosphamide (CY; 120 mg/kg). Fifty-two (88 %) of 59 patients receiving a trace 131 I-labeled dose of 0. 5 mg/kg anti-CD 45 murine antibody had higher estimated <b>absorbed</b> radiation <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow and spleen {{than in any other}} organ. Forty-six patients were treated with 102 to 298 mCi (3774 - 11 026 MBq) 131 I, delivering an estimated 5. 3 to 19 (mean, 11. 3) Gy to marrow, 17 - 72 (mean, 29. 7) Gy to spleen, and 3. 5 Gy (n = 4) to 5. 25 Gy (n = 42) to the liver. The estimated 3 -year nonrelapse mortality and disease-free survival (DFS) were 21 % and 61 %, respectively. These results were compared with those from 509 similar International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry patients who underwent transplantation using BU/CY alone. After adjusting for differences in age and cytogenetics risk, the hazard of mortality among all antibody-treated patients was 0. 65 times that of the Registry patients (95 % CI 0. 39 - 1. 08; P =. 09).

40|$|Purpose: Adequate {{dosimetry}} {{is mandatory}} for effective and safe peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Besides the kidneys, {{the bone marrow}} is a potentially dose-limiting organ. The radiation dose to the bone marrow is usually calculated according to the MIRD scheme, where the accumulated activity <b>in</b> the <b>bone</b> marrow is calculated from the accumulated radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical in the blood. This may underestimate the absorbed dose since stem cells express somatostatin receptors. We verified the blood-based method by comparing the activity in the blood with the radioactivity <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow aspirates. Also, we evaluated the absorbed cross-dose from the source organs (liver, spleen, kidneys and blood), tumours and the so-called "remainder of the body" to the bone marrow. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates were drawn in 15 patients after treatment with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate. Radioactivity <b>in</b> the <b>bone</b> marrow was compared with radioactivity in the blood drawn simultaneously. The nucleated cell fraction was isolated from the bone marrow aspirate and radioactivity was measured. The absorbed dose to the bone marrow was calculated. The results were correlated to the change in platelet counts 6 weeks after treatment. Results: A strong linear correlation and high agreement between the measured radioactivities <b>in</b> the <b>bone</b> marrow aspirates and in the blood was found (r= 0. 914, p< 0. 001). No correlation between the calculated <b>absorbed</b> dose <b>in</b> the <b>bone</b> marrow and the change in platelets was found. There was a considerable contribution from other organs and {{the remainder of the}} body to the bone marrow absorbed dose. Conclusion: (1) After PRRT with [177 Lu-DOTA 0,Tyr 3]octreotate, the radioactivity concentration <b>in</b> the <b>bone</b> marrow is identical to that in the blood; (2) There is no significant binding of the radiopharmaceutical to bone marrow precursor stem cells; (3) The contribution of the cross dose from source organs and tumours to the bone marrow dose is significant; and (4) There is considerable variation <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow <b>absorbed</b> dose between patients. These findings imply that for individual dose optimization, individual calculation of the bone marrow absorbed dose is necessary...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{method for}} red marrow {{dosimetry}} in radioimmunotherapy, {{in the absence}} of specific activity uptake in red marrow, is based on the activity measured in the blood or plasma. The activity concentration ratio of red marrow to blood is then assumed to be constant. The aim of the current study was to determine whether this ratio varies with time after injection. METHODS: Measurements were carried out with both animals and patients. Tumor-bearing rats were intravenously injected with iodine- 131 -, iodine- 125 -, indium- 111 -, or rhenium- 188 -labeled BR 96, a chimeric immunoglobulin G 1 monoclonal antibody. (All were chelate-labeled, except for iodine- 131, which was iodogen-labeled.) Measurements were made of the activity concentration <b>in</b> blood and <b>bone</b> marrow at different points in time after injection, and the ratio of activity concentration in red marrow and blood as a function of time postinjection (RMBLR[t) ]) was calculated. For patients treated with iodine- 131 -labeled monoclonal antibody (LL 2, Immunomedics Inc., Morris Plains, NJ; anti-CD 22; immunoglobulin G 2 isotype of mouse origin), blood samples were drawn and scintillation camera images taken at different times after injection. The red marrow activity concentration in the sacrum was determined by activity quantification from regions of interest. The activity concentration in blood was also measured. The RMBLR(t) was calculated based on these data. RESULTS: For both patients and rats, the RMBLR(t) was increased 72 hours after injection. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} use of a constant RMBLR can lead to an over- or underestimation of the <b>absorbed</b> dose <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the difficulty in using fixed values of the activity concentration ratio of red marrow to blood for dosimetry...|$|R

Measurements of radiation and the operation of radiation detectors are based on the radiation interactions with matter and the theory governing these interactions has been discussed. Various techniques for localising pure beta- and photon-emitting radionuclides situated inside attenuating media have been suggested on a theoretical basis, and have been experimentally shown to work successfully. Most of the work is on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The theory of mathematical reconstruction of a two dimensional distribution from its projections is discussed and reconstruction techniques and their relative merits and demerits have been reviewed. SPECT seeks the determination of absolute regional radionuclide concentrations as a function of time. A SPECT system has been developed by modifying an existing transmission CT scanner and the reconstruction algorithms. The performance of the SPECT system has been tested for a number of point sources and various extended sources in gas, liquid and solid forms. The SPECT scanner in its present design is capable of performing in both the transmission and emission modes. The characteristics of the SPECT scanner, including the detector efficiency, spatial resolution and the effect of collimator size, have been studied experimentally. The major problems faced by SPECT include the solid angle effect, which influences the collection efficiency, in scattered radiation, and attenuation of photons inside the surrounding medium. These problems together with their various possible solutions have been discussed in detail. Methods for compensation for solid angle variation, in scattered radiation and photon attenuation have been devised and used successfully to compensate the projection data...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The field of nuclear medicine has reached advanced stages in the use of radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment and diagnosis of innumerable maladies. However, along with the use of nuclear medicine come responsibilities inherently {{associated with the use of}} radioactive material. It is necessary to be able to calculate doses <b>in</b> the trabecular <b>bone</b> region accurately and consistently. The accurate assessment of patient dose will allow physicians to better predict the amounts of radioactivity needed for specific diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Additionally, improved calculational techniques for bone dosimetry will decrease the likelihood of overadministrations and will allow for reliable predictions of side-effects to patients. The dosimetry of this region is therefore a very important, and unfortunately complicated, area associated with the field of nuclear medicine. A new dosimetric trabecular bone model has been developed and incorporated into a Monte Carlo radiation transport code to determine electron <b>absorbed</b> fractions <b>in</b> red <b>bone</b> marrow and the endosteal tissue which is contained <b>in</b> trabecular <b>bone.</b> The model is based on measured omnidirectional chord length distributions through trabeculae and marrow cavities in nine skeletal locations.

Pu activity concentrations were measured in Macropus rufus (red kangaroo), Oryctolagus cuniculus (European rabbit), and Pseudomys hermannsburgensis (sandy inland mouse) inhabiting the relatively undisturbed, semi-arid conditions at the former Taranaki weapons test site at Maralinga, Australia. Of the absorbed Pu (distributed via circulatory and lymph systems) accumulation was foremost <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> (83 % ± 10 % SD), followed by muscle (9 % ± 10 %), liver (7 % ± 7 %), kidneys (0. 5 % ± 0. 3 %), and heart (0. 4 % ± 0. 4 %). The bone values are higher than those reported in ICRP 19 and 48 (45 - 50 % bone), while the liver values are lower than ICRP values (30 - 45 % liver). The ICRP values were based on data dominated by relatively soluble forms of Pu, including prepared solutions and single-atom ions produced by decay following the volatilisation of uranium during nuclear detonation (fallout Pu, ICRP 1986). In contrast, the Maralinga data relates to low-soluble forms of Pu used in tests designed to simulate accidental release and dispersal. We measured Pu in lung, GI-tract and the skin and fur as distinct from the <b>absorbed</b> Pu <b>in</b> <b>bone,</b> liver, muscle, and kidneys. Compared with the mean absorbed activity concentrations, the results for lung tissues were higher by up to one order of magnitude, {{and those in the}} GI tract contents and the washed skin/fur were higher by more than two orders of magnitude. These elevated levels are consistent with the presence of low-soluble Pu, including particulate forms, which pass through, or adhere upon, certain organs, but are not readily absorbed into the bloodstream. This more transitory Pu can provide dose to the lung and GI tract organs, as well as provide potential transfer of contamination when consumed in predator-prey food chains, or during human foodstuff consumption. For example, activity concentrations in O. cuniculus edible samples prepared according to traditional aboriginal methods were more than two orders of magnitude higher than in muscle alone. The increase was due to inclusion of GI tract components and contents in the traditional method. Our results provide new insights into the sequestration of Pu in mammalian tissues under environmental exposure conditions. These results contrast with those related to the specific forms of Pu and exposure conditions upon which the ICRP models were based. However, they provide data relevant to the assessment of key environmental legacy waste sites, and of potential release scenarios for the low-soluble oxide forms in the growing worldwide inventory of Pu associated with power production.

Patients with RA {{were found to}} have a raised OKT 4 / 8 ratio both <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow and peripheral blood in comparison with the controls. Furthermore, bone marrow of RA showed a lower percentage of OKT 8 + T cells than that of controls. The percentage of HLA-DR+ T cells was higher <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow than <b>in</b> peripheral blood of RA, though a slightly lower percentage was detected <b>in</b> <b>bone</b> marrow than <b>in</b> peripheral blood of controls.
