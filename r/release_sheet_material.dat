40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming (SMF) of {{materials}} such as stainless steels {{there is a major}} problem with transfer and accumulation of <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> to the metal forming tool surface. The problem is known as galling; a kind of severe adhesive wear, which results in severe scratching of produced parts. In this thesis, galling observed in contacts between tool steels and stainless steel sheets under lubricated sliding conditions was studied, focusing on the early stage of galling. It was found that changes in friction cannot be used as galling indicator in the early stage of galling because transfer and accumulation of <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> happens even though friction is low and stable. The progression of galling is influenced by tool steel damage occurring around the tool steel hard phases caused by <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> flow, which results in formation of wear-induced galling initiation sites. A correlation between the critical contact pressure to galling and <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> proof stress was found. Galling happened at lower pressures for <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> with lower proof stress possibly due to easier <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> flow, resulting in quicker tool damage. Material transfer and tool steel damage were delayed for tool steels comprising homogenously distributed, small and high hard phases. Additionally, the galling resistance was higher for tool steels with higher hardness due to decreased tool steel damage. In a comparison between observations of the worn tool surfaces after wear tests and calculations in FEM it was found that material transfer did not take place at regions with highest contact pressures but at regions with highest plastic strains. The results obtained in this thesis indicate that tool steel damage and <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> flow occurring in the contact during sliding are important factors influencing galling...|$|R

40|$|A study {{examining}} {{the effect of}} specimen configuration on the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted, multi-layer joints in aluminium alloys was conducted. It has observed that the specimen configuration {{had a significant effect}} on the strength and failure mechanism of a self-piercing riveted multi-layer joint. During shear testing, when secondary bending was present interlock failure was observed, while in the absence of secondary bending, <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> failure occurred. Interlock and <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> failure modes were also observed in T-peel tests, where depending on the configuration, either substrate failure led to peeling the top sheet away from the rivet head, or interlock failure resulted in pulling the rivet out of the bottom sheet. In the cases where the <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> failed, an increase in <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> strength led to an increase in joint strength. Under identical setting conditions, joints with double shear and no secondary bending effect exhibited significantly higher shear strength and more energy absorption than joints in single shear.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming (SMF) of {{materials}} such as stainless steels {{there is a major}} problem with transfer and accumulation of <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> to the metal forming tool surface. The problem is known as galling; a sort of severe adhesive wear, which results in severe scratching of produced parts. In this thesis, the overall aim was to gain knowledge of the influence of tool steel microstructure on galling initiation under sliding conditions. It was discovered that material transfer and tool steel damage caused by <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> flow creating wear-induced galling initiation sites occurred in the early stage of galling. The galling resistance was higher for tool steels with higher matrix hardness due to better resistance to tool steel damage. Initial friction and critical contact pressure to galling was influenced by the strength of the <b>sheet</b> <b>material.</b> Material transfer happened at low pressures and the friction value was high in a case of <b>sheet</b> <b>materials</b> with lower proof strength, possibly due to the sheet contact against the tool steel matrix resulting in high adhesion and quicker tool damage. It was demonstrated that, in addition to hardness of the tool steel matrix and <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> proof strength, tool steel microstructural features like size, shape, distribution and height of hard phases are important parameters influencing galling. Tool steels comprising homogeneously distributed, small and high hard phases better prevented the contact between <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> and the tool steel matrix. Thus, a metal to metal contact with high friction was more efficiently avoided, which resulted in better tool performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} is a {{manufacturing}} method used {{because of its}} versatility. Sheets are plastically deformed by a tool to create a product. A tool is expected to last for several 100, 000 forming operations and efforts are made to optimize the tools. A common type of wear referred to as galling is the adhesion of <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> to the tools. This problem has become more prevalent as new high strength <b>sheet</b> <b>materials</b> have been developed {{at the same time}} as lubricants have become heavily regulated. This has forced the development of new tool steels with improved resistance to galling. There are many parameters influencing the response to galling. In this work the influence of surface preparation, contact geometry, material selection and lubrication has been investigated. The surface of the forming tools has a large influence on the tools effective life. To refurbish a forming tool is expensive and often requires special shops and hand polishing. The influence on galling of different surface preparations suited for sheet metal forming was investigated using a strip-reduction equipment. The contact conditions of a tool sliding against metal sheets were investigated using FE models. The contact conditions were calculated for a U-bending test and for a sliding-on-flat-surface wear tester. The results were compared to those found in literature. One model incorporated the surface roughness of a sheet as measured by optical profilometry. The strength of the interface between the tool and the <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> determine if material can be transferred onto the tool. The interface between the tool and adhered <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> was closely studied using transmission electron microscopy of thin lamellas produced by focused ion beam milling. This showed <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> adhering to the tool without the formation of an interlayer. Finally, several different combinations of tool steels and <b>sheet</b> <b>materials</b> were tested with regards to their ability to withstand galling. Baksidestext: Sheet metal forming can be used to produce a wide range of products but the initial costs are high as the forming tools are expensive. Wear of the tools in the form of galling i. e. the adhesion of tiny pieces of <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> to the tools has become more prevalent as high strength <b>sheet</b> <b>materials</b> have been developed and lubricants have become heavily regulated. In this work the influence on galling of surface preparation, contact geometry, material selection and lubrication has been investigated. It was found that tool surfaces should be polished as rougher surfaces quickly picked up material that adhered to the tools and subsequently scratched the sheets. The strength of the interface between the tool and the <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> determine if material can be transferred onto the tool. The interface was studied using bright field transmission electron microscopy and the <b>sheet</b> <b>material</b> was found to adhere to the tool without the formation of an interlayer. The conditions under which galling occurs were studied using a slider on flat surface wear tester and several different material combinations were tested with regards to their galling resistance.

40|$|Individual carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) exhibit exceptional {{tensile strength}} and stiffness; however, these properties have not translated {{well to the}} macroscopic scale. Premature failure of bulk CNT materials under tensile loading occurs due to the relatively weak frictional forces between adjacent CNTs, leading to poor load transfer through the material. When used in polymer matrix composites (PMCs), the weak nanotube-matrix interaction leads to the CNTs providing less than optimal reinforcement. Our group is examining the use of covalent crosslinking and surface modification {{as a means to}} improve the tensile properties of PMCs containing carbon nanotubes. <b>Sheet</b> <b>material</b> comprised of unaligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was used as a drop-in replacement for carbon fiber in the composites.
