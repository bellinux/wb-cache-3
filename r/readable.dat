5|$|COBOL syntax {{has often}} been criticized for its verbosity. Proponents {{say that this was}} {{intended}} to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance. COBOL was also intended to be easy for programmers to learn and use, while still being <b>readable</b> to non-technical staff such as managers.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{created his}} own raised-dot system {{by using an}} awl, {{the same kind of}} {{implement}} which had blinded him. In the process of designing his system, he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own slate and stylus tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines straight and <b>readable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his ability}} to {{translate}} what is a complicated treatise into an easily <b>readable</b> and understandable prose for a beginner, Khoo's Sun Tzu series were well received and continue to grow in scope and depth in later years. He additionally manages to add realism by injecting real-life situations culled from his 15 years in management, that provoke much thought and encourage readers to assess their own performance, and take positive measures to become more effective in their workplace and interpersonal relationships.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{intended}} to be a highly <b>readable</b> language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Python does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional, in contrast to many other programming languages. Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, <b>readable,</b> conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} checklist {{was started}} at 20:27:01, {{at which time}} the aircraft's altitude reached 500meters (1,500ft). The first point on the checklist were not <b>readable,</b> but the last three were. At 20:27:32 the captain asked for flaps and landing gear, which were immediately deployed by the first officer and resulted in the aircraft gaining 70meters (200ft) of altitude. The landing gears were confirmed locked at 20:28:00. Four seconds later the passenger asked the captain if there were reserve systems {{which could be used}} if the landing gear did not deploy properly. At this point the aircraft started the descent from 500meters (1,500ft).|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These <b>readable</b> manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E
5|$|An {{authoritative}} {{version of}} Marco Polo's book does not and cannot exist, {{for the early}} manuscripts differ significantly. The published editions of his book either rely on single manuscripts, blend multiple versions together, or add notes to clarify, for example in the English translation by Henry Yule. The 1938 English translation by A.C. Moule and Paul Pelliot {{is based on a}} Latin manuscript found in the library of the Cathedral of Toledo in 1932, and is 50% longer than other versions. Approximately 150 manuscript copies in various languages are known to exist, and before availability of the printing press discrepancies were inevitably introduced during copying and translation. The popular translation published by Penguin Books in 1958 by R.E. Latham works several texts together to make a <b>readable</b> whole.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily <b>readable</b> format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E
5|$|While {{the book}} was <b>readable</b> enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at {{specialist}} scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

Standard encoding of early 1990s for Unix systems and the first Russian Internet encoding.|$|E

25|$|The {{printing}} telegraph is {{a derivative}} of the electrical telegraph which links two 28-key piano-style keyboards by electrical wire representing {{a letter of}} the alphabet and when pressed causing the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. The receiver would then receive the instantly <b>readable</b> text of the message on a paper strip. This {{is in contrast to}} the electrical telegraphs that used Morse Code 'dots' and 'dashes' which needed to be converted into <b>readable</b> text. After 1850, the printing telegraph was in common use, namely along the United States east coast and in France. The printing telegraph was invented in 1846 by Royal Earl House of Rockland, Vermont.|$|E
