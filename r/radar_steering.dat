The Sunset implementation of electronic steering is described, and it is demonstrated that such systems are cost effective, versatile, and no more complex than fixed beam alternatives, provided three or more beams are needed.

A cost comparison of steerable and fixed systems allowing solution of this problem is given.

40|$|A {{middle and}} upper {{atmospheric}} radar system is described. The antenna array consists of 25 groups each of which consists of 19 crossed-Yagis with three elements; each antenna has semiconductor transmitter and receiver, called a module, and each group of 19 antennas works as an independent small <b>radar</b> <b>steering</b> its radar beam {{under the control of}} a microcomputer. Thus, the total system consists of 25 small radars of this kind, enabling one to do various sophisticated operations with the system. The system is controlled by two other computers, one for radar controlling (HP 9835 A) and the other for data taking and on-line analysis (VAX 11 / 750). The computer-controlled system is simple in operation for users and reliable in observation. Very quick beam steering (as quick as in a msec) is also possible because of electronic phase-changing of each module output under control of the microcomputer which is further controlled by the radar controller...|$|E
30|$|More recently, an FDA {{acting as}} the {{transmit}} array to mitigate the clutter, suppressive and deceptive jamming in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) STAP radar is proposed in [16]. The cancelation was based on combining the range, angle, and Doppler domains in FDA-MIMO-STAP radar. In [17], the FDA-MIMO radar to suppress the deceptive jamming in joint transmit-receive domain has been investigated. The suppression {{was based on the}} fact that FDA-MIMO <b>radar</b> <b>steering</b> vector is dependent on both range and angle. Therefore, the false targets can be suppressed due to the mismatch in either range or angle. This method works well only when the angle of the false target is different from that of the true target, or when they are in close angle but far from each other in the range. However, the discrimination performance will deteriorate severely when the ranges of the false and true target are too close. Although the MIMO radar has a number of advantages, it suffers from a significant disadvantage, that is, the absence of the coherent joint transmit/receive processing gain [18].|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wind {{speed is}} a most {{important}} weather parameter to record and monitor for many applications like meteorology, shipping, aviation etc. Wind observations are very important for general (operational) aviation meteorology, and weather prediction. Wind profilers are vertically directed pulsed Doppler radars which can analyze the back scattered signals and determine the velocity of air along the beams. In pulsed Doppler <b>radar</b> by <b>steering</b> beams by 15 ° from zenith, the vertical and horizontal components of the air moment can be obtained. Wind profiler systems are made for frequency bands that are around 50 MHz, 400 MHz, and 1000 MHz. The bands around 50 MHz are suited for high altitude measurements. This paper presents the design of Wind Profiler and discusses the {{issues such as the}} concept of wind profiler radar, how profilers estimate the moment of horizontal wind, Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS) technique for Wind velocity measurement.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) Meander Antenna whose main lobe is steerable by variation of the feed frequency. Generally for radar-tracking of fast moving objects a high scanning rate is needed. Due to the mass inertia mechanically <b>steering</b> <b>radar</b> systems are limited in their scanning rates. A possible solution to overcome this disadvantage is given by using electric beam steering. In most cases conventional array-feed networks are very complex, large and expensive. This fact restricts the mobile usage of such systems. The proposed design of a SIW slot array antenna allows steering of the main lobe by a simple frequency change. This concept leads to a significant reduction of the array dimensions and an improvement of the scanning range. A broadside radiation is achieved at the centre frequency of 60 GHz. Measured scan angle show the values of 20 degrees...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} sensor fusion {{framework}} for {{solving the problem}} of joint egomotion and road geometry estimation. More specifically we employ a sensor fusion framework to make systematic use of the measurements from a forward looking <b>radar</b> and camera, <b>steering</b> wheel angle sensor, wheel speed sensors and inertial sensors to compute good estimates of the road geometry and {{the motion of the}} ego vehicle on this road. In order to solve this problem we derive dynamical models for the ego vehicle, the road and the leading vehicles. The main difference to existing approaches is that we make use of a new dynamic model for the road. An extended Kalman filter is used to fuse data and to filter measurements from the camera in order to improve the road geometry estimate. The proposed solution has been tested and compared to existing algorithms for this problem, using measurements from authentic traffic environments on public roads in Sweden. The results clearly indicate that the proposed method provides better estimates. IVSS - SEF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of the {{essential}} assumptions made in estimating the terminal velocity and the drop-size distribution of hydrometeor from the precipitation Doppler spectrum observed by VHF/UHF radar (or wind profiler) {{is that all of}} the precipitation particles are moving together at the same velocity as the ambient wind. However, {{this may not be the}} case. In this paper, taking advantage of the capability of simultaneously measuring the motions of precipitation particles and the clear-air turbulence with a VHF radar, we develop a method to examine the wind-driven effect on the drift of precipitation particles using the Chung-Li VHF radar. By appropriately setting the <b>radar</b> parameters and <b>steering</b> the <b>radar</b> beams, experimental results show that the drift velocity of the precipitation particles in response to the drag force exerted by the background atmosphere is not the same as the ambient wind velocity, approximately 83 % of the latter in this case. This feature indicates that the precipitation particles are not moving with the background wind, causing inaccurate estimations of the terminal velocity and the drop-size distribution of hydrometeor if this effect is not taken into account. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — {{with the}} {{widespread}} use of digital techniques in modern communication systems, Digital Beam Forming (DBF) technique can be used for <b>radar</b> transmitter Beam <b>Steering.</b> Beam forming is a signal processing technique used for directional signal transmission or reception in antenna arrays and is achieved by controlling the phase and amplitude of each antenna element. The functions of a Timing Signal Generator (TSG) of a radar system is been implemented using VHDL programming and targeting it on to a FPGA. TSG works directly under the control of Radar Controller (RC) implemented using MATLAB and interfaced through Ethernet. Multiple DDS chips is used to generate multichannel radar waveforms and FPGA is used to send data and control signals to these DDS chips via SPI to achieve DBF. DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) is a digitally controlled method of generating signals whose frequency, phase and amplitude are controlled by the respective description words. A sixteen channel direct-digital waveform synthesizer has been developed to enable Digital Beam Steering of the transmitting side for a 4 x 4 array Patch Antenna. Each antenna element has separate beam forming exciter. The RC communicates to the TSG unit implemented in FPGA and sends commands to TSG. Through the RC GUI, the control parameters like frequency and phase shift values are sent to the TSG. Based on the control signals, data has to be sent to internal registers of each DDS. Xilinx FPGA is used t...|$|R
30|$|The {{specialty}} of the Saura radar {{is the large}} antenna array, which is comprised of 29 crossed antennas arranged in a Mills Cross configuration and annexed by two additional antennas. The latter are typically only used for reception in a spaced antenna configuration for the interferometric analysis of the detected signals. The comparably large antenna array, for a radar system operating in the medium frequency range, spreads well over 1  ×  1  km and thus offers a good angular resolution with a minimum half-power beam width of 6.3 ^∘ and 6.6 ^∘, respectively pointing boresight and 6.8 ^∘ off-vertical. Another example for such a large antenna array used for atmospheric science at such low frequencies is the Buckland Park MF radar and was described by Holdsworth and Reid (2004). The arrangement of the Saura antenna array is shown in Fig.  1, where antennas marked in red depict the receiving configuration used in this study. Each dipole of the crossed antennas in the array is connected to an individual transceiver module being adjustable in phase and providing 2  kW peak power each. This configuration provides <b>radar</b> beam <b>steering</b> capabilities {{as well as the}} generation of right and left circular polarization, respectively matching the ordinary and extraordinary magneto-ionic component, often abbreviated by O/X. The atmosphere is typically probed sequentially in vertical and four oblique directions (see Table  1 for details). With such characteristics, the versatile Saura radar is mainly used to derive the wind field in the mesosphere by applying Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS, see Woodman and Guillen 1974) or Spaced Antenna techniques (SA) applying the full correlation analysis method (FCA, see Briggs 1984; Vincent et al. 1987). The temporal resolution of Saura radar winds depends on the chosen radar experiment settings at the given time. The individual experiments nowadays have a run time of roughly 4  min, 215  s for the vertical and 235  s for the multi-beam experiment including oblique soundings. The typical experiment sequence is scheduled as follows, one vertical followed by two multi-beam experiments, with a sequence length of 12  min. For this study, only single pulse experiments with 1  km pulse width are used to prevent potential code side lobe contamination at mesospheric heights generated by long range-coded high duty cycle signals on transmission scattered off the E region.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only chance}} for {{survival}} of the little group of American [...] "Jeep" [...] carriers and [...] "tin cans" [...] lay in running to the east long enough to launch what aircraft could be readied before fleeing to the south hoping that aid would arrive before their complete destruction. While the carriers launched all available aircraft to attack their numerous Japanese adversaries and then formed a rough circle as they turned toward Leyte Gulf, Hoel and her fellow destroyers Johnston and Heermann, worked feverishly to lay down a smoke screen to hide their [...] "baby flattops" [...] from the overwhelmingly superior enemy ships. At 07:06, when a providential rain squall helped to hide his carriers, Admiral Clifton Sprague boldly ordered his destroyers to attack the Japanese with torpedoes. Hoel instantly obeyed this order by heading straight for the nearest enemy battleship, , then 18,000 yd away. When she had closed to 14,000 yd she opened fire as she continued her race toward Kongōs 14 in guns. A hit on her bridge which knocked out all voice radio communication did not deflect her from her course toward the enemy until she had launched a half salvo of torpedoes at a range of 9,000 yd. Although Hoels torpedoes all failed to strike their target, they caused Kongō to lose ground in her pursuit of the carriers by {{forcing her to turn}} sharply left and to continue to move away from her quarry until they had run their course. Minutes later Hoel suffered hits which knocked out three of her guns, stopped her port engine, and deprived her of her Mark-37 fire control director, FD <b>radar,</b> and Bridge <b>steering</b> control.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{reconfigurable}} antennas to tune resonances, change polarization and modify their radiation patterns, made their development imperative in modern telecommunication systems. Their agility and diversity created new horizons for {{different types of}} applications especially in cognitive radio, Multiple Input Multiple Output Systems, satellites and many other applications. Reconfigurable antennas satisfy the requirements for increased functionality, such as direction finding, beam <b>steering,</b> <b>radar,</b> control and command, within a confined volume. Since their rise in the last decade, reconfigurable antennas have made use of many reconfiguration techniques. The most common techniques utilized revolved around switching mechanisms. By combining low-loss, high-isolation switches such as MEMS or PIN diode switches with compatible antenna elements, we can physically reconfigure antennas and their feed structures providing frequency and polarization diversity. Other techniques such as the incorporation of variable capacitors, varactors and physical structure alteration surfaced recently to overcome many problems faced in using switches and their biasing. The aim of this work is to develop not only new reconfigurable antenna designs but to also establish guidelines for the design and optimization {{of these types of}} antennas. In this work a new approach for reducing redundancies in reconfigurable antennas structures using graph models as optimization tools is presented. The characteristics of various reconfigurable antennas are grouped, categorized and graph modeled according to a set of proposed rules. The optimized configurations of these antennas are presented and discussed to verify the validity of the new proposed approach. In addition to the use of graph models for the optimization approach their algorithms can be used to program field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to control reconfigurable antennas and automate their process. Moreover, in this work the level of uncertainties in a reconfigurable antenna structure, the reliability and correlation between the reliability and complexity of reconfigurable antennas are mathematically formulated. Information theory is used to predict the probability of error in a reconfigurable antenna system. This work also presents the different methods that can be utilized to adjust to failures of an antenna part and to ensure a smooth functioning of the defected reconfigurable antenna.
