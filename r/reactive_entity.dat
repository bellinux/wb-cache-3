The molecular basis of these processes have been examined in relation to gamete quality, early blastocyst development and placental function, and data have been generated showing perturbations of these developmental stages by environmental insults or embryo biotechnologies. The developmental period falling between the entry of the blastocyst into the uterine cavity to implantation has also been examined {{in terms of the}} biological function of the endometrium. Indeed several mechanisms underlying uterine receptivity, controlled by maternal factors, and the maternal recognition of pregnancy, requiring conceptus-produced signals, have been clarified. Nevertheless, recent data based on experimental perturbations have unveiled unexpected biological properties of the endometrium (sensor/driver) that make this tissue a dynamic and <b>reactive</b> <b>entity.</b> Persistent or transient modifications in organisation and functionality of the endometrium can dramatically affect pre-implantation embryo trajectory through epigenetic alterations with lasting consequences on later stages of pregnancy, including placentation, fetal development, pregnancy outcome and post-natal health.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{programs}} have an objective {{that can be}} precisely stated as the maximization of a function defined over its local variables. This {{is the case of}} utility-based software agents, which are <b>reactive</b> <b>entities</b> that try to maximize their welfare, usually accessed by an utility function. This paper introduces a programming language suitable for explicit programming with utility functions. Starting from a standard concurrent programming language, we added primitives to allow the parametrization of each process with an utility function that should be maximized. For the moment, using techniques of Markov decision problems, we can compile sequential programs, written in a restricted version of this new language, into equally behaved programs written in the original one. Major problems in developing such utility-based programming language are the need to compare the utility of infinite executions or the need to deal with uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a control of multi-actor systems (or multi-sensors) functioning in an unknown environment. These actors are <b>reactive</b> <b>entities</b> able {{to react to}} the stimuli coming from the environment and to choose between several actions. In order to improve their behaviour (i. e. in order to choose the good action) in the course of time, the system multi-actors must be able to use reinforcement learning. This signal of reinforcement is, until now, a signal whose values are a priori defined. We propose to raise this "a priori" while using the Shannon’s entropy to measure the coherence of the choice of the action by the transformation of the reinforcement signal table. This stage, of local training will allow the improvement of the control of the global system and coordination between the various actors. The results of the simulation show that the actor can learn to control its trajectory efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Graph {{processes}} {{are used in}} order to formalize the relation between global requirement specifications of multi-agent systems by means of message sequence charts, and implementation oriented design models where graph transformation rules specify the agent's operations. 1 Introduction A multi-agent system {{can be described as}} a network of autonomous, <b>reactive</b> <b>entities</b> (agents) which act and interact concurrently by accessing shared resources (objects) and by exchanging messages. In this process, the network may by reconfigured by creating and deleting objects, agents, and links. As a network of agents and objects is most naturally represented as a graph, graph transformation provides a convenient model for concurrent computations in a multi-agent system, where the agent's autonomous operations are specified by graph transformation rules [2, 3]. In particular, the graph matching mechanism implicit in a rule application allows to specify the activation of agents by situation patterns t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{polymerization}} of prochiral bis-anhydrides with diols catalyzed by a cinchona alkaloid {{was shown}} to provide chiral polyesters in good yields and {{with high levels of}} stereocontrol. The structures of the polyesters were determined by H- 1 and C- 13 NMR analyses, whereas their size was estimated by both size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which indicated that moderate degrees of polymerization were attained through this step-growth polymerization. The enantioselectivity of the process was evaluated by using chiral HPLC analysis of the bis-lactones resulting from a controlled chemoselective degradation of the polyesters. The best stereocontrol was reached for oligomers formed from bis-anhydride and diol monomers bearing rigid aromatic spacers between the reactive functional groups. In this case, average enantioselectivities were comparable to those observed during ring-opening of simple anhydrides with similar alcohols. In contrast, the use of more flexible spacers between <b>reactive</b> <b>entities</b> generally led to lower levels of stereocontrol...|$|R

40|$|The hydrophilic/hydrophobic {{nature of}} {{cellulose}} {{is based on}} its structural anisotropy. Cellulose chains are arranged {{in a parallel manner}} and are organized in sheets stabilized by interchain OH–O hydrogen bonds, whereas the stacking of sheets is stabilized by both van der Waals (vdW) dispersion forces and weak CH–O hydrogen bonds. Cellulose has a strong affinity to itself and materials containing hydroxyls, especially water. Based on the preponderance of hydroxyl functional groups, cellulose polymer is very reactive with water. Water molecular smallness promotes the reaction with the cellulose chains and immediately formed hydrogen bonds. Besides that, vdW dispersion forces play an important role between these two <b>reactive</b> <b>entities.</b> They stabilize the cellulose structure according to the considerable cohesive energy in the cellulose network. Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and vdW dispersion forces {{play an important role in}} determining the cellulose crystal structure during the cellulose-water interactions. As a result of these interactions, the volume of cellulose undergoes a meaningful change expressed not only by an exponential growth in amorphous regions, but also by an expansion in nanocrystalline regions. In addition, the volume change is associated with the swelling material expressed as a weight gain of the cellulose polymer. Molecular modeling using Accelrys Materials Studio allowed us to open a new horizon and is helpful for understanding cellulose-water interactions...|$|R

30|$|In {{comparison}} to plant litter, {{most of the}} C/V ratios were very small, ≤ 0.4 (Fig.  8), and indicate that the <b>reactive</b> <b>entities</b> of cinnamyl phenols, particularly p-coumaric acid, are either released or modified during the sedimentary diagenesis. However, in BS sediments (BS 1 and BS 2), the C/V ratios are > 0.4 (Fig.  8) {{may be due to}} the selective preservation of cinnamyl phenols during diagenesis. In general, cinnamyl phenols are associated with lignins by ester bonds (Kirk et al. 1980) and also with carbohydrates. The diagenetic depletion of cinnamyl phenols in coastal sediments may also be influenced by either loosely associated with the lignin molecule or bound with a chemical component which is less recalcitrant than lignin (Dittmar and Lara 2001). The PON/P ratios (IS, 0.21 – 0.24; BS, 0.19 – 0.24) are close to plant litter (0.19 – 0.24) representing the reactivity of p-hydroxyacetophenone comparable to total p-hydroxyl phenols during diagenesis and microbial degradation (Prasad and Ramanathan 2009). In this context, P/(V[*]+[*]S) ratio can also applied as a proxy for methylation. In aquatic ecosystems, lignin degradation generally initiated with either oxidation of propyl side chain or demethylation of the methyl groups or both. But, in both IS and BS sediments, P/(V[*]+[*]S), (Ad/Al)V, (Ad/Al)S, and (Ad/Al)P ratios are lower than the plant litter explaining that aromatic ring cleavage may be the dominant mechanism for lignin degradation in the Sundarban sediments (Dittmar and Lara 2001; Loh et al. 2012). The Ad/Al ratios were higher than the plant litter indicating that the lignin organic matter degradation may be influenced by the oxidation of propyl side chain in the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem. Highly variable S/V ratios were observed in both mangrove sediments which explain that the relative diagenetic activity of syringyl phenols to vanillyl phenols are largely regulated by in situ redox conditions and microbial interactions with the organic matter at the particular depth. However, the relatively constant S/V ratio was observed in BS 3 sediment suggesting a similar diagenetic activity for syringyl phenols to vanillyl phenols.|$|R

The Multi-Agent paradigm {{has proved to be}} an appropriate approach, both in research and education, to grasp the complexity of these systems and investigating the underlying concepts of emergence and self-organization. As such, Agent-Based software are more and more used in life sciences to implement these models in virtual environments and simulate them. However, most of these software require knowledge and skills in programming languages, such as Java or the NetLogo environment. The gap between most of Agent-Based software prerequisites and the actual programming skills of (future) biologists has to be reduced and the processes of implementing a model and simulate it made more intuitive. To answer this issue, we propose a smart, intuitive and open-source software aimed at biologists (students, teachers, researchers) to easily build and simulate complex biological mechanisms observed in multicellular and molecular systems.
