I wonder if it is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, she {{published}} The Divine King in England, {{in which}} she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the claim that societies {{all over the world}} sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of William II was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|It's <b>really</b> <b>a</b> dance-off {{between a}} more {{sophisticated}} 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for us because we have to learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
5|$|Mara Aramov arrives {{to shoot}} Phagan, but she convinces Gabe and Lian {{that she came}} to help.

Lian reveals that the serum Gabe injected into the test subjects was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> lethal chemical, and Markinson was having them killed. Using the fighting between Rhoemer's terrorists and Phagan's security personnel to cover his insertion, Gabe descends into a silo and searches for the missile's detonation codes.|$|E

During the fictional meeting both men describe plans to secure dictatorships in their respective countries via the suppression of freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E

5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's <b>really</b> <b>a</b> spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E
5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't <b>really</b> <b>a</b> resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Rosie is {{fighting}} for her young son to join her from Mexico while working for the self-absorbed Spence (Grant Show) and Peri (Mariana Klaveno).

Marisol (Ana Ortiz), who is not <b>really</b> <b>a</b> maid, successfully interviews to be the fifth maid for the show as an employee of second wife Taylor (Brianna Brown) and Michael (Brett Cullen), who hires her despite objections from Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Brunswick Oels Jägers gave a good {{account of}} {{themselves}} during the war. The regiment — <b>really</b> <b>a</b> single battalion—arrived in Portugal in early 1811. The Duke of Wellington distributed one company to the 4th Division and two companies to the 5th Division as skirmishers, while the remaining nine companies {{served in the}} newly formed 7th Division. The Oels remained in this organization {{until the end of}} the war in April 1814. During this period, the Oels served in most of the major battles including Fuentes de Onoro, Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, the Nive, and Orthez.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not <b>really</b> <b>a</b> narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} of the British spy drama {{television}} series Spooks (known as MI-5 in the United States) began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One, before ending on 17 June 2002. It consists of six episodes. Spooks follows the actions of Section D, a counter-terrorism division of the British Security Services (MI5). Among the storylines, main character Tom Quinn faces dilemmas living a double life with his girlfriend, who at first does not know he is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> spy, and Tessa Phillips is running phantom agents for monetary gain. Matthew Macfadyen, Keeley Hawes, David Oyelowo, Peter Firth, Jenny Agutter, Lisa Faulkner, Esther Hall, Heather Cave, Hugh Simon and Greame Mearns are listed as the main cast.|$|E

5|$|After overhearing a {{government}} radio broadcast with disguised references to nuclear weapons, Lois sneaks on board Air Force One. She manipulates {{her way into}} the room with the Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid possessing Lionel's body. Jor-El taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment. Harnessing the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and makes his way to the Fortress of Solitude. There, the spirit of his father, Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.|$|E
