500|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} I was doing... I {{sat down and}} started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E

We are realists and we clearly <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> store for us yet lie trials and deprivations, losses and difficulties." [...] Two weeks before this statement Sultan Ali Keshtmand, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, lamented the fact that half the schools and three-quarters of communications had been destroyed since 1979. The Soviet Union rejected several Western-made peace plans, such as the Carrington Plan, since they did not take into consideration the PDPA government. Most Western peace plans had been made in collaboration with the Afghan opposition forces. At the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, stated; ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Trotter noticed that racial {{segregation}} was spreading in Boston: {{the number of}} hotels, restaurants, and other public establishments refusing service to African Americans was increasing. [...] He came to <b>realize</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> order to effect real change, the radical message needed {{to be taken out}} of Boston, and began organizing protest meetings across New England in 1903. At the suggestion of Trotter, William H. Ferris went to Washington D.C. in January 1903. Ferris gave a presentation critical to Booker T. Washington in front of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society on January 6, 1903. Richard W. Thompson spoke in support of Washington as replies at the Second Baptist Lyceum on January 25 and Jesse Lawson did the same on February 3. In 1999, Jacqueline M. Moore argued that Thompson's paper failed to hold his ground against Ferris, who was present at the talk.|$|E

2500|$|One of the novel's early champions, Lionel Trilling, {{warned in}} 1958 {{of the moral}} {{difficulty}} in interpreting a book with so eloquent and so self-deceived a narrator: [...] "we find ourselves the more shocked when we <b>realize</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the course of reading the novel, we have come virtually to condone the violation it presents... we have been seduced into conniving in the violation, because we have permitted our fantasies to accept what we know to be revolting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler {{also spoke}} in {{opposition}} to the extension of the football schedule from 10 to 11 games for the 1971 season: [...] "I think the NCAA made a mistake in going to 11 games[...] [...] [...] I love the game and I love to coach it but I also <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> college they still have to go [...] to school[...] [...] [...] [...] it does take away somewhat from their academic pursuits. I was concerned about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} {{recording}} studio experience for McCready and Vedder. Regarding McCready, Cornell said, [...] "You almost kind of had to yell at him {{to get him to}} <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the five-and-a-half minute solo of 'Reach Down', that was his time and that he wasn't going to be stepping on anybody else." [...] The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in. Cornell later said [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively".|$|E

2500|$|Also in {{the fifth}} section, Radhakrishnan offers his {{interpretation}} of three [...] "inadequacies" [...] or [...] "exaggerations" [...] in the Buddha's thought, which [...] "revealed themselves in [...] later history and relation to Hinduism." [...] These are that i) [...] "Philosophy is a natural necessity of the human mind," [...] and the Buddha's hearers were unable to adopt suspended judgement on the ultimate questions; ii) [...] "The Buddha's conception of dharma as the absolute reality was not sufficiently concrete for practical purposes"; and iii) The Buddha taught that one could renounce householder duties at any age. Radhakrishnan states that these [...] "exaggerations" [...] are understandable if we <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the Buddha's time, attempts to lead the spiritual life {{had to contend with}} [...] "three great enemies... the theologians, the ritualists, and the worldlings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maayana Miskin of Arutz Sheva {{characterized}} the movement as [...] "a mass protest". Writing for The American Thinker, Ethel C. Fenig described the protest {{movement as a}} cause for freedom of speech. Westword commented positively on the protest idea, [...] "Sounds like an idea we'd like to frame." [...] The editor of Family Security Matters, Pam Meister, discussed the protest movement {{from the perspective of}} freedom of speech, and commented, [...] "I <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a free society, someone {{is always going to be}} doing or saying something that will offend somebody somewhere. I also realize that more free speech, not censorship, is the answer." [...] Andrew Mellon of Big Journalism wrote in favor of the protest movement, commenting, [...] "The bottom line is that the First Amendment guarantees free speech including criticism of all peoples. We are an equal-opportunity offense country. To censor ourselves to avoid upsetting a certain group (in a cartoon no less) is un-American." [...] Mario Roy of La Presse discussed the incident, and noted, [...] "it is likely that institutions will apply more and more self-censorship. Fearing a possible threat, nothing is worse than the fear of fear." ...|$|E
