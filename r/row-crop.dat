Most of them never left the drawing board, which was intentional; Henry Ford was interested in continuing R (and continued paying Ford engineers to work on it), although he wasn't going to put any models into production until all conditions (design, market) were right for commercial success. A Fordson <b>row-crop</b> model, essentially a [...] "Fordson version of the Farmall" [...] with tricycle design and high clearance, was prototyped at Dearborn in 1930-1931 but waited until 1936 to be produced, when Ford Ltd of Britain produced it as the Fordson All-Around. (It was not without precedent, for the aftermarket had presaged it, although not with the high clearance; in 1939, Ford filed a patent for raising and lowering the clearance on the fly.) The idea of variable front track for <b>row-crop</b> tractors was also considered at Ford during this era. Achieving it via pivoting cantilevered wheel mounts was one of the options, although Ford never put that method into production (it later reached production in the form of the Avery Ro-Trak in 1938). The thought devoted to the topic paid off later, when the Ford 9N achieved it with another, simpler method. Between 1928 and 1932, Henry Ford's attention became consumed mostly by the development and introduction of his company's first V8 engine, which was introduced by Ford on March 31, 1932 and was an immediate success in Ford cars and trucks.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to describe and quantify biologically labile and refractory nitrogen and phosphorus constituents, transformations, and loads in the runoff of two sub-watersheds exhibiting differing agricultural land-use practices. Runoff was impacted by intensive <b>row-cropping</b> for corn production in one of the watersheds while the other one was impacted by dairy livestock management. BACKGROUND: Increasing agricultural development in watersheds has resulted in substantial water, sediment, and nutrient loadings, leading to reduced water quality in receiving waters over the past several decades. Accelerated soil and nutrient import from watersheds is exacerbated by agricultural land-use practices that promote intensive row cropping and rapid drainage of soils for crop production. High runoff of nutrient-rich constituents can also occur via dairy and livestock production, coupled with containment of large numbers of animals in barnyard and pasture settings, resulting in reduction of perennial cover, disturbance of soils, and localized soil nutrient enrichment via animal waste. There is a need to manage watersheds for reduction of soil and nutrient losses by implementing best management practices (BMP’s) (e. g., conservation tillage, perennial vegetation cover and buffering, terracing, contour strip cropping, animal wast...|$|R

It identifies demographic and personal factors that are correlated with a wildlife orientation. Wildlife-oriented farmers in Iowa tend to be farmers with smaller acreages overall, with smaller gross farm incomes, with fewer acres devoted to <b>row-crops,</b> and with more diverse landscapes that more often include trees, streams, Conservation Reserve Program acres or other non-agricultural land than farmers who are not wildlife-oriented.

We report the hydrologic and water-quality effects of a 173 -mm rainfall event that generated three weeks (Feb 15 to Mar 9, 2014) of continuous flows through and between three normally isolated wetlands. A suite of water-quality parameters (physical, nutrients, and pathogen indicators) was monitored daily from offsite (agricultural) and onsite (forested) sources at two sites along one flowpath and five sites along a second at the Joseph W Jones Ecologic Research Center at Ichauway.

40|$|Agriculture in {{the late}} 1980 ’s. Some {{of the goals of}} CRP were to protect water quality of wetlands, {{diminish}} soil erosion, and enhance wildlife habitat. By landowners enrolling in CRP for long term contracts, some environmentally sensitive cropland was “set aside ” from production. Not only did CRP enrollment protect soil quality, commodity market prices were propped up by diminishing the amount of grain flowing into the marketplace. During the late 1980 ’s through mid- 2000 ’s commodity stocks were great enough that the extra land enrolled in CRP was not needed for production. Starting in 2007 running through 2009, a large portion of CRP contracts in Wisconsin will expire. With the stronger commodity prices related to grain demand, many landowners are considering returning former CRP land to production.

50|$|Unsustainable {{agricultural}} practices are {{the single greatest}} contributor to the global increase in erosion rates.The tillage of agricultural lands, which breaks up soil into finer particles, {{is one of the}} primary factors. The problem has been exacerbated in modern times, due to mechanized agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by water erosion. Others include mono-cropping, farming on steep slopes, pesticide and chemical fertilizer usage (which kill organisms that bind soil together), <b>row-cropping,</b> and the use of surface irrigation. A complex overall situation with respect to defining nutrient losses from soils, could arise {{as a result of the}} size selective nature of soil erosion events. Loss of total phosphorus, for instance, in the finer eroded fraction is greater relative to the whole soil. Extrapolating this evidence to predict subsequent behaviour within receiving aquatic systems, the reason is that this more easily transported material may support a lower solution P concentration compared to coarser sized fractions. Tillage also increases wind erosion rates, by dehydrating the soil and breaking it up into smaller particles that can be picked up by the wind. Exacerbating this is the fact that most of the trees are generally removed from agricultural fields, allowing winds to have long, open runs to travel over at higher speeds. Heavy grazing reduces vegetative cover and causes severe soil compaction, both of which increase erosion rates.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Yield {{reductions}} due {{to competition}} of weeds with crop plants {{can be extremely}} important. Early weed competition can be as important in reducing crop yield as weed competition for the entire season. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to determine the weed control achieved by narrow <b>row-cropping</b> patterns, (2) to measure the competitive effect achieved with narrow <b>row-cropping</b> patterns, with low photosynthetic capacity crop plants or with high photosynthetic capacity plants, in competition with high photosynthetic capacity weeds, (3) to determine at what time weed control becomes important and (4) to determine if the time at which competition begins could be determined by change in weight, sugar content, and/or nitrogen content of the commercial crop. Also, two greenhouse studies were made to evaluate the differential uptake of nitrogen by two competiting species, corn (Zea mays L.) and pigweed (Amaranthus rectroflexus L.), and to evaluate the effect of competition for soil and light between two broadleaf species, snap beans and pigweed. Yields of bush snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and onion (Allium cepa L.) were all decreased significantly by the presence of weed competition throughout the entire growing season. Reduction in total area occupied by an individual crop plant resulted in decreased effects on vegetative and reproductive parts due to weed competition and increased the effect of crop plant-to-plant competition. Early weed control was important in all crops. In 1969, yield reductions in corn and beans allowed, to compete with weeds for a period of five to six weeks after crop emergence were equal to those from plots with weed competition for the entire season. In 1970, corn required two weeks of cultivation after emergence and snap beans required three weeks of cultivation after emergence to decrease losses due to weed competition. Weed weight yields were significantly reduced in snap beans at the 5 x 5 inch spacing when compared to the 15 x 5 and 35 x 5 inch spacings. As measured by leaf fresh weight, competition was determined to begin between snap beans and redroot pigweed at 36 to 44 days after crop emergence at crop plant spacings of 35 x 5 and 15 x 5 inches. Significant weed competition did not develop after 51 days at crop plant spacings of 5 x 5 inches. Competition between corn and redroot developed 41 days after emergence for all plant spacings. This study indicated the time at which competition between crop and weeds could be determined by leaf fresh weight measurements or by measuring the leaf area of the crop plants. At a fertilizer rate of 77 - 101 - 64 pounds of N-P-K per acre, corn made greater gains in total green weight than did pigweed in the greenhouse. However, with the further addition of 300 pounds of ammonium nitrate per acre, pigweed continued to make gains while corn growth was unaffected. At all fertility rates, pigweed had higher levels of total leaf nitrogen than corn. When snap beans had emerged and become established before the emergence of pigweed, the total green and dry weight of pigweed was significantly reduced if growing in full competition or in competition for soil factors only...|$|R

Land use within both watersheds is similar with nearly equal percentages of <b>row-crops,</b> grasslands, and forest.

Key environmental {{problems in this}} region include water contamination by nutrients and herbicides emitted from cropland, a lack of non-agricultural habitat to support diverse communities of native plants and animals, and {{a high level of}} dependence on petrochemical energy in the dominant cropping systems. In addition, projected changes in climate for this region, which include increases in the proportion of precipitation coming from extreme events could make soil and water conservation in existing cropping systems more difficult. To address these challenges we have conducted three cropping systems projects in central Iowa: the Marsden Farm Cropping Systems experiment, the Science-based Trials of <b>Row-crops</b> Integrated with Prairies (STRIPs) experiment, and the Comparison of Biofuel Systems (COBS) experiment. Results from these experiments indicate that (1) diversification of the dominant corn–soybean rotation with small grains and forage legumes can permit substantial reductions in agrichemical and fossil hydrocarbon use without compromising yields or profitability; (2) conversion of small amounts of cropland to prairie buffer strips can provide disproportionately large improvements in soil and water conservation, nutrient retention, and densities of native plants and birds; and (3) native perennial species can generate large amounts of biofuel feedstocks and offer environmental benefits relative to corn- and soybean-based systems, including greater carbon inputs to soil and large reductions in nitrogen emissions to drainage water.
