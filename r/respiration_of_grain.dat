40|$|Warmth accelerates {{the rate}} <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> growth in wheat, but the {{temperature}} coefficient expressed as Q 10 decreases gradually between 10 and 25 °C. The rate of protein deposition responds more to temperature {{than the total}} grain dry matter accumulation rate. Warmth shortens the post-floral phase in cereals. The relation can be approximated by a direct log-linear relationship between temperature and duration, or by a heat sum above a minimum temperature. The proportion of the final amount of nitrogen in the shoot {{taken up by the}} roots after anthesis declines upon increase in the concentration of nitrogen in shoot dry matter at anthesis. The component shoot organs contribute to the total amount of nitrogen relocated from the shoot to the grains in amounts proportional to the amounts of nitrogen present in these organs at anthesis. Instantaneous effects of change in temperature on the apparent photosynthesis rate per plant were small. Differences in apparent photosynthesis per plant, which developed in time between temperature treatments or nitrogen treatments, were primarily attributable to the impact of these factors on the rate of leaf senescence. Measured respiration rates were compared with theoretically expected rates. There was agreement between calculated and observed growth <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains.</b> Measured <b>respiration</b> rates <b>of</b> non-grain organs (<b>respiration</b> related with maintenance and transport mainly) were considerably greater than theoretically expected rates, especially in roots. A dynamic simulation model is presented that describes and interrelates post-floral gross photosynthesis, respiration, grain growth, uptake and redistribution of nitrogen, and leaf senescence. According to model predictions final grain yield in the field (for Dutch climate and crop management) decreases by 30 - 40 g. m - 2 per degree centigrade rise in temperature throughout grain filling (other input data fixed). This adverse effect of temperature can be offset by a concomitant increase in daily radiation of 130 - 180 J. cm - 2 (PhAR). Yield differences between crops that differ in amount of shoot nitrogen at anthesis only are predicted to be 15 - 20 %. ...|$|R
40|$|High <b>respiration</b> rate <b>of</b> a <b>grain</b> {{indicates}} faster {{degradation of}} its dry matter. Proper grain management requires chronological and precise measurements {{of carbon dioxide}} evolved from grain respiration during the postharvest storage duration. Therefore the main goal {{of this research was}} to develop a new technique that evaluates temporal corn respiration rate using pressure sensors. It was based on measuring pressure drop associated with the grain respiration in a closed container and using it to calculate the grain respiration rates. Dry corn (Zea Mays L.) was procured from a local farmer and stored at 4 ºC. Corn rewetting technique was applied A set of eighteen pressure sensor modules were used throughout the course of this study. These modules determine gas productivity for various biological cultures through measuring and recording the cumulative pressure as well as temperatures. A 150 -gram subsample from each moisture level was placed in a glass bottle along with two NaOH vials as well as one silica gel vial. The effects of corn storage temperature (23, 35, and 45 oC) and initial moisture content (12. 9, 14. 8, 17. 0, 18. 8, and 20. 7 % w. b) on the cumulative respiration and respiration rate were studied for duration of nine days. The pressure sensor method was found to be reliable in measuring corn respiration rate as affected by the tested parameters. The highest cumulative <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> 2. 625 g-CO 2 /kg-corn was observed at the moisture content of 18. 8 % and the medium temperature level of 35 oC after nine days. It was also observed that the respiration rate increased with increases in temperature and peaked out at a temperature <b>of</b> 35 °C. <b>Respiration</b> rates reached their maximum values of 0. 199, 0. 755, 0. 987, and 1. 147 g-CO 2 /kg-corn. d under the medium temperature level of 35 oC and the moisture contents of 14. 8 % (5 th day), 17. 0 % (5 th day), 18. 8 % (3 rd day), and 20. 9 % (2 nd day), respectively.

Plastic structures suitable for long-term storage systems, as well as intermediate storage <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> have been developed and applied. These storage systems based on the hermetic principle were designed for (1) storage at the farmer-cooperative and small trader level with 10 - 1000 tonnes capacity for enclosing stacks termed Cocoons™, (2) small scale storage suitable for small portable containers of 60 kg to 2 tonnes called SuperGrainbags ™ and (3) quality preservation, insect control and prevention of condensation during shipment of commodities in shipping containers known as TranSafeliners™.

40|$|Fungal {{spoilage}} <b>of</b> stored <b>grains</b> {{may occur}} when activity of water (aw) in cereal grain exceeds a critical limit enabling mould growth. Because {{it is not}} feasible to maintain all parts <b>of</b> large <b>grain</b> bulks below this critical moisture limit during prolonged storage time, an infection by seed-borne fungi is not rare in cereal grain stored under humid temperate or hot climates, inducing irreversible qualitative losses. Additionally, some fungal species produce harmful mycotoxins. The most harmful toxigenic species belong {{to the group of}} xerophilic species (genera Aspergillus and Penicillium). Because mycotoxin contamination <b>of</b> cereal <b>grain</b> is a worldwide issue for public health and a permanent concern for cereal-food industries facing the challenge of a permanent monitoring mycotoxin content in their primary matters, tolerable levels of mycotoxins are severely regulated worldwide. Mycotoxin-producing species growth is closely dependent <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> moisture levels enabling biological activity in grain ecosystem. Consequently, mould growth in stored grain bulks can be anticipated through early detection <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> and mould <b>respiration.</b> The prevention <b>of</b> mycotoxigenic fungi spoilage <b>of</b> stored <b>grain</b> can be managed by a preventive strategy. The main objective of the review was to describe the different methods, material and practices combined in such an integrated preventive approach.

Soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm depth was measured using a digital thermometer (Omega HH 509 R, Stamford, CT) adjacent to each PVC collar.
