30|$|For four liner configurations, see Table  1, from {{experimental}} studies [1, 18] we have computed the near field velocity and pressure profiles {{and so the}} effective Rayleigh conductivity. The <b>relative</b> <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> ν_ 0 is computed as quotient of the kinematic viscosity ν= 1.4660 × 10 ^- 5 m^ 2 /s of air at 15 ∘C divided by the period δ {{to the power of}} four. In Fig.  3 (b) and Fig.  3 (c) we illustrate the near field pressure and velocity profiles p̃ and ṽ for the liner DC 006 at frequency 306 Hz using a truncation radius S= 40. It is visible that the pressure decays almost linearly inside the cylindrical hole, but also the behaviour at distance to the hole. Moreover, the pressure shows close to the rim of the cylinder an edge singularity (i.e., a corner singularity for the 2 D axis-symmetric problem) that is resolved numerically by the hp-adaptive refinement strategy. The near velocity profile shows a flux from all sides to and through the hole. It appears that the outward flux of the imaginary part of ṽ over _+(S) is negative (resp. positive over _-(S)) corresponding to a positive real part of the approximate Rayleigh conductivity k_R(S) (see (24)) and so of the Rayleigh conductivity k_R. This is in line with the inviscid case, where k_R is real and positive. Moreover, we see the higher velocity amplitude inside the hole that decays towards its boundaries. This boundary layer phenomena is more visible for lower frequencies (see Fig.  3 (d)), where one also see a local change of the velocity direction on the wall boundary.|$|E

The utilization of biodiesel produced from jatropha oil by transesterification process represents {{one of the most promising}} options for the use of conventional fossil fuels. The high FFA content raw jatropha oil of was converted into jatropha methyl ester (JME) and ethyl ester (JEE) known as biodiesel in presence of acid and alkaline catalyst with methanol and ethanol respectively.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, API gravity, <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> {{and water}} content were {{determined}} in petroleum oil using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FT-IR/ATR). Support vector regression (SVR) {{was used as}} the non-linear multivariate calibration procedure and partial least squares regression (PLS) as the linear procedure. In SVR models, the multiplication of the spectra matrix by support vectors resulted in information {{about the importance of the}} original variables. The most important variables in PLS models were attained by regression coefficients. For API gravity and <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> these variables correspond to vibrations around 2900 cm− 1, 1450 cm− 1 and below to 720 cm− 1 and for water content, between 3200 and 3650 cm− 1, around 1650 cm- 1 and below to 900 cm− 1. The SVR model produced a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0. 25 for API gravity, 22 mm 2 s− 1 for <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> and 0. 26 %v/v for water content. For PLS models, the RMSEP values for API gravity was 0. 38 mm 2 s− 1, for <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> was 27 mm 2 s− 1 and for water content was 0. 34 %. Using the F-test at 95 % of confidence it was concluded that the SVR model produced better results than PLS for API gravity determination. For <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> and water content the two methods were equivalent. However, a non-linear behavior in the PLS <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> model was observed...|$|R

After 6 months of storage, the JME samples that were kept at 4 °C in exposure to air, the <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> was to increase from 6.1 × 10 - 6 (initial value) to 8 × 10 - 6 m 2 /s (Figure  3 c); whereas, in sealed condition, the value increased to a maximum of up to 7.2 [*]×[*] 10 - 6 m 2 /s (Figure  3 b).

The samples that were kept at 25 °C and 35 °C in exposure to air, the <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosities</b> after 6 months of storage were also found to be increased up to 8.5 × 10 - 6 and 9.2 × 10 - 6 m 2 /s, respectively (Figure  3 c);whereas, in sealed condition, a maximum increase in <b>kinematic</b> <b>viscosity</b> was up to 7.8 × 10 - 6 and 8.1 × 10 - 6 m 2 /s for the samples kept at 25 °C and 35 °C, respectively (Figure  3 b).
