5|$|Between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm {{approximately}} 800 prisoners had surrendered, and {{arrangements were}} made {{for them to be}} transferred to other prisons. At 8:00 pm Governor O'Friel agreed that prison officers should enter E wing, and at 8:05 pm approximately ten Control & Restraint (C) units each consisting of twelve prison officers entered the wing. By 8:10 pm all four landings of E wing had been secured, and one C unit progressed to the Centre where they fought with rioting prisoners. This was reported to Governor O'Friel, who instructed the officers not to move beyond E wing. Scaffolding poles and other missiles were thrown at the C teams from the <b>roof</b> <b>area</b> above the fourth landing in E wing, and when prisoners broke onto the wing the C teams withdrew at 0:22 am on 2 April, leaving prisoners in control of the wing. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, {{and by the end of}} the first day 700 had surrendered and been transferred to other prisons along with 400 prisoners who were not involved in the rioting. Between 200 and 350 prisoners occupied the rooftop of the main prison during the night.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the <b>roof</b> <b>area</b> of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

25|$|Since the NYW was {{constructed}} all at once, one architectural firm, Fellheimer & Long with Allen H. Stem Associated Architects, designed all the stations, platforms and signals for the line. For reasons of continuity, maintenance and appearance, concrete {{was used as}} the material for all stations. Built in Renaissance, mission or classic styles, the NYW stations are considered among the most well-designed depots in the country. The design of the Quaker Ridge station’s peaked roof was inspired by Manhattan’s Pennsylvania Station.

25|$|Joglo roof is {{the most}} {{characteristically}} Javanese roof form and the most complex. Joglo roof {{is associated with the}} residences of nobility, traditionally reserved for Javanese palace (kraton, official residence, government estate, and the house of Javanese aristocrats (ningrat). The main roof is much steeper and the four ridge greatly reduced in length. Joglo roof does not use king posts as does the limasan or kampung roof, rather the four innermost main house columns are sometimes taller than the outer ones. These four innermost house columns support a roof that is the steepest of all type of Javanese roof; almost forming a pyramid, except that it comes to two points rather than a single one. These four innermost main house columns is surmounted by a unique structural element known as tumpang sari. A tumpang sari is basically layered beams structure; the outermost band of beams support the rafters of both the upper and lower roofs, while the heavily-ornate inner band of beams create a vaulted ceiling {{in the form of an}} inverted stepped pyramid. The basic joglo-type houses can also be increased in size by adding extra columns and extending the <b>roof</b> <b>area</b> outwards.|$|E
40|$|This work is {{focussed}} on {{the characterization}} of PV technology over roofs and their constraints for a geographical analysis.

25|$|There is {{no public}} access to the {{interior}} of the tower. It contains three floors, a very narrow stone spiral staircase on the south side, and a <b>roof</b> <b>area</b> with a trapdoor. The staircase has steep risers and is naturally lit when the sun is in the southern quarter by three very small glazed windows, however at other times {{all or part of the}} staircase is pitch dark. The ground floor contains the vestry with its own loft above, incorporating the west window which is inaccessible to visitors. The middle floor is the clock chamber, containing a turret clock mechanism serving the three blue clock faces of the tower, and chiming on the hour. It probably dates from the 19thcentury, and has been wound and maintained for generations by the local Shutt family. In recent years the cranks and clock weights were removed to Pannal Hall (where they were lost) and the clock and chime mechanism is now driven by two electric motors. The clock employs a clapper mechanism on the largest bell to chime the hour. The top floor of the tower is the bell chamber. Two of the three hung and functioning bells are dated 1669 and 1703, both re-cast by Samuel Smith of York. This might imply that the smallest bell could be contemporary with the 15th to 16thcentury tower.|$|E

This study highlights the benefits of a range of allotment scale IWCM options that result from different climate regimes, water demands and <b>roof</b> <b>areas.</b> The significance of results is that when rainwater tanks and/or wastewater systems are introduced at the allotment scale, {{there is plenty of}} water available for all uses. However, the extents of benefits are dependent on climate regime and water demand.

2500|$|Some impact craters on Mercury have non-circular, irregularly shaped {{depressions}} or pits {{on their}} floors. Such craters have been termed pit-floor craters, and MESSENGER team members {{have suggested that}} such pits formed {{by the collapse of}} subsurface magma chambers. If this suggestion is correct, the pits are evidence of volcanic processes at work on Mercury. Pit craters are rimless, often irregularly shaped, and steep-sided, and they display no associated ejecta or lava flows but are typically distinctive in color. For example, the pits of Praxiteles have an orange hue. Thought to be evidence of shallow magmatic activity, pit craters may have formed when subsurface magma drained elsewhere and left a <b>roof</b> <b>area</b> unsupported, leading to collapse and the formation of the pit. [...] Major craters exhibiting these features include Beckett, Gibran and Lermontov, among others. It was suggested that these pits with associated brighter and redder deposits may be pyroclastic deposits caused by explosive volcanism.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s {{there was}} a fuel {{shortage}} in the new Israeli state, and the government forbade heating water between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. As the situation worsened, engineer Levi Yissar proposed that instead {{of the construction of}} more electrical generation plants, homes should switch to solar water heaters. [...] He built a prototype in his home, and in 1953 he started NerYah Company, Israel's first commercial manufacturer of solar water heaters. [...] By 1967 around one in twenty households heated its water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. [...] However, cheap oil from Iran and from oil fields captured in the Six-Day War made Israeli electricity cheaper and the demand for solar heaters [...] dropped. [...] After the energy crisis in the 1970s, in 1980 the Israeli Knesset passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient <b>roof</b> <b>area).</b> As a result, Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy per capita (3% of the primary national energy consumption).|$|E
2500|$|Paxton's roofing system {{incorporated}} his elegant {{solution to}} the problem of draining the building's vast <b>roof</b> <b>area.</b> Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering - a patented design now widely known as a [...] "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.|$|E
