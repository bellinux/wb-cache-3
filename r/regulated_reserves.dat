40|$|The {{nutritional}} condition (fat {{and protein}} reserves) of shorebirds was studied, mainly at Teesmouth and Lindisfarne, north-east England, during the non-breeding season. Normal patterns {{of fat and}} protein storage are similar in most coastal shorebird species. Fat reserves rise to a peak in midwinter. Fat is stored rapidly before both spring and autumn migrations. Protein reserves (measured as pectoral muscle size) remain steady during winter. Protein reserves increase before spring migration, but not before autumn migration. Most shorebirds regulate both fat and protein reserves during winter. Plovers (Charadriidae) have larger fat and protein reserves than Sandpipers (Scolopacidae). However rocky-shore species carry smaller reserves than species feeding on soft sediments. Interspecific differences are related to morphology, foraging behaviour, habitat use and winter movements. First-year shorebirds carry similar sized or larger reserves than adult conspecifics. Catabolism of nutritional reserves was studied during two periods of severe winter weather in north-east England. Reserves were catabolised faster by species that normally carried the largest <b>regulated</b> <b>reserves.</b> In eastern Britain some Redshanks cannot regulate their fat and protein reserves even during mild winters. Possible reasons are discussed. The condition of shorebirds that had starved to death during severe weather is examined. Redshanks, first-year Oystercatchers, inland species) and shorebirds that return early to breeding grounds are most at risk. Recovery of nutritional condition after starvation is examined. In addition to seasonal variation, differences {{in the size of}} regulated fat reserves occur in different wintering grounds. Total lean weights in relation to wing-length as a measure of body size are used to examine whether similar seasonal and latitudinal differences in protein reserves of shorebirds exist. Plovers have larger pectoral muscles than Sandpipers but similar total lean weight (measured in relation to body size). During winter, lean weights are lower in several equatorial and southern hemisphere areas than in northern temperate regions. Seasonal and latitutinal changes in lean weight are discussed in relation to periods of environmental stress...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how grid-level electricity storage may benefit {{the operations of}} NV Energy, and assesses whether those benefits are likely to justify {{the cost of the}} storage system. To determine the impact of grid-level storage, an hourly production cost model of the Nevada Balancing Authority (% 22 BA% 22) as projected for 2020 was created. Storage was found to add value primarily through the provision of <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve.</b> Certain storage resources were found likely to be cost-effective even without considering their capacity value, as long as their effectiveness in providing <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> was taken into account. Giving fast resources credit for their ability to provide <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> is reasonable, given the adoption of FERC Order 755 (% 22 Pay-for-performance% 22). Using a traditional five-minute test to determine how much a resource can contribute to <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> does not adequately value fast-ramping resources, as the <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> these resources can provide is constrained by their installed capacity. While an approximation was made to consider the additional value provided by a fast-ramping resource, a more precise valuation requires an alternate <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> methodology.

40|$|This paper proposes {{an energy}} and reserve joint {{dispatch}} model {{based on a}} robust optimization approach in real-time electricity markets, considering wind power generation uncertainties as well as zonal reserve constraints under both normal and N- 1 contingency conditions. In the proposed model, the operating reserves are classified as <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> and spinning reserve according to the response performance. More specifically, the <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> is usually utilized to reduce the gap due to forecasting errors, while the spinning reserve is commonly adopted to enhance the ability for N- 1 contingencies.

By considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of the Quaternary aquifers in the Southern sector of the Lake Chad basin, this study has permitted to obtain a quantitative evaluation of the groundwater resources available in a selected area of about 2 9 3 4000 km. The estimated <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> ranges between 0. 1 to 0. 5 x 10 m /year.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how grid-level electricity storage may benet {{the operations of}} NV Energy in 2020, and assesses whether those benets justify {{the cost of the}} storage system. In order to determine how grid-level storage might impact NV Energy, an hourly production cost model of the Nevada Balancing Authority (") as projected for 2020 was built and used for the study. Storage facilities were found to add value primarily by providing reserve. Value provided by the provision of time-of-day shifting was found to be limited. If <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> from storage is valued the same as that from slower ramp rate resources, then it appears that a reciprocating engine generator could provide additional capacity at a lower cost than a pumped storage hydro plant or large storage capacity battery system. In addition, a 25 -MW battery storage facility would need to cost 650 /kW or less in order to produce a positive Net Present Value (NPV). However, if <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve</b> provided by storage is considered to be more useful to the grid than that from slower ramp rate resources, then a grid-level storage facility may have a positive NPV even at today's storage system capital costs. The value of having storage provide services beyond reserve and time-of-day shifting was not assessed in this study, and was therefore not included in storage cost-benefit calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire to}} reduce {{dependence}} {{on fossil fuels}} is resulting in numerous policy incentives for increased renewable energy sources within the power grid. Because wind generation {{is arguably the most}} affordable per MWh of the renewable energy sources it is growing nearly as quickly as conventional generation techniques. Due to this significant increase in wind penetration levels, numerous largescale wind integration studies have been produced to determine the reliability impacts of large-scale wind power. Using data from two large US wind interconnection studies, this thesis provides evidence that mesoscale meteorological models under-predict the variability in wind data particularly on short time scales, indicating that data from mesoscale meteorological models need to be used with caution for some types of analyses. These types of analyses include most notably <b>regulating</b> <b>reserves,</b> which are used to rebalance supply and demand on a second-by-second bias. This thesis will also describe and evaluate a new method for jointly quantifying the amount of spinning and <b>regulating</b> <b>reserves</b> required to meet reliability requirements within a balancing area with significant amounts of wind power using high resolution wind data. The method is based on jointly minimizing dispatch costs and reserve allocations, across two time scales (seconds to minutes, and minutes to hours) to satisfy North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Area Control Error (ACE) requirements...|$|R
5000|$|The frequency-response reserve (also {{known as}} <b>regulating</b> <b>reserve)</b> is {{provided}} as an automatic {{reaction to a}} loss in supply. It occurs because immediately following a loss of supply, the generators slow down due to the increased load. To combat this slowing, many generators have a governor.

However, because the frequency-response reserve is often small and not at the discretion of the system operator it is not considered part of the operating reserve.|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{illustrated}} through {{a set of}} simulations that the AGC can effectively control the real time power imbalances due to the wind power forecast errors, by controlling the generation from conventional power plants. Furthermore, it has been seen that the <b>regulating</b> <b>reserves</b> are needed from fast conventional power plants to maintain system balance and the amount depends on the level of wind power integration. Better forecasting of wind speed and the load demand is desirable in a power system of large-scale wind power integration. It has also been depicted that the interconnections with strong electrical networks stabilize the system frequency and decide the wind power integration level.|$|R

This {{is a matter of}} high priority to investigate, as more <b>regulating</b> <b>reserves</b> and specified control strategies for generation control are required in the future power system with even more high wind power penetration. This paper evaluates the impact of large-scale wind power integration on future power systems. An active power balance control methodology is used for compensating the power imbalances between the demand and the generation in real time, caused by wind power forecast errors. The methodology for the balance power control of future power systems with large-scale wind power integration is described and exemplified considering the generation and power exchange capacities in 2020 for Danish power system.|$|R

30|$|With {{increasing}} {{large scale}} integration wind power, active power balancing {{is becoming a}} challenging technical issue. Several studies have been performed in this area {{over the last few}} years. For example, according to [2], the increasing integration of wind power alters the frequency behaviour and solutions must be developed to meet these challenges. A Dutch case study in [3] shows that additional <b>regulating</b> <b>reserves</b> are required in the presence of large scale wind power.

According to [5], the WPPs can participate in frequency regulation services with energy storage devices such as super capacitor banks, while [6] examines the benefits of active power regulation from WPPs.

30|$|Regulating {{power in}} a {{deregulated}} power system is always needed to increase system reliability and to ensure power supply security. The need for <b>regulating</b> <b>reserves</b> is growing {{with the increase of}} wind power integration in power systems. Beside this, effective way of bids activation is also of high importance. In this article, an algorithm has been designed in order to simulate the actions similar to the control room with respect to real time active power balance control. The algorithm ‘rolling balance’ is exemplified and implemented for the case of a power system that reflects the dynamics of the future Danish power system with a high wind penetration scenario. The dynamic model of a power system uses input time series from an hour-ahead power balancing model (SimBa) for power generation, load demand and power exchange corresponding to one particular day with high wind speed and high load demand.|$|R

In fact, advanced solutions relying on both system design and operating measures may be of paramount importance to allow the secure {{integration of}} more RES generation.

The system stability is classified based on the midterm dynamic simulation. It is found that ignoring intermittency and governor effects is an inadequate method to assess intermittency impact. Therefore, the intermittency midterm dynamic impact must be studied. For the studied system, the instability {{is expected to be}} around 25  % RPS with the current reserves. It is also identified that most vulnerable peak hour to instability is the afternoon peak hour when solar power begins to drop off. This article tries to stimulate further dynamic intermittency studies on the issues caused by renewable intermittency, which have not been revealed because of inadequate/incomprehensive study methodologies. Based on the study, effective mitigative solutions can be developed to guarantee the reliability of power grid when incorporating higher RPS if high <b>regulating</b> <b>reserves</b> are impractical.|$|R

And then a methodology is proposed for the active power balance control taking into account the hour-ahead regulating power plan with reduced planning horizon. In the methodology, the power plants and the power exchange are dispatched in a time scale of 5 min. The hour-ahead plan efficiently addresses the intermittent wind power and reduces the regulation burden that would be required in a dispatch plan of one hour. The AGC further compensates the power imbalances between demand and generation in a real time, which is provoked by wind power forecast errors. The Danish power system is used as a case study in this paper. The studies show that imbalances between the demand and the generation can be compensated by reducing dispatching plan and regulation the active power production from conventional power plants through AGC.|$|R

In this model, first-stage decisions determine day-ahead energy purchases and sales and the upward and downward reserve margins committed. Second-stage decisions correspond to intraday markets and deal with reserve requirements and several possible scenarios for vehicle staying pattern. The design of the objective function prioritizes supplying energy to EV batteries while minimizing the net expected energy cost at the EV charging point. A case study describing a parking for 50 EVs is analyzed. The case includes household, commercial and mixed EV staying patterns with several intraday arrival and departure scenarios.
