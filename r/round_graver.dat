2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{inhabitants of}} Bussell Island lived during the Late Archaic period (c. 3000–1000 BC), and occupied the island sporadically throughout the Woodland period (1000 BC – 1000 AD). [...] Archaeologist Mark R. Harrington, who conducted extensive excavations {{in the area}} in 1919, called these early inhabitants [...] "Round Grave" [...] people, due to their practice of burying their dead in small, <b>round</b> <b>graves.</b> [...] The <b>Round</b> <b>Grave</b> people used tools made of animal bone and stone, and used both steatite vessels and simple pottery.|$|R
50|$|Harrington {{described}} the <b>graves</b> of the <b>Round</b> <b>Grave</b> culture as measuring 2 to 3 feet in diameter, with the bodies folded and compacted {{to fit in}} the graves. Typical burial goods included bone awls, steatite bowls, and animal teeth. The Cherokee graves were rectangular, with the bodies laid in a flexed position. Typical Cherokee burial items included earthenware vessels, glass beads, and pipes.|$|R
50|$|There are grave mounds {{and stone}} ships from the Bronze Age in Lau. From the Iron Age, {{there are seven}} grave fields, house foundations, {{collapsed}} stone walls and groove stones. Two of the stone ships and a <b>round</b> <b>grave</b> are situated at Bandeläins täppu {{on the edge of}} Lausbackar. They are dated from about 900 BC. 100 m south of the stone ships is a standing stone.|$|R

50|$|The Upper/Eastern Deffufa {{was located}} amidst {{thousands}} of low, <b>round</b> <b>graves,</b> with clear stylistic {{differences between the}} northern, middle, and southern parts of the cemetery. The most elaborate tombs {{were found in the}} southern part of the cemetery. Reisner assumed that the large, quadrangular deffufa structures were funerary chapels associated with the largest mound graves, not tombs themselves. He interpreted these based on his knowledge of ancient Egyptian funerary practices, and since many of the grave goods found were Egyptian, he had no reason to think otherwise.|$|R

2500|$|The successors to the <b>Round</b> <b>Grave</b> {{people at}} Bussell Island were a people Harrington simply called the [...] "Second Culture." [...] This culture {{was part of}} what is now known as the Mississippian culture, which flourished in the upper Tennessee Valley between 900 and 1600 AD. [...] The Mississippian people of the upper Tennessee Valley are known for their large {{platform}} mounds and conical burial mounds, including several found on Bussell Island and the surrounding mainland. [...] Bussell Island's Mississippian inhabitants used triangular flint arrowheads, celt axes, and wore ornaments made from copper and seashells (the latter suggesting trade with coastal regions).|$|R
50|$|The first {{funerals}} in Egypt {{are known}} from the villages of Omari and Maadi in the north. The people of these villages buried their dead in a simple, <b>round</b> <b>graves</b> with one pot. The body was neither treated nor arranged in a regular way as {{would be the case}} later in the historical period. Without any written evidence, there is little to provide information about contemporary beliefs concerning the afterlife except for the regular inclusion of a single pot in the grave. In view of later customs, the pot was probably intended to hold food for the deceased.|$|R

60|$|The {{caretaker}} put {{the papers}} in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to trundle. The mourners split and moved to {{each side of the}} hole, stepping with care <b>round</b> the <b>graves.</b> The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.|$|R

5000|$|Among the {{innovations}} {{introduced in the}} lectures were {{the timing of the}} pulse by watch and the practicing of giving food and liquids to patients with fever instead of withholding nourishment.

50|$|Funerary customs {{developed}} during the Predynastic period {{from those of the}} Prehistoric Period. At first people excavated <b>round</b> <b>graves</b> with one pot in the Badarian Period (4400-3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures. By the end of the Predynastic period, there were increasing numbers of objects deposited with the body in rectangular graves, and there is growing evidence of rituals practiced by Egyptians of the Naquada II Period (3650-3300 B.C.E). At this point, bodies were regularly arranged in a crouched or fetal position with the face toward either the east the rising sun or the west (which in this historical period was the land of the dead). Artists painted jars with funeral processions and perhaps ritual dancing. Figures of bare breasted women with birdlike faces and their legs concealed under skirts also appeared in some graves. Some graves were much richer in goods than others, demonstrating the beginnings of social stratification. Gender differences in burial emerged with the inclusion of weapons in men's graves and cosmetics palettes in women's graves.|$|R
60|$|The corps then {{assembled}} <b>round</b> a <b>grave</b> {{which had}} already been dug, and into it the bodies of their comrades who had fallen were placed. Major Tempe then said a few brief words of adieu, hoping that all who fell might die equally bravely, and victoriously. Then the sods were shoveled in; and the men, saddened by the scene--though still flushed with the triumph of their first, and signal, success--prepared to leave the spot.|$|R
60|$|The {{wilderness}} was {{red with}} blood, {{the air was}} rent with shouts of victory and cries of agony or despair. And there, {{in the midst of}} it all, ringed <b>round</b> with <b>grave,</b> courteous Saracens, stood the emir, clad above his mail in his white robe and jewelled turban, facing the great Christian knight, with harness hacked and reddened, the light of battle shining in his fierce eyes, and a smile upon his stained features.|$|R
60|$|The leader, {{after waiting}} for a while, said {{something}} sharply to Makola, who shook his head. Then the man, after looking round, noticed Makola's hut and walked over there. The next moment Mrs. Makola was heard speaking with great volubility. The other strangers--they were six in all--strolled about {{with an air of}} ease, put their heads through the door of the storeroom, congregated <b>round</b> the <b>grave,</b> pointed understandingly at the cross, and generally made themselves at home.|$|R
60|$|Goblin's finger is lifted; and she steals out again, {{into the}} Chapel of the Holy Office. She {{stops at a}} certain part of the flooring. Her great effect is at hand. She waits for the rest. She darts at the brave Courier, who is {{explaining}} something; hits him a sounding rap on the hat with the largest key; and bids him be silent. She assembles us all, round a little trap-door in the floor, as <b>round</b> a <b>grave.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After the Lynedoch estate {{passed into}} Graham's {{possession}} in 1787, {{on his return}} from a pilgrimage abroad {{he found that the}} wall erected <b>round</b> the <b>graves</b> by Major Barry half a century before had fallen into a dilapidated state. He had the remains of the wall removed and a neat stone parapet and iron railings, 5 feet high, placed round the spot and covered the graves with a stone slab, on which was inscribed the words, [...] "They lived, they loved, they died".|$|R
60|$|Thousandacres had the civility {{to order}} us chairs, {{and we took}} our seats accordingly. On looking <b>round</b> the <b>grave</b> and {{attentive}} circle, I could trace no new signs of hostility; but, on the contrary, the countenances of all seemed more pacific than they were when we parted. I considered this as an omen that I and my friend should receive some propositions that tended toward peace. In this I was not mistaken; the first words that were uttered having that character.|$|R

6000|$|For {{with the}} coast-guardsmen many sailors stayed. There {{was nothing to}} be earned by staying: but still, who knew but they might be wanted? And they hung on with the same feeling which tempts one to linger <b>round</b> a <b>grave</b> ere the earth is filled in, loth to give up the last sight, and with it the last hope. The ship herself, over and above her lost crew, was in their eyes a person to be loved and regretted. And Gentleman Jan spoke, like a true sailor-- ...|$|R

'I {{swore to}} be avenged! while I walked <b>round</b> the <b>grave</b> of the {{chieftain}} {{who was the}} last of my race; while I stood alone out of the army of my people in the city of the slayers of my babes; while I tracked the footsteps of the Roman who had twice escaped me, as she fled through the street; while I watched and was patient among the pillars of the temple, and waited till the sun went down, and the victim was unshielded for the moment to strike.|$|R
60|$|It was {{his great}} pride and {{pleasure}} {{that so many}} of Maggie's children were round him to do honour to her old friend's burial--three sons, and four daughters, and three sons-in-law. They all stood <b>round</b> the <b>grave,</b> as near as might be to the stone that Gertrude, as a child, had laid under his care, when his silver hair had mingled with her golden locks; and with them was a concourse that evidently impressed the nephew with a new idea of the estimation in which his uncle had been held.|$|R
6000|$|He worked harder {{the next}} day in digging a grave for Prince in the garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family. When the hole was ready, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the horse and dragged him up the path towards it, the {{children}} following in funeral train. Abraham and 'Liza-Lu sobbed, Hope and Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the walls; and when Prince was tumbled in they gathered <b>round</b> the <b>grave.</b> The bread-winner had been taken away from them; what would they do? ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the meal}} was being cooked the British and Punjaub dead were carried out {{to the spot where}} the grave had been dug. The troops had a hearty meal, and then marched out from the village. They were drawn up <b>round</b> the <b>graves,</b> and the bodies were laid reverently in them. Captain Mallett said a few words over them; the earth was then shovelled in and levelled, and the troops marched to a wood a mile distant, where they halted until {{the heat of the day}} was over. They {{returned}} by the direct road to the camp, which they reached at midnight.|$|R
6000|$|With sad and gloomy countenances the {{multitude}} gathered <b>round</b> the <b>grave.</b> They dwelt with mournful hearts on the sturdy virtues, the signal services, and the gallant exploits {{of the brave}} old worthy. They recalled, with secret upbraiding, their own factious oppositions to his government; and many an ancient burgher, whose phlegmatic features had never been known to relax, nor his eyes to moisten, was now observed to puff a pensive pipe, and the big drop to steal down his cheek; while he muttered, with affectionate accent, and melancholy shake of the head, [...] "Well, den!--Hardkoppig Peter ben gone at last!" ...|$|R
60|$|If {{there was}} not an {{instinct}} for {{all three of them}} in that meeting, an unreasoning tendency toward a closer intimacy, then Jane Withersteen believed she had been subject to a queer fancy. She imagined any child would have feared Lassiter. And Fay Larkin had been a lonely, a solitary elf of the sage, not at all an ordinary child, and exquisitely shy with strangers. She watched Lassiter with great, <b>round,</b> <b>grave</b> eyes, but showed no fear. The rider gave Jane a favorable report of cattle and horses; and as he took the seat to which she invited him, little Fay edged as much as half an inch nearer. Jane replied to his look of inquiry and told Fay's story. The rider's gray, earnest gaze troubled her. Then he turned to Fay and smiled {{in a way that made}} Jane doubt her sense of the true relation of things. How could Lassiter smile so at a child when he had made so many children fatherless? But he did smile, and to the gentleness she had seen a few times he added something that was infinitely sad and sweet. Jane's intuition told her that Lassiter had never been a father, but if life ever so blessed him he would be a good one. Fay, also, must have found that smile singularly winning. For she edged closer and closer, and then, by way of feminine capitulation, went to Jane, from whose side she bent a beautiful glance upon the rider.|$|R
60|$|I cannot call to mind {{where or}} when, in my childhood, I {{had seen a}} stained glass window in a church. Nor do I {{recollect}} its subject. But I know that when I saw her turn <b>round,</b> in the <b>grave</b> light of the old staircase, and wait for us, above, I thought of that window; and I associated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield ever afterwards.|$|R
