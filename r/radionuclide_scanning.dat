40|$|Methods {{currently}} {{employed to}} establish the etiology of congenital hypothyroidism include thyroid ultrasound and scintigraphic exams. Thyroglobulin is a protein almost exclusively secreted by thyroid tissue and indirectly reflects the amount of follicular cells. Even though thyroglobulin is easy to measure, it has been not frequently used because of discordant results to distinguish mainly athyreosis and ectopy (dysgenesis). Knowing the differences in inheritance and prognosis of thyroid dysgenesis and dyshormonogenesis, {{it is important to}} define the etiology of CH, combining tools that are easy, fast and available in most medical centers. Our objective was to evaluate and compare color Doppler ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin with <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scan</b> to define the etiology of congenital hypothyroidism. We evaluated 38 children above 3 years-old off-treatment that performed serum thyroglobulin by immunofluorometric assay, color Doppler ultrasound and radionuclide study. On color Doppler ultrasound, 11 patients had athyreosis, 5 ectopic glands, being I associated to hemiagenesis. Twenty one had topic thyroid (3 goiters, 10 normal, 8 hypoplastic). Hemiagenesis and cystic lesion were not revealed by <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scan.</b> We observed substantial agreement between color Doppler ultrasound and <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scan</b> (kappa= 0. 745, p< 0. 0001). Serum thyroglobulin in athyreosis ranged from < 1. 0 to 18. 7 mu g/L. Patients with ectopic glands showed wider thyroglobulin range (4. 5 to 123 mu g/L, median 28. 4 mu g/L). Only one patient showed thyroglobulin deficiency.

5000|$|In {{patients}} with multiglandular parathyroid disease, imaging {{is not as}} reliable. In addition, size limitation of the abnormal gland can limit the detection by <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scanning.</b> SPECT (three-dimensional) imaging, {{as an adjunct to}} planar methods, may increase sensitivity and accuracy, especially in cases of small or parathymic adenomas. By using a gamma camera in nuclear medicine, the radiologist is able to determine if one of the four parathyroid glands is hyperfunctioning, if that is the cause of the hyperparathyroidism. Theoretically, the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland will take up more of the Tc99m-sestamibi, and will show up 'brighter' than the other normal parathyroid glands on the gamma camera pictures, especially because of the internal biofeedback loop within the body with calcium inherently feeding back to calcium-receptors and inhibiting parathyroid hormone production within the normal parathyroid glands. Sometimes this determination must be made three or four hours later when activity taken up by the thyroid and normal parathyroid glands fade away; the abnormal parathyroid gland retains its activity, while the radiopharmaceutical is eluted out of the normal thyroid gland. However, in {{patients with}} nodular goiter or functional tumors of the thyroid gland, increased uptake of the sestamibi agent is possible and make parathyroid localization difficult or confusing.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} combined Tc- 99 m-pertechnetate and Tc- 99 m-sestamibi <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scanning</b> for imaging abnormal parathyroid glands in hyperparathyroid disease in a prospective study. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Established methods to localize abnormal parathyroid glands lack accuracy for routine use. Tc- 99 m-sestamibi {{used in conjunction with}} iodine- 123 has excellent potential for preoperative imaging in patients with hyperparathyroid disease. An alternative method for parathyroid imaging was studied using Tc- 99 m-pertechnetate and Tc- 99 m-sestamibi. METHODS: Thirty patients with hyperparathyroid disease had Tc- 99 m-pertechnetate and Tc- 99 m-sestamibi subtraction <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scanning</b> to visualize abnormal parathyroid glands before surgery. The patients had surgery and pathologic confirmation of all parathyroid glands. RESULTS: In 23 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 12 of 13 solitary adenomas were visualized. Six of nine patients with diffuse hyperplasia had bilateral uptake consistent with diffuse hyperplasia. Three of nine patients had negative scans. One patient previously operated on for diffuse hyperplasia had only one gland scanned. Seven patients with renal failure-associated hyperparathyroid disease were scanned: five had bilateral uptake of Tc- 99 m-sestamibi consistent with hyperplasia, and two who had been previously operated on had localization of remaining abnormal parathyroid glands. CONCLUSIONS: Tc- 99 m-pertechnetate combined with Tc- 99 m-sestamibi subtraction <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scanning</b> is less cumbersome to implement than iodine- 123 combined with Tc- 99 m-sestamibi scanning. It has a high sensitivity for imaging solitary parathyroid adenomas or persistent solitary hyperplastic glands.

Diagnostic performance characteristics were computed for physi-cal findings, <b>radionuclide</b> <b>scanning,</b> high-resolution ultrasonography (HRUS), and HRUS-guided FNAB, using surgical specimen histology as the reference. Results: Age older than 70 years; a hard nodule upon palpation; and presence of cervical lymphadenopathy were significantly associated with a diagnosis of cancer.

It also clarifies the need in future evaluations to consider {{a number of factors}} not mentioned in many previous studies. (Med Decis Making 5 : 437 - 446, 1985) The preceding paper described a conceptual framework to generate questions about potential test uses.

Describing the structure of this evaluation, guided by the framework described previously, helps to determine whether appropriate ques-tions were asked about the potential use of this technology. Background The diagnostic distinction between biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis must be made during the first few weeks of an infant’s life.
