40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{describe}} {{and evaluate the}} procedures used to collect personal costs associated with vision impairment using diaries. Methods: Participants with impaired vision (VA Bonferroni-adjusted value). Data at 1, 3, and 6 months, extrapolated to annual figures, showed no significant difference from annual total costs, indicating consistency in the data collection periods. A significant association was found between diary data and similar entries in the follow-up questionnaire, confirming {{the validity of the}} <b>recorded</b> <b>expenditures</b> (Spearman; p < 0. 01). Participants commented that the diary method was useful to obtain personal costs. Conclusion: A high response rate was achieved by using diaries and additional assistance methods. The diary provided an accurate and reliable strategy to determine the major personal costs associated with vision impairment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{identify}} and analyze the causes of negative unliquidated obligations (NULO) in the O&M, MC appropriation, using sample data drawn from Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California. NULOs exist when <b>recorded</b> <b>expenditures</b> (liquidations) exceed amounts obligated. As such, NULOs represent out-of-balance conditions that should not have occurred. NULOs {{were found to be}} correlated with unmatched disbursements, specific transaction types (USMC Standard Accounting, Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS) Document Identifier Codes 'XSI' and 'XRA'), and contracts containing multiple Contract Line Item Numbers. The thesis categorized causes as either fund administrator errors or disbursing errors. Eighty-eight percent of NULOs were attributable to fund administrators failure to record obligations initially, or only partially, and erroneous adjustments to recorded obligations. SABRS' internal controls were found to be only partially effective due to their reliance upon data elements that were incorrectly or incompletely input into SABRS and other accounting procedural weaknesses. NULOs remained uncorrected {{due to a lack of}} management reports detailing NULOs and fund administrators' failure to use existing management exception reports to identify and correct NULOs. NANAU.

50|$|The present Cathedral {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for a mid-11th-century structure, traces of which survive in the crypt. The date when construction began is unknown, although a document of 1195 <b>recording</b> <b>expenditure</b> on rebuilding works suggests that construction was already underway by that date. The fact that the east end protrudes beyond the line of the Gallo-Roman walls and that royal permission to demolish those walls was only granted in 1183 shows that work on the foundations cannot have started before that date. The main phase of construction is therefore roughly contemporaneous with Chartres Cathedral (begun 1194), some 200 km to the northwest.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{conditional}} quantiles {{of a given}} distribution {{relate to}} each other. Given two conditional quantiles estimated nonparametrically, we investigate their relation by linking them through a parametric transformation. Asymptotic normality of the associated parameter vector is established, and the method is illustrated with data from the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) of UK households. The FES <b>records</b> <b>expenditures</b> of households on six broad categories of goods (alcohol, clothing, food, fuel, transport, and "other goods"), and the methodology is applied by estimating and comparing the conditional quantiles of the Engel relation. The only category for which expenditure can explain the shift in the quantile curves is for "other goods" relationship, indicating an increase in heterogeneity for better off households, suggesting a "taste for variety" effect as the expenditure level increases. For the remaining categories one cannot reject the null of a parallel shift of the quantile curvesQuantile Regression, Semiparametric Estimation, Specification Testing, Engel Curve, Household Expenditure, Budget Shares. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the effects of fiscal decentralization on the magnitude and composition of expenditures. There is consistent evidence that vertical imbalance leads to larger general government. The evidence on the effects of balanced decentralization is mixed, depending a great deal on the sample and the fiscal federal margin in question. Theory and case studies suggest such heterogeneity in the comparative effectiveness of fiscal decentralization is due to heterogeneity in the institutional environment by which citizens gather information, register preferences, and monitor officials. Unfortunately, quantifying this institutional heterogeneity remains elusive. More troubling, there is sufficient distance between <b>recorded</b> <b>expenditure</b> and the quality of service delivery that using the former to assess the efficacy of fiscal decentralization is surely inadequate. We then review those studies which progress beyond measures of expenditures to measures of outcomes. Here too, the results of fiscal decentralization vary a great deal and the determinants of that variation remain elusive. There is thus room for clever work highlighting the conditions delivering effective monitoring thereby enabling successful fiscal decentralization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to compare the {{financial}} management habits of Ball State University first-year students and seniors living on campus. A stratified, systematic sample of 100 first-year students and 100 seniors were surveyed during December 2000.

It was determined that Ball State University first-year students and seniors have similar financial management habits. Statistically significant differences between first-year students and seniors existed on the following variables: having a student loan, knowing when the loan must be repaid, having one or more credit cards, carrying a balance on one or more credit cards, having a savings account, and <b>recording</b> <b>expenditures</b> in a check register.
