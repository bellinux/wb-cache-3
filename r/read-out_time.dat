Specifically self-organization during MBE growth and re-organization processes in block copolymer films under the influence of solvent vapor have been characterized on the relevant timescales ranging from seconds to minutes.

50|$|At room {{temperature}} radiation damage induced defects temporarily trap electrons and holes resulting from ionization, {{which are then}} emitted back to the conduction band or valence band in a time that is typically longer than the <b>read-out</b> <b>time</b> of the connected electronics. Consequently the measured signal is smaller than it should be. This leads to {{low signal to noise}} ratios that in turn can prevent the detection of the traversing particle.At cryogenic temperatures, however, once an electron or hole, resulting from ionization or from detector leakage current, is trapped in a local defect, it remains trapped for a long time due to the very low thermal energy of the lattice. This leads to a large fraction of 'traps' becoming filled and therefore inactive. Trapping of electrons and holes generated by particles traversing the detector is then prevented and little or no signal is lost. The understanding of this has been detailed in a number of papers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{application}} of therapeutic proteins is often hampered by limited cell entrance and lysosomal degradation, as intracellular targets are not reached. By encapsulation of proteins into targeted liposomes, cellular uptake via endocytosis can be enhanced. To prevent subsequent lysosomal degradation and promote endosomal escape, photochemical internalization (PCI) was studied {{here as a}} tool to enhance endosomal escape. PCI makes use of photosensitising agents which localize in endocytic vesicles, inducing endosomal release upon light exposure. Materials and Methods. The cytotoxic protein saporin was encapsulated in different types of targeted liposomes. Human ovarian carcinoma cells were incubated with the photosensitiser TPPS 2 a and liposomes. To achieve photochemical internalization, the cells were illuminated for various time periods. Cell viability was used as <b>read-out.</b> Illumination <b>time</b> and amount of encapsulated proteins were varied to investigate the influence of these parameters. Results. The cytotoxic effect of liposomally targeted saporin was enhanced by applying PCI, likely due to enhanced endosomal escape. The cytotoxic effect was dependent on the amount of encapsulated saporin and the illumination time. Conclusion. PCI is a promising technique for promoting cytosolic delivery of liposomally targeted saporin. PCI may also be applicable to other liposomally targeted therapeutic proteins with intracellular targets.

In the limits of zero <b>read-out</b> <b>time,</b> zero sky noise, and perfect optics, the sensitivity of an all-sky survey is independent of telescope aperture: for fixed detector size and focal ratio, the greater light-gathering power of larger telescopes is exactly cancelled by their reduced field of view.

Here, we bring this technique to its current limit and demonstrate how the careful design of system parameters leads to fast and high-fidelity measurements without affecting qubit coherence. We achieve this result by increasing the dispersive interaction strength, by choosing an optimal linewidth of the readout resonator, by employing a Purcell filter, and by utilizing phase-sensitive parametric amplification.

In order {{to cope with a}} data rate 100 times higher than during LHC Run 1 and with the continuous <b>read-out</b> of the <b>Time</b> Projection Chamber (TPC), it is necessary to upgrade the Online and Offline Computing to a new common system called O 2.

30|$|In {{evaluating}} which effects {{should be}} estimated and compensated for quantitative measurements, we qualitatively observed that dead time {{is dominated by}} a fixed <b>read-out</b> <b>time.</b> Nonetheless, an estimation of dead time variability {{should be made to}} determine if compensation methods are needed. We also noted that the tile temperature increases rapidly after being powered up and stabilizes after approximately 3 min, consistent with the results of Somlai-Schweiger et al. [27]. This implies a variation in the signal to noise ratio {{as a function of the}} time of cell firing during the acquisition in DCM mode. Any confounding effect might be mitigated by grouping together the cells that are activated in parallel (rather than dies) and employing a predetermined correction based on the time from power-up. The extent of the errors introduced by this effect are not yet known, although we believe they would not impact any of the results presented here. Another potential source of error that we did not evaluate is the use of one DCM to select the HDC cells in the other maps, as this neglects the effect of temperature differences between the maps. Finally, the variation of the effect of the inhibition level between dies was not presented here, but is available in the additional material. The comparison of the dark count rate measured without and with the lens (Table 5) suggests that also the light tightness of the chamber should be thoroughly tested to provide reliable quantitative measurements of photon count values.|$|E
40|$|We present {{preliminary}} {{characterization of}} the Speedster-EXD, a new event driven hybrid CMOS detector (HCD) developed in collaboration with Penn State University and Teledyne Imaging Systems. HCDs have advantages over CCDs including lower susceptibility to radiation damage, lower power consumption, and faster <b>read-out</b> <b>time</b> to avoid pile-up. They are deeply depleted and able to detect x-rays down to approximately 0. 1 keV. The Speedster-EXD has additional in-pixel features compared to previously published HCDs including: (1) an in-pixel comparator that enables read out of only the pixels with signal from an x-ray event, (2) four different gain modes to optimize either full well capacity or energy resolution, (3) in-pixel CDS subtraction to reduce read noise, and (4) a low-noise, high-gain CTIA amplifier to eliminate interpixel capacitance crosstalk. When using the comparator feature, the user can set a comparator threshold and only pixels above the threshold will be read out. This feature can be run in two modes including single pixel readout in which only pixels above the threshold are read out and 3 x 3 readout where a 3 x 3 region centered on the central pixel of the x-ray event is read out. The comparator feature of the Speedster-EXD increases the detector array effective frame rate by orders of magnitude. The new features of the Speedster-EXD hybrid CMOS x-ray detector are particularly relevant to future high throughput x-ray missions requiring large-format silicon imagers.

Our approach is based on confocal dual-color illumination and detection of the scattering intensities from individual silver nanoparticles and gold nanorods. In {{the absence of the}} target DNA, the nanoparticles move independently and their respective scattering signals are uncorrelated. In the presence of the target DNA, the probe-functionalized gold and silver nanoparticles assemble via DNA hybridization with the target, giving rise to temporal coincidences between the signals scattered by each nanoparticle. The degree of coincidence accurately quantifies the amount of target DNA. To demonstrate the efficiency of our technique, we detect a specific DNA sequence of sesame, an allergenic food ingredient, for a range of concentration from 5 pM to 1. 5 nM with a limit of detection of 1 pM. Our method is sensitive and specific enough to detect single nucleotide deletion and mismatch. With the dual-color scattering signals being much brighter than fluorescence-based analogs, the analysis is fast, quantitative, and simple to operate, making it valuable for biosensing applications...|$|E
40|$|Background: How do neural {{networks}} encode sensory information? Following sensory stimulation, neural coding is commonly {{assumed to be}} based on neurons changing their firing rate. In contrast, both theoretical works and experiments in several sensory systems showed that neurons could encode information as coordinated cell assemblies by adjusting their spike timing and without changing their firing rate. Nevertheless, in the olfactory system, there is little experimental evidence supporting such model. Methodology/Principal Findings: To study these issues, we implanted tetrodes in the olfactory bulb of awake mice to record the odorant-evoked activity of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells. We showed that following odorant presentation, most M/T neurons do not significantly change their firing rate over a breathing cycle but rather respond to odorant stimulation by redistributing their firing activity within respiratory cycles. In addition, we showed that sensory information can be encoded by cell assemblies composed of such neurons, thus supporting the idea that coordinated populations of globally rateinvariant neurons could be efficiently used to convey information about the odorant identity. We showed that different coding schemes can convey high amount of odorant information for specific <b>read-out</b> <b>time</b> window. Finally we showed that the optimal readout time window corresponds to the duration of gamma oscillations cycles. Conclusion: We propose that odorant can be encoded by population of cells that exhibit fine temporal tuning of spiking activity while displaying weak or no firing rate change. These cell assemblies may transfer sensory information in spikin...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{novelty of}} what is generally meant by a "physical unclonable function" (PUF) is precisely defined, in order to supply a firm basis for security evaluations and the proposal of new security mechanisms. A PUF {{is defined as a}} hardware device which implements a physical function with an output value that changes with its argument. A PUF can be clonable, but a secure PUF must be unclonable. This proposed meaning of a PUF is cleanly delineated from the closely related concepts of "conventional unclonable function", "physically obfuscated key", "random-number generator", "controlled PUF" and "strong PUF". The structure of a systematic security evaluation of a PUF enabled by the proposed formal definition is outlined. Practically all current and novel physical (but not conventional) unclonable physical functions are PUFs by our definition. Thereby the proposed definition captures the existing intuition about what is a PUF and remains flexible enough to encompass further research. In a second part we quantitatively characterize two classes of PUF security mechanisms, the standard one, based on a minimum secret <b>read-out</b> <b>time,</b> and a novel one, based on challenge-dependent erasure of stored information. The new mechanism is shown to allow in principle the construction of a "quantum-PUF", that is absolutely secure while not requiring the storage of an exponentially large secret. The construction of a PUF that is mathematically and physically unclonable in principle does not contradict the laws of physics.
