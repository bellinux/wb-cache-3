50|$|Atmospheric thermal ducting {{is often}} more intense at UHF, because shorter {{wavelengths}} have much greater <b>refraction</b> <b>angles</b> than longer ones. However, a much stronger thermal inversion is often required than is needed for ducting in the 2-meter band.|$|R
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, concerning visible light, {{the real}} {{part of the}} refractive index n can deviate strongly from unity (n of glass in visible light ranges from 1.5 to 1.8) while the deviation from unity for X-rays in different media is generally {{of the order of}} 10−5. Thus, the <b>refraction</b> <b>angles</b> caused at the boundary between two isotropic media calculated with Snell's formula are also very small. The consequence of this is that <b>refraction</b> <b>angles</b> of X-rays passing through a tissue sample cannot be detected directly and are usually determined indirectly by [...] "observation of the interference pattern between diffracted and undiffracted waves produced by spatial variations of the real part of the refractive index." ...|$|R

Because the results of analyses of such gradient effects by W. B. Hubbard and J. R. Jokipii are expressed in other ways, a special effort is made to compare all of the predictions on a common basis.

5000|$|The {{ability to}} resolve {{features}} in optical lithography {{is directly related}} to the numerical aperture of the imaging equipment, the numerical aperture being the sine of the maximum <b>refraction</b> <b>angle</b> multiplied by the refractive index of the medium through which the light travels. The lenses in the highest resolution [...] "dry" [...] photolithography scanners focus light in a cone whose boundary is nearly parallel to the wafer surface. As it is impossible to increase resolution by further refraction, additional resolution is obtained by inserting an immersion medium with a higher index of refraction between the lens and the wafer. The blurriness is reduced by a factor equal to the refractive index of the medium. For example, for water immersion using ultraviolet light at 193 nm wavelength, the index of refraction is 1.44.|$|E

5000|$|The {{refractive}} index of materials {{varies with the}} wavelength (and frequency) of light. This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors. As the {{refractive index}} varies with wavelength, so will the <b>refraction</b> <b>angle</b> as light goes from one material to another. Dispersion also causes the focal length of lenses to be wavelength dependent. This {{is a type of}} chromatic aberration, which often needs to be corrected for in imaging systems. In regions of the spectrum where the material does not absorb light, the refractive index tends to decrease with increasing wavelength, and thus increase with frequency. This is called [...] "normal dispersion", in contrast to [...] "anomalous dispersion", where the refractive index increases with wavelength. For visible light normal dispersion means that the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red.|$|E
50|$|Like reflection, {{refraction}} {{had been}} known about for some time. It was, however, a much more complicated problem that required further work. It was known that refracted light propagates in a spherical shell much as reflected light does and that it also takes on {{the color of the}} material through which it is traveling. It was also known that if a ray of light is traveling and goes from one medium to another that its angle will bend in a manner related to the density of the two materials. Like reflections the incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal all lie in the same place however the angle of refraction is always less than the angle of incidence. The only exceptions to this are perpendicular rays which do not in fact refract. Taqī al-Dīn did discover though that “the difference between the refraction angles of different incident rays is less than the difference between the angles of incidence.” He also noted that “the ratio of the angle of the larger incident to its <b>refraction</b> <b>angle</b> is larger than the ratio of the angle of the smaller incident to its refraction angle.” These are pretty much still our modern rules for optics and Taqī al-Dīn even tried to formulate Snell’s law although he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic refractometers {{automatically}} {{measure the}} refractive index of a sample. The automatic {{measurement of the}} refractive index of the sample {{is based on the}} determination of the critical angle of total reflection.A light source, usually a long-life LED, is focused onto a prism surface via a lens system. An interference filter guarantees the specified wavelength. Due to focusing light to a spot at the prism surface, a wide range of different angles is covered.As shown in the figure [...] "Schematic setup of an automatic refractometer" [...] the measured sample is in direct contact with the measuring prism. Depending on its refractive index, the incoming light below the critical angle of total reflection is partly transmitted into the sample, whereas for higher angles of incidence the light is totally reflected. This dependence of the reflected light intensity from the incident angle is measured with a high-resolution sensor array. From the video signal taken with the CCD sensor the refractive index of the sample can be calculated.This method of detecting the angle of total reflection is independent on the sample properties. It is even possible to measure the refractive index of optically dense strongly absorbing samples or samples containing air bubbles or solid particles [...] Furthermore, only a few microliters are required and the sample can be recovered. This determination of the <b>refraction</b> <b>angle</b> is independent of vibrations and other environmental disturbances.|$|E

40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} are artificial {{structures that}} have periodic dielectric components with different refractive indices. Under certain conditions, they abnormally refract the light, a phenomenon called negative refraction. Here we experimentally characterize negative refraction in a one dimensional photonic crystal structure; near the low frequency {{edge of the}} fourth photonic bandgap. We compare the experimental results with current theory and a theory based on the group velocity developed here. We also analytically derived the negative refraction correctness condition that gives the angular region where negative refraction occurs. By using standard photonic techniques we experimentally determined the relationship between incidence and negative <b>refraction</b> <b>angles</b> and found the negative refraction range by applying the correctness condition. In order to compare both theories with experimental results an output refraction correction was utilized. The correction uses Snell's law and an effective refractive index based on two effective dielectric constants. We found good agreement between experiment and both theories in the negative refraction zone. Since both theories and the experimental observations agreed well in the negative refraction region, we can use both negative refraction theories plus the output correction to predict negative <b>refraction</b> <b>angles.</b> This can be very useful from a practical point of view for space filtering applications such as a photonic demultiplexer or for sensing applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{generalized}} Snell’s law (GSL) with phase discontinuity proposed {{based on}} the concept of a metasurface, which can be used to control arbitrarily the reflection and refraction of waves, attracts a growing attention in these years. The concept of abnormally deflecting the incident wave has been applied to the elastic field very recently. However, most of the studies on metasurfaces are based on passive materials, which restricts the frequency or the deflected angles always working in a single state. Here, we steer elastic SH wave propagation in an electrorheological (ER) elastomer with a structured meta-slab composed of geometrically periodic wave guides by exposing the slab to the programmed electric fields. The dependence of phase velocities of SH waves on the applied electric fields can make the phase shift under the form of a special function along the slab, which will control the <b>refraction</b> <b>angles</b> of the transmitted SH waves by the GSL. Accordingly we design the meta-slab theoretically and conduct corresponding numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the structured meta-slab under the programmed external electric fields can deflect SH wave flexibly with tunable <b>refraction</b> <b>angles</b> and working frequencies, and can focus SH wave with tunable focal lengths. The present study will broaden the scope of applying adaptive materials to design metasurfaces with tunability...|$|R

40|$|We {{show in the}} {{framework}} of the 1 D nonlinear Schrödinger equation that the value of the <b>refraction</b> <b>angle</b> of a fundamental soliton beam passing through an optical lattice can be controlled by adjusting either the shape of an individual waveguide or the relative positions of the waveguides. In the case of the shallow refractive index modulation, we develop a general approach for the calculation of the <b>refraction</b> <b>angle</b> change. The shape of a single waveguide crucially affects the refraction direction due to the appearance of a structural form factor in the expression for the density of emitted waves. For a lattice of scatterers, wave-soliton interference inside the lattice leads to the appearance of an additional geometric form factor. As a result, the soliton refraction is more pronounced for the disordered lattices than for the periodic ones...|$|E
