5|$|Amtrak <b>rebuilt</b> the cafes into {{numerous}} configurations {{during the}} 1980s and 1990s. These included all-table dinettes, club cars {{for use in}} Metroliner service, and club-dinettes {{with a mix of}} tables and club seats. By the 2010s most cafes were configured as club-dinettes; some had been converted into all-table dinettes. Five dinettes were <b>rebuilt</b> for use on the Inter-American, a long-distance train operating between Texas and St. Louis, Missouri; lounge seats replaced the coach seats. 21 dinettes were also refurbished for Metroliner service. By the 2010s all the remaining dinettes were <b>rebuilt</b> with all-table seating, save two which were converted into short-distance coaches.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{singled out}} the Broadway Limited for special {{treatment}} and in 1972 completely refurbished its equipment, {{most of which}} was ex-Penn Central, although former Union Pacific Railroad sleeping cars were also used. Amtrak also added a Slumbercoach to the consist. In 1974 Amtrak tried out <b>rebuilt</b> 6-bedroom, 8-roomette ex-Rock Island sleeping cars, but their limited capacity reduced revenue. The Broadway Limited began receiving <b>rebuilt</b> Heritage Fleet cars in 1980, and Amfleet coaches thereafter. 68 cars were <b>rebuilt</b> at a total cost of $9.8 million.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on May 24, 2004, {{construction}} of new platforms began at Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The <b>rebuilt</b> Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the <b>rebuilt</b> Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both consist of a single high-level platform {{on the south side}} of the tracks. The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides of the tracks (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. Construction at Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished with the opening of the <b>rebuilt</b> station platform on July 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|British Army {{accepted}} 30 vehicles, later <b>rebuilt</b> as carriers.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{dating from}} these centuries include William Alvey's baroque house on Northgate, the Manor House on Northgate inset with medieval masonry, and Sessions House on the Market Place. The Carre family founded the grammar school which was <b>rebuilt</b> in 1834, the hospital, <b>rebuilt</b> in 1830, and the almshouses, <b>rebuilt</b> 1857, while the Victorian {{builders}} Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry constructed or added to numerous public buildings and private residences, including Lafford Terrace {{and their own}} houses on Southgate and at Westholme.|$|E
5|$|Ellis Park was <b>rebuilt</b> and reopened on June 1, 2006, for training. The first {{races at}} the <b>rebuilt</b> {{facility}} were held on July 19, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Jordanhill Station will be <b>rebuilt</b> for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, one of {{a number}} of {{stations}} that will be <b>rebuilt</b> for the Commonwealth Games through a £300million transport legacy plan.|$|E
5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out {{beginning}} in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. The roof was <b>rebuilt,</b> the south wall was <b>rebuilt</b> using the original materials, and the main features of the 12th-century chancel arch were discarded.|$|E
5|$|None of the Amclubs {{remain in}} their {{original}} configuration. Three of the original club cars were delivered with all club-style seating {{for a total of}} 33 seats; five of the original style were <b>rebuilt</b> to match. As the original Budd Metroliners were withdrawn many of the Amclubs were refurbished for use in Metroliner service. Three were <b>rebuilt</b> for use on the Montrealer, an overnight train between Washington, D.C. and Montreal. Booths and lounge seating replaced the coach seating and club seats. These were later <b>rebuilt</b> as all-table dinettes. Most clubs were <b>rebuilt</b> as club-dinette cars, with one half given over to booths and the other having 2×1 seating. Others were <b>rebuilt</b> as full-length business class cars, with 62 seats. Still others were converted to 72-seat coaches.|$|E
5|$|On the NBR, {{locomotives}} {{were generally}} <b>rebuilt</b> when their boilers wore out. No. 224 received two new boilers {{in the course}} of its life: one was fitted by Drummond, the other by Holmes. Holmes ultimately <b>rebuilt</b> all of the locomotives: other than no. 224, nos. 420/1 were <b>rebuilt</b> in 1887, nos. 422/3 in 1890 and no. 264 in 1893. No. 224 then received its third rebuilding in 1897. In later years, no. 224 was used on secondary and branch line trains.|$|E
5|$|The C {{station was}} {{designed}} by Thomas Phillips Figgis in a similar style to Kennington station. It was partially <b>rebuilt</b> in the 1920s when the C tunnels were modernised, and was <b>rebuilt</b> during {{the construction of the}} Elephant & Castle shopping centre and roundabout in the 1960s. It was <b>rebuilt</b> {{at the start of the}} 21st century, reopening on 12 December 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Russian company Aviarestoration has <b>rebuilt</b> three MiG-3s. They all use Allison V-12 engines. One {{is in the}} US in the Military Aviation Museum of Pungo, Virginia and another, <b>rebuilt</b> from a MiG-3 {{shot down}} in 1942, first flew again around the start of 2010. It will remain in Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} culvert at {{the southeast corner}} of the drydock was <b>rebuilt</b> in December 2013, and the drydock itself completely excavated in April 2014. The entrance to the drydock, at the western end, was surmounted by a bridge, partially demolished in 2002 but <b>rebuilt</b> during 2014.|$|E
5|$|The minaret is {{believed}} to have been built in the area of an earlier, Fatimid-era brick minaret that had itself been <b>rebuilt</b> several times. Contemporary accounts suggest that the Fatimid minaret had defects in its construction and needed to be <b>rebuilt</b> several times, including once under the direction of Sadr al-Din al-Adhra'i al-Dimashqi al-Hanafi, the qadi al-qudat (Chief Justice of the Highest Court) during the rule of Sultan Baibars. Recorded to have been <b>rebuilt</b> again under Barquq in 1397, the minaret began to lean at a dangerous angle and was <b>rebuilt</b> in 1414 by Taj al-Din al-Shawbaki, the walī and muhtasib of Cairo, and again in 1432. The Qaytbay minaret was built in its place as part of a reconstruction of the entrance to the mosque.|$|E
5|$|The mosque was {{originally}} a small prayer house built by Umar the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, but was <b>rebuilt</b> and expanded by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and finished {{by his son}} al-Walid in 705 CE. The mosque was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and <b>rebuilt</b> by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur in 754. His successor al-Mahdi <b>rebuilt</b> it again in 780. Another earthquake destroyed most of al-Aqsa in 1033, but two years later the Fatimid caliph Ali az-Zahir built another mosque which has stood to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} New Paltz station {{burned down}} around 4:45 A.M. on April23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire {{originated in the}} office stove, and spread rapidly before local fire companies could arrive. A passenger car {{was used as a}} temporary station while the building was <b>rebuilt.</b> By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely <b>rebuilt</b> by December31, 1907, and in active use by February7, 1908. While the original station had a gabled roof, the <b>rebuilt</b> station was hipped. The direction of the new station's battens was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The <b>rebuilt</b> freight house was placed a distance from the depot.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Army used T48s <b>rebuilt</b> as M3A1 Half-tracks, in 1944. Most <b>rebuilt</b> by the Chester Tank Depot. One T48 was {{integrated}} into the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|Warsaw {{and other}} ruined cities were cleared of rubble — mainly by hand — and <b>rebuilt</b> with great speed (one of {{the successes of}} the Three-Year Plan) {{at the expense of}} former German cities like Wrocław, which often {{provided}} the needed construction material. Wrocław, Gdańsk, Szczecin and other formerly German cities were also completely <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Architecture, {{sculpture}} and painting developed also under Italian influence {{from the beginning}} of the 16th century. A number of professionals from Tuscany arrived and worked as royal artists in Kraków. Francesco Fiorentino worked on the tomb of Jan Olbracht already from 1502, and then together with Bartolommeo Berrecci and Benedykt from Sandomierz <b>rebuilt</b> the royal castle, which was accomplished between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built Sigismund's Chapel at Wawel Cathedral. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in Brzeg, and even Kraków merchants (by the mid 16th century their class economically gained strength nationwide) built or <b>rebuilt</b> their residencies to make them resemble the Wawel Castle. Kraków's Sukiennice and Poznań City Hall are among numerous buildings <b>rebuilt</b> in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades.|$|E
5|$|Armero {{was never}} <b>rebuilt</b> after the tragedy. Instead, the {{survivors}} were relocated to {{the towns of}} Guayabal and Lérida, rendering Armero a ghost town.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{the first}} phase of {{reconstruction}} has taken place. The original foundation and chimney has been <b>rebuilt,</b> and full restoration of Fort Dobbs is underway.|$|E
5|$|August 16, 1629 – The most {{damaging}} hurricane thus {{far in the}} colony's history destroys crops, several forts, a prison, and the <b>rebuilt</b> watchtower.|$|E
5|$|Comet 1X: Two RCAF Comet 1As were <b>rebuilt</b> with heavier-gauge skins to a Comet 2 {{standard}} for the fuselage, and renamed Comet 1X.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 is an almost-identical {{copy of the}} {{original}} spacecraft, however modifications were made including {{the addition of a}} backup radar altimeter. In total, 85 improvements were made to the spacecraft when it was <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Abbot Sadyngton's {{apparent}} financial corruption, {{the abbey}} {{appeared to be}} financially stable: the abbey's monastic buildings had recently been extensively <b>rebuilt</b> and the abbey had a substantial annual income of £1180.|$|E
5|$|Deva Victrix, {{or simply}} Deva, was a legionary {{fortress}} and {{town in the}} Roman province of Britannia {{on the site of}} the modern city of Chester. The fortress was built by the Legio II Adiutrix in the AD 70s as the Roman army advanced north against the Brigantes, and <b>rebuilt</b> completely over the next few decades by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix. In the early 3rd century the fortress was again <b>rebuilt.</b> The legion probably remained at the fortress until the late 4th or early 5th century, upon which it fell into disuse.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{with how}} commercialized the <b>rebuilt</b> church has become, Lisa {{abandons}} Christianity and seeks out {{to follow a}} new religion.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty locomotives were <b>rebuilt</b> by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the <b>rebuilt</b> Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives found new homes on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of al-Hafiz (r. 1130–1149) several mausoleums and mosques were <b>rebuilt</b> to honour notable female figures in Shi'i history.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum {{was built}} {{early in the}} 2nd century. It was at least partly {{demolished}} and <b>rebuilt</b> around 200; the destruction coincides with an uprising of the northern tribes in 196. The fort was modified or wholly <b>rebuilt</b> about the year 300. It {{appears to have been}} preceded by an Iron Age fort, followed by a Roman camp before the permanent fort was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Fires were a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed {{almost entirely of}} wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its limited use. However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again <b>rebuilt.</b> The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1240 a Mongol force sacked Reting monastery {{and killed}} 500 people. The gompa was <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was <b>rebuilt</b> and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was <b>rebuilt</b> {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E
