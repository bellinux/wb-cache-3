2500|$|Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve {{is located}} on the north east coast of Unguja, [...] from the Zanzibar Town. The reserve is an {{important}} biodiversity spot in the coral rag zone. The forest reserve is rich both in faunal and floral species. The faunal species reported from the reserve are: Endemic species of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey,</b> Aders' duiker, sykes, blue monkeys, suni antelope and several species of snakes. The avifauna species consist of 47 bird species, which includes Fischer's turaco, Zanzibar sombre greenbul, crowned hornbill and white-browed coucal. There are 100 plant species which includes many medicinal species. There are also coral caves within the reserve where stalactites and stalagmite formations can be seen. There is also a spice plantation near the reserve. Coral rag forest, a sensitive ecosystem, is under threat due to timber extraction, since the 1970s. Conservation measures have been undertaken to preserve the rich biodiversity of the reserve.|$|E
2500|$|Ngezi Forest Reserve covers {{an area of}} [...] {{and is in the}} {{north-western}} tip of Pemba Island. It {{was declared}} a reserve in 1950 after most of the area had been denuded for cultivation of cloves. It still has high closed forests known as Ngezi forest extending right up to the beach at Vumawimbi. The forest types reported consist of coral bushes and thickets, thick grasses and bushes in the sandy-loam soils and Mtifutifu soils; dominant plant species are: Odyendea zimmermanni (Mjoho), riverine forest of Barringtonia racemosa (Mtomondo), Milicia spp (Mvule), Alexandrian laurel (Mtondoo), Erythropholem spp (Mwavi), Antiarus spp (Mgulele), Chrisalidocarpus pembanus (Mpapindi) and Terminalia catapa (Mkungu), and mangrove forests. Avifauna recorded consists of 27 bird species in the forests, out of which the endemic species are hadada, the African goshawk, the palm-nut vulture, scops owl, the malachite kingfisher and the Pemba white-eye. Other faunal species consist of Pemba flying fox (large fruit-eating bat), the Pemba vervet monkey, the Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey,</b> hyrax, Pemba blue duiker (an antelope {{about the size of a}} hare), feral pigs (introduced by the Portuguese), the Javan civet cat (introduced by southeast Asian traders for the production of musk) and marsh mongoose (an endemic carnivore).|$|E
40|$|Chimpanzees across Africa {{include some}} meat in their diet 1. In most {{communities}} where chimpanzees {{have been studied}} over the long term, primate prey is apparently preferred over other animal prey, with <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Piliocolobus badius) comprising the most common monkey species eaten 2. At Fongoli, Senegal, {{it is likely that}} chimpanzees have never had access to <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> at this hot, dry and open site, although the range of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> (P. b. temminckii) in Senegal and adjacent countries in West Africa has diminished 3. Fongoli chimpanzees are currently not sympatric with <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> although they eat vertebrate prey of various types, including a number of primate species...|$|R
50|$|Pennant's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{have been}} little studied but their diet {{is likely to}} be similar to that of other <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> and consist mainly of fresh leaves {{supplemented}} by flowers, fruit and seeds. They have specialist teeth that can macerate leaves and break up tough but pliant unripe fruit and the seeds embedded in the flesh. Their multi-chambered stomach permits fermentation to occur and they can alternate between a leaf-based and a seed-based diet. They tend to select foliage with a high protein to fibre ratio and a low tannin content. One of their favourite food trees is Fleroya ledermannii.|$|R
50|$|There are a three primate species: vervet <b>monkeys,</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> and patas monkeys. Other mammals include antelope, squirrel, porcupine, African palm civets, mongooses, galagos, {{and several}} types of rodents, {{including}} cane rats.|$|R

50|$|Another {{remarkable}} behavior {{occurs when}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> reach their restless and somewhat nomadic adolescence. This period {{is when the}} young monkeys leave their natal troops and look for another troop to join. This is not easy, as most troops are very suspicious and can get deadly when new monkeys try to join. The <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> have adapted their behavior by joining troops of green monkeys that are near the potential <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> troops that they wish to join, and living amongst {{them in order to}} spy on their potential new families. In one notable case, an adolescent male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent two years with a green monkey troop in order to spy in safety on a prospective troop in this manner.|$|R
5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|R

The Ugandan red colobus is an Old World monkey which is found in 5 different locations across Uganda and Tanzania.|$|E
5000|$|Vundwe is {{relatively}} isolated {{and it is}} not a protected area, unlike the nearby Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve. The island has a high coral rag forest with tall trees like Adansonia digitata baobabs, which has, in recent years, started to be subjected to extensive clearing. [...] This impacts the habitat of the Zanzibar red colobus, an endangered species of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> which the island houses. The species population also declines because of poisonings.|$|E
50|$|Thollon's red colobus (Procolobus tholloni), {{also known}} as the Tshuapa red colobus, is a species of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and lower Republic of the Congo. It is found south of Congo River and west of Lomami River. It had once been {{considered}} a subspecies of the P. badius. It was recognised as a distinct species by Dandelot in 1974, and this was followed by Groves in 2001, while others have suggested it should be considered a subspecies of P. rufomitratus.|$|E
50|$|The western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius), {{also known}} as the rust <b>red</b> <b>colobus,</b> is a species of Old World monkey found in West African forests from Senegal to Ghana. All other species of red colobuses have {{formerly}} been considered subspecies of P. badius. It is often hunted by the common chimpanzee. In 1994, western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> infected many chimpanzees with Ebola virus when they were hunted and eaten by the chimpanzees.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys,</b> Pennant's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{lives in}} troops which may consist of twelve to eighty {{individuals}} occupying a territory of 25 to 150 hectares. The troops have several males and a rather {{larger number of}} females and juveniles. They move through the canopy with agility, leaping {{from tree to tree}} and making use of the elasticity of the branches. The gestation period is probably about five months before a single infant is born.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys,</b> including the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here). [...] However, other authors consider Piliocolobus to be a subgenus of Procolobus.|$|R
50|$|Bijilo forests have {{endangered}} western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey,</b> the callithrix monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus). King West National Park has baboons, and patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). The Senegal bushbaby Galago senegalensis, Campbells monkey (Cercopithecus campbelli). The River Gambia National {{park has}} chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The western red colobus (Procolobus badius) {{are a common}} sight in the Kiang West National Park, Bijilo Forest Park and Abuko Nature Reserve.

50|$|When {{body weight}} is {{controlled}} for, specialist feeders such as insectivores and frugivores have larger home ranges than generalists like some folivores (leaf eaters). Because their food source is less abundant, {{they need a}} bigger area for foraging. An example comes from the research of Tim Clutton-Brock, who found that {{the black and white}} colobus, a folivore generalist, needs a home range of only 15ha. On the other hand, the more specialized <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> has a home range of 70 ha, which it requires to find patchy shoots, flowers and fruit.|$|E
50|$|The Tana River <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> {{gets its}} name from where it resides, along forests along the {{floodplain}} in the lower Tana River in eastern Kenya, the country's longest river. The river is roughly 1,000 km long. When the river in a flood, the floodplain measures from one to six km in width, and about 60 to 100 m in width when not in a flood. Floods occur roughly once a year, with a major flood occurring every three years. Although the floodplain is mostly grassy, there are places where bushland, woodland, and forests reside.|$|E
50|$|Patas are {{believed}} to be the natural host for the virus since about 50% of wild patas monkeys have antibodies for the virus, while antibodies are much less prevalent in other simian species such as vervets and baboons. In macaques, however, infection with this virus can result in acute severe disease with high mortality. Recently, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> and red-tailed guenons have been identified as natural hosts for SHFV.|$|R
25|$|Female {{resistance}} {{has rarely}} {{been found to be}} effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult. However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. They will even try to protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mating system}} is polygynous, {{and there is}} a {{corresponding}} sexual dimorphism in size, with the males substantially the larger sex. Females normally give birth every two years, during the onset of the warm, rainy season; gestation is around five months, and the infants are born with fur and with their eyes open. Group sizes range from 10 to 40, containing only a single adult male. It is often found in groups with other species of monkeys such as the red-tailed <b>monkey</b> and various <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ulanga Valley is {{characterized}} by its large populations of large mammals such as the buffalo, elephant, hippopotamus, lion, and puku. The majority of the world's Puku population live in the Ulanga Valley. The Ulanga Valley is {{home to one of}} the largest populations of Nile crocodile in Africa and is an important breeding ground for bird species such as the African openbill, white-headed lapwing, and the African skimmer. The Ulanga Valley is also home to a number of species only found in the Valley, such as the Udzungwa <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> and three species of birds, the Ulanga weaver and two undescribed species of cisticolas.|$|E
50|$|Often {{the trip}} to Zanzibar {{is the end of}} a {{tourists}} adventure into Tanzania after either a safari expedition in the north of the mainland or after a trek to the peak of the Kilimanjaro. There are hundreds of kilometres of beach as well as coral and limestone scarps along the coast allowing safe and significant amounts of diving and snorkeling. Apart from the beaches the island has the Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park which is a mangrove swamp and is the home for the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> and home to 40 species of bird and 50 species of butterfly. Zanzibar is accessible Abeid Amani Karume International Airport and by ferry from Dar es salaam.|$|E
50|$|The Zanzibar red colobus (Procolobus kirkii) is {{a species}} of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> endemic to Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, {{off the coast of}} Tanzania. It is also known as Kirk's red colobus after Sir John Kirk, the British Resident of Zanzibar who first brought it to the {{attention}} of zoological science. It is now classified as an endangered species and in the mid-1990s was adopted as the flagship species for conservation in Zanzibar. The population trend is still decreasing, and because this species is only located in the archipelago, conservationists are attempting to work with the local government to devise a proper, effective strategy to protect the population and habitat. The species has been reclassified twice; it was previously in the genus Colobus, and more recently in the genus Procolobus.|$|E
40|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and virus {{neutralization}} assays {{indicated that}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> in Kibale National Park, western Uganda, had antibodies to {{a virus that}} was similar, but not identical, to known orthopoxviruses. The presence of a novel poxvirus in this endangered primate raises public health and conservation concerns. The virus subfamily Chordopoxviridae contains emerging pathogens of considerable concern, both because of their historic impact on global human health and because of their zoonotic potential (1). Although certain poxviruses in this subfamily {{are among the most}} extensively studied viral pathogens (e. g., smallpox, vaccinia), the natural diversity of mammalian poxviruses remains poorly characterized. This fact is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa, where at least 1 zoonotic orthopoxvirus (monkeypox) has caused sporadic human outbreaks since 1970 (2), and infected rodents exported to the United States caused a highly publicized human outbreak in 2003 (3, 4). In this study, we describe serologic evidence for a previously uncharacterized poxvirus in endangered <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Piliocolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) from Kibale National Park, western Uganda (5, 6). Our results, based on postadsorption ELISA, Western blot, and virus neutralization assays, extend our understanding of the host range and diversity of poxviruses and raise public health and conservation concerns...|$|R
