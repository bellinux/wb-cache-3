50|$|West Coast Railway {{operated}} <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{notable for}} being largely {{made up of}} 1950s locomotives and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> bought from V/Line, replacing the 1980s-built locomotives and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> that had previously operated on the line.

50|$|The Glasgow Subway <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{serves the}} Glasgow Subway, the third-oldest {{underground}} metro {{system in the}} world. The first 33 cars of the current <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was built by Metro Cammell between 1977 and 1979. Eight additional trailer cars were built in 1992. The <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> entered service when the subway re-opened after modernisation work on 16 April 1980. The <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is being refurbished ahead of new <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> being acquired {{as part of the}} upgrade to the subway. Unlike other Metro systems in the United Kingdom, the Subway has a running gauge of 4 ft (1,219 mm).|$|R
5000|$|Different {{types of}} {{railroad}} <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> have different couplers {{depending on the}} purpose and type of equipment being used and its intended destination. European <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> tend to use buffers and chain couplers while American <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> uses a Janney coupler or [...] "knuckle coupler". These are incompatible with each other, but where some railroads have obtained older, less expensive used <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> from different countries or regions, {{instead of having to}} standardize on one form of coupler, it may be useful {{to be able to use}} either type of coupler on a piece of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> without having to remove anything.|$|R
50|$|The {{privatisation}} of British Rail {{led to a}} hiatus in {{the ordering}} of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> which predictably led to the almost complete collapse of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> manufacturing industry. When purchases of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> resumed, with little remaining capacity in the UK contracts were increasingly placed overseas.|$|R
50|$|After the T&T was {{abandoned}} and torn up in 1942, {{most of the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was scrapped or shipped away for the war effort.

50|$|In 2015, {{refurbished}} Nagoya Municipal Subway 5000 series <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{began to}} arrive, adding 50% capacity to the line's existing Nagoya trains and reducing journey times. Though the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is {{in very good}} condition and will be further refurbished, the purchase was criticised by the Minister of the Interior and Transport, Florencio Randazzo, who accused the Municipal Government of buying dated <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{in contrast to the}} brand new <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> purchased by the Ministry for Buenos Aires' commuter rail network and Line A of the underground.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to permit an {{approach}} for: (1) selecting a maintenance strategy for <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> and (2) obtaining possible spare parts' quantities and replacement intervals for the components of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> The methodology adopts an analytic network process (ANP) technique for the strategy evaluation, because ANP considers the important interactions among evaluation factors. The ANP's result decides upon a proper <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance strategy formed by various combinations of preventive maintenance (PM) and corrective maintenance (CM). The ratio PM/CM, obtained by ANP, can help to predict spare parts' quantities of the components of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> The empirical result also indicates that preventive maintenance should be much more valued than corrective maintenance. In addition, safety is considered the most crucial factor for the selection of a <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance strategy. The fruit of this study serves as a reference for railway system operators when evaluating their <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance strategy and also when estimating their spare parts' quantities and replacement intervals for specific components of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> Rolling stock maintenance Maintenance strategy Spare parts Replacement interval...|$|R
50|$|High-speed rail in Czech Republic is at {{planning}} stage only. Even though České Dráhy own and operate multiple <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> capable of speeds of 200 km/h, other than Velim railway test circuit {{there is no}} infrastructure capable of speeds over 160 km/h. Czech <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> manufacturer Škoda Transportation produces high-speed <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> on regular basis.|$|R
50|$|The size of load {{that can}} be carried on a railway of a {{particular}} gauge is also influenced by {{the design of the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> Low-deck <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> can sometimes be used to carry taller 9 ft shipping containers on lower gauge lines although their low-deck <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> cannot then carry as many containers.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the economies of}} scale and the determinants of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance costs for 24 urban rail transit operators. The estimates reveal significant returns to scale in maintenance for both per car and per car kilometre. The econometric analysis also provides statistically significant cost elasticities for wages and staff hours, suggesting substitution effects between factors. Staff outsourcing is found to significantly decrease costs, whereas higher levels of fleet availability at the peak and <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> failures increase it. The effect {{of the age of}} <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> and the network is negligible on <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance costs; however, the analysis reveals a downward trend in <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> costs among the metros in the CoMET and Nova consortia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} {{maintaining}} <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is to perform train service without failure during operation. It {{is not possible}} to prevent failure, however, by using periodic preventive maintenance methods, because new <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is made from many electric components and requires the application of IT skills. RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety) methods have consequently been applied to new manufactured <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> in KORAIL since implementation of the KTX. With this approach it is possible to verify the reliability at the operating stage, and RCM (Reliability Centered Maintenance) methods for maintenance have been applied to manufactured <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> since the beginning of KTX ser-vice.

25|$|As railway {{lines have}} been {{transferred}} to London Overground operation, services are sometimes operated using <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> inherited from the previous train operating company, and for a temporary period these trains have been branded with transitional livery until they are replaced with newer <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> When the first London Overground services began, they were operated using Silverlink <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> which retained Silverlink's purple and lime green livery with yellow doors.

40|$|The routing of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> depends {{strongly}} on the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> {{assignment to}} different operations and the shunting schedule.
