In this context, the main contribution of the present article is the establishment of correctness results proving component-based systems <b>reconﬁgurations</b> using graph grammars. New guarded <b>reconﬁgurations</b> allow us to build <b>reconﬁgurations</b> based on primitive reconﬁguration operations using sequences of <b>reconﬁgurations</b> and the alternative and the repetitive constructs, while preserving conﬁguration consistency. A practical contribution consists of {{the implementation of a}} component-based model using the GROOVE graph transformation tool. Then, after enriching the model with interpreted conﬁgurations and <b>reconﬁgurations</b> in a consistency compatible manner, a simulation relation is exploited to validate component systems’ implementations. This sound implementation is illustrated on a cloud-based multitier application hosting environment managed as a component-based system. </p...|$|R
40|$|SOFA 2 is a {{component}} system employing hierarchically composed components in distributed environment. It contains concepts, which allow for specifying dynamic <b>reconfigurations</b> of component architectures at runtime, which {{is essential for}} virtually any real-life application. The dynamic <b>reconfigurations</b> comprise creating/disposing components and creating/disposing connections between components. In contrast to majority of component systems, SOFA 2 is able to specify possible architectural <b>reconfigurations</b> in the application architecture at design time. This allows SOFA 2 runtime to follow the dynamic behavior of the application and reflect the behavior in architectural <b>reconfigurations.</b> The goal of this thesis is to reify these concepts of dynamic <b>reconfigurations</b> {{in the implementation of}} SOFA 2 and demonstrate their usage on a demo application...|$|R

This paper deals with the formal specification and verification of dynamic <b>reconfigurations</b> of those systems using architectural constraints and temporal logic patterns. The proposals of the paper are applied to the Fractal component model.

5|$|When flux tubes {{loaded with}} the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, they go through a {{reconnection}} process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma. The former returns to the inner magnetosphere {{in the form of}} flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of plasmoids—large blobs of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global <b>reconfiguration</b> events also observed by the Galileo probe, which occurred regularly every 2–3 days. The <b>reconfiguration</b> events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co-rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere. The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.|$|E

5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This <b>reconfiguration</b> allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E

The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985.

30|$|The paper {{discussed}} {{an architectural}} adaptation strategy for systems able to self-adapt {{in accordance to}} the surrounding environment. It is based on two phases: one offline, where <b>reconfigurations</b> are planned and organised; and another online, that takes advantage of such organisation of <b>reconfigurations</b> to autonomously choose one and adapt the system, {{as part of a}} monitoring feedback loop. This strategy acts on top of a concrete framework that allows the software architect to model and apply <b>reconfigurations</b> and to formally verify and reason about functional and non-functional (quantitative/probabilistic) requirements of the system architecture. We highlight the use of formal models to represent the coordination layer of a software system. Through source-to-source transformation techniques these models are transformed into suitable quantitative models, enabling runtime verification of both non-functional and functional requirements of the system. This plays a crucial role in triggering adaptations, and, in general, in the maintenance of software architecture quality, and system consistency upon dynamic <b>reconfigurations.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the formal {{specification}} and verification of dynamic <b>reconfigurations</b> of component-based systems. To validate such complex systems, {{there is a need}} to check model consistency and also to ensure that dynamic <b>reconfigurations</b> satisfy architectural and integrity constraints, invariants, and also temporal constraints over (re) configuration sequences. As architectural constraints involve first-order formulae, and a behavioural semantics of <b>reconfigurations</b> gives rise to infinite state systems, we propose to associate proof and model-checking within the well-established B method, to support the modelling of such systems and the (partial-) validation of their dynamic <b>reconfigurations.</b> The objective of the paper is twofold. First, given a hierarchical B model of component-based architectures, we validate it by proving its consistency. Second, given linear temporal logic formulae expressing the desirable dynamic behaviour of the system, we validate reconfigurable system architectures by using bounded model-checking tools supporting the B method.

5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental <b>reconfiguration,</b> the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy <b>reconfiguration</b> of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E
