40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an overall {{evaluation of the}} concept of inline injection pump for pressure 120 MPa. The name of this pump is "Mj" and it {{is a product of the}} Motorpal, a. s. company. This thesis also contains an analysis of the contact pressures between the cam lobe and the pumping element's <b>roller</b> <b>tappet.</b> This includes comparing three different shapes of the roller and their influence on the magnitude of contact pressures. Calculations of the plunger helix and of the fuel delivery's impact on the relative position of plunger are also present...|$|E
40|$|The {{method for}} {{reduction}} of valve timing movable masses, {{by the use}} of composite cams for camshaft, which mate with <b>roller</b> <b>tappet,</b> is presented. It has been carried out an analysis of stresses under the surface of the cam using the methodology and computer programs allowing the synthesis and analysis of the cam mechanism, and to estimate the fatigue life, as well as using the finite element method. Mating roller tappets with a light camshaft, forged from TiAl alloy, can be done if the camshaft has steel caps set under the pressure on the surfaces their cams. The problem, however, is the formation of high stress in the Bielaiev point, when a <b>roller</b> <b>tappet</b> mates with segment cam. Because of the certainty for the cap fixing, it is assumed that the depth for the Bielaiev point should not exceed half the thickness of the cap. The stress analysis shows, that exceeding of the material yield strength is controlled by the interference value between the cam and its cap and by the apex radius of the cam. Effect of contact stress is at least an order of magnitude smaller. The maximum depth of the Bielaiev point does not exceed 0. 09 mm, which is about half the thickness of the proposed cap. There is a need not for too small radii between the cam and the apical cap. Optimal selection of proper geometry of the cam will be easier after a proper modification of the program used for the synthesis and analysis of the cam mechanism, such {{that it is possible to}} ask any operational surface of the cam profile...|$|E
50|$|The Algol had {{a single}} pair of {{overhead}} inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder. The cam-ring drove <b>roller</b> <b>tappets,</b> mounted in the cam-case, which in turn operated rocker arms, fitted with ball bearings, via pushrods. The cam-ring was concentric with the crankshaft and driven via epicyclic gears.|$|R

The cam-rings drove <b>roller</b> <b>tappets,</b> mounted in the cam-case, which in turn operated rocker arms, fitted with ball bearings, via pushrods. The cam-rings were concentric with the crankshaft and driven via epicyclic gears. Most Antarès were conventionally aspirated via a single carburettor.|$|R
25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a throttle body injector system with a tuned intake manifold and dual electronic ignition, or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} throttle body injector to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour time between overhauls. Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and <b>roller</b> <b>tappets.</b>|$|R

50|$|Designated EGA, the 3.3 {{was built}} at Trenton Engine in Trenton, Michigan. It uses SFI fuel injection, has <b>roller</b> <b>tappets</b> and {{features}} forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and either a cast aluminum or reinforced plastic intake manifold. The 3.3 has a timing chain, {{and is an}} interference engine meaning that the valves will collide with the pistons {{in the event of}} a timing chain failure. Unlike the 3.5 on which the water pump is driven by the timing belt, on the 3.3, the accessory belt drives the water pump.|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} of the 60° engine {{was introduced in the}} 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. Like its predecessors it continued to utilized an overhead valve configuration with 2 valves per cylinder, a cast iron cylinder block, aluminum cylinder heads, and an aluminum intake manifold. However, the heads and intake manifold were redesigned for better air flow, the cylinder block was stiffened, and the flat-tappets of the generation I and II engines were replaced with <b>roller</b> <b>tappets.</b> This generation also came standard with sequential multiport fuel injection and structural oil pan.|$|R

50|$|The 239 V6 is a 239 cuin L V6 {{released}} in 1987 {{for use in}} the Dodge Dakota and a replacement for the older, longer slant-6. It is essentially a six-cylinder version of the 318 V8. Output was 125 hp (93 kW) and 195 lbft Nm until it was replaced by the Magnum 3.9 starting in 1992. In 1987 it used a two-barrel Holley carburetor and hydraulic tappets. In 1988 it was upgraded with throttle-body fuel injection and <b>roller</b> <b>tappets</b> which it retained until the 1992 Magnum update. Then in the 1992 Magnum update, the throttle-body fuel injection was upgraded to a multi-point fuel injection. The engine was produced through 2004 before it was replaced with the 3.7L Power Tech V6.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the past}} 10 [...] 15 years, ceramic {{hardware}} has been fabricated and {{tested in a}} number of piston engine applications including valves, piston pins, <b>roller</b> followers, <b>tappet</b> shims, and other wear components. It has been shown that, with proper design and installation, ceramics improve performance, fuel economy, and wear and corrosion resistance. These results have been obtained using rig and road tests on both stock and race engines. Selected summaries of these tests are presented in this review paper...|$|R
50|$|The {{shuttle is}} thrown by two levers {{attached}} to the side frame, but activated by a friction <b>roller</b> on the <b>tappet</b> shaft. As the shuttle enters the shuttle-box {{at the end of}} its travel, it depresses a lever which acts as a brake. If this lever is not depressed then the loom is stopped.|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use <b>roller</b> <b>tappets</b> in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
50|$|The Monosoupape had no {{carburetor}} or throttle, {{and since}} most of its air supply was taken in through the exhaust valve, {{it could not be}} controlled by adjusting the air supply to the crankcase like other rotaries. Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve <b>tappet</b> <b>rollers,</b> but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.2 Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. Some later Monosoupapes were fitted with a selector switch which allowed the pilot to cut out three or six cylinders instead of all nine when hitting the blip switch, so that each cylinder fired only once per three engine revolutions but the engine remained in perfect balance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced inlet valves in the pistons {{by using a}} single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve <b>tappet</b> <b>rollers,</b> a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R
