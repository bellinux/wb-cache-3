5|$|A {{total of}} 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the <b>round</b> <b>number</b> {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1919 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; a few were used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a premium {{to help pay for}} local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.|$|E
5|$|TETCO was {{the brainchild}} of {{corporate}} lawyers Charles Francis and James Elkins, who convinced the construction specialists George and Herman Brown, and the fuel engineer E. Holley Poe, that buying the Big and Little Inch pipelines could be a lucrative opportunity. The corporation was established specifically {{for the purposes of the}} bid, and came to their bidding figure by estimating that the likely competition would bid at $130 million; their own figure exceeded this by 10 percent, and added on $127,000 to avoid a suspiciously <b>round</b> <b>number.</b> TETCO believed it could afford to make this offer because it intended to reuse the electric motors in the oil pumping mechanisms for moving the natural gas; it also believed that the price of gas would rise considerably in the post-war markets.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 200,112 half {{dollars in}} October 1920, with the excess above the <b>round</b> <b>number</b> {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were shipped to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the profits {{to go to the}} tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, and there was no thought at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. The recession of 1921 began soon after; sales dropped, {{and tens of thousands of}} both dates remained unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.|$|E

25|$|Between 2700 and 2000 BC, in Sumer, {{the round}} stylus was {{gradually}} {{replaced by a}} reed stylus {{that was used to}} press wedge-shaped cuneiform signs in clay. These cuneiform number signs resembled the <b>round</b> <b>number</b> signs they replaced and retained the additive sign-value notation of the <b>round</b> <b>number</b> signs. These systems gradually converged on a common sexagesimal number system; this was a place-value system consisting of only two impressed marks, the vertical wedge and the chevron, which could also represent fractions. This sexagesimal number system was fully developed {{at the beginning of the}} Old Babylonia period (about 1950BC) and became standard in Babylonia.|$|E

At the K-1 World Grand Prix '99 Opening Round, the qualifying round for the 1999 K-1 WGP, on October 5, 1999, he took a unanimous decision victory over Lloyd van Dams. In the quarter-finals of the K-1 Grand Prix '99 Final Round on December 5, 1999, Aerts went up against Jérôme Le Banner for the third time. Just fifteen seconds into the first round, he dropped the big Frenchman with a high kick. Although dazed and clearly hurt, Le Banner was able to make the count and came back to knock Aerts out with a devastating left hook at just over the one minute-mark of <b>round</b> <b>number</b> one, sending the reigning champion crashing out of the tournament.|$|E

500|$|A {{total of}} 40,034 Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during January and February 1927, with the excess over the <b>round</b> <b>number</b> {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1928 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were distributed by local banks, which charged $1 per coin, and they sold principally to Vermonters. [...] The distribution was coordinated by the Bennington Battle Monument and Historical Association of Bennington, Vermont. Four banks in Bennington each received 2,000 coins for distribution, as did four banks in Rutland. In 1929, the Bennington group was selling the coins by mail at a charge of $1.25 per coin by registered mail and $1 per coin for ten or more if the buyer paid for conveyance by an express company.|$|E
500|$|The most heated argument, however, was {{the issue}} of US60. [...] The Joint Board had {{assigned}} that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to Oklahoma City, from where it ran west to Los Angeles. Kentucky strongly objected to this designated route, {{as it had been}} left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the US62 designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of US52 east of Ashland, Kentucky, as US60. They assigned US62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US60. [...] But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs. [...] A compromise was proposed, in which US60 would split at Springfield, Missouri, into US60E and US60N, but both sides objected. [...] The final solution resulted in the assignment of US66 to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly <b>round</b> <b>number.</b> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.|$|E

2500|$|In {{each round}} {{at least four}} hands are played, with each player taking the {{position}} of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players don't physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the <b>round</b> <b>number.</b> (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Psychological pricing (also price ending, charm pricing) is a pricing/marketing {{strategy}} {{based on}} the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. Retail prices are often expressed as [...] "odd prices": a little less than a <b>round</b> <b>number,</b> e.g. $19.99 or £2.98. There's evidence that consumers tend to perceive “odd prices” as being significantly lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit. Thus, prices such as $1.99 are associated with spending $1 rather than $2. The theory that drives this is that lower pricing such as this institutes greater demand than if consumers were perfectly rational. Psychological pricing is one cause of price points.|$|E

[...] There had been little advance publicity of the coins, and the exposition took place during the Recession of 1921. All of the 2★4 coins were sold, and when sales slowed of the plain variety, 29,600 were returned to the mint for melting, likely all plain. Early advertisements for the coin contained sketches prepared by Aitken, showing the obverse as issued, but depicting a reverse bearing the state Seal of Missouri, that Aitken had abandoned when he found it did not work well.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{subsequent}} period of sixty-two weeks—during {{which time the}} city is rebuilt (verse 25b)—an [...] "anointed one shall be cut off" [...] (verse 26a); this [...] "anointed one" [...] is generally considered to refer to Onias III, whose death {{at the hands of}} Seleucid officials outside Jerusalem in 171/0 BCE is recorded in 2 Maccabees 4:23-28. The identification is further supported by the fact that most critical scholars see another reference to Onias III's murder in Daniel 11:22, though Ptolemy VI and the infant son of Seleucus IV have also been suggested. On the other hand, the identification of the latter [...] "anointed one" [...] with Onias III raises the question of how 7 + 62 = 69 weeks of years (or 483 years) could have elapsed between the departure of the [...] "word" [...] in verse 25a—which is not earlier than 605/4 BCE—and the murder of Onias III in 171/0 BCE. Hence, some critical scholars follow Montgomery in thinking that there has been [...] "a chronological miscalculation on [...] part of the writer," [...] who is then criticized for making [...] "wrong-headed arithmetical calculations;" [...] while others like Goldingay are not inclined to see this as a [...] "chronological miscalculation" [...] on the basis that the seventy weeks are not an exercise in literal chronology, but the more inexact science of [...] "chronography." [...] Collins opts for something like a middle-ground position in saying that [...] "the figure should be considered a <b>round</b> <b>number</b> rather than a miscalculation." [...] And there are still others who see the calculations as being at least approximately correct so long as the initial seven week period of forty-nine years can overlap with the sixty-two week period of 434 years, with the latter period spanning the time between Jeremiah's prophecy in 605/4 BCE and Onias III's murder in 171/0 BCE.|$|E
