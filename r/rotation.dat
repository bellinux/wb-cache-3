5|$|A precise {{value for}} the <b>rotation</b> period of the {{interior}} remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, Cassini found that the radio <b>rotation</b> period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately 10hr 45min 45sec (±36sec). The latest estimate of Saturn's <b>rotation</b> (as an indicated <b>rotation</b> rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini, Voyager and Pioneer probes was reported in September 2007 is 10hr 32min 35sec.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential <b>rotation.</b> The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour <b>rotation</b> of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the <b>rotation</b> period is 12hours. This differential <b>rotation</b> is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of plane <b>rotations</b> in {{orthogonal}} factorizations has been increasing in popularity. This is {{in part due to}} modifications which enable computations with plane <b>rotations</b> to be carried out more quickly and in part due to the use of plane <b>rotations</b> in updating matrix factorizations and in other sparse applications. A review of Jacobi, Givens and modified plane <b>rotations</b> and of products of plane <b>rotations</b> is given. The review includes discussion of the computational details required to avoid underflow and overflow when computing plane <b>rotations,</b> storage of plane <b>rotations</b> and the stability of plane <b>rotations.</b> Mention is also made of the possibility of using plane <b>rotations</b> for pivoting...|$|R
5|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} in the 1900s gave the first {{clues about the}} Venusian <b>rotation.</b> Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any <b>rotation.</b> He surmised the planet must have a much longer <b>rotation</b> period than had previously been thought. Later work in the 1950s showed the <b>rotation</b> was retrograde. Radar observations of Venus were first {{carried out in the}} 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the <b>rotation</b> period, which were close to the modern value.|$|E
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the <b>rotation</b> rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the <b>rotation</b> rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the <b>rotation</b> rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the <b>rotation</b> rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have <b>rotation</b> rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a <b>rotation</b> period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal <b>rotation</b> rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a <b>rotation</b> period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E

5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential <b>rotation.</b> The <b>rotation</b> of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the <b>rotation</b> of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official <b>rotation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crop <b>rotation</b> is, {{however, the}} most {{important}} cultural control of L. decemlineata. <b>Rotation</b> may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of <b>rotation.</b> However they have relatively low rates of <b>rotation</b> compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of <b>rotation</b> for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The <b>rotation</b> rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E

For the Sumatra earthquake (Fig.  3), large coseismic <b>rotations</b> are observed between 4 °N and 7 °N, where the largest mainshock slip occurred, while some <b>rotations</b> extend to the northern end of the rupture at about 13 °N.

5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} <b>rotation</b> rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential <b>rotation</b> of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid <b>rotation,</b> so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the <b>rotation</b> rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's <b>rotation</b> rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus.
