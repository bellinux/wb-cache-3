25|$|Immediately {{after the}} earthquake, the electricity-producing Reactors 1, 2, and 3 {{automatically}} shut down their sustained fission reactions by inserting control rods in a legally-mandated safety procedure {{referred to as}} SCRAM, which ceases the reactors' normal <b>running</b> <b>conditions.</b> As the reactors were unable to generate power to run their own coolant pumps, emergency diesel generators came online, as designed, to power electronics and coolant systems. These operated nominally until the tsunami destroyed the generators for Reactors 1–5. The two generators cooling Reactor 6 were undamaged and were sufficient to be pressed into service to cool the neighboring Reactor 5 along with their own reactor, averting the overheating issues that Reactor 4 suffered.|$|E
2500|$|... 87002 Royal Sovereign is {{preserved}} by the AC Locomotive Group, {{and has been}} returned to main line <b>running</b> <b>conditions.</b> Due to the new contract for the Caledonian Sleeper won by the Serco in 2014, 87002 has been selected to help bring the empty coaching stock {{in and out of}} London Euston. It was painted in February 2015 into Caledonian blue ready for the new contract. From 31 March 2015, 87002 shunts the empty sleeper coaching stock into London Euston alongside 86101 as part of the Serco Caledonian Sleeper contract. 87002 can also be used on mainline sleeper services if required.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, {{it became}} {{possible}} to operate an express {{all the way}} from Christchurch to Invercargill in a single day. [...] The Dunedin-Invercargill run was treated {{as an extension of the}} Christchurch-Dunedin express, and the train was sometimes called the Invercargill Express. [...] In March 1914, it was possible to travel from Christchurch to Invercargill in thirteen hours. [...] AB class locomotives capable of speeds of 107km/h and higher took over from the A and Q locomotives from 1915, but in the 1930 and wartime maximum, SIMT speed was limited to 50mph and track and <b>running</b> <b>conditions</b> did not allow the acceleration of the late 1940s when the express at its zenith reached sustained speeds on the Plains [...] of 72-3mph and became the South Island Limited.|$|E

It was also the first V8 engine to use variable valve lift (Valvetronic). The variable valve lift replaces throttle butterflies (during normal <b>running</b> <b>conditions)</b> for added response, efficiency and power.|$|E
50|$|Diesel exhausts, {{long known}} for their {{characteristic}} smells, changed significantly with the reduction of sulfur content of diesel fuel, and again when catalytic converters were introduced in exhaust systems.

50|$|Minimalist {{shoes are}} shoes {{intended}} to closely approximate barefoot <b>running</b> <b>conditions.</b> They have reduced cushioning, thin soles, and are of lighter weight than other running shoes, allowing for more sensory contact for the {{foot on the}} ground while simultaneously providing the feet with some protection from ground hazards and conditions (such as pebbles and dirt). Research shows that wearing a minimalist shoe can help improve foot strength and arch function.|$|E
