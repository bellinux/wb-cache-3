5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of the solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E

40|$|Particle {{diffusion}} in <b>rotating</b> <b>drums</b> is studied via {{computer simulations}} using a full 3 -D model {{which does not}} involve any arbitrary input parameters. The diffusion coefficient for single-component systems agree qualitatively with previous experimental results. On the other hand, the diffusion coefficient for two-component systems is {{shown to be a}} highly nonlinear function of the rotation velocity. It is suggested that this results from a competition between the diffusive motion parallel to, and flowing motion perpendicular to the axis of rotation. (Published in: Journal de Physique I 5, 1551 (1995).) 1 Introduction <b>Rotating</b> <b>drums</b> perform critical functions in many industrial processes. They are utilized for tasks such as humidification, dehumidification, convective heat transfer, facilitation of gas-solid catalytic reactions and, not the least, ordinary mixing or blending. Understanding the mechanisms behind particle mobility in <b>rotating</b> <b>drums</b> is an important step towards refining [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The stencil {{duplicator}} or mimeograph machine is a low-cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Once prepared, the stencil is {{wrapped around the}} ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Thomas Alva Edison invented the mimeograph in 1875.|$|E
25|$|Most {{spinning}} {{today is}} done using Break or Open-end spinning, {{this is a}} technique where the staples are blown by air into a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum,</b> where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces. This method has replaced the older methods of ring and mule spinning. It also is easily adapted for artificial fibres.|$|E
25|$|In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University {{developed}} and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942, the first electronic digital calculating device. This design was also all-electronic, and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> for memory. However, its paper card writer/reader was unreliable, {{and work on}} the machine was discontinued. The machine's special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable, stored program distinguish it from modern computers.|$|E

50|$|An {{inherent}} {{safety concern}} is that if power to the <b>rotating</b> <b>drums</b> was lost—even if thrust was maintained—the aircraft would lose its ability to generate lift as the drum slowed down {{and it would not}} be able to sustain flight.|$|R
25|$|A simple {{seismometer}} that {{is sensitive}} to up-down motions of the earth can be understood by visualizing a weight hanging on a spring. The spring and weight are suspended from a frame that moves along with the earthʼs surface. As the earth moves, the relative motion between the weight and the earth provides {{a measure of the}} vertical ground motion. If a recording system is installed, such as a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> attached to the frame, and a pen attached to the mass, this relative motion between the weight and earth can be recorded to produce a history of ground motion, called a seismogram.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{tracking}} device {{is a tool}} created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of electromagnetic energy was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare {{was the first to}} use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's upper eyelid. The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying membrane and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually. In 1889, Edmund B. Delabarre invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> by means of a stylus with a direct mechanical connection to the cornea. Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of the eyes were developed and used {{from the end of the}} 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and eye caps.|$|E
500|$|As {{well as the}} 122A and 147A reissues, Hammond-Suzuki {{now makes}} smaller and {{transportable}} Leslies using modern technology. The 2101 is [...] high and has a rotating horn as found on the 122 and 147, along {{with a pair of}} [...] compression drivers and two [...] woofers. The unit provides two separate inputs so different instruments can be plugged into the rotary and stationary components respectively. The 2121 is a [...] stationary speaker that uses digital signal processing to emulate the <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> found in older Leslies. The 3300 {{is the same as the}} 2121, but with a 300 watt power amplifier.|$|E
40|$|Segregation in <b>rotating</b> <b>drums</b> is studied {{experimentally}} in two {{and three}} dimensions with unexpected results. In the first case, {{we find that the}} spatial grain distribution oscillates between uniform and segregated states when the <b>drum</b> <b>rotates</b> below the fluidization regime. In three dimensions we find the startling result that the system axially segregates at (very) long times, and that the previously reported patterns are long lived transients...|$|R
50|$|Yet another {{process that}} is gaining ground with startup {{companies}} (especially in Australia, United States and Japan) is heat compression, which takes all unsorted, cleaned plastic in all forms, from soft plastic bags to hard industrial waste, and mixes the load in tumblers (large <b>rotating</b> <b>drums</b> resembling giant clothes dryers). The most obvious benefit to this method is that all plastic is recyclable, not just matching forms. However, criticism rises from the energy costs of <b>rotating</b> the <b>drums,</b> and heating the post-melt pipes.|$|R
50|$|The Sentmanat extensional {{rheometer}} (SER) {{is actually}} a fixture that can be field installed on shear rheometers. A film of polymer is wound on two <b>rotating</b> <b>drums,</b> which apply constant or variable strain rate extensional deformation on the polymer film. The stress is determined from the torque exerted by the drums.|$|R
500|$|Julian Mack and Berlyn Brixner were {{responsible}} for photography. The photography group employed some fifty different cameras, taking motion and still photographs. Special Fastax cameras taking 10,000 frames per second would record the minute details of the explosion. Spectrograph cameras would record the wavelengths of light emitted by the explosion, and pinhole cameras would record gamma rays. A <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> spectrograph at the [...] station would obtain the spectrum over the first hundredth of a second. Another, slow recording one would track the fireball. Cameras were placed in bunkers only [...] from the tower, protected by steel and lead glass, and mounted on sleds {{so they could be}} towed out by the lead-lined tank. Some observers brought their own cameras despite the security. Segré brought in Jack Aeby's 35mm Perfex 44. It would take the only known well-exposed color photograph of the detonation explosion.|$|E
500|$|Leslie {{worked as}} a radio service {{engineer}} at Barker Brothers Department Store in Los Angeles, which sold and repaired Hammond organs. He bought one in 1937, hoping {{it would be a}} suitable substitute for a pipe organ. He was disappointed, however, with the sound in his home compared to the large showroom where he originally heard it. Consequently, he attempted to design a speaker to overcome this. He initially tried making a cabinet similar to Hammond's, but soon concluded that pipe organs produced a spacially varied sound because of the different location of each pipe. He set out to emulate this by making a moving speaker. He tried various combinations of speakers and speeds, and discovered that a single one running at what's now known as the [...] "tremolo" [...] speed worked best. After further experimentation, he decided that splitting the signal into a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> and horn helped accentuate bass and treble frequencies.|$|E
500|$|During 1869, an {{improved}} model was designed which, unlike the previous version, drew upon {{work done by}} other inventors. A machine patented in 1833 by Charles Thurber, for example, used a cylindrical platen. Sholes adapted the idea and implemented a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> to which the paper was clipped, replacing {{the frame of the}} previous model. Soule and Glidden did not assist development of the new platen and, as their interest in the venture was waning, sold their rights to the original machine to Sholes and Densmore. Prototypes were sent to professionals in various fields, including James O. Clephane, a stenographer whose heavy use destroyed several machines. Clephane's feedback, although [...] "caustic", {{led to the development of}} an additional 25 to 30prototypes, each an improvement on its predecessor. In summer 1870, Densmore traveled to New York to demonstrate the machine to Western Union, which was looking for a method to record telegrams. Western Union ordered several machines, but declined to purchase the rights, as it believed a superior device could be developed for less than Densmore's asking price of $50,000.|$|E

2500|$|Longwall mining {{accounts}} for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of [...] or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> that moves mechanically {{back and forth across}} a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls onto an armored chain conveyor or pan line that takes the coal to the conveyor belt for removal from the work area. Longwall systems have their own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining progresses. As the longwall mining equipment moves forward, overlying rock that is no longer supported by coal is allowed to fall behind the operation in a controlled manner. The supports make possible high levels of production and safety. Sensors detect how much coal remains in the seam while robotic controls enhance efficiency. Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed, usually 75 percent of the section, the roof is allowed to collapse in a safe manner.|$|E
2500|$|Yes {{toured the}} album across Europe and North America between November 1973 and April 1974, with a two-hour set of Close to the Edge (1972) and Tales from Topographic Oceans {{performed}} {{in their entirety}} plus encores. The set was altered as it progressed, with [...] "The Revealing Science of God" [...] dropped for some early shows in 1974 and [...] "The Remembering" [...] removed completely from March. The band brought {{four times as much}} stage equipment than their previous tours which included an elaborate stage designed by Roger Dean and his brother Martyn with fibreglass structures, dry ice effects, a <b>rotating</b> <b>drum</b> platform, and a tunnel that the band emerged from. During one show, the structure around White that opened and closed failed to operate which left him trapped inside. White claimed the incident was behind a scene depicted in This Is Spinal Tap (1984). The UK leg included five consecutive sell out nights at the Rainbow Theatre in London which marked the first time a rock band achieved the feat. During the North American leg, Yes played two sell out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City that grossed $200,000. The band spent £5,000 on a hot air balloon, decorated with the album's artwork, which was tethered in each city they performed in the US.|$|E
