40|$|Summary. Plasma {{melatonin}} {{was measured}} at the summer and winter solstices and the autumn and spring equinoxes in <b>Romney</b> Marsh <b>sheep</b> held under natural conditions in South Australia (35 =deg). The amount of melatonin detected was generally related {{to the extent of}} natural darkness, though the melatonin onset was particularly delayed after dusk in winter compared with other seasons. The duration of detectable melatonin was shorter in summer than at any other season. After each initial 24 h sampling, the sheep were resampled for a further 24 h in acutely extended darkness to mark the phase and duration of suprachiasmatic nuclei activity which {{is believed to be the}} source of the melatonin signal. The onset of high plasma melatonin was earlier than the time of natural sunset in spring and summer, but not different from the time of natural sunset in autumn and winter. The offset of high plasma melatonin was later than the time of natural sunrise at all times of year and particularly so in summer. Under the extended dark conditions, the duration of detectable melatonin was longer than that under natural photoperiod at all seasons of the year and the duration of melatonin was again shorter in summer than winter. If melatonin measurements under the conditions of extended darkness do reflect the phase and duration of suprachiasmatic nuclei function then the natural light of the photoperiod can, particularly during long photoperiod conditions, mask the expression of the pacemaker. The findings may have implications for the timing of the breeding season in <b>Romney</b> Marsh <b>sheep...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The most {{successful}} breed {{raised in the}} early 19th century was the Spanish breed of Merino. It was bred on the South Island for many years.

40|$|The Tibetan Argali (Ovis ammon hodgsoni), a {{wild sheep}} of the {{subfamily}} Caprinae (Bovidae), primarily {{found in the}} Tibetan Plateau, is categorized as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. For the conservation of this species, we have achieved the cloning of a full-term live Argali lamb (died shortly after birth) from a male Argali cell line that has been cryopreserved for more than 20 years. While working towards the goal of cloning a live Argali, we also recognised the need to establish a reproductive herd of animals by producing both fertile males and females. However, {{as in the case}} of Argali, it is difficult, and in some cases impossible, to obtain male and female cell lines from an endangered mammalian species. Therefore, for demonstrating a proof of concept of using an assisted reproduction technology (ART) for the conservation of endangered species or reviving extinct species, we used the Argali as an experimental model to produce both fertile males and females through ART. The Sry gene plays a central role in mammalian sex determination: mutations in the Sry gene result in the development of XY females; in mice, Sry knockout (KO) results in fertile XY females. Therefore, we created sex-reversed Argali cell lines through the KO of the Sry gene. In parallel, for potentially comparing the fertility of sex-reversed XY females between the Argali and domestic sheep [Romney (Ovis aries) ], we also knocked out the Sry gene in the domestic sheep. Specifically, we used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /Cas system to introduce mutations to the high-mobility group (HMG) box of the Sry gene. Skin fibroblasts from either adult Argali or <b>Romney</b> <b>sheep</b> were cultured in DMEM (HyClone) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were harvested at 100 % confluence with 0. 25 % trypsin-EDTA and transfected with the CRISPR/Cas DNA constructs by using the Amaxa Nucleofector system. For each experiment, 106 cells were transfected with 5 μg of CRISPR/Cas DNA constructs. After 72 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, with half being used for genomic DNA isolation (for examining KO efficiency) and the other half for limited dilution for obtaining single-cell-derived colonies. With the Surveyor assay and a restriction enzyme digestion assay (successfully knocked-out cells lose the Dde I site in the HMG box of the Sry gene, rendering resistance to Dde I digestion), we demonstrated that the Sry KO efficiency was about 10 % both in Argali and <b>Romney</b> <b>sheep.</b> By screening single-cell-derived colonies from the transfected <b>Romney</b> <b>sheep</b> cells, an Sry-KO cell line harboring a 2 -nucleotide deletion in the HMG box was successfully established.

It was concluded that in the arid range areas efforts should be concentrated on crossbreeding the Dorper sheep with the local breeds, except in the areas of poorest potential, where development should be through selection of local animals. Similarly the Galla goat should be crossed with the local breeds of Small East African goat with the aim of producing an improved meat breed.

Airway hypersensitivity induced by Ascaris suum extract in New Zealand <b>Romney</b> <b>sheep.</b> New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 38 (2), 57 - 61. This study aimed {{to establish an}} animal model for human bronchial asthma using locally bred <b>Romney</b> <b>sheep.</b> It was then planned {{to determine whether or}} not morphological and inflammatory factors in the ovine respiratory tract are associated with a predisposition to allergic bronchial hypersensitivity induced by inhaled Ascaris suum antigen. The skin and airway responses to a commercial A. suum antigen were tested in adult <b>Romney</b> <b>sheep</b> from two local farms with and without previous exposure to pigs. Ninety percent of 101 adult sheep tested showed an immediate skin reaction, and about 70 % of 43 adult sheep with positive skin reactions showed an immediate airway response, reflected as a significant increase in airway resistance and/or decreased dynamic lung compliance. Among these 43 sheep, 21 showed changes in both airway resistance and dynamic lung compliance (Group A); ten only in dynamic lung compliance (Group B) and 12 were non-responders (Group C). No significant changes were recorded when the same animals were given an aerosol of phosphate buffered saline. Although the sheep with previous exposure to pigs showed significantly greater skin reactions than those without exposure to pigs, they showed no significant differences in airway response to antigen inhalation. In addition, there was no correlation between the degree of skin reaction and the magnitude of bronchoconstriction. Since no information was available on the respiratory tract-associated lymphoid tissue and cells in healthy sheep, study of this tissue and its associated epithelium was a prerequisite for studies of the morphological and inflammatory mechanisms involved in the development of allergic airway hypersensitivity. The ovine respiratory tract has five forms of lymphoid tissue; intra-luminal, intraepithelial, scattered forms, and dense and nodular aggregations; the dense and nodular aggregations being confined to the pharyngeal tonsil and bronchioles. Morphologically well-developed lymphoepithelium (M cells) is present only in the pharyngeal tonsil region, and absent in the lower respiratory tract. The M cell of the ovine pharyngeal tonsil is ultrastructurally and functionally similar to that in other mucosal tissues of this and other species, but its development and maturation takes place earlier than the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. Mast cells in the lower respiratory tract of normal sheep are morphologically heterogeneous, and both formalin-sensitive and formalin-resistant types can be identified. The morphological and histochemical features of formalin-sensitive mast cells are similar to those from the human respiratory tract in several respects which enhances the use of the sheep model in the study of human allergic respiratory disease. A morphometric comparison of airway structure and inflammatory components was conducted between the three groups of sheep with varying airway hypersensitivity. The epithelium of the small airways was significantly thinner and contained fewer goblet cells in the hypersensitive sheep (Groups A and B; than in non-reacting sheep (Group C). Mast cells from the hypersensitive sheep had a significantly greater volume density of secretory granules than those from non-reacting sheep. However, no morphological difference was found in the epithelial integrity of airways between hypersensitive and non-reacting sheep, and the permeability of tracheobronchial epithelium to horseradish peroxidase was of the same order in all groups. Similarly, the airway wall was not significantly thicker in hypersensitive sheep than in non-reacting sheep, and the shortening of smooth muscle required to cause complete airway closure was similar. The numerical density of mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes in the airways and lung was not significantly different between the groups. These observations indicate that the Ascaris-induced airway response seen in <b>Romney</b> <b>sheep</b> is similar in several respects to that seen in human asthmatics and these sheep can therefore be used as an animal model to study human asthma. The current findings suggest that the presence of relatively low goblet cell density, thin epithelium, and high volume density of mast cell secretory granules in the small airways and lung may be important inherent factors responsible for the development of airway hypersensitivity in these sheep. It is concluded that most of the other morphological features observed in asthmatics and animal models are likely to be the result of allergic airway reactions rather than a fundamental difference between potentially allergic and non-allergic subjects...|$|E

This led us to search for the ovine KAP 13 - 3 gene, a gene encoding a high sulphur KAP. In this study, the notional KAP 13 - 3 gene (KRTAP 13 - 3) was amplified using primers designed based on a reported bovine KRTAP 13 - 3 sequence. PCR-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis was used to screen amplicons derived from the gene in one hundred and forty seven New Zealand <b>Romney</b> cross-bred <b>sheep.</b> Five unique banding patterns were revealed. Either one PCR-SSCP pattern (homozygous) or a combination of two patterns (heterozygous) was observed for each sheep. Sequencing of PCR amplicons representtative of different SSCP patterns revealed five different DNA sequences. The sequences derived from the amplicons showed a low homology to other known ovine KRTAPs, but had a high homology with previous reported KRTAP 13 -n sequences from human and cattle, with the closest homology being with bovine KRTAP 13 - 3, suggesting the sequences represent the ovine KRTAP 13 - 3 locus. Among the five allele sequences, four nucleotide substitutions were identified within the coding region. Of these substitutions, three were non-synonymous and would result in amino acid changes (p. Arg 79 Cys, p. Arg 81 Gln and p. Tyr 130 His). This variation in the KAP 13 - 3 gene may affect gene expression, the structure and assembly of the protein, and consequently influence wool traits, if KAP 13 - 3 is of importance to wool fibre structure...|$|R
40|$|Sheep {{differ in}} their {{inherent}} abilities to convert feed protein into wool keratin (Marston, 1948; Ferguson, Carter and Hardy 1949; Clark, Keshary, Coop and Henderson 1965). Animals processing a high efficiency of wool production maybe characterized by a greater density of active follicles, or by an increased production of fibre volume per follicle. If the findings of Henderson (1953) for Kent and Romney longwools are followed in this experiment, then fibre volume will contribute most to wool production with fibre density having little effect. In this case the cause of increased fibre volume would probably be due to either a faster rate of cellular proliferation within the individual wool follicle bulbs, or to a larger cell size within the fibre. To date there has only been limited research into {{the relative importance of}} mitotic activity (Fraser 1964 a; Schinckel 1961, 1962; Short, Wilson and Schinckel 1964; Short 1965) and cell size (Short et al 1964; Short 1965) with respect to wool production. It is generally concluded that there is relatively little differences in cell volume between animals and that cell turnover rate is the major factor influencing variations of production. However, it is also recognised that both these factors will be influenced by plane of nutrition (Schinckel 1962; Short et al 1964; Short 1965). Ultimate cortial cell volume is a measure of cell growth from the time of its proliferation, through differentiation and keratine formation, until it is fully keranized. Therefore factors which will affect cell growth during these phases will also affect the final cell volume. In this experiment a number of <b>Romney</b> Marsh <b>sheep</b> specially selected to provide a range of feed:wool conversion efficiencies were pen-fed inside for 9 months. It was planned to measure the productive characteristics of these sheep, to note any variation in cortical cell volume both between sheep and with time, and if possible to obtain a reasonable estimate of relative mitotic activities. The technique employed, and the analysis thereafter, were not intended to be as simple and as rapid as would be required of a practical method for large-scale identification of efficient wool-producing sires. Rather they were developed with the purpose of obtaining an accurate relationship between the internal and external components of wool production, and of determining any differences between individual animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor's {{thesis is}} a {{literary}} review and summary of current knowledge of reproduction in selected sheep breeds, namely breeds Romney and Suffolk, definition of the different reproduction indicators and description of {{the internal and external}} factors that affect them. Another goal is to make, based on the information gathered, an overall assessment of the reproduction standard of selected sheep breeds of breeders in the Czech Republic. The period assessed is 2010 - 2014, and the monitored reproduction indicators are: the percentage of fertilization, fertility, strength, rearing and also the birthweight of lambs. Furthermore, the thesis describes the basics of reproduction of <b>Romney</b> and Suffolk <b>sheep</b> and the factors affecting reproduction. For the basis of this thesis were used the documents from the sheep and goats year book. Suffolk breed is the most numerous meat breed in the Czech Republic. The assessment shows that the Suffolk breed achieved better results than Romney breed only in the percentage of fertility. In other indicators breed Romney showed better results. The greatest differences were in percentage of fertilization and fertility. At the percentage of intensity, the results were comparable with the exception of year 2014. The percentage of rearing was significantly better in the Romney breed in the years 2011 and 2014. The results of lambs birthweight did not show big differences; the weight of both breeds was around 3, 1 to 3, 2 kg. Suffolks have been particularly reared for their outstanding meat yield and therefore do not achieve as good results as the Romney breed, which is thanks to its good reproductive and maternal characteristics used in the maternal position. To improve the percentage of fertilization it would be appropriate to eliminate the number of pregnant ewe in the herds. It is also necessary to ensure high quality and sufficient quantity of feed, to ensure proper animal welfare and selecting proven sheep breeding ram for conceiving...|$|R
