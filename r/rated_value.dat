25|$|The {{percentage}} of allowed {{deviation from the}} <b>rated</b> <b>value</b> is called tolerance. The actual capacitance value should be within its tolerance limits, or {{it is out of}} specification. IEC/EN 60062 specifies a letter code for each tolerance.|$|E

25|$|If {{the ripple}} current exceeds the <b>rated</b> <b>value,</b> the {{corresponding}} heat generation exceeds the capacitor's temperature limit and may destroy the internal structure (voltage proof, boiling point) of the capacitors. Then the components tend to short circuiting, vent opening or explosion. Ripple currents higher than rated values are possible only with forced cooling.|$|E
25|$|The rated {{capacitance}} {{is the value}} for which the capacitor has been designed. The actual capacitance of film capacitors depends on the measuring frequency and the ambient temperature. Standardized conditions for film capacitors are a measuring frequency of 1nbsp&kHz and a temperature of 20nbsp&°C. The percentage of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the <b>rated</b> <b>value</b> is called capacitance tolerance. The actual capacitance value of a capacitor should be within the tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel rate {{calculation}} algorithm called quantized rate selection (QRS) for quantized undithered dynamic supply voltage scaling (DSVS) systems. The algorithm monitors the total buffered workload, and where possible selects a <b>rate</b> <b>value</b> equal to a quantized <b>rate</b> <b>value.</b> At quantized <b>rate</b> <b>values,</b> energy dissipation of quantized DSVS systems approaches continuous voltage level DSVS systems. Our experimental work on FMIDCT computation using nine video sequences and a 4 -level quantized undithered system shows that additional energy savings of 1. 4 % to 18. 5 % can be achieved from QRS, compared to the existing averaging technique.

2500|$|Fuse {{selection}} {{depends on}} the load's characteristics. Semiconductor devices may use a fast or ultrafast fuse as semiconductor devices heat rapidly when excess current flows. The fastest blowing fuses are designed for the most sensitive electrical equipment, where even a short exposure to an overload current could be very damaging. [...] Normal fast-blow fuses are the most general purpose fuses. [...] The time delay fuse (also known as anti-surge, or slow-blow) are designed to allow a current which is above the <b>rated</b> <b>value</b> of the fuse to flow {{for a short period}} of time without the fuse blowing. [...] These types of fuse are used on equipment such as motors, which can draw larger than normal currents for up to several seconds while coming up to speed.|$|E
60|$|It appears, therefore, {{that the}} value of money is liable to more {{frequent}} fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at a fixed valuation than when the exclusive standard of the currency is either gold or silver. Instead of being only affected by variations in the cost of production of one metal, it is subject to derangement from those of two. The particular kind of variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having two legal standards is a fall of value, or what is commonly called a depreciation, since practically that one of the two metals will always be the standard of which the real has fallen below the <b>rated</b> <b>value.</b> If the tendency of the metals be to rise in value, all payments will be made in the one which has risen least; and, if to fall, then in that which has fallen most.|$|E
