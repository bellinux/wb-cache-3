5000|$|Downward {{pressure}} on the lid forced the nail downwards; withdrawing the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> detonated the mine.|$|R
50|$|Pin on pin - A <b>pin</b> is <b>riveted</b> on top {{of another}} pin to give the design a 3-D look.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, William E. Bassett (who {{started the}} W. E. Bassett Company in 1939) {{developed}} the [...] "Trim"-brand nail clipper, the first made using modern (at the time) manufacturing methods using the superior jaw-style design {{that had been}} around since the 19th century, but adding two nibs near the base of the file to prevent lateral movement, replacing the <b>pinned</b> <b>rivet</b> with a notched rivet, and adding a thumb-swerve in the lever.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Type F couplers, {{non-rotating}} shaft type at right. Rotating shaft type at {{left was}} pulled from vehicle after losing its <b>retaining</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Filing-to-fit" [...] {{of certain}} parts during {{production}} limited interchangeability. The exposed rear sight had no protective ears and was vulnerable to breakage. The adjustable front sight {{could be lost}} if the retaining screw wasn't tightly secured. The weapon was susceptible to jamming if grime clogged the bolt's locking recess in the receiver. The two small magazine guide <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> and corresponding receiver stud holes were tapered allowing disassembly and assembly only from one direction—right to left for disassembly, and left to right for assembly; adding unacceptable levels of complexity in a combat environment. The <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> had to be delicately pounded out whenever the bolt needed to be removed for cleaning. During the reassembly process, if the <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> were inserted {{too much or too}} little when reassembling, the receiver might not fit back into the tight confines of the stock.|$|R
50|$|The PMD-6, PMD-7 and PMD-57 series mines are Soviet Union blast type anti-personnel mines that {{consist of}} a wooden box with a hinged lid with a slot cut into it. The slot presses down against a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> which holds back the striker. When {{sufficient}} pressure {{is applied to the}} lid of the box the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> moves, allowing the striker to hit the detonator. The mines typically have an operating pressure of 1 to 10 kg. All the mines in the series use MOV series fuzes.|$|R
5000|$|Pull fuse: A {{pull fuse}} is a zero-delay fuse used in booby traps: the grenade detonates {{immediately}} when the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> is removed. The pin is typically {{attached to a}} tripwire.|$|R
5000|$|Handle making {{can be done}} {{in several}} {{different}} ways depending on the tang of the knife. Full tang knives usually have handle scales either <b>pinned,</b> <b>riveted,</b> or screwed on to the tang itself while knives without a full tang may be inserted into a solid handle and then attached in one of the previously stated methods. Handle materials can range from natural materials including wood or elk horn to man-made materials like brass, plastic, polymer or micarta. A knife makers grinder may have additional attachments for making knife handles, such as small diameter contact wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The mine is {{triggered}} by {{pressure on the}} lid forcing the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> out of the striker which then hits the detonator. It {{can be used with}} a tripwire connected to the fuze acting as a crude anti-handling device.|$|R
50|$|A hairpin clip, {{also known}} as a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> is a type of formed wire used on a grooved shaft. It is {{designed}} to be easily installed and uninstalled, and is reusable. They are commonly made from 1050 carbon steel and 300 series stainless steel.|$|R
50|$|The mine is armed by {{transferring}} the detonator from the fuze cap {{to the well}} {{in the base of}} the mine, the safety cap is then removed. Pressure on the central pressure plate, compresses the spring until the pressure is enough to shear the plastic <b>retaining</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mine uses an MUV pull fuze {{attached}} {{to an internal}} lever fuze. Pressure on the lid depresses {{one end of the}} lever, removing the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from the MUV fuze, allowing the striker to impact a percussion cap, which ignites the detonator followed by the main charge.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a simple wooden box with a hinged lid that acts as the trigger mechanism. A slot is cut {{into the side of}} the lid which rests on the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin.</b> The main charge is a block of cast TNT into which a variety of fuzes may be placed, typically either the RO-1 or an MUV series fuze.|$|R
40|$|One {{component}} serves three functions, electrical interconnections, thermal control, {{and mechanical}} integrity, at same time. Several versions of design: (1) Insulated support plate contains holes; (2) Alternate support plate configuration uses rivets instead of pins; and (3) Another configuration includes leaf-spring contacts instead of <b>pins</b> or <b>rivets...</b>|$|R
50|$|The TM-38 was a rectangular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine had a large raised rectangular central pressure plate with four reinforcing creases. When enough pressure {{was applied to the}} plate it collapses pressing down on a bolt connected to an internal lever. The lever is pulls a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from the MUV fuze, which releases the striker, which impacts the MD-2 detonator.|$|R
50|$|The broch was {{inhabited}} {{until the}} Middle Ages. Among the finds in the broch was a decorative pin from the 8th {{century and a}} Norse <b>pin</b> and <b>rivets,</b> dating from the 11th or 12th century. Located near the broch are {{the remains of a}} rectangular building in the Norse style.|$|R
50|$|The Schu-mine 42 (Shoe-mine), {{also known}} as the Schützenmine 42, was a German anti-personnel mine used during the Second World War. It {{consisted}} of a simple wooden box with a hinged lid containing a 200 g block of cast TNT and a ZZ-42 type detonator. A slot in the lid pressed down on the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> sufficient pressure on the lid caused the pin to move, releasing the striker which triggered the detonator.|$|R
50|$|The TM-35 was a rectangular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine has a metal case, which is rectangular with a carrying handle {{on one side and}} a large raised pressure plate in the centre. Sufficient pressure on the central pressure plate presses down on one end of an internal see-saw like lever, which removes the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from an MUV fuze, releasing the striker, triggering the mine.|$|R
50|$|The TMD-40 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consisted of a rectangular wooden box which contained a detonator assembly at each end and seven 400 gram and four 200 gram blocks of explosive. The fuse assemblies consisted of a lever device, which when pressed downward by pressure pieces attached to {{the lid of the}} mine, see-sawed upward, pulling the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from a pull detonator. The main charge was then triggered.|$|R
50|$|Using the Gammon {{bomb was}} very simple. After filling the {{stockinette}} bag with explosive, the screw-off cap was removed and discarded. Removing the screw-off cap revealed a stout linen tape wound around {{the circumference of}} the fuze. The linen tape had a curved lead weight on the end. While holding the lead weight in place with one finger (to prevent the linen tape from unwinding prematurely) the grenade was then thrown at the target. When the Gammon grenade was thrown, the weighted linen tape automatically unwrapped in flight, pulling out a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from the fuze mechanism. Removal of the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> freed a heavy ball-bearing and striker inside the fuze, which was then held back from the percussion cap only by a weak creep spring. In this manner the Allways fuze became armed in flight. Impact with the target gave the heavy ball-bearing a sharp jolt - overcoming the weak resistance of the creep spring - that slammed the striker against the percussion cap. The percussion cap fired directly into the adjacent detonator, which in turn sent a violent shockwave into the main explosive filling contained inside the stockinette bag. Detonation of a Gammon grenade was instantaneous on impact with the target, i.e. there was no time-delay.|$|R
50|$|Then, on 22 February, {{the convoy}} ran {{into one of}} the worst storms ever {{recorded}} in the Barents Sea. Once again the convoy began to split up and was blown apart. The weather deteriorated to Beaufort scale force 12 with winds at 70 to 90 knots and temperatures 40 below zero. During this storm, one of the main springs on the Henry Bacons steering gear was broken, and the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> was sheared. This damage caused the Henry Bacon {{to drop out of the}} convoy to effect repairs.|$|R
5000|$|The YaM-5 ({{anti-tank}} mine 5 kilograms) was a Soviet anti-tank blast mine with a wood case. Various {{wood was}} used. The mine {{consists of a}} rectangular wooden box with a hinged lid that overlaps {{the front of the}} mine. A slot in the hinged lid's side through which an MUV pull fuse is placed. A wooden pressure bar is sometimes used {{on the edge of the}} lid above the slot. A nail is placed horizontally through the loop of the MUV fuse's striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> and two loops on the bottom of the lid's slot.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of bearing and tensile loads on the creep behavior of joints was studied. A specimen {{was designed for}} this study which possessed some of the general features of <b>pin</b> and <b>rivet</b> joint connections and an apparatus was constructed to apply both bearing and tensile loads to the joint model. Deformation measurements were made by use of a photogrid printed on the joint model...|$|R
50|$|The rear set {{of drivers}} with their {{high-pressure}} cylinders is fixed in the plate {{frame of the}} loco. The front set of drivers with their low-pressure cylinders {{are linked to the}} rear sets with king <b>pins,</b> the <b>rivetted</b> boiler lies on it with its slide plates (Gleitplatten) Leaf springs at the sides hold the driving gear in a central position. Both driving sets have an inside frame.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Indian (Southern) tabar (axe), 18th century, {{the wooden}} haft has a steel tang running 3/4 {{of the way}} down, <b>pinned</b> by four <b>rivets.</b> The axe head is brass with a forged steel blade, L. 58 cm.|$|R
5000|$|Mateba Autorevolvers {{chambered}} in [...]357 Magnum can {{be loaded}} with [...]38 Special ammunition. Typical [...]38 Special loads {{do not have}} enough power to fully cycle the recoil mechanism, but the weapon will still function with a double-action trigger pull. There are two optional recoil springs designed specifically for [...]38 Special cartridges that can be installed by the operator to overcome this problem (.38 Special and [...]38 wadcutter). Replacing the spring requires the removal of the slide assembly, which is blocked by a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> held in place by a small set screw in the triggerguard. The barrel shroud acts as the spring keeper and guide rod bushing.|$|R
50|$|The PK {{general-purpose}} {{machine gun}} U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm sheet of steel that is supported extensively by <b>pins</b> and <b>rivets.</b> For additional rigidity and strength the PK receiver features double walls made from 1.5 mm steel plates that are welded {{together with the}} U-shaped stamping. The receiver top cover is also stamped from 1.5 mm sheet metal and hinged {{on the front of}} the receiver and locked at the back with a spring-loaded latch.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} of tolerance analysis in assemblies using Sigmund Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) software is validated through {{the example of}} an automobile locking device. Simulation with CAT, applying criteria on both the statistical distribution and the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> position in the hole used in the example, {{will allow us to}} predict the functional dimension tolerances in these assemblies with greater accuracy in the preliminary design phase. These tolerances will subsequently define the manufacturing specifications. The statistical distribution, in the example, that best fits the overall set of tolerances, is the triangular distribution followed by the normal distribution; the position of the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> axis in its hole is off-centre by 53 % with regard to its maximum value...|$|R
25|$|As safety precautions, the {{built-in}} fuse for the warhead is released by a safety mechanism. This arms the warhead after a flight distance of approximately five meters. Once armed, the warhead will detonate on impact, {{and as a}} safety when the rocket's propellant runs out. This safeguards against live ammunition staying around and causing hazards to all in the future. The Panzerfaust 3 is distributed in a special package including spare parts and a cleaning kit. The package contains a launcher, ejector and spring, extractor, dummy extractor plug, bolt-head <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> plastic cleaning rod with brass tip, bore and chamber brushes, camel's hair brush and a prismatic bore scope. It takes several minutes to assemble and load the launcher.|$|R
5000|$|The Franchi SPAS-12 came {{equipped}} with a non-adjustable circular aperture rear sight and a large, non-adjustable blade foresight integrated into the barrel. The LAW-12 was a semi-automatic only and the SAS-12 was a pump action only. These three [...] "sister" [...] shotguns accepted all SPAS-12 components, notably trigger groups, barrel threaded attachments and stocks. The various magazine extension tubes of the LAW-12 and SAS-12 were never designed to be interchangeable with the SPAS-12 as this would cause issues with the gas selector switch moving from Auto to Pump action on the SPAS-12 model. The extensions {{have been known to}} spin off the front of the SPAS-12 during cycling if the extension was not tapered for the SPAS-12 <b>retaining</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
50|$|The vibraslap is a {{percussion}} instrument {{consisting of}} a piece of stiff wire (bent into a U-shape) connecting a wood ball to a hollow box of wood with metal “teeth” inside. The percussionist holds the metal wire in one hand and strikes the ball (usually against the palm of their other hand). The box acts as a resonating body for a metal mechanism placed inside with a number of loosely fastened <b>pins</b> or <b>rivets</b> that vibrate and rattle against the box. The instrument is a modern version of the jawbone.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} provide {{emergency oxygen}} to passengers {{to protect them}} from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead oxygen masks and oxygen generators. In some wide-body airliners, such as the DC-10 and IL-96, the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> and trigger the production of oxygen.|$|R
40|$|Improved {{screw-thread}} lock engaged after screw tightened in nut {{or other}} mating threaded part. Device does not release contaminating material during tightening of screw. Includes pellet of soft material encased in screw and <b>retained</b> by <b>pin.</b> Hammer blow on pin extrudes pellet into slot, engaging threads in threaded hole or in nut...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a series}} {{approach}} and the Muskhelishvili formulation in the two-dimensional theory of elasticity, stress-intensity factors K are derived for problems in which cracks emanate radially from {{the boundary of}} an arbitrarily loaded internal circular hole in an infinite plate. Numerical values are obtained for K(I) and K(II) for radial cracks from a hole containing a loose-fitted <b>pin</b> or <b>rivet</b> that is pulled perpendicular to the crack direction in {{the plane of the}} plate. The method is a general one for determining K for a set of symmetrically emanating radial cracks for a variety of concentrated or distributed tractions on the circular hole...|$|R
50|$|Some taper pins have a {{male screw}} thread {{on the small}} end that is {{designed}} to project through the hole and <b>retain</b> the <b>pin</b> with a washer and a nut. Other pins are threaded on both ends, on the thick end to pull the pin out with the same nut that holds the pin in place.|$|R
