40|$|D. Ing. The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis is an investigation into fundamental aspects of the mechanical excavation of hard rock using free <b>rolling</b> <b>cutters,</b> currently being undertaken at the Chamber of Mines of South Africa Research Organization. The motivation for undertaking this study {{was provided by the}} need to improve the effectiveness and operational efficiency of this type of tool with regards to its application in the South African gold mining industry. Earlier work has shown that the use of high-pressure water jets enhances the performance of mechanical cutting in hard rock. To assess the potential of this approach for use in conjunction with free <b>rolling</b> <b>cutters,</b> a series of laboratory tests was conducted using both disc and button type cutters, to determine the relative effects, on cutter performance, of variations in the relevant jet and cutting parameters. The parameters investigated were jet pressure, jet configuration, depth and spacing of cuts and cutting speed. Jets of diameter 1, 2 mm were used singly and in combination of 2 and 4 jets at pressures in the range of 5 MPa to 40 MPa which gave flow rates of up to 0, 3 lis per jet. Cut spacing, cut depth and cutting speed were varied between 15 mm and 90 mm, 2 mm and 6 mm, and 0, 1 mls and 1, 0 mls respectively. Tests were carried out on a linear rock cutting machine, purpose built according to specifications prepared from measurements made during underground field trials, which gave it the ability to test full-scale cutters under loading conditions representative of those found in the field. All the tests carried out were performed in the constant penetration, multiple pass (groove deepening) cutting mode, using dressed (smooth) and pre-conditioned (pre-roughened) rock surfaces...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to quantify the}} changes in disc cutter performance between dry and saturated rock. The tests were conducted using samples of limestone and sandstone to determine whether changes in performance are consistent across rock types. A linear rock cutting machine was used to conduct the tests with a <b>rolling</b> disc <b>cutter.</b> The tests were performed at varying depths with fixed disc spacing. Cutting forces were measured in the different rocks and cutting depths with rock yield determined and specific energy calculated. Comparing the results between cutting in dry and saturated rock showed reductions in cutting forces of 52 % and 7 % respectively for sandstone and limestone. That is {{the magnitude of the}} reduction in forces when cutting saturated rock was not consistent with {{a significant difference between the}} two rock types. The changes in specific energy were similar with a 43 % and 9 % reduction in sandstone and limestone. This difference in behaviour between the two rocks was also reflected in rock strength. A comparison of the strength between dry and saturated rock found the change was non-uniform with a 64 % and 17 % reduction in uniaxial compressive strength in the saturated sandstone and limestone samples respectively. When using a <b>rolling</b> disc <b>cutter,</b> rock cutting performance and rock strength were found to alter between dry and saturated conditions. In the case of a sandstone sample there were significant reductions in cutting forces, specific energy and strength whereas in limestone there were only marginal reductions in these parameters...|$|R

50|$|There is also {{currently}} available, {{a hybrid}} type of bit that combines both <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> and fixed cutter elements.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> {{and fixed}} {{cutter drill bits}} have {{internal}} passages to direct drilling fluid, conveyed by the drill pipe from surface pumps, through hydraulic nozzles directed {{at the bottom of}} the wellbore to produce high velocity fluid jets that assist in cleaning the old cuttings off the bottom before the next tooth contacts the rock. Placement of the nozzles, particularly in <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> bits, is also often done to assist in keeping the cutting elements free of cuttings build-up in certain kinds of clay and shale formations.|$|E
40|$|The {{competency}} of any TBM in any geological {{condition is}} determined by a rock or rock mass breakage process. A 12. 24 km long tunnel between Maroshi and Ruparel College was excavated by Brihanmumbai municipal corporation (BMC) to improve water supply system of greater Mumbai, India, using open-type hard rock tunnel boring machines (TBMs). In this paper an attempt {{has been made to}} establish the relationship between rock mass characteristics i. e. RMR and UCS of the Deccan trap rocks and TBMs performance characteristics for 5. 83 km long Maroshi-Vakola tunnel section of the Maroshi-Ruparel college tunnel project. To analyze the effect of variable rock mass conditions on the TBM performance, the operating parameters i. e. thrust force, torque and RPM of the machine, were recorded and intact rock strength was determined. The effect of rock mass properties on machine penetration rate (PR) and the relation with other operational parameters were analyzed. The rock strength affects the rock behaviour under compression. When the <b>rolling</b> <b>cutters</b> indent the rock, the stress exerted must be higher than the rock strength i. e.; the rock strength is directly relevant to the performance of TBM. Studies show that the penetration rate decreases with increase in uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). The comparison of measured penetration rate with empirical model developed by Graham, in which, the penetration rate is computed using UCS and average thrust per cutter, showed good agreement with coefficient of determination (R- 2), i. e. 0. 97. The study shows that the TBM performance was maximum in rock mass rating (RMR) range from 40 to 75, while slower penetration was recorded both in very poor and very good rock masses...|$|R

5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> {{drill bit}} design was disclosed in U.S. patents granted to Howard R. Hughes, Sr. on August 10, 1909, and {{which led to}} the creation of what became the Hughes Tool Company. This bit employed two conical steel rolling elements with milled teeth that engaged the formation, when the device was rotated, to produce the cutting action. This design represented a significant improvement in drilling performance over the so-called [...] "fish tail" [...] scraper type bits commonly used in rotary drilling at the time, and over the next two decades, rotary drilling with <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> bits largely replaced all other drilling methods in the oilfield. The significance of the Hughes Two-Cone Drill Bit was recognized on its 100th anniversary when it was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.|$|E
5000|$|Drill bits are broadly {{classified}} into two main types {{according to their}} primary cutting mechanism. <b>Rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> bits drill largely by fracturing or crushing the formation with [...] "tooth"-shaped cutting elements on two or more cone-shaped elements that roll {{across the face of}} the borehole as the bit is rotated. Fixed cutter bits employ a set of blades with very hard cutting elements, most commonly natural or synthetic diamond, to remove material by scraping or grinding action as the bit is rotated.|$|E
50|$|Fixed {{cutter bits}} {{were the first}} type of drill bit {{employed}} in rotary drilling, and they are mechanically much simpler than <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> bits. The cutting elements do not move relative to the bit; {{there is no need}} for bearings or lubrication. The most common cutting element in use today is the polycrystalline diamond cutter (PDC), a sintered tungsten carbide cylinder with one flat surface coated with a synthetic diamond material. The cutters are arranged on the blades of the bit in a staggered pattern with the diamond coated cutter surface facing the direction of bit rotation to provide full coverage of the borehole bottom. Other fixed cutter bits may employ natural industrial-grade diamonds or thermal stable polycrystalline diamond (TSP) cutting elements.|$|E
50|$|Intensive tillage leaves {{less than}} 15% crop residue cover {{or less than}} 500 pounds per acre (560 kg/ha) of small grain residue. This type of tillage is often {{referred}} to as conventional tillage but as conservational tillage is now more widely used than intensive tillage (in the United States), it is often not appropriate to refer to this type of tillage as conventional. Intensive tillage often involves multiple operations with implements such as a mold board, disk, and/or chisel plow. Then a finisher with a harrow, <b>rolling</b> basket, and <b>cutter</b> can be used to prepare the seed bed. There are many variations.|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{improvement}} {{in the performance of}} mechanical rock cutting systems are continually being sought. One area being investigated is combining mechanical rock cutting tools with water jets. In this ‘hybrid’ arrangement, the mass breakage mechanism of a <b>rolling</b> disc <b>cutter</b> or drag pick is coupled with the concentrated energy medium of a high pressure water jet. Research has indicated that the resultant improvements in performance of mechanical cutting tools could be due to the cutting of the rock surface through fracture and erosion thereby ameliorating the rock breakage process of the mechanical cutting tool. Damage by a water jet has been observed even in rock of high strength. This paper outlines a study on the sole use of water jets in cutting rock and the effects of changes in the principal variables of a water jet. An understanding of the characteristics and the relative importance of any changes in these variables is necessary to optimise the cutting performance of a hybrid system in terms of advance rate and energy expenditure. The variables considered in the study included nozzle diameter, water pressure, traversing speed and multiple passes of a water jet. Within the range of values studied for each variable, a change in water pressure was found to have the greatest impact on the level of surface damage in rock. Traversing speed, {{and to a lesser extent}} nozzle diameter, were also found to alter the magnitude of surface damage in rock...|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> bits usually employ three cones {{to contain}} the cutting elements, although two cone or (rarely) four cone arrangements are sometimes seen. These bits mainly fall into two classes depending on the manufacture of the cutting elements or [...] "teeth". Steel-tooth bits have cones that have wedge-shaped teeth milled directly in the cone steel itself. Extremely hard tungsten carbide material is often applied to the surfaces of the teeth by a welding process to improve durability. Tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits have shaped teeth of sintered tungsten carbide press-fit into drilled holes in the cones. Some types of steel-tooth bits also have TCI elements {{in addition to the}} milled teeth. The cones rotate on roller or journal bearings that are usually sealed from the hostile down-hole drilling fluid environment by different arrangements of o-ring or metal face seals. These bits usually also have pressure compensated grease lubrication systems for the bearings.|$|E

Michaels performed a diving elbow drop and Sweet Chin Music on Cena but Carlito executed a <b>rolling</b> <b>cutter</b> and pinned Michaels to eliminate him. Masters performed a DDT on Cena onto the chamber floor. Carlito and Masters attacked Cena and Carlito ordered Masters to apply the Masterlock on Cena. Masters did so until Carlito turned on Masters, attacking him a low blow. Carlito rolled up Masters to eliminate him and then Cena rolled up Carlito to win the match and retain the title.|$|E
50|$|On the May 1 {{episode of}} Raw, Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose {{interrupted}} an argument between Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor over who should face Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship. Ambrose criticized Lesnar for not appearing and wrestling often and claimed the Intercontinental Championship {{to be the}} top title of the Raw brand. The Miz then {{came out and said}} that he should be the one to face Ambrose for the title. A #1 contender's match was scheduled between Rollins, Bálor, and Miz. During the match, Samoa Joe attacked Rollins, taking Rollins out of the match, and Bray Wyatt attacked Bálor with Sister Abigail, allowing Miz to score the pinfall. On the May 15 episode of Raw, Miz faced Ambrose for the title. At the climax of the match, Miz attempted a low blow on Ambrose, but Ambrose countered and performed a low blow on Miz, who won by disqualification. Later, Ambrose was scheduled to defend his Intercontinental Championship against Miz at Extreme Rules with the stipulation being that if Ambrose were disqualified, he would lose the title. The following week, The Miz interfered in Ambrose's match against Elias Samson, who was having his Raw in-ring debut. Instead of attacking Ambrose, Miz attacked Samson, making Ambrose lose by disqualification. Ambrose chased after Miz, but Samson attacked Ambrose with a <b>Rolling</b> <b>Cutter.</b>|$|E
