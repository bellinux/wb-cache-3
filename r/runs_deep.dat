2500|$|The Shakespeare {{family had}} long sought armorial {{bearings}} {{and the status}} of gentleman. William's father John, a bailiff of Stratford with a wife of good birth, was eligible for a coat of arms and applied to the College of Heralds, but evidently his worsening financial status prevented him from obtaining it. The application was successfully renewed in 1596, most probably at the instigation of William himself as he was the more prosperous at the time. The motto [...] "Non sanz droict" [...] ("Not without right") was attached to the application, but it was not used on any armorial displays that have survived. The theme of social status and restoration <b>runs</b> <b>deep</b> through the plots of many of his plays, and at times Shakespeare seems to mock his own longing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cycle of}} the feminization of poverty in the Dominican Republic {{is a direct result}} of {{cultural}} biases and systematic oppression. Dominican women make generally forty-four cents on the dollar as compared to men. This wage gap often leads to a high level of food insecurity among women in the Dominican Republic. Food insecurity often leads to an increased rate of dangerous behaviors such as unprotected sex and drug use. These behaviors put women at a greater risk for contracting HIV. There is a grand stigma around HIV positive women in the Dominican Republic. For this reason, women are more likely to be subjected to health screenings when applying for a job. If the screening reveals that a women is HIV positive, then they are almost guaranteed to be denied any position. Unemployment furthers the issue of food insecurity and because the HIV stigma is so prevalent in that culture, women are often ostracized from their families and forced to fend for themselves with no job prospects or support. One woman's doctor told her upon announcing her diagnosis, [...] "What you have to do now is die," [...] because he realized the severity of the cultural implication of the news. HIV positive women are also more likely to suffer domestic abuse. Children of HIV positive women are also affected. One women shared the story of her sister refusing to adopt her child when she was unable to provide for him after her diagnosis because the sister was afraid the child was tainted by virtue of his mother having the disease. The cycle <b>runs</b> <b>deep</b> of women suffering from HIV and therefore poverty within the country and the stigma disenfranchises citizens from wanting to address the problem.|$|E

6000|$|September 5th.--I {{took a walk}} {{of three}} miles from the village, which brought me into Vermont. The line runs athwart a bridge,--a rude bridge, which crosses a {{mountain}} stream. The stream <b>runs</b> <b>deep</b> {{at the bottom of}} a gorge, plashing downward, with rapids and pools, and bestrewn with large rocks, deep and shady, not to be reached by the sun except in its meridian, as well on account of the depth of the gorge as of the arch of wilderness trees above it. There was a stumpy clearing beyond the bridge, where some men were building a house. I went to them, and inquired if I were in Massachusetts or Vermont, and asked for some water. Whereupon they showed great hospitality, and the master-workman went to the spring, and brought delicious water in a tin basin, and produced another jug containing [...] "new rum, and very good; and rum does nobody any harm if they make a good use of it," [...] quoth he. I invited them to call on me at the hotel, if they should cone to the village within two or three days. Then I took my way back through the forest, for this is a by-road, and is, much of its course, a sequestrated and wild one, with an unseen torrent roaring at an unseen depth, along the roadside.|$|E
60|$|Rivers {{cannot be}} forded if their depth exceeds 3 feet for men or 4 feet for horses. Fords are easily {{discovered}} by typing a sounding-pole to {{the stern of}} a boat rowing {{down the middle of}} the stream, and searching those places where the pole touches the bottom. When no boat is to be had, fords should be tried for where the river is broad rather than where it is narrow, and especially at those places where there are bends in its course. In these the line of shallow water does not run straight across, but follows the direction of a line connecting a promontory on one side to the nearest promontory on the other, as in the drawing; that is to say, from A to B, or from B to C, and not right across from B to b, from A to a, or from C to c. Along hollow curves, asa, b, c, the stream <b>runs</b> <b>deep,</b> and usually beneath overhanging banks; whilst in front of promontories, as at A, B, and C, the water is invariably shoal, unless it be a jutting rock that makes the promontory. Therefore, by entering the stream at one promontory, with the intention of leaving it at another, you ensure that at all events the beginning and end of your course shall be in shallow water, which you cannot do by attempting any other line of passage.|$|E
