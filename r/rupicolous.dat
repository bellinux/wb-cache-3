50|$|The genus Cordylus (Sauria: Cordylidae) {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of small- to medium-sized spiny lizards from Africa, collectively called girdle-tailed or girdled lizards. All are diurnal and ovoviviparous (live-bearing, without shelled eggs). Most species are <b>rupicolous</b> (rock-dwelling), while a few species are arboreal or live in burrows. They defend themselves with osteoderms (flat bony plates in the skin) and by quickly retreating into rock crevices or burrows. Many species live in groups and males defend territories.|$|E

50|$|The caper {{bush is a}} <b>rupicolous</b> species. It is {{widespread}} on rocky areas and is grown on different soil associations, including alfisols, regosols, and lithosols. In different Himalayan locations, C. spinosa tolerates both silty clay and sandy, rocky, or gravelly surface soils, with less than 1% organic matter. It grows on bare rocks, crevices, cracks, and sand dunes in Pakistan, in dry calcareous escarpments of the Adriatic region, in dry coastal ecosystems of Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, in transitional zones between the littoral salt marsh and the coastal deserts of the Asian Red Sea coast, in the rocky arid bottoms of the Jordan valley, in calcareous sandstone cliffs at Ramat Aviv, Israel, and in central west and northwest coastal dunes of Australia. It grows spontaneously in wall joints of antique Roman fortresses, on the Western Wall of Jerusalem's Temple Mount, and on the ramparts of the castle of Santa Bárbara (Alicante, Spain).

50|$|Utricularia regia is a {{carnivorous}} plant {{that belongs to}} the genus Utricularia and is endemic to the Sierra Madre del Sur region of Guerrero, Mexico. It is similar to U. hintonii and U. petersoniae, but it is easily distinguished from these species by the unusual 4-lobed division of the upper corolla lip and the unique color pattern. Utricularia regia is an annual <b>rupicolous</b> species that is found growing among rocks with mosses and Selaginella in pine forests at altitudes from 1650 m to 1900 m. It grows {{during the rainy season}} and flowers from September to October, producing fruit from October to early November. The specific epithet regia was chosen because of the appearance of an inverted crown in the markings of the lower corolla lip. It was discovered in 2005 and collected again on subsequent botanical explorations in preparation for the Flora de Guerrero. It was formally described in a 2009 volume of Brittonia by Sergio Zamudio and Martha Olvera. The authors placed the new species into Peter Taylor's section Psyllosperma, which has subsequently been merged with section Foliosa based on molecular phylogenetics.|$|E
50|$|The Canyon is {{considered}} a biogeographic corridor since {{it is home to}} four types of vegetation: Tropical Forest, Deciduous, Riparian forest, <b>Rupicolous</b> Gerbil vegetation and secondary vegetation. Several species of flora and fauna are endemic to the canyon. It is often visited by national and international investigators since it is includes great biological diversity. On June 5, 1997 the canyon was declared a Nature reserve, under the category of Zone subject to Ecological Conservation Protected Area by the World Conservation Union of all the area belonging to the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area because it is the most urbanized area. Great Horned Owls, Collared Peccaries, Bobcats, Gray Foxes, Opossums, Red-tailed Boas, Barn Owls, Leaf Cutter Ants and Vampire Bats are among the species making a home in the canyon.There are several urbanized areas that cover {{the eastern side of the}} canyon, complexes such as the University of Guadalajara campus of the CUAAD Center of Art, Architecture and Design, the Guadalajara Zoo, and the now closed Guadalajara Planetarium. In addition to several residential areas, there are also sporting and recreational facilities that include soccer fields, basketball, tennis and fronton courts, picnic spaces, a running strip, a recreational park and an outdoor theater. There were plans to build the next Guggenheim Museum in early 2008, the controversial Arcediano dam project and the high-rise project Puerta Guadalajara (Guadalajara Gate) which included a shopping mall, a convention center, two hotels, two museums, 9 residencial towers and two more corporate towers. None of these projects have been started and it seems likely that they have now all been cancelled or postponed indefinitely. However, work is in progress on the construction of an art museum in the Mirador park, on the site formerly intended for the Guggenheim museum project.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study I {{examined}} the phylogeography of the <b>rupicolous</b> Cape girdled lizard, Cordylus cordylus. Samples were collected across the species distribution range from 63 localities in the Eastern and Western Cape and Free State provinces of South Africa, yielding a total sample size of 207 specimens. Four DNA loci, two nuclear (PRLR, PTPN 12) and two mitochondrial (16 S rRNA, ND 2), were sequenced. Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods were employed to test evolutionary relationships among populations, followed by population structure analyses, divergence time estimations and niche modelling. My results confirm the species monophyly and revealed the presence of two distinct clades. Clade 1 comprised specimens from the western and southern portions of the Western Cape coast, while clade 2 comprised specimens from the southern and eastern Cape coast and adjacent interior of the Eastern and Western Cape and Free State provinces. An area of sympatry between the two clades was observed in the Breede river valley. The divergence time estimates revealed an Early Pliocene (4. 31 Ma), Late Miocene (6. 01 Ma) divergence {{for each of the}} two clades retrieved. Phylogeographic data suggest that clade 1 is younger (lower haplotypic and nucleotide diversity), in comparison to clade 2. Furthermore, the niche modelling shows that C. cordylus occupies a wide range of unfavourable habitats. The absence of marked phylogeographic patterning within clades is very uncharacteristic for a <b>rupicolous</b> vertebrate species. The ecological pliability and generalist nature of C. cordylus presumably contributed to the observed phylogeographic pattern and have facilitated the absence of within clade differentiation. Moreover, I suggest that microclimatic variables, rather than geographic barriers influence the genetic structuring of C. cordylus...|$|E
