50|$|In {{patients}} who have persistently detectable viral loads while taking ART, tests {{can be done to}} investigate whether there is drug resistance. Most commonly a genotype is sequenced which can be compared with databases of other HIV viral genotypes and <b>resistance</b> <b>profiles</b> to predict response to therapy. If there is extensive resistance a phenotypic test of a patient's virus against a range of drug concentrations can be performed, but is expensive and can take several weeks, so genotypes are generally preferred. Using information from a genotype or phenotype, a regimen of 3 drugs from at least 2 classes is constructed that will have the highest probability of suppressing the virus. If a regimen cannot be constructed from recommended first line agents it is termed salvage therapy, and when 6 or more drugs are needed it is termed mega-HAART.|$|E
50|$|Totally {{drug-resistant}} tuberculosis (TDR-TB) is a generic term for tuberculosis strains that {{are resistant to}} {{a wider range of}} drugs than strains classified as extensively {{drug-resistant tuberculosis}}. TDR-TB has been identified in three countries; India, Iran, and Italy. The emergence of TDR-TB has been documented in four major publications. However, it is not yet recognised by the World Health Organization. TDR-TB has resulted from further mutations within the bacterial genome to confer resistance, beyond those seen in XDR- and MDR-TB. Development of resistance is associated with poor management of cases. Drug resistance testing occurs in only 9% of TB cases worldwide. Without testing to determine drug <b>resistance</b> <b>profiles,</b> MDR- or XDR-TB patients may develop resistance to additional drugs. TDR-TB is relatively poorly documented, as many countries do not test patient samples against a broad enough range of drugs to diagnose such a comprehensive array of resistance. The United Nations' Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases has set up a TDR Tuberculosis Specimen Bank to archive specimens of TDR-TB.|$|E

Therefore, HIV- 1 resistance testing using {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) may be of value in resource-limited settings. We compared genotypic <b>resistance</b> <b>profiles</b> in plasma and PBMCs from patients failing ART in two cities of Honduras (Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula), a resource-limited country. One hundred patients failing ART were randomly selected from a longitudinal patient monitoring cohort. Plasma and PBMC samples without patient identifier were used for genotypic resistance testing.

Specimens with concordant <b>resistance</b> <b>profiles</b> between the two compartments were 88 % (95 % CI: 80. 3 % - 94. 5 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Shigellosis remains {{considerable}} {{public health}} problem in some developing countries. The nature of Shigellae suggests that they are highly adaptable when placed under selective pressure in a human population. This is demonstrated by variation and fluctuations in serotypes and antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> <b>profile</b> of organisms circulating in differing setting in endemic locations. Antimicrobial resistance in the genus Shigella is a constant threat, with reports of organisms in Asia being resistant to multiple antimicrobials and new generation therapies. METHODS: Here we compare microbiological, clinical and epidemiological data from patients with shigellosis over three different periods in southern Vietnam spanning 14 years. RESULTS: Our data demonstrates a shift in dominant infecting species (S. flexneri to S. sonnei) and <b>resistance</b> <b>profile</b> of the organisms circulating in southern Vietnam.

40|$|Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a {{ubiquitous}} Gram-negative gamma-proteobacterium, {{has emerged}} as an important opportunistic pathogen responsible for nosocomial infections. A major characteristic of clinical isolates is their high intrinsic or acquired antibiotic resistance level.

No major variation in the antibiotic resistance gene content was observed between strains irrespective of their origin and antibiotic <b>resistance</b> <b>profiles.</b> Although environmental strains generally carry as many multidrug resistant (MDR) efflux pumps as clinical strains, the absence of resistance-nodulation-division (RND) pumps (i. e., SmeABC) previously described to be specific to S. maltophilia was revealed in two environmental strains (BurA 1 and PierC 1).
