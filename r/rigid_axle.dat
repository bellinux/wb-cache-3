25|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} had mainwheels on a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle,</b> rubber {{sprung from}} the crosspiece between two tall V-form legs {{mounted on the}} fuselage at the same points as the interplane struts. The axle and crosspiece were enclosed within an airfoil section fairing, which provided some additional lift.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} during the {{reconstruction}} the fixed axle undercarriage was replaced with a more refined arrangement where the wheels were separately mounted on hinged and faired V-struts from the fuselage underside and with vertical shock absorber struts to the wing underside, allowing much larger wheel deflections on landing than with the less than half wheel-diameter allowed by end-sprung <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> mountings. Unusually, the wheels, which had three-ply centres, were ash-tyred because rubber was expensive in postwar Germany.|$|E
25|$|Celica Camry {{utilizes}} the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive {{layout and}} in A40 guise, a standard four-link <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> suspension system with gasoline inline-four engines displacing 1.6liters for the 12T-U (TA41) and 1.8liters with the 13T-U (TA46). Initial model grades comprised: 1600 LT, 1600 XT, 1800 LT, 1800 XT, and 1800 XT Super Edition. In August 1980, Toyota released high-end models with four-wheel independent suspension, denoted A50 (front MacPherson struts, rear semi-trailing arm setup; four-wheel disc brakes). For the TA57 series 1800 SX, Toyota fitted the 1.8-liter 3T-EU engine. Toyota designated the new 2.0-liter grades, the 21R-U powered 2000 SE and 18R-GEU-based 2000 GT as RA56 and RA55, respectively.|$|E
50|$|For {{military}} applications {{the selection}} includes both conventional <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> {{as well as}} independent suspension systems, all of them being driven with planetary reduction. Both the steering and non-steering <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> are with 10-14 tonnes capacities and the tandem applications with double capacity, 20-28 tonnes. The brakes used on <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> are predominantly S-cam type; the heavier steering axles are equipped with wedge brakes. The independent suspension systems are for 6×6, 8×8 and 10×10 layouts with 6 to 8 tonnes capacity per axle. The brakes are either disc or wedge type.|$|R

25|$|The 1953 {{model year}} {{was not only}} the Corvette's first {{production}} year, but at 300 produced it was also the lowest-volume Corvette. The cars were essentially hand-built and techniques evolved during the production cycle, so that each 1953 Corvette is slightly different. All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors, and black canvas soft tops. Order guides showed heaters and AM radios as optional, but all 1953 models were equipped with both. Over two hundred 1953 Corvettes are known to exist today. They had independent front suspension, but featured a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> supported by longitudinal leaf springs at the rear. The cost of the first production model Corvettes in 1953 was $3490.|$|E
2500|$|The D.XVII {{shared the}} flat-sided, tapered {{fuselage}} {{of the third}} D.XV, a tailplane mounted to the rear horizontal knife edge, a small fin and an almost semicircular rudder which was entirely above the tailplane. The D.XVII was powered by a [...] BMW IIIa six cylinder, water-cooled inline engine driving a two-bladed propeller. The fixed conventional undercarriage was standard for the time, with a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> mounted to V-struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons, plus a tailskid faired into a small ventral fin.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was flat-sided and rectangular in cross-section, with plywood covering. The prototypes {{differed in}} the way this covering was applied; on one the grain ran diagonally, on the other longitudinally. [...] They also differed in their vertical tails, one broader and lower than the other. [...] Both had deep horn balanced rudders which extended to the keel. The horizontal tail was mounted at mid-fuselage, with a straight-edged, unswept tailplane bearing overhung, balanced elevators with outward increasing chord. Both prototypes had conventional undercarriages with a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> mounted to the lower fuselage by V-form struts.|$|E
50|$|All the Mark IVs {{were built}} on a {{separate}} chassis frame with suspension by semi-elliptic leaf springs on <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> front and rear.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was metal {{framed and}} fabric covered, {{with a straight}} edged, wire braced tailplane carrying divided elevators mounted on top. [...] Its vertical tail was low and broad, with a curved leading edge; the rudder was deep and aerodynamically balanced. [...] The Wib 2 was powered by a [...] water-cooled V-12 Renault 12 M engine completely enclosed within a smooth cowling and drove a two blade propeller. Small radiators projected out {{on either side of}} the cowling. [...] The undercarriage was of the fixed conventional type, with the mainwheels on a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> supported by V-struts and assisted by a tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|The Wib 3 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb upright {{water-cooled}} V-8 engine with a Lamblin cylindrical radiator {{on each side of}} the fully enclosed cowling. A [...] supercharger maintained power up to [...] The fuselage was aluminium skinned from its nose to the cockpit; aft, it was fabric covered. Its wire braced, almost triangular tailplane carried split elevators, the inner ends cropped to allow movement of the broad rudder. The Wib 3 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> supported by a pair of V-struts mounted at the roots of the interplane struts. The axle was enclosed within an aerofoil shaped fairing which added [...] to the wing area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was likewise {{a standard}} rectangular section wooden girder structure, fabric covered except around {{the engine and}} a wood upper decking around the open, tandem cockpits for pilot and for the observer, who sat under the wing trailing edge. It tapered to a knife-edge at the tail. At the front the [...] Mercedes water-cooled upright inline engine was enclosed in a rectangular cross-section metal cowling which tapered vertically, exposing the upper cylinders, to a two blade propeller. At {{the rear of the}} housing an external radiator, with shutters for engine temperature control, projected on each side. The Schoettler had a conventional fixed undercarriage, with the mainwheels on a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> mounted on V-struts.|$|E
50|$|Available with {{a choice}} of {{cabriolet}} bodies, the car, like its six-cylinder sibling, rode on two <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> suspended on semi-elliptical leaf springs. A top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) was claimed.|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} built in the {{traditional}} method of aluminium panels fixed to a wooden framework. The suspension used leaf springs and was non independent with <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> front and rear. The brakes were mechanically operated.|$|R
50|$|The car {{sat on a}} U-profile pressed-steel chassis with <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> and semi-elliptical leaf springing. In 1922 it {{was offered}} only as an open-topped four-seater. The {{mechanically}} linked foot and hand brakes both operated directly against the rear wheels.|$|R
2500|$|The train {{stays on}} the track {{by virtue of the}} conical shape of the wheel treads. [...] If a {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side by an amount [...] "y" [...] (the tracking error), the radius of the tread in contact with the rail on one side is reduced, while on the other side it is increased. [...] The angular velocity is the same for both wheels (they are coupled via a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle),</b> so the larger diameter tread speeds up, while the smaller slows down. [...] The wheel set steers around a centre of curvature defined by the intersection of the generator of a cone passing through the points of contact with the wheels on the rails and the axis of the wheel set. Applying similar triangles, we have for the turn radius: ...|$|E
2500|$|January 1969 saw {{the arrival}} of the Suzuki Fronte Van three-door wagon (LS10) as a {{successor}} to the Suzulight FE-series Van which had been built alongside the LC10 for a couple of years. The LS10 featured a conventional drivetrain lay-out (engine in front, rear wheel drive), a rear <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> with leaf springs and a wheelbase of [...] Design was square in style, radically different from the Fronte sedan. To begin with, the rear opening was a single unit, hinged at the top. The engine was the air-cooled 356cc LC10 two-cycle three-cylinder unit, here detuned to [...] for a top speed of 105km/h. The Van (and its subsequent siblings) has MacPherson struts in front and semi-elliptic leaf springs in rear. Unusually for Japanese cars, the spare wheel was mounted in the engine compartment - something more commonly seen in French cars - to help free up more space for luggage.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that this}} type of {{suspension}} {{should not be confused with}} earlier, <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> applications such as those used on early Ford cars.|$|E
50|$|The car {{sat on a}} U-profile {{pressed steel}} chassis with <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> and semi-eliptical leaf springing. It was offered only as a four-door sedan/saloon. The {{mechanically}} linked foot brake operated directly on all four wheels, while the handbrake operated on the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|This new smaller car {{employed}} a conventional steel reinforced (with flitch plates) wooden chassis with half elliptic leaf springs {{front and rear}} supporting the car on <b>rigid</b> <b>axles.</b> The forward end of the springs are fixed rigidly to the chassis frame, the rear ends slide within brackets.|$|R

50|$|By now the S4 had {{acquired}} independent front suspension, using a transverse leaf spring. The back wheels were, as before, {{attached to a}} <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> suspended with longitudinal leaf springs.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{is independent}} {{at the front}} using a transverse leaf spring and wishbones and the <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> at the rear uses torsion bars. Steering is by rack and pinion. The brakes are Lockheed hydraulic with 11 in inch drums all round.|$|E

The mechanically linked foot brake operated directly on all four wheels, while the handbrake operated on the rear wheels.|$|R
25|$|One year later, {{a revised}} model, called the 6C 2300 B was presented. In this version {{the engine was}} placed in a {{completely}} newly designed chassis, with individual front suspension and rear swing axle, and hydraulic brakes. The 6C-2300 was produced in 760 copies with <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> and 870 copies of the B-model.|$|R
50|$|Leaf {{springing}} and <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> had {{the merit}} of simplicity and development costs were also kept down by using engines directly from the company's passenger car range. The original L319s shared the 43 hp engine of the Mercedes-Benz 180D. Subsequently, slightly more powerful diesel alternatives were offered along with petrol engined variants.|$|R
50|$|The D.14 had conventional, fixed landing gear. A pair of V-struts, splayed {{slightly}} outwards, {{were attached}} to the lower fuselage longerons and supported a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle,</b> with the mainwheels 2.50 m apart. The forward components of the V-struts were telescopic, with shock absorbers and coil springs inside their streamlined fairings.|$|E
50|$|Gearboxes are six/seven speed dual-clutch automatic, six speed {{manual and}} CVT (the latter only {{available}} in a liquefied petroleum gas version sold in South Korea). Suspension is made of Pseudo McPherson struts on front and a semi <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> on rear, with an optional active suspension system. Brakes are discs on both axles.|$|E
5000|$|The Doblò {{carries a}} payload {{of up to}} 730 kg, with an {{interior}} volume of [...] The Doblò uses Fiat Strada's platform, in turn derived from the Fiat Palio's one, using a <b>rigid</b> <b>axle</b> with leaf springs at the rear, instead of a torsion beam with coil springs as on the Palio.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{passed to}} the rear wheels using a classic 4-speed manual transmission. However, from May 1934 it became {{possible}} to specify, at extra cost, a [...] "Cotal Preselector transmission". Suspension was based on <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> front and back with longitudinal leaf springs, semi-elliptic at the front and attached using demi-cantilevers at the back.|$|R
50|$|The car {{sat on a}} U-profile {{pressed steel}} chassis with <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> and semi-elliptical leaf springing. It was offered only as a four-door sedan/saloon or soft/open topped sedan/saloon. A two-door full {{cabriolet}} was also offered. The mechanically linked foot brake operated directly on all four wheels, while the handbrake operated on the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|The chassis, {{based on}} that of the Hudson, was conventional, with semi-elliptic leaf springs on all wheels and <b>rigid</b> <b>axles</b> front and rear. Wooden-spoked artillery-style wheels were fitted. Initially brakes were on the rear wheels, only but front wheel brakes were fitted as {{standard}} from 1925 {{and at the same}} time the wheels became steel-spoked.|$|R
