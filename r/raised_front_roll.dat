40|$|A {{new design}} of <b>front</b> <b>rolls</b> in ring {{spinning}} frame is offered to improve properties of the yarn. Perforated bottom <b>front</b> <b>roll</b> accompanied by modification {{in the shape of}} the roller and its flutes is considered for better bounding of the fibers into yarn structure. Then, modified rollers are constructed and mounted in front of the prior <b>front</b> <b>rolls.</b> Sample ring yarns with count of 15 and 20 Ne were spun separately by means of new system with air suction (M. S. R. Y), without air suction (M. R. Y) and also, by means of ordinary <b>front</b> <b>rolls</b> (T. R. Y) to assess the effects of proposed design on the properties of the yarn. This paper presents the comparison of mechanical and qualitative characteristics of the spun yarns. Study shows that, new design of <b>front</b> <b>rolls</b> had positive influence on improving properties of the samples. Yarn samples were the same in terms of tenacity in 0. 05 level of significance but different in 0. 01. The elongation at break of M. S. R. Y was the highest but, the yarn sample was the lowest in terms of mass variations (CV%), imperfections and hairiness in comparison with the M. R. Y and T. R. Y samples...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pulse transit time, which {{correlates}} with blood pressure, is measured between the electrocardiogram R-wave peak and 50 % <b>raising</b> <b>front</b> {{level of a}} photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. Registered PPG signal bandwidth may be shared by noise and therefore the signal <b>raising</b> <b>front</b> is undetectable. Electrocardiogram reference adaptive sum comb filter was used to extract the harmonic components of the PPG signal and suppress the noises between them. Averaging effect of the filter on the PPG signal was studied and adjustments were made. The influence of the comb filtered PPG signal on the measurement of pulse transit time was analysed. Key words: photoplethysmography, electrocardiography, pulse transit time, adaptive comb filter. 1...|$|R

50|$|Rolling, first {{demonstrated}} by Ken Westerfield in 1975, is performed when the disc rolls across {{any part of}} the body. The most common roll is the chest or <b>front</b> <b>roll,</b> which is performed when the disc rolls from one hand, across the chest, to the second hand in order to be caught or released for more maneuvers. Experienced players often perform front, back, and leg rolls, with and against the spin, in creative combination.|$|R

50|$|Running {{backwards}} {{down a hill}} is more dangerous, and it is {{advised that}} someone learn how to drop into a backward roll before attempting it, to deal with any resulting tripping or loss of balance in the prone movement. Although {{the distance to the}} ground is greater running downhill backwards, the incline makes it much easier to perform rolls in downhill running, than when running level ground, so it can be done more instinctively. This applies to backward running and the backroll as it does to front running and the <b>front</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hortillon means {{market garden}} in Picard, and {{derives from the}} Latin hortillus, small garden. It is {{circulated}} in flat bottom boats, formerly called barque à cornet , due to the very <b>raised</b> <b>front,</b> which allows the boats to easily dock on the fragile shores of the cultivated fields. It is the port of upstream, located {{at the foot of}} the cathedral where a weekly market is held on the water, although the arrival by boat of the growers can be accomplished only once a year, in summer.|$|R
50|$|In the {{conventional}} arrangement, the front roller is mounted centrally, {{forward of the}} chimney. In order to allow enough clearance from the boiler (and hence a larger <b>front</b> <b>roll),</b> the smokebox is extended forward substantially at the top to incorporate a support plate on which to mount the bearing for the roller assembly. This gives the distinctive, hooded look {{to the front of}} a steam roller. It also necessitates a different design of smokebox door - it has to hinge up or down, rather than opening sideways, due to the limited access available. Access to the boiler tubes for cleaning is limited and the brush usually has to be inserted through the small gap between the top of the roll and the fork.|$|R
