The two main types of work song in England are agricultural work songs, usually are rhythmic a cappella songs sung by people working on a physical and often <b>repetitive</b> <b>task,</b> like the 'Harvest song' common in south-west England. The songs were probably intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom. Rhythms of work songs can serve to synchronize physical movement in a group or gang. Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the 18th century, as workers took the music {{with which they were}} familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances. Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry. As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in textile production, mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries.|$|E

5000|$|... "Merck’s {{behavioral}} psychopharmacology screening program finally identified one highly {{promising new}} antidepressant. Code named MK-202, the chemical increased lever-pressing work output under {{a range of}} conditions, in seemingly more adaptive ways than amphetamine. For instance, in the “strained fixed-ratio” test, designed to measure “an animal’s ability to handle an overly large workload with inadequate motivation,” MK-202 performed better than dextroamphetamine. Here, hungry rats were given a drop of condensed milk only after pressing a lever two hundred times {{in response to a}} light signal. However, {{in the middle of their}} heavy and under-rewarded task a second light would turn on intermittently, and if they immediately responded by pressing a second lever they would get a milk drop instantly. Thus, this experiment measured both willingness to do “a particularly long and tedious job” as well as “alertness” to a second stimulus, according to Merck researchers. The rats on amphetamine performed well on the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> but tended to miss the second stimulus; not so the rats on MK-202. Given the similarity between the rat’s situation and the repetitive work that most people must endure to make a living, a drug that increased lever pressing without producing unresponsiveness would seem a likely antidepressant—provided we accept that inefficiency in unrewarding jobs indicates psychiatric depression.""This implicit identification of impaired work efficiency with depressive illness, inscribed in the use of amphetamine-boosted lever pressing as the benchmark that subsequent antidepressants had to meet, applied to the highest level executive type of work also. (The business world is called a “rat race” with reason!) This is evident from another test, designed to measure a rat’s capacity to perform complex tasks. Here, to get a reward, rats had to press a lever rapidly when a white light was on, slowly when a red light was on, and not at all when both lights were on. The rats on amphetamine pressed their levers fast no matter what lights were on, but the rats on MK-202 only pressed fast when high speed was rewarded. In these and a half a dozen other experiments with trained rats subject to diabolically ingenious “reinforcement schedules” (that is, particular programs of reward and punishment), MK-202 outperformed amphetamine for boosting work output, maximizing reward, and minimizing punishment, particularly when tasks were both difficult and unrewarding. A more promising antidepressant drug candidate could hardly be imagined, and in January 1960 the behavioral psychopharmacology unit passed it on for human testing as an antidepressant, with its highestrecommendation." ...|$|E
40|$|Repetitive {{workplace}} {{tasks are}} associated with fatigue induced changes to shoulder muscular behavior, which can alter glenohumeral joint kinematics and lead to chronic injury. However, accessible and reliable methods to detect shoulder muscle fatigue in the workplace are scarce. The overall purpose of this thesis was twofold. First to determine if changes in upper extremity joint angle across individuals during a workplace emulative <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> exhibit features that may be visually identifiable, and second, to characterize the relationship between potentially visually identifiable changes in thoracohumeral elevation and traditional indicators of shoulder muscle fatigue. Twenty-seven, young healthy individuals performed a seated repetitive manuals materials handling task requiring them to lift and lower a weighted bottle between two target locations to exhaustion. During the last five lift motions of each 2 -minute interval during the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task,</b> a symbolic motion structure representation (SMSR) algorithm was used to identify the basic spatial-temporal structure of the time series upper extremity joint angle data (i. e. torso, thoracohumeral, elbow and wrist), followed by measures of selected shoulder muscle electromyography (EMG) mean power frequency (MPF) and ratings of perceived fatigue and discomfort (RPF/RPD). Joint angle SMSRs characterize motion as a sequence of directional changes in joint angle time series data, which are easier to visually identify by ergonomists, in comparison to joint angle magnitudes. Changes in joint angle SMSRs occurred across upper extremity joints for most participants (at least 24 of 27) in this <b>repetitive</b> <b>task.</b> A weak positive linear relationship existed between the onset of changes in thoracohumeral elevation SMSR and the onset of shoulder muscle fatigue (as identified by {{a decline in the}} EMG MPF from the infraspinatus muscle) (R 2 = 0. 275, p = 0. 02). Participants who varied the thoracohumeral elevation SMSR, in comparison to those who did not, exhibited a 7. 45 % greater decrease in anterior deltoid EMG MPF (p = 0. 304), indicative of higher levels of muscle fatigue, throughout the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task.</b> In principle, the results of this thesis indicate that upper extremity kinematic changes in a <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> may be visually identifiable as directional changes in joint motion identified by the SMSR algorithm. The relationship between anterior deltoid muscle fatigue and variability in thoracohumeral elevation SMSRs throughout the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> provide a link between potentially visually identifiable directional changes in thoracohumeral elevation joint motion (SMSR) and shoulder muscle fatigue accumulation. These initial findings can inform future research endeavors aimed at developing heuristic guidelines for visually identifying variations in thoracohumeral joint angles as a more accessible method to identify local shoulder muscle fatigue in ergonomics assessments...|$|E

40|$|Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) {{is common}} after stroke and {{individuals}} with USN have greater disability than individuals without USN. Existing interventions for USN must be examined more closely and new interventions {{should be considered}} to identify interventions that show the most promise for reducing disability associated with USN. The focus of this dissertation was three-fold. First, we examined {{the state of the}} science related to interventions for USN after stroke, and articulated a scientific rationale for examining <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice. Second, we examined the association between USN and changes in impaired arm function over time. Third, we conducted a Phase II pilot clinical trial examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice among adults with USN after stroke. 	The findings highlight the complexities of impairments associated with USN (impaired arm use, impaired arm function, inattention). We proposed a new conceptual model that may be useful in conceptualizing and examining new intervention approaches to USN. We found that individuals with USN have greater impairments in arm function than individuals without USN at the onset of stroke rehabilitation, and that the trajectory of motor recovery is attenuated for individuals with USN in the next 6 months. We also determined that it is feasible to recruit and retain individuals with chronic USN and hemiparesis to participate in an intensive <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice program and that the intervention was tolerable for participants. Finally, we found that individuals with USN experience small, yet statistically reliable improvements in arm use, arm function, and attention after participating in a <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> practice program. 	Future studies should prospectively examine variability in the trajectories of motor recovery, attention, and disability among individuals with USN from the onset of stroke through the first year or two after stroke to inform the refinement of sample selection criteria, intervention design and timing, as well as outcome assessment. These data may be used in future studies to explore additional interventions that address impaired arm use, impaired arm function, and inattention associated with USN. ...|$|E
