40|$|Democratic movements, market mechanisms, and {{decentralization}} {{reforms have}} been at the heart of transformation of former USSR republics. Republic of Moldova was not an exception. The initial argument behind such fascination with these reforms stems from the idea that market mechanisms in an open and democratic society will facilitate the efficient and effective resources ’ allocation, compensating for interim distributive ineq-uities and macro-economic challenges. Such a natural experiment has been in progress for more than 20 years in the Republic of Moldova. During these 20 years Moldova experienced democracy in its infancy, democratic return of communism, and once again return to democracy and its core ideas and values. Public administration system along with public finance and budgeting systems experienced comparably abrupt changes in their development. This qualitative study of Moldovan public administration and fi-nance frameworks will provide an evaluative description of these three distinct, but in-terrelated periods in Moldovan history of independence and development of public ad-ministration and public budgeting systems.

The {{main focus of}} the analysis is {{the effects of this}} differentiation on consumer behavior. In order to comprehend the importance of these price reductions, the report also investigates {{the pros and cons of}} electric vehicles in relation to conventional, gasoline powered cars. Benefits include lower emission rates of green house gasses and toxic particles, whereas barriers include higher production prices, limited range and a somewhat limited availability of public charging stations. The applied theoretical perspective advocates that various interests are taken into consideration, in order to understand the underlying <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> or failure of a given policy. Therefore this analysis attempts to understand the reasons behind the choices of politicians, businesses and costumers. The main analytical findings are that the tax reductions are currently very important for the continued market expansion of electric cars, whereas the other limitations of range, recharging and safety are not nearly as severe an issue, as they have previously been. The fact that they still take up a large part of the public debate is thus rather an expression of a slow-dying prejudice than an actual limitation of modern electric vehicles...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In todays world {{software}} testing with statistical fault localization technique {{is one of}} most tedious expensive and time consuming activity. In faulty program a program element contrast dynamic spectra that estimate location of fault. There may have negative impact from coincidental correctness with these technique because in non failed run the fault can also be triggered out and if so disturb the assessment of fault location. Now eliminating of confounding rules on the recognizing the accuracy. In this paper coincidental correctness which is an effective interface is the <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> fault location. We can find out fault predicates by distribution overlapping of dynamic spectrum in failed runs and non failed runs and slacken the area by referencing the inter class distances of spectra to clamp the less suspicious candidate. After that we apply coverage matrix base reduction approach to reduce the test cases of that program and locate the fault in that program. Finally empirical result shows that our technique outshine with previous existing predicate based fault localization technique with test case reduction...|$|R

40|$|Discourse {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the methods of identifying ideologies reflected in text as well as the communication strategies used to convey those ideologies effectively to the addressed audience. Political business speeches defined as ‘a relatively autonomous discourse produced orally by a politician {{in front of an audience}} with the main purpose of persuading the audience into accepting a business proposition’ can be a good source to understand (a) the dominant business ideologies in a country, and (b) the <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> or failure of a political leader in conveying his/her business ideologies and/or justifying his/her business proposition.

Analyzing one of Dr. Mahathir’s speeches delivered at an international business summit in the year 2000 revealed some of his ideologies with regard to Euro-Asia business relationships as well as the communication strategies he used to convey these ideologies to the audience. In this speech, Dr. Mahathir strongly believes in ‘equal power in Euro-Asia relationships’ as well as ‘unity and solidarity among Asian countries’ as the two main ideologies in this speech; and he tries to convey these ideologies by ‘referring to the bitter history of Euro-Asia relationships’ as well as ‘using pronouns’ as the two salient strategies used in this speech...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to provide a systematic review of the literature addressing internationalisation of firms from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Design/methodology/approach: This article presents an inter-disciplinary systematic review of literature about the internationalisation of firms from CEE. Findings: Three different clusters of research were identified. In the "Internationalisation Processes" cluster, containing many comparative studies, the focus is on specific approaches adopted by local firms in the process of internationalisation. One of the leitmotivs is the dichotomy between hostile home-country factors that create the need for internationalisation and market- seeking motives that guide the search for international expansion. The "Internationalisation Variables" cluster aims to explain the <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> or failure of internationalisation processes and strategies; this cluster focuses on possible facilitating or hindering aspects experienced by CEE firms and one often-cited element is the firm's network. Finally, the "Internationalisation Outcomes" cluster assumes a reverse approach when compared to the other two clusters. Indeed, the internationalisation phenomenon can also be studied in terms of its effect on the firm; the elements sought in these types of studies are both potential benefits and risks associated with internationalisation in CEE countries. The latter category in particular gives rise to interesting questions for future research. Originality/value: Given that large, developed economies tend to receive much academic interest, and that smaller transitional economies are not always adequately represented in the scientific discussion, this article contributes to the literature on internationalisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of supply networks to ensure timely and high quality information sharing between trading partners {{is an essential}} component in supply chain performance development. This dissertation investigates how various interorganizational relationships among supply network partners affect the adoption and spread of interorganizational information system standards. The thesis develops the Adoption Position theoretical model and applies it {{in the form of}} comparative case studies to explain the <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> and failure of recent IOS adoptions. The analysis spans multiple tiers of three international supply chains, providing altogether 15 cases of dyadic relationships. The cases suggest that the electronic exchange of information between trading partners does not only depend on their intention to adopt the system, but on the underlying power structure as well. A conflict of interest in IOS adoption coupled with an unsupportive power structure can lead to inefficiencies in the supply network and can indirectly thwart the efforts to realize an integrated supply chain. The results suggest that the intention to adopt a specific IOS and the relative power relationship between trading partners together determine the adoption decision and the degree of collaboration within the supply network. Using the Adoption Position model the study identifies the type of relationships that are supportive towards collaboration and the ones which are not. The model is used to map entire supply chains and to examine the prospect of supply chain-wide diffusion of an integrating technology. The thesis contributes to business practice by offering strategies on how to make IOS integration a success. ...|$|E

In Iran, surveys have been conducted on various high risk groups {{but this is the}} first announcement based study for hepatitis C virus HCV prevalence among cases with history of intravenous drug using (IVDU) in the country. Methods: The announcement-based detection and follow-up of patients with anti-HCV positive project in volunteers with history of intravenous drug using was conducted in Isfahan province. At the first step, six focus groups were conducted and 2 pilot studies were carried out in two cities to design the main study. Comprehensive community announcement was done in all of public places and for physicians. The volunteers were invited to Isfahan reference laboratories and the serum samples were sent to Infectious Diseases Research Center Laboratory in standard conditions and HCV-Ab was tested by ELISA method. Results: In this study, 1, 747 individuals that are estimated 50 % of all expected intravenous drug users in the community were presented themselves. The most important <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> in recruiting volunteers in this study were the perfect propaganda, appropriate cooperation of lab staffs, continuous evaluation and good cooperation in Isfahan province administrations.

40|$|AbstractThe need to {{increase}} productivity and to reduce drilling damage favors the use of underbalanced drilling (UBD) technology. In highly depleted reservoirs, extremely low-density fluids, such as foams or aerated mud, are used to achieve circulating densities lower than the pore pressure. In such cases, the induced modification of the in situ stresses has to be supported mainly by the rock, with little contribution from the drilling fluid pressure. The application of underbalanced drilling depends on the mechanical stability of the drilled formation, among other factors. In general, poorly consolidated, depleted formations are not suited for that technology. In this paper, 23 UBD worldwide cases have been analyzed; {{two of which are}} from Egyptian fields and the others are from Iran, Algeria, Kuwait, Oman, Texas, Mexico, Indonesia, Canada, Libya, Middle East, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Lithuania. From these analyses, the reasons of failure or success have been stated. The <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> included depleted reservoirs and highly fractured carbonates formation while, the reasons of failure include over pressurized shale, highly tectonic stress areas, and downhole failures. The main attractive application of this technology was proposed to be only in the reservoir section, and the target was to prevent the reservoir damage and hence increase the productivity and recovery factor. A proposed underbalanced drilling program is developed based on these analyses {{to be used in the}} three main regions in oil and gas producing Egyptian fields. The aerated mud was selected as a drilling fluid to drill the reservoir section in Western Desert and Gulf of Suez region whereas the single phase fluid was selected as a drilling fluid in the Nile Delta region...|$|E

The aim {{of this research is}} comparative study of relationship between general perceived self-efficacy and test anxiety in academic achievement of male and female students. This study is the correlation one. In the present study, 350 students (175 males’ and 175 females) were selected by random sampling method. To measure the general perceived self-efficacy, it was used self-efficacy questionnaire (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995), to measure the test anxiety, it was used test anxiety questionnaire (Abolghasemi and colleagues, 1996) and finally to gather demographic data, it was used a prepared inventory. The results showed that there was a positive significant relationship between general perceived self-efficacy and students academic achievement (female: r = 0. 551, P< 0. 000, male: r = 0. 281, P< 0. 004) and a negative significant relationship between test anxiety and students academic achievement (female: r =- 0. 674, P< 0. 000, male: r =- 0. 121, P< 0. 043). The results of regression analysis showed that in academic achievement of female students, test anxiety (- 0. 084) and in academic achievement of male students, self-efficacy (0. 057) had significant predictive power and in academic achievement of male students, test anxiety and female student's general perceived self-efficacy had no significant predictive power.
