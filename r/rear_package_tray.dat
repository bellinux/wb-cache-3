50|$|The {{condition}} was exacerbated by police equipment installers drilling over the <b>package</b> <b>tray</b> in the luggage compartment. Due {{to the gas}} tank's orientation, drilling through the <b>package</b> <b>tray</b> may result in drilling into the gas tank. Installers also used screws set directly into the bulkhead and facing the fuel tank. In {{the event of a}} high-energy collision, these screws could be forced into the tank, both rupturing the tank and possibly acting as a spark source. Long bolts for mounting heavier equipment were also directly suspect. The manufacturer provided an aftermarket shield to help prevent these items from puncturing the tank during impact. Further, many investigations, both performed by federal/state agencies, and the police department themselves, have found that removable items in the trunk were improperly stowed. These items became tank-piercing projectiles during the rear-collision scenarios. Ford's second solution {{came in the form of}} a recall kit including patterns to mark unsafe areas (to drill) in the luggage compartment. Also included were rubberized kevlar and hard ballistic nylon shields for the differential cover lower shock bolts. They also included a kevlar-based trunk liner. Ford used similar kits on early-1980s model passenger vehicles. For 2005 and newer models, Ford offers an optional on-board fire-suppression system for the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor units. The system itself is integrated with the anti-lock braking system as part of the activation, and can be activated manually. However, Ford does cite several system limitations regarding fuel loss and impact speeds.|$|R

40|$|Pecan nutshells are a {{solid form}} of waste {{obtained}} from the pecan nut production {{and they have been}} explored as an inexpensive filler for incorporation by melt blending into the poly(lactic acid) (PLA) matrix. The pecan nutshells contain polyphenols, proteins, tannins, sugars, and lipids; some of these components must be released in order to improve adhesion with a polymeric matrix. The physicochemical characterization of the extruded biocomposites of pecan nutshell powder (PNSP) at 0, 5, and 7. 5 % wt. with two treatments (untreated and defatted) into PLA is presented in this work. The incorporation of PNSP into the PLA matrix caused a variation in color and density and increased the water absorption. However, some mechanical and thermal parameters of the biocomposites showed a significant decrease. The morphological analysis showed good dispersion and adhesion of the PNSP to the PLA matrix. Based on the results of the characterization, biocomposites formulated with defatted PNSP have a potential to be used as sustainable fillers in PLA biocomposites. These biocomposites have a potential application as food containers, <b>packaging</b> <b>trays,</b> or disposable items...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we propose}} {{the method of}} optimally {{selecting}} material of front pillar (A-pillar) and <b>package</b> <b>tray</b> for minimizing weight while satisfying vehicle requirements on static stiffness and dynamic stiffness. First, we formulate a material selection optimization problem. Next, we establish the CAE procedure of evaluating static stiffness and dynamic stiffness. Then, to enhance the efficiency of design work, we integrate and automate the established CAE procedure using a commercial process integration and design optimization (PIDO) tool, PIAnO. For effective optimi-zation, we adopt the approach of metamodel based approximate optimization. As a sampling method, an orthogonal array (OA) is used for selecting sampling points. The response values are evaluated at the sampling points and then these response values are used to generate a metamodel of each response using the radial basis function regression (RBFr). Using the RBFr models, optimization is carried out an evolutionary algorithm that can handle discrete design variables. Material optimization result reveals that the weight is reduced by 49. 8 % while satisfying all the design constraints...|$|R

The management and disease problems with cost-benefit {{analysis of the}} layer chick <b>rearer</b> <b>package</b> programme of the PLDP have been evaluated in randomly selected 10 layer chick rearing units (n= 3100 chicks) from day-old chicks up to 60 days to marketing of Muktagacha areas {{in the district of}} Mymensingh during the period from August to December 2002. It appears from {{the results of this study}} that 12. 87 % chicks died within 60 days of age inspite of chick reared in intensive management system and provided vaccines against common infectious diseases. The diagnosed diseases associated with mortality of chicks included infectious bursal disease (37. 6 %), coccidiosis (13. 28 %), chronic respiratory disease (13. 28 %) and other conditions (35. 84 %). The highest mortality rate (37. 6 %) in layer chicks, caused by infectious bursal disease (IBD), which were double vaccinated with Nobilisï¿½ Gumboro D- 78 vaccines (Intervet) that indicates vaccination failure against IBD which deserve further investigation. Cost-benefit analysis of the outcome of the 10 layer chick rearing units varied, and it was found loss in one unit (- 3. 17 %) and the highest profit of 45. 66 % with an average profit of 27. 33 %.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} an AI heifer calf rearing scheme on dairy stock development, in a coconut grazing and a peri-urban smallholder dairy production system in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. The heifer rearing scheme included free advice on calf rearing, drugs, acaricides, minerals and subsidised concentrates for 30 months. The farmers in the coconut growing area integrate dairying with their plantation, they sell their milk to the main processors. The peri-urban farmers are intensive milk producers, who sell their milk at informal markets. To estimate {{the effect of the}} heifer rearing scheme on dairy replacement stock development, scheme farmers were compared with farmers who did not participate in the scheme. Calf mortality was twice as high in non-scheme farms (23 - 28 %) as in scheme farms (12 - 14 %).

40|$|For {{packaged}} fresh produce, inappropriate high {{relative humidity}} (RH) levels and condensation of water vapour cause premature spoilage. Humidity-regulating trays {{were developed to}} solve this issue. They were made from a thermoformed multilayer structure: polyethylene (outside) /foamed hygroscopic ionomer (active layer) with 0 or 12 wt% NaCl/hygroscopic ionomer (sealing layer, inside). Moisture absorption kinetics of the humidity-regulating trays with 0 and 12 wt% NaCl (T- 0 and T- 12, respectively) was investigated under different RH conditions (76, 86, 96 and 100 %) at 13 Â°C for 16 days. Additional trays containing 7 g of distilled water were closed with a high barrier lidding film, and the headspace RH was continuously monitored {{as a function of}} time. As control, a polypropylene (control-PP) tray was used. Strawberries and tomatoes were used to test capability of the trays to regulate in-package RH. The amount of water absorbed by the T- 0 and T- 12 trays was 7. 6 and 13. 2 g, respectively. Active hygroscopic ionomer layer was effective in water vapour absorption, and the integration of NaCl into this active layer increased the water vapour absorption capacity of the tray. The Weibull model adequately described the moisture sorption kinetics of the individual <b>packaging</b> <b>trays</b> as a function of time. The headspace RH of trays covered with a lidding film was found to be 89. 8, 99. 6 and 100 % in the T- 12, T- 0 and control-PP trays, respectively. The T- 12 trays containing fresh produce best regulated the in-package RH below 97 % and maintained overall quality, but at the expense of slightly higher product weight loss (2 â 3 wt% for strawberry, 1 wt% for tomatoes) compared to the control-PP trays (0. 3 â 0. 6 wt%) ...|$|R
40|$|The use of wood fibres for {{production}} of bio-based composites has attracted interest in various application sectors ranging from packaging to automotive components {{and in other}} high value applications. In {{the course of the}} present research activity, several bio-based composites were developed using wood fibres with a compostable polymeric matrix such as polylactic acid (PLA) and a flexible biodegradable polymer such as poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT). The developed materials were used for the manufacture of several prototypes for food <b>packaging</b> (<b>trays,</b> boxes for refrigerated or frozen fish, egg box), agricultural applications (pots and yarns), automotive components (spoiler and seats) as well as containers for cosmetics and chemicals. Biodegradability and compostability are desired properties, allowing bio-recycling as end of life scenario, mainly for materials used in food packaging and agricultural applications. Thus, they may be recycled {{at the end of their}} life time service producing compost as a value-added by-product. Composting is the main option for bio-recycling but also other valuable pathways can be pursued. Because lignocellulose is one of the components of developed materials, several by-products such as enzymes, reducing sugars, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, etc. may be obtained from the bio-composites produced. Alternatively, the bio-composites can be also used for the production of yeast biomass. This is important as another recyclability way of the new produced materials. In the present research the bio-composites produced were investigated as substrates for the production of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, a potential source of single-cell protein (SCP), Î²-carotene, and Rhodotorula sp. as potential source of food and feed grade colorant. This is another more valuable alternative to the composting considering also that composting cannot be used to dispose of large quantities of bio-plastics, and in the future it will become more and more important to find alternative routes of valorisation for bio-plastics disposal...|$|R
