5000|$|The {{difference}} from conventional wire-brushing with an angle grinder lies {{first with the}} mounting of the bristles in the rotating brush. With a conventional rotary brush, the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are mounted <b>resiliently</b> in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed [...] 'accelerator bar' , which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact {{the surface of the}} workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple rotary brush at the same speed.|$|E

5000|$|... (2) Three-Hit Concept of {{vulnerability}} and resilience: this hypothesis states {{that within a}} specific life context, vulnerability may be enhanced with chronic failure to cope with ongoing adversity. It fundamentally seeks to explicate why, under seemingly indistinguishable circumstances, one individual may cope <b>resiliently</b> with stress, whereas another may not only cope poorly, but consequently develop a stress-related mental illness. The three “hits” - chronological and synergistic - are as follows: genetic predisposition (which predispose higher/lower HPA axis reactivity), early-life environment (perinatal - i.e. maternal stress, and postnatal - i.e. maternal care), and later-life environment (which determines match/mismatch, {{as well as a}} window for neuroplastic changes in early programming). (Figure 1)6 The concept of match/mismatch is central to this evolutionary hypothesis. In this context, it elucidates why early life programming in the perinatal and postnatal period may have been evolutionarily selected for. Specifically, by instating specific patterns of HPA axis activation, the individual may be more well equipped to cope with adversity in a high-stress environment. Conversely, if an individual is exposed to significant early life adversity, heightened HPA axis reactivity may “mismatch” him/her in an environment characterized by low stress. The latter scenario may represent maladaptation due to early programming, genetic predisposition, and mismatch. This mismatch may then predict negative developmental outcomes such as psychopathologies in later life.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. Divorce is an ever-present {{phenomenon}} in society. This {{is also true}} for white Afrikaans-speaking adolescents. Some of these adolescents seem to cope <b>resiliently</b> with the risk inherent in divorce while others struggle to cope. I wanted to determine what protective factors and processes {{are present in the}} lives of white Afrikaans-speaking adolescents who do function <b>resiliently.</b> The aims of the study were to explain what adolescent resilience means, document the impact of divorce on adolescents, conduct an empirical study to determine what protective factors and processes contribute to resilience, and to develop resilience promoting guidelines {{in the form of a}} concept program for Life Orientation educators and other service providers who might encourage resilience among white Afrikaans-speaking adolescents from divorced families. The study followed the prescriptions of the International Youth Resilience Study (IYRS), which includes a triangulated mixed method design. An advisory panel drawn from the communities of the participants helped to develop site specific questions and to identify resilient and non-resilient white Afrikaans-speaking adolescents from divorced families from different schools in three provinces. In total, 64 participants completed the Child and Youth Resilience measure (CYRM) and ten resilient adolescents were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The resulting findings suggested that protective factors and processes inherent to the individual, relationships, the community and culture helped the resilient adolescents to cope adaptively with their parents' divorce. In line with more recent thinking, the findings confirmed that protective resources that encourage resilience are group-specific. Using the protective factors and processes identified by the participants, I compiled a concept programme to encourage adolescents from white Afrikaans-speaking divorced families to function more <b>resiliently.</b> The concept programme includes a ten-session, group intervention programme for adolescents and complementary workshops for their parents, educators, friends and community leaders. The concept programme was not implemented and so a future intervention study is recommended to test the concept programme. Future studies could also look at the relevance of the programme for adolescents from divorced families in other cultures. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. In South Africa today many {{adolescents}} {{are faced with}} having to cope with their parents' divorce. There are many risks that occur when {{adolescents are}} faced with divorce. Of late {{research has suggested that}} parental divorce is an increasingly common phenomenon in black families, but there is no literature which focuses on what contributes to black adolescents coping <b>resiliently</b> with their parents' divorce. The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide answers, by means of a literature review and empirical research, to what the antecedents of resilience are among black adolescents coping <b>resiliently</b> with their parents divorce. This was achieved by using a qualitative phenomenological design: ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with resilient black adolescents coping well with their parents' divorce. This study makes a contribution to theory because it suggests a new resilience -promoting resource for black youth from divorced homes, namely dedicated support from friends and teachers (support that is 'always' available), not noted in previous resilience studies. This study also contributed to theory by confirming that resilience promoting processes such as community-facilitated spaces (hostel residence), extra-curricular activities at school and cultural rites encourage resilience among youth whose parents are divorced. This has not been noted in previous literature studies. The findings of this study were used to draft recommendations for Life Orientation teachers on how to encourage resilience among black South African adolescents coping with the adversities of their parents' divorce. In so doing my study made a potential contribution to practice. Master...|$|E
