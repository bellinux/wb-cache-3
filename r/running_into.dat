5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons <b>running</b> <b>into</b> the Black Canyon slope {{in the wrong}} {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E

A mostly-new road (now eastbound US 46) was built from Hackettstown east to Netcong to avoid steep grades {{on the existing}} roads. Portions of the existing Budd's Lake Road were used between Budd Lake and Netcong. From Netcong the route used the old Morris Turnpike to Ledgewood and the Dover Turnpike to Dover, <b>running</b> <b>into</b> Dover on Blackwell Street.

5|$|Rowley {{dismissed}} {{this idea}} given the shattered state of Africaine and instead towed the frigate back to Île Bourbon, shadowed by Astrée and Iphigénie {{on the return}} journey. The French frigates did achieve some consolation in pursuing Rowley from a distance, <b>running</b> <b>into</b> and capturing the Honourable East India Company's armed brig Aurora, sent from India to reinforce Rowley. On 15 September, Boadicea, Africaine and the brigs arrived at Saint Paul, Africaine sheltering under the fortifications of the harbour while the others put to sea, again seeking to drive away the French blockade but unable {{to bring them to}} action. Bouvet returned to Port Napoleon on 18 September, and thus was not present when Rowley attacked and captured the French flagship Vénus and Commodore Hamelin at the Action of 18 September 1810.|$|E

5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon <b>running</b> <b>into</b> first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. Perhaps {{it was due to}} this lukewarmness that Władysław was never able to inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
