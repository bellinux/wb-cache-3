25|$|A <b>Roomette,</b> in the {{historically}} correct {{sense of the}} word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional <b>Roomette</b> is in night mode, the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes {{are placed on both}} sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car's floor level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly Spartan form of <b>Roomette.</b>|$|E
25|$|The train {{currently}} has four classes, branded as Platinum, Gold Service, Red Service Sleeper and Red Service Daynighter. The Platinum Service {{was introduced in}} 2008 as a premium class of travel. The Gold Service, the former first-class service, features either <b>roomette</b> or twinette sleeper cabins, with complimentary meals in the restaurant car.|$|E

50|$|Unlike twinettes, <b>roomettes</b> do {{not include}} a shower; {{passengers}} use a communal shower {{at the end of}} the car, and also a toilet in the same location if they wish. Occasionally older <b>roomettes</b> do not have their own toilet either.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{railroads and}} carbuilders were debuting carbody and {{interior}} styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettes—that is, the car's interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman's roomettes, however, were designed with the single traveler in mind. The <b>roomette</b> featured a large picture window, a privacy door, a single fold-away bed, a sink and small toilet. The roomette's floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveler to ride in luxury compared to the multilevel semiprivate berths of old.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Amtrak {{converted}} two Amfleet I coaches into sleepers ( [...] 22900 and 22901). Two prototype Superliner <b>roomette</b> modules were installed, displacing twelve seats. The cars were {{used on the}} Washington—Cincinnati Shenandoah.

50|$|Amtrak {{designed}} {{new types}} of sleeping-car accommodations when it began constructing new long-distance equipment in the late 1970s, and today it uses two primary types of sleeping cars. Most long-distance trains use double-deck Superliner equipment, while a few eastern trains use single-level Viewliner cars. <b>Roomettes</b> on these sleeping cars include single bench seats {{on both ends of}} the room; the seats fold together to form a single bunk bed, and an upper bunk folds down from the ceiling. Superliner <b>roomettes</b> do not include private toilets or washbasins, but Viewliner <b>roomettes</b> do.|$|R

50|$|A <b>roomette</b> {{is a type}} of {{sleeping}} car compartment in a railroad passenger train. The term was first used in North America, and was carried over into Australia and New Zealand. <b>Roomette</b> rooms are relatively small, and were generally intended for use by a single person; contemporary roomettes on Amtrak, however, include two sleeping berths.|$|E
5000|$|The floor-plan in newer <b>roomette</b> cars is {{somewhat}} different, and {{was designed to}} remedy this shortcoming. The corridor zigzags slightly down the car, and the floor-plan of each <b>roomette</b> forms a trapezium with two right angles (following non-North-American {{use of the word}} [...] "trapezium" [...] - this word and [...] "trapezoid" [...] swap meanings depending on whether they are used in or out of North America). The bed occupies the rectangular area closest {{to the side of the}} car, and there remains a small right-angled triangular area of floor space which remains clear, its hypotenuse adjacent to the corridor, which zigzags the opposite way once at the start of each <b>roomette</b> on each side, dovetailing with the triangular area in each <b>roomette.</b> This extra floor space is sufficient to unfold the toilet and wash basin, so that they can be used while the bed is still folded down.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} {{sleeping car}} has five bedrooms and ten <b>roomettes</b> {{on the upper}} level. The bedrooms are set against {{one side of the}} car with a hallway along the edge, while the <b>roomettes</b> are located to each side with the hallway running down the centerline. At the center of the car are the stairs to the lower level and a bathroom. A hallway runs through the centerline of the lower level with the accessible bedroom at one end and the family bedroom at the other. To one side of the stairs are three bathrooms and one shower, and to the other are four more <b>roomettes.</b> Luggage racks are located opposite the stairs. The layout of the deluxe sleeping car is similar. There are ten bedrooms on the upper level with a continuous hallway along one edge. The lower level contains opposed family and accessible bedrooms, four toilets, four <b>roomettes,</b> and a luggage rack. Two bedrooms may be combined to form a [...] "bedroom suite".|$|R
