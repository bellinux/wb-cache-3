50|$|In 1986, slit rolling was {{introduced}} to Hadeed's Rolling Mills, increasing the daily production record by more than 21%. In 1987, a scrap car shredder plant was commissioned. With a capacity of 50 tonnes per hour, it shreds cars into pieces small enough to be charged into the electric arc furnaces. In 1988, Hadeed introduced a new technology (Bar Quenching) to its rolling mills in Jubail for the manufacture of concrete reinforcing bars. This process involves high pressure surface quenching followed by self-tempering. As the bar emerges from the last <b>rolling</b> <b>stand,</b> the surface temperature is rapidly reduced by high pressure water jets. This action causes change in the microstructure of the steel, making it harder and stronger. Subsequently the heat retained in the core dissipates out and heats the surface to around 620 °C causing another change in the microstructure, which improves the ductility and toughness of the bar. This process can meet increasing demands from structural engineers for higher yield strength combined with good ductility and weldability in reinforcing steel to reduce construction costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{quenching}} process {{produces a}} high strength bar from inexpensive low carbon steel. The process quenches the surface {{layer of the}} bar, which pressurizes and deforms the crystal structure of intermediate layers, and simultaneously begins to temper the quenched layers using {{the heat from the}} bar's core. Steel billets 130mm² ("pencil ingots") are heated to approximately 1200°C to 1250°C in a reheat furnace. Then, they are progressively rolled to reduce the billets to the final size and shape of reinforcing bar. After the last <b>rolling</b> <b>stand,</b> the billet moves through a quench box. The quenching converts the billet's surface layer to martensite, and causes it to shrink. The shrinkage pressurizes the core, helping to form the correct crystal structures. The core remains hot, and austenitic. A microprocessor controls the water flow to the quench box, to manage the temperature difference through the cross-section of the bars. The correct temperature difference assures that all processes occur, and bars have the necessary mechanical properties. The bar leaves the quench box with a temperature gradient through its cross section. As the bar cools, heat flows from the bar's centre to its surface so that the bar's heat and pressure correctly tempers an intermediate ring of martensite and bainite. Finally, the slow cooling after quenching automatically tempers the austenitic core to ferrite and pearlite on the cooling bed.|$|E

40|$|Mill rolls {{are ones}} {{of the most}} {{expensive}} tools applied in plastic working processes and have to satisfy several criteria, which allow them to be used. Cast iron mill rolls, due to their fracture toughness and tribological properties, are the most often applied at hot-rolling in the last <b>rolling</b> <b>stands.</b> This results from the smallest dynamic loads of such <b>rolling</b> <b>stands</b> and the decisive influence of the surface quality of these tools on the surface quality of the rolled product. An improper microstructure of rolls can lead to their premature wearing, e. g. broken flanges, pivots twisting off etc. By means of the heat treatment the matrix microstructure and morphology of carbide precipitationscan be modified and this in-turn can influence cast iron properties. Determination of the influence of microstructure changes, caused by the heat treatment, on the properties of EN-GJN-HV 300 low-alloycast iron, after its modification and spheroidization – is the aim of the present paper. Those changes are based on the formation pearlitic or bainitic matrices at the similar morphology of graphite and ledeburitic cementite precipitations. The performed investigations should enable designing the heat treatment of cast iron metallurgical rolls {{in such a way as}} to obtain the optimal microstructures for functional parameters of these type of tools. The influence of changing the pearlitic matrix into the bainitic one on such properties as: hardness, impact strength, tensile strength, creep limit, bending strength and a stress intensity factor KIc was investigated in this study.

40|$|The {{thickness}} of the steel strip is an important indicator of the overall strip quality. Deviations in thickness are primarily controlled using the automatic gauge control (AGC) system of each <b>rolling</b> <b>stand.</b> At the last stand, the monitoring AGC system is usually used, where the deviations in thickness can be directly measured by the X-ray thickness gauge device and used as the input to the AGC system. However, due to the physical distance between the thickness detection device and the <b>rolling</b> <b>stand,</b> time delay is unavoidably present in the thickness control loop, which can affect control performance and lead to system oscillations. Furthermore, {{the parameters of the}} system can change due to perturbations from external disturbances. Therefore, this paper proposes an identification and control scheme for monitoring AGC system that can handle time delay and parameter uncertainty. The cross-correlation function is used to estimate the time delay of the system, while the system parameters are identified using a recursive least squares method. The time delay and parameter estimates are then further refined using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, so as to provide the most accurate parameter estimates for the complete system. Simulation results show that, compared with the standard Proportion Integration Differentiation (PID) controller approach, the proposed approach is not affected by changes in the time delay and parameter uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|The {{high quality}} {{requirements}} of sheet metal (eg steel, aluminium) {{and the modern}} trends towards computer control of sheet rolling have placed an increasing emphasis on {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics of the flat rolling process. The examination of the thermal behaviour of the rolls and rolled product, as the latter is deformed in a <b>rolling</b> <b>stand,</b> is integral to an understanding of rolling. The thermal process occurring in the rolling stands affects the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the material, governs the roll cooling requirements, and influences the overall flatness of the rolled product. This thesis is primarily concerned with the prediction of the short-time variation of the temperature field of the rolls and rolled product, as the latter is deformed in a <b>rolling</b> <b>stand.</b> The effect of an oxide layer, which often exists in hot rolling of steel, on the thermal process has been studied in detail. It is demonstrated that, under normal rolling conditions, the thermal process occurring in rolling can be reduced by perturbation methods to one of heat transfer between three slabs with plane parallel boundary contact. As a result, the reduction in heat loss to the rolls and the increase in temperature of the rolled product due to the insulating effect of the oxide layer can be quantified. The contribution of each heat source term, namely, that arising from the effect of the bulk temperature difference between the roll and rolled product, frictional heating at the roll/rolled product contact region, and deformation heating in the rolled product within the roll gap, to the overall thermal process is estimated for both hot and cold rolling conditions...|$|E

The first part {{is considered to be}} a ‘Real-time’ process meaning that for each image, this part of the processing must be completed within a stipulated time depending on the maximum speed at which the steel object can travel. Once RoIs are identified, second part of processing for the whole batch is required to be completed within the stipulated batch process completion time. Thus, the second part of the algorithm processing time is considered to be ‘Just in time’ process [57].|$|R
