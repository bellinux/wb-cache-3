5|$|The <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Barbours and Proctor crosses Plunketts Creek {{four times}} and the four bridges are {{numbered}} in order, starting from the southernmost in Barbours near the mouth and going upstream. While evidence such as maps indicates that the third bridge was constructed close to 1840, the first definitive proof of its existence is a survey to relocate the <b>road</b> <b>between</b> {{the second and third}} bridges in 1875. The first bridge over Plunketts Creek was replaced with a covered bridge in 1880, and the second bridge was replaced in 1886. That same year, the <b>road</b> <b>between</b> the second and third bridges was moved again, returning to its original position {{on the west side of}} the creek.|$|E
5|$|When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, {{what is now}} PA 997 {{between the}} Maryland border and Waynesboro was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 44 while {{a section of the}} current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264. At this time, an unpaved road ran between Waynesboro, Mont Alto, and Fayetteville. PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto, where an unnumbered paved road continued south to Waynesboro, north to US 30 in Fayetteville, following Mont Alto Road. Upon designation, the entire length of PA 997 was paved. The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316, which was paved, while PA 433 was designated onto the unpaved <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Lurgan and Roxbury. PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg, heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg, northeast to Roxbury, east to Newburg, and south to Shippensburg. Upon designation, PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was unpaved between Pleasant Hall and Newburg. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro, following a paved road. The same year, PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction, running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, while PA 996 was designated onto the paved <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Scotland and US 11 in Green Village. The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 (now PA 533) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an unnumbered <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Upper Strasburg and Roxbury. At this time, the <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Mont Alto and Scotland was an unnumbered, unpaved road, the <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Green Village and Culbertson was an unnumbered, paved road, and the <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Roxbury and McCrea was an unnumbered, unpaved road.|$|E
5|$|A {{concession}} <b>road</b> <b>between</b> Hoyle and Matheson already {{existed at}} this point, {{and over the}} next several years it was reconstructed to provincial standards.

5|$|A {{rerouting}} in late 1971 {{moved the}} US45 designation along M-26 between Rockland and Greenland. From Greenland, US45 followed Ontonagon–Greenland Road to Ontonagon. In late 1973, MDOT reversed the rerouting—US45 was {{restored to its}} previous routing on Rockland <b>Road</b> <b>between</b> Rockland and Ontonagon and M-26 was re-extended south from Greenland to Rockland; M-38 was extended west along Ontonagon–Greenland Road.|$|E
5|$|Also {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering was NY89, which utilized modern NY414 {{north of}} the hamlet of Magee and the portion of Lake Bluff <b>Road</b> <b>between</b> the current NY104 super two and Ridge <b>Road.</b> <b>Between</b> Magee and its current alignment east of the village of Seneca Falls, NY89 used what is now NY318. In the early 1950s, a north–south connector between NY89 in Magee and a junction with US20 and NY5 midway between Waterloo and Seneca Falls was designated NY89A. This route became part of a larger realignment of NY414 in the late 1950s. In the rerouting, NY414 was altered to overlap US20 and NY5 west out of Seneca Falls before following what had been NY89A and NY89 north to US104 (Ridge Road) near the Huron hamlet of Resort. NY89, meanwhile, was realigned to follow the former alignment of NY414 to Wolcott.|$|E
