40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel methodology to allow the synthesis of skeletally diverse alkaloid-like unnatural compounds. Enantiomerically enriched building blocks are iteratively assembled onto a purification handle using reliable coupling reactions. Subsequently, ring-opening-ring-closing metathesis cascade reactions are used as a complexity generating step to <b>restitch</b> the molecular framework. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of diversity-oriented synthesis, with particular emphasis on strategies used to introduce skeletal diversity. The conceptual idea behind the project is explained, and placed into context using leading examples as the benchmark for success in diversity-oriented synthesis. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} synthesis of a range of building blocks, many of which are enantiomerically enriched, on multigram scale. The design of a solid phase 'linker' is described in Chapter 3, as are the solution phase studies used to explore suitable methodologies to couple the building blocks. The use of solid phase chemistry is described in Chapter 4, as well as the use of light fluorous tags as an alternative purification handle. Chapter 5 describes the synthesis and subsequent metathesis of a range of fluorous-tagged metathesis substrates using one building block iteration. The Thesis concludes with the preparation of 45 metathesis precursors using combinations of two building blocks assembled onto a fluoroustagged linker in Chapter 6. Metathesis cascades were carried out, allowing the isolation of 33 complex and skeletally diverse products. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Poets such as Joan Kane, Esther Belin, Natalie Diaz, and Joy Harjo utilize creative agency to reinscribe temporality, making present the power of both traditional and contemporary Indigenous knowledge. By reimagining time, these writers create multiple temporalities, each one with a different poetic possibility of a future. The <b>restitching</b> of time that occurs through Native poetry brings together the reservation and the city, stillness and motion, the cycles of the seasons and the cycles of the female body...|$|R

40|$|Évasion plays back {{sequences}} of a re-performance of Houdini's escape from a straightjacket. Drawing inspiration from pre-cinematographic {{devices such as}} the praxinoscope and zoetrope, the footage is reworked repositioning the relations between vision and movement in both perception and media. The performance plays back across 8 separate screens {{in a manner that}} both break-ups and <b>restitches</b> it. Arranged in an octagonal configuration, the audience circumnavigates the screens watching the escape unfold with each screen playing back its own angle and tempo of events. The circumnavigation promises to reveal how the escape ‘works’, but the installation is a perceptual illusion; more of the escape unfolds yet less of the trick is revealed. The soundscape is directly responsive to the viewer in front of the screen. Tracking the position of the viewer, the soundscape will seem to precede the viewers as they circulate around the installation. Sensors detect audience position and trigger audio to travel ahead of the listener’s position. Like the escape artist, the sound also threatens to escape from the audience. The installation {{is not so much a}} visual representation of a performer’s escape but rather an expression of the movement that courses through, conditions and yet directly eludes a visual grasp of the scene...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{excavation}} of the Arabia, the next {{challenge for the}} partners of River Salvage Inc. was learning to clean and preserve the artifacts. During the digging process, organic artifacts had been stabilized in blocks of ice: both in Jerry Mackey's restaurant freezers and freezers installed in storage units in underground caves near the Missouri River. In the three months following the dig, larger wooden artifacts, including the stern, paddle wheel, and two prefabricated houses found on board, were submerged in an 80-by-20-foot pool specially dug by the team. Greg Hawley partnered with conservators working on the Mary Rose Trust in Portsmouth, England, and the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa, along with the Historical Resource Conservation Branch of the Canadian Parks Service, to learn freshwater preservation techniques. [...] The preservation process is still in progress today at the museum. Organic materials like wood and leather are submerged in a food preservative called polyethylene glycol (PEG) and then freeze-dried. Preservationists gently remove oxidized material from metal artifacts using metal tools and special erasers. Bottled and jarred foods and beverages are injected with nitrogen, an inert gas. Shoes, boots, and garments must be <b>restitched</b> since their cotton thread dissolved under water. [...] It {{has been estimated that}} the preservation of the collection will be completed in 2022.|$|R
50|$|From the 16th to the 18th centuries, for 235 years, the {{painting}} decorated {{the dining room}} of the San Giorgio monastery, until soldiers of Napoleon looted it as war booty, on 11 September 1797, during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802). For the easy transport of the over-sized painting, from the Venetian monastery to Paris, the canvas of The Wedding at Cana was cut in half, to be reassembled and <b>restitched</b> in France. In 1798, the 235-year-old painting was stored in {{the first floor of the}} Louvre Museum; by 1803, that store of looted art had become the Musée Napoléon, the personal art collection of the future Emperor of the French.In the early 19th century, after the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15), the restitution of looted artwork was part of the post-Napoleonic conciliation treaties; appointed by Pope Pius VII of the Vatican States, the sculptor Antonio Canova negotiated the French return of Italian artwork that Napoleon looted by way of the Treaty of Tolentino (1797); yet, on the prejudiced advice of Napoleon's curator of the museum, Vivant Denon — that the Veronese canvas was too fragile to travel from Paris to Venice — Canova excluded The Wedding at Cana from repatriation, and, in its stead, sent to Venice the Feast at the House of Simon (1653), by Charles Le Brun.|$|R

The device {{is well known}} an iconic object of desire in our society of consumption. The iPhone can play music as a commodity, {{and this is the}} way most listeners interact with it. Adam & Atau reappropriate the iPhone and its advanced technical capabilities to transform the consumer object into an expressive musical instrument for concert performance. In a duo, with one in each hand, they create a chamber music, 4 -hands iPhone. The accelerometers which typically serve as tilt sensors to rotate photos in fact allow high precision capture of the performer’s free space gestures. The multitouch screen, otherwise used for scrolling and pinch-zooming text, becomes a reconfigurable graphic user interface akin to the JazzMutant Lemur, with programmable faders, buttons, and 2 D controllers that control synthesis parameters in real time. All this drives open source Pure Data (PD) patches running out of the free RJDJ iPhone app. A single advanced granular synthesis patch becomes the process by which a battery of sounds from the natural world are stretched, frozen, scattered, and <b>restitched.</b> The fact that all system components - sensor input, signal processing and sound synthesis, and audio output, are embodied in a single device make it very different than the typical controller + laptop model for digital music performance. The encapsulation in a self-contained, manipulable object take the iPhone beyond consumer icon to become a powerful, expressive musical instrument...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{systems are}} {{woven into the}} human society, their {{applications}} ranging from critical infrastructures, {{such as health care}} systems and power plants, to ordinary usages, such as mobile phones and smart cards. Dependability of the applications heavily relies on the security of computer systems with Integrated Circuits (ICs) their main component. The IC design process is a complex task and engages different parties from intellectual property (IP) vendors to IC manufacturers to meet the time-to-market requirement and to offer with a competitive price. This horizontal process creates opportunities aplenty for adversaries to interfere with the design process and to undermine design characteristics. In this work, we introduce design-for-hardware-trust (DFHT) architectures. The architectures aim to reveal the malicious modifications of ICs, called hardware Trojan, at foundries where adversaries may add extra circuits to disable the main circuit at some specific time or to leak secret information. Hardware Trojans are small compared with the main design and so have a negligible impact on the design power consumption and its delay characteristics. Further, they are designed to become activated under rare conditions. We propose new methodologies to increase Trojan activity and to magnify Trojan impact in the circuit. Our first methodology removes the rare triggering conditions of hardware Trojans by increasing the transition probability of low transition nets which are mostly utilized for Trojan triggers. Low transition nets are <b>restitched</b> through dummy scan flip-flops which are accessible through input pins. While not changing the design functionality, dummy flip-flops deliver controllability over low transition nets and reduce Trojan activation time. The second methodology reduces the circuit activity as background noise to magnify Trojan impacts. It has been shown that there is a high correlation between switching in scan cells of a circuit and switching in the circuit. The design is divided into a number of regions and scan cells placed in a region are connected to each other in one or more scan chains. Activating one or few regions at a time significantly reduces the circuit activity as background noise while keeping the Trojan activity comparatively high. Beside the malicious modification of ICs, an adversary can over produce a chip for selling in the black market. Counterfeit products bring huge profit loss for brand owners and endanger customers 2 ̆ 7 safety. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been proposed to uniquely identify and authenticate fabricated chips. Designed based on unique variations in process parameters from chip to chip, PUF translates parameters, such as delay, into a unique binary signature. In this work, we proposed a new PUF based on dynamic logic, called Dynamic PUF, to identify chips with very low power and area overhead compared with previously developed PUFs. In addition to the design security, the design quality significantly determines its applicability in the field. Testing a chip after fabrication ensures its correct functionality. It has been shown that designs usually experience much higher switching activity in the test mode compared with the normal mode. This may lead to hot spot and electromigration phenomena that reduce the design reliability. In nanometer regime, delay fault testing is widely used for performance verification post-silicon and high test power can negatively impact the test results. In this work, we propose a new layout-aware pattern evaluation technique which can be seamlessly integrated into current automatic test pattern generators (ATPGs). The technique considers the location of transitions in the design layout, eliminating patterns generating high activity in a portion of the design to prevent performance degradation, and replaces them with low-transition patterns to keep the original fault coverage. ...|$|R
