40|$|Abstract. The seismic dynamic {{responses}} on two buildings with the vibration isolation system {{have been evaluated}} and {{the results show that}} the dry friction plate-reset spring isolation system is apparently effective if the reasonable parameters could be obtained by optimization. The maximum inter-storey drift could be drastically decreased by about 80 % at base storey or about 60 % at top storey. The elastic coefficient of the <b>reset</b> <b>spring</b> should be larger than the lower limit in order for the effective reposition ability of the system. On the other hand, the influence of the vertical seismic action to the horizontal dynamic response is so small that it could be neglected...|$|E
40|$|Capacity {{regulation}} {{system by}} controlling suction valve {{is useful for}} large scale reciprocating compressor in petrochemical engineering field. The dynamic performance of adjustment device influences the stability and accurancy of this system. In this paper, a mathematical model of adjustment device coupled with the motion of suction valve is built, and the dynamic performances of valve plate are simulated. The {{results show that the}} displacement of actuator increases with the hydraulic oil pressure until the valve plate is keeped to be opened. The closing process of valve plate is delayed when the hold time of actuator is larger enough. Although the gas flow rate and power consumption of comressor decrease with the relax angle of actuator, the power is also consumed when the gas is not discharged through the discharge valve. The closing time decreases with the <b>reset</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness but increases with the diameter of hydraulic...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{ejection}} mechanism consisting four <b>reset</b> <b>springs,</b> an electromagnet and a seed disk {{was designed}} for tray seeder. The motion conditions of seeds in the seed disk were theoretical analyzed and intensity and height of seed ejection were calculated. The motions of the seeds and seed disk were multi-body dynamic simulated using Cosmos modules plug-in SolidWorks software package. The simulation results showed the consistence with the theoretical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Device uses {{friction}} {{to dissipate}} kinetic energy. When moving mass pushes in one direction, it offers substantial friction. Pushed in opposite direction, it offers negligible friction. Built-in <b>spring</b> <b>resets</b> for another shock-absorption cycle. Used in industrial machinery, automobile bumpers and suspensions, and parachute lanyards...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The driving covers casting {{with complex}} shape belongs to {{irregular}} casting. According {{to the requirements}} of size and performance of the thin-walled castings, the expanding-type runner of the trapezoid shape section was adopted, conducive to the production of thin-walled castings. The parting surfaces of the die-casting die are the interface of the movable die and fixed die and that of left and right slider. The left and right slider would be <b>reset</b> by <b>spring.</b> Proved by actual production, the mold operated smoothly, without clamping stagnation, and the production of die castings meet delivery requirements...|$|R
50|$|Blow Forward Semi-Auto: The firing {{mechanism}} of the marker operates using the gases stored in the valve to cycle the bolt and fire the paintball, after which a <b>spring</b> <b>resets</b> the mechanism for the next shot. Notables examples include the Air-gun Designs Auto-mag, Tippmann X-7 Phenom and the Tiberius Arms T8.|$|R
50|$|The Americans {{eventually}} constructed such obstacles {{across the}} river at northern Manhattan, between forts Washington and Lee in 1776; at the newly constructed Fort Montgomery on the West Bank on Popolopen Creek in 1776-1777 south of West Point; a partially completed one at Pollepel Island in 1776-1777 north of West Point; and the Great Chain (1778-1782) between West Point and Constitution Island. The largest and most important project was the last-mentioned chain, at West Point, which was <b>reset</b> each <b>spring</b> {{until the end of}} the war. Attention was concentrated on the West Point area because the river narrowed there, and curved so sharply that, together with winds, tides and current, ships already had to slow to navigate the passage. Creating more obstructions on the river enabled the shore batteries to work their cannons against the enemy.|$|R
50|$|The jigger {{consists}} of a slotted wooded board that floats under the ice surface and two levers connected {{in such a way}} that when a rope connected to one lever (arm) is pulled, the second lever (leg) jabs into the ice and pushes against the ice to move the board in the direction opposite to the rope pull. After each pull a <b>spring</b> <b>resets</b> the arm, and the action is repeated. In this way a person by an ice hole propels the jigger away. If the ice is transparent enough, one just makes another hole over the jigger when it moves far away. (Otherwise the progress of the jigger may be monitored by the tapping noise of the jigger's leg.) After that the jigger is pulled out of the second hole, together with the rope, and the net may be stretched under the ice using the rope from one hole to another.|$|R
5000|$|The {{military}} and civilian death toll has mounted, the Iraqi insurgency has shifted to what many observers have labeled a civil war, {{and the politics of}} Iraq have remained unstable, many politicians and citizens from the United States and across the world have begun pushing for the U.S. to withdraw from Iraq. Significant American calls for withdrawal include the Iraq Study Group Report and the Center for American Progress's proposal for strategic <b>reset.</b> As of <b>spring</b> 2007, surveys showed a majority of Americans in support of a timetable for withdrawal. While up to 70 percent of Americans in one survey favored withdrawal, most prefer to leave gradually over 12 months, and 60 percent say the U.S. has a moral obligation to the Iraqi people. [...] In addition to voicing concerns over the human and financial costs of the war, supporters of withdrawal argue that the U.S. presence fosters ongoing violence by providing a target for al-Qaeda. It also allows Iraqi political leaders to avoid reaching a power-sharing agreement. The withdrawal will induce Iraq's neighbors to become more involved in quelling violence in the country and will relieve the strain on the U.S. military. [...] The withdrawal debate has brought comparison of Iraq and Vietnam wars.|$|R
