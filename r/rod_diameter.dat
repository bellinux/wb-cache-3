30|$|In Figure  5 a, some {{periodic}} {{behaviors of}} LEE with the <b>rod</b> <b>diameter</b> are observed {{for both the}} TE and TM modes. The periodic variation of LEE is basically related with resonant modes inside the nanorod structure. When a resonant mode is formed, light is confined within the nanorod structure and cannot be easily extracted, which results in the valley of LEE in Figure  5 a. Therefore, {{it is important to}} control the <b>rod</b> <b>diameter</b> appropriately to obtain high LEE. In addition to the periodic behavior, LEE globally tends to decrease with increasing <b>rod</b> <b>diameter.</b> This is because the number of confined optical modes inside the rod increases and the area of the p-GaN layer also increases as the <b>rod</b> <b>diameter</b> increases.|$|E

Microcracking of both {{the inner and outer}} fuel rod surfaces and variations in wall thickness are detected by using a pulsed eddy current technique developed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the mechanism of the formation and the convection of vortices shedding from the cylinder with an upstream rod. The aerodynamic characteristics of the rod and cylinder are modelled in two dimensions by using Fluent® with laminar flow. It is found that the mean drag and the lift fluctuation of the cylinder can be reduced by the upstream rod, especially in the cavity flow mode with the <b>rod</b> <b>diameters</b> d / D = 0. 3 and 0. 5 (here d and D are the <b>diameters</b> of the <b>rod</b> and the cylinder, respectively). With <b>rod</b> <b>diameters</b> d / D = 0. 3 and 0. 5, the simulation indicates that there are two flow modes of the flow field around the rod and cylinder, which appear with the variation of the center-to-center spacing ratio L / D: the cavity flow mode and the wake impinge mode. There is a pair of standing vortices between the rod and the cylinder in the cavity mode, which results in the pressure decrease on the windward side of the cylinder. It is found that the characteristics of the flow significantly depend on the spacing ratio L / D. Instantaneous flow fields, force fluctuation, force spectrum and so on are presented to identify the flow modes and to understand the underlying mechanism of the cylinder drag reduction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Halipteris willemoesi {{is a large}} octocoral {{commonly}} found in the Bering Sea. It {{is a member of}} a ubiquitous group of benthic cnidarians called sea pens (Octocorallia: Pennatulacea). Sea pens have a skeletal structure, the axial rod, that in cross section exhibits growth rings. Pairs of adjacent rings, or ring couplets, were assumed to be annuli and were used to estimate the age and growth of H. willemoesi. Twelve axial rods, extracted from H. willemoesi collected in the Bering Sea, were selected to represent small (25 – 29 cm total length), medium (97 – 130 cm TL) and large (152 – 167 cm TL) colonies. Each rod resembled a tapered dowel; the thickest part (0. 90 – 6. 75 mm in diameter) was at about 5 – 10 % of total length from the base tip, the distal part was more gradually tapered than was the base. The number of ring couplets increased with rod size indicating their utility in estimating age and growth. Estimated age among rods was based on couplet counts at the thickest part of each rod; the average estimated age (±SE) was 7. 1 ± 0. 7, 19. 3 ± 0. 5, and 44. 3 ± 2. 0 yr for small, medium and large-size rods, respectively.
