25|$|In the April 6, 1926, <b>Ripsaw,</b> Morrison {{attacked}} Minneapolis Mayor George Emerson Leach and Duluth Commissioner of Public Utilities W. Harlow Tischer. A temporary {{restraining order}} was quickly placed on the <b>Ripsaw</b> by State District Judge H. J. Grannis of Duluth.|$|E
25|$|Morrison {{was served}} with a warrant for his arrest based on a {{complaint}} from Leach under an obscene-literature ordinance recently rushed through the Minneapolis City Council. The next day, {{a temporary restraining order}} was placed on the <b>Ripsaw</b> by State District Judge H. J. Grannis of Duluth. Tischer claimed that the charges of graft were untrue and he demanded that the <b>Ripsaw</b> be stopped. The Finnish Publishing Company, which printed the <b>Ripsaw,</b> was also named in the injunction, and news dealers and newsboys were barred from distributing the paper.|$|E

25|$|Morrison’s {{specialty}} {{was digging}} into the “unholy and undesirable alliance” between lawmakers and lawbreakers. During the <b>Ripsaw’s</b> first year, Duluth Chief of Police Robert McKercher and City Auditor “King” Odin Halden were both ousted from their positions after being labeled crooked by Morrison.|$|R

If required, smaller timbers were <b>ripsawn</b> from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, timbers are more {{commonly}} bandsawn, and the timbers may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides.|$|R
25|$|Barrett Chase and Scott Lunt {{founded the}} website Perfect Duluth Day in 2003. Chase was a {{cartoonist}} and copy {{editor for the}} <b>Ripsaw,</b> and Lunt helped deliver the paper. Former <b>Ripsaw</b> Managing Editor Paul Lundgren became a part-owner of Perfect Duluth Day in 2009, as did freelance illustrator Brian Barber.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ripsaw</b> {{returned}} in January 1999. Brad Nelson and Cord R. Dada published a monthly scandal sheet similar to Morrison’s original <b>Ripsaw.</b> Its first lead story, “Dotygate,” accused Duluth Mayor Gary Doty {{and his administration}} of various crimes associated with the demolition of buildings on East First Street {{to make way for}} construction of the Duluth Technology Village.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ripsaw</b> began {{shortly after}} St. Louis County outlawed {{the sale of}} alcohol. When Superior, Wisconsin, {{followed}} {{a few months later}} with its own voter-instituted prohibition, the Twin Ports were nominally dry, but alcohol was available at bootleg outlets and in townships nearby. Local politicians and police did little to enforce the prohibition, and Morrison ridiculed them for it in the <b>Ripsaw.</b> He also editorialized in favor of streetcars, public toilets and higher pay for policemen.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ripsaws</b> decline {{began with}} the October 25, 1924 issue. Morrison accused State Senator Mike Boylan of {{threatening}} him with mayhem and death, Cass County Probate Judge Bert Jamison of having acquired syphilis at a brothel and Victor L. Power, a former mayor of Hibbing, of corrupt legal practices and a weakness for women and whiskey. All three retaliated.|$|R
25|$|Lommen accused Morrison of {{bringing}} forth the libelous attacks {{because he and}} Power had not bought enough political advertising in the <b>Ripsaw.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tischer {{continued}} to insist the injunction against the <b>Ripsaw</b> be maintained, even after Morrison’s death. Judge E. J. Kenney, however, allowed {{a continuation of}} the paper, but without its “head sawyer,” the paper ceased.|$|E
25|$|Microfilm {{copies of}} the <b>Ripsaw</b> {{are located in the}} Duluth Public Library and in the Library of the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul, for {{researchers}} interested in reading specific articles from the paper.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ripsaw</b> {{became a}} weekly {{publication}} on April 5, 2000. Paul Lundgren {{was hired as}} managing editor and the paper was transformed into an alternative news, arts and entertainment source. One year later, it was accepted into the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies.|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 1925, Morrison {{was ordered}} to make a public apology to Power. Morrison told the court and Power that he was sorry if the <b>Ripsaw</b> “had cost Mayor Power the election.” The charges against Morrison were dropped and his {{sentence}} rescinded.|$|E
25|$|Morrison’s Duluth <b>Ripsaw</b> debuted on March 24, 1917. Issues were {{published}} every other Saturday, although {{on more than}} one occasion Morrison was overwhelmed by the task of producing the paper by himself, and took three weeks to finish a new issue, working almost entirely by himself.|$|E
25|$|The last weekly {{issue was}} {{published}} on Dec. 31, 2003. Three months later, the <b>Ripsaw</b> returned to monthly status, {{this time as}} a full-color magazine edited by Tony Dierckins. It lasted 10 issues before reverting to newsprint for its final three issues, which were published every other month, ending in September 2005.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} Tabor College, Morrison {{went to work}} {{teaching}} school in Western, Nebraska. While in Western, he published the first <b>Ripsaw</b> newspaper. He is also believed to have published similar papers, or at least worked in the journalism field, in Missouri and Montana, as well as Crete, Friend and DeWitt, Nebraska.|$|E
25|$|Co-publisher Cord R. Dada {{sold the}} {{majority}} of his ownership in the paper to Brad Nelson’s brother Tim Nelson in April 2001, relieving himself of all duties at the <b>Ripsaw</b> and leaving Brad Nelson as the majority owner and sole publisher of the paper. Within a few months, Lundgren was dismissed and Nelson became editor/publisher.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Duluth <b>Ripsaw</b> {{was founded}} by John L. Morrison, a puritanical Christian who abhorred alcohol, gambling and prostitution. The paper debuted on March 24, 1917. Issues were published every other Saturday, with copies sold at newsstands for five cents. The newspaper's offices were originally in downtown Duluth’s Fargusson Building, and later moved to the Phoenix Building.|$|E
25|$|The most {{powerful}} {{blow to the}} “Great Family Journal” came {{in the summer of}} 1925. Senator Boylan, who, according to the Oct. 25, 1924 <b>Ripsaw,</b> had threatened to kill Morrison, was trying to have the paper shut down. He worked with Rep. George Lommen to draft several bills allowing suppression of scandalous newspapers. Sen. Freyling Stevens, a powerful lawyer, introduced the senate version of what would become known as the “Minnesota gag law,” for which he is credited with authorship.|$|E
25|$|While Morrison {{was held}} in Cass County, Power instigated {{criminal}} and civil libel actions, claiming the October 25 <b>Ripsaw</b> article was written {{for the sole purpose}} of injuring him politically. The Duluth police held a warrant for Morrison's arrest pending his release from the Cass County jail. A jury in Hibbing, Minnesota, found him guilty, and he was sentenced to 90 days in the county workhouse. He immediately appealed. Later, Morrison was ordered to make a public apology to Power. The charges against him were dropped and his sentence rescinded. Later that month, Morrison pleaded guilty to the charges of criminal libel brought by Jamison.|$|E
2500|$|Tischer {{continued}} to insist the injunction against the <b>Ripsaw</b> be maintained, even after Morrison’s death. Judge E. J. Kenney, however, allowed {{a continuation of}} the <b>Ripsaw</b> “without the articles objected to by Commissioner Tischer.” ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ripsaw</b> (sometimes called Rip-Saw, <b>RipSaw</b> or The Duluth Rip-Saw) was a Duluth, Minnesota {{newspaper}} published from 1917 to 1926 {{and again}} from 1999 to 2005. The paper was a scandal sheet {{during the first}} years of publication, with a reputation for muckraking, sensationalism and criminal libel. The revival was similar in tone, though the publishers changed [...]|$|E

2500|$|Power claimed Morrison’s {{article was}} written {{for the sole purpose}} of {{injuring}} him politically. He told the Duluth News Tribune he was going against the advice of his campaign committee by bringing up the charges against Morrison before the election. He alleged the <b>Ripsaw</b> article was “instigated by the opposition camp,” and that Morrison was the advertising manager of his opponent. Furthermore, he suggested that Morrison was “preparing extra copies of his paper to be delivered to the opposition for special circulation.” Power vowed to have anyone who circulated the <b>Ripsaw</b> arrested, saying those who circulate the paper “are as liable to the same prosecution as the publisher.” ...|$|E
2500|$|John Loyal Morrison (September 10, 1863 [...] May 18, 1926) {{founded the}} {{controversial}} Duluth, Minnesota newspaper <b>Ripsaw.</b> His editorial attacks on area politicians were so unrelenting {{that a state}} law was passed specifically to shut down his paper. The legal battle that followed led to a landmark Supreme Court decision affirming the unconstitutionality of prior restraint laws.|$|E
2500|$|Governor Theodore Christianson {{signed the}} Public Nuisance Law, but Morrison {{was unaware of}} this change. On April 6, 1926, the <b>Ripsaw</b> {{attacked}} Minneapolis Mayor George Emerson Leach: “Minnesotans do not want loose-love governor.” In the next issue, Duluth Commissioner of Public Utilities W. Harlow Tischer was the target: “Tischer and his gang fail to establish graft plan.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The <b>Ripsaw</b> is {{a genuine}} one-man sawmill,” {{he wrote in the}} July 13, 1918 editorial. “The entire work, snaking out dead-heads, filing the saw, piling the product, getting it to the market, even loading and billing it, falls on one man. It often takes 18 hours a day and seven days a week to do all that half way creditably, to say nothing of brilliantly.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{produced}} the <b>Ripsaw</b> {{almost entirely by}} himself. Three known helpers were stenographer Alice B. Bartlett, a cartoonist who signed his work “Webster,” and Isadore Cohen, a pre-teenaged newsboy who hawked papers {{in front of the}} old St. Louis County State Bank. Other writers were also periodically featured, {{but the vast majority of}} the work was always done by Morrison, who called himself the “head sawyer” of the “Great Family Journal.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Arched {{door and}} window {{openings}} required {{the use of}} wood centering during erection, as did corridor arches and any type of vault or domed construction. [...] Windows were kept small and to a minimum, and placed high on walls as a protective measure in case of Indian attack. A few of the missions had imported glass window panes, but most made do with oiled skins stretched tightly across the openings. [...] Windows were {{the only source of}} interior illumination at the missions, other than the tallow candles made in the outposts' workshops. Doors were made of wood cut into planks at the carpintería, and most often bore the Spanish [...] "River of Life" [...] pattern or other carved or painted designs. [...] Carpenters used a <b>ripsaw</b> (or [...] "pitsaw") to saw logs into thin boards, which were held together by ornate nails forged in the mission's blacksmith shop. [...] Nails, especially long ones, were scarce throughout California, so large members (such as rafters or beams) which had to be fastened together were tied with rawhide strips. Connections of this type were common in post and lintel construction, such as that found over corridors. Aside from nails, blacksmiths fashioned iron gates, crosses, tools, kitchen utensils, cannons for mission defense, and other objects needed by the mission community. Settlements had to rely on cargo ships and trade for their iron supplies as they did not have the capability to mine and process iron ore.|$|E

Later that year, he returned to <b>Ripsaw</b> to record various rock and roll songs, six of which <b>Ripsaw</b> released in 1985. All of the <b>Ripsaw</b> material was later released on CDs by Finnish Bluelight Records.|$|E
