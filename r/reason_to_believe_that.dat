5|$|Another peace {{agreement}} between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary. Their retention of Eger gave the Austrians good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Hungary was still contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in Hungary ended, until its revival in 1566.|$|E

With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott saw no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E

5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli {{to that of the}} Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E
5|$|The series {{begins as}} Ned Stark {{is asked to}} become the chief advisor (known as the Hand of the King) to lecherous King Robert Baratheon.

Ned must travel south to help the king and find out who killed the previous Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, while trying to protect his family from the Lannisters. As he tries to uncover the reasons behind Jon Arryn's death he uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that Arryn himself died trying to expose.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{drawings}} {{described in this}} letter as showing drafts of the two new patterns, together with any royal response to the complaint which may have accompanied them, having been lost, (possibly in the 1834 Burning of Parliament), other evidence exists, at least on paper, of a Scottish variant whereby the Scottish cross appears uppermost. Whilst, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, this design is considered by most vexillologists to have been unofficial, there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such flags were employed during the 17th century for use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of The Present State of the Universe by John Beaumont, Junior, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) there was no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but {{if this was the}} norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The {{year and}} {{circumstances}} of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> dates in this source are unreliable. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death {{may be related to}} his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, various {{independent}} delegates {{gathered in}} Indianapolis to nominate a presidential ticket to campaign on those issues. For president, they chose Peter Cooper, an 85-year-old industrialist and philanthropist from New York, with Samuel Fenton Cary, a former congressman from Ohio, {{as his running}} mate. The Greenback ticket fared poorly in the election that November, attracting just 81,740 votes—less than 1% of the total. As bad economic times continued, however, the party gained momentum. Labor unrest the following year, culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, added to many laborers' alienation from the two major parties. Local movements, like California's Workingmen's Party, began to agitate for laws to improve the condition of laborers (and {{for an end to}} Chinese immigration). By 1878, the third-party movement had become strong enough to elect 22 independents to the federal House of Representatives, most tied in some way to the Greenback movement. As the 1880 presidential election approached, members of the Greenback Party (or Greenback-Labor Party, as it was sometimes known) had <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they could improve on the results of 1876.|$|E
