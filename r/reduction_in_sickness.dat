40|$|Sickness {{absence from}} work due to {{experienced}} distress and mental health issues has continuously increased {{over the past years}} in Germany. To investigate how this alarming development can be counteracted, we conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a job coaching intervention to maintain the working capacity of members of staff and ultimately prevent sickness absence. Our sample included N = 99 employees who reported mental distress due to work-related problems. The intervention group (n = 58) received between 8 and 12 individual job coaching sessions in which they worked with a professional job coach to reduce their mental distress. The control group (n = 41) received a brochure about mental distress. Data were collected {{before the start of the}} study, at the end of the job coaching intervention and at a 3 -month follow up. These data included the number of sickness absence days as the primary outcome and questionnaire measures to assess burnout indicators, life satisfaction and work-related experiences and behaviors. Compared with the control group, the results indicated no <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence in the intervention group but fewer depressive symptoms, a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work, more experience of work-related success, less depletion of emotional resources and a greater satisfaction with life when participants had received the job coaching. Thus, although we could not detect a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence between the groups, job coaching was shown to be a viable intervention technique to benefit employees by contributing to re-establish their mental health. We discuss the implications of the study and outline future research...|$|E
40|$|The mild {{influenza}} {{epidemic of}} mixed A and B strains early in 1966 {{provided an opportunity}} to assess the efficacy of an oil-adjuvant influenza vaccine which had been administered {{more than two years}} earlier to 1, 341 volunteers at two U. K. Atomic Energy Authority establishments. At the 5 % confidence level, a statistically significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence due to influenza was found in this vaccinated group when compared with a control group of 918 employees. This trend was observed at both establishments. Some confirmation was thus obtained of serological predictions that protection would last two to three years or longer after inoculation. There was some indication that the vaccine might be more effective in older workers. This trial suggests the need for more long-term evaluation of oil-adjuvant influenza vaccines...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was designed}} to test the efficacy of pressure at the P 6 (Neiguan) acupuncture point, in preventing morning sickness. Three groups of patients in early pregnancy recorded the severity and frequency of sickness over a period of 4 consecutive days following daily pressure at P 6 point, pressure at a point near the right elbow and with no treatment. Troublesome sickness was significantly less in both the genuine (23 / 119) and dummy (41 / 112) pressure groups as compared with the control series (67 / 119). When the data are adversely 'weighted' to compensate for the lower incidence of fully completed returns in the active treatment groups, only the P 6 group show a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness.</b> No side effects occurred in either group and while anticipation of benefit may offer a partial explanation for the findings, pressure at the Neiguan point appears to have a specific therapeutic effect...|$|E
40|$|This is the {{presentation}} of results from a small scale evaluation of a programme in an English hospital designed to improve staff welfare and reduce sickness absence.

40|$|The Faster Return to Work (FRW) {{scheme that}} Norwegian {{authorities}} implemented in 2007 {{is an example}} of a policy that builds on the human capital approach. The main idea behind the scheme is that long waiting times for hospital treatment lead to unnecessarily long periods of absence from work. To achieve a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> average <b>sickness</b> absence duration, the allocation of FRW funds and new treatment capacity is exclusively aimed at people on sick leave. Many countries have allocated funds to reduce waiting times for hospital treatment and research shows that more resources allocated to the hospital sector can reduce waiting times. Our results support this as the FRW scheme significantly reduces waiting times. However, on average the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> waiting times is not transformed into an equally large <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the <b>sickness</b> absence period. We find significant difference in the effects of FRW on length of sick leave between surgical and non-surgical patients though. The duration of sick leave for FRW patients undergoing surgical treatment is approximately 14 days shorter than for surgical patients on the regular waiting list. We find no significant effect of the scheme on length of sick leave for non-surgical patients. In sum, our welfare analysis indicates that prioritization of the kind that the FRW scheme represents is not as straightforward as one would expect. The FRW scheme costs more than it contributes in reduced productivity loss. We base our analyses on several different econometric methods using register data on approximately 13 500 individuals over the period 2007 – 2008...|$|R

40|$|Users of Virtual Reality (VR) systems often {{experience}} vection, {{the perception}} of self-motion {{in the absence of}} any physical movement. While vection helps to improve presence in VR, it often leads to a form of motion sickness called cybersickness. Cybersickness is a major deterrent to large scale adoption of VR. Prior work has discovered that changing vection (changing the perceived speed or moving direction) causes more severe cybersickness than steady vection (walking at a constant speed or in a constant direction). Based on this idea, we try to reduce the cybersickness caused by character movements in a First Person Shooter (FPS) game in VR. We propose Rotation Blurring (RB), uniformly blurring the screen during rotational movements to reduce cybersickness. We performed a user study to evaluate the impact of RB in reducing cybersickness. We found that the blurring technique led to an overall <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> levels of the participants and delayed its onset.

40|$|Cumbrian Constabulary {{deployed}} {{an organizational}} peer support response for personnel involved known as trauma risk management (TRiM). Aims To examine data routinely gathered during the TRiM process {{to evaluate the}} relationship of the intervention to sickness absence. Methods Using incident databases, details were gathered regarding exposure to the murders and type of TRiM intervention, including an assessment of the psychological risk to the individual of developing a trauma-related mental health problem. Sociodemographic information was collated by the occupa-tional health department. Cumulative sickness absence data in the 2  months following the murders were used as a proxy for mental health status. Results A total of 717 police officers and civilian support staff were identified. High levels of traumatic expo-sure were associated with subsequent receipt of a TRiM intervention. The majority of psychological risk indices reduced between the initial and subsequent evaluation. Greater traumatic exposure was associated with longer sickness absence lengths. Engagement in the TRiM process was associated with a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence especially in more junior ranks. Conclusions In this study, we found that TRiM deployed within a police force responding to a major event offere...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a 1 – 2 week multiprofessional team assessment, without a real rehabilitation effort, 60 patients suffering from long-standing pain and on long-lasting time on sick leave were studied. A questionnaire concerning their daily activities, quality of life, pain intensity, sick-leave level, and their work state was filled out by all patients before starting the assessment and at a 1 -year follow-up. The results from the assessment period and the multiprofessional team decision of the patient’s working ability were compared with the actual working rate after 1 year. The follow-up showed a significant reduction of sick leave and a higher level of activity (P < 0. 001). One year after the initial evaluation, 40 % showed a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> benefit level and 12 % resumed full-time work. However, the team evaluation of the patient’s work ability did not correlate to predict the actual outcome.

A comparison with the data of the study performed in the same hospital about 15 years ago showed a rise in the duration of absences with a simultaneous <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> their incidence. <b>Sickness</b> absenteeism was higher among female, mainly unskilled, workers, presently or previously married, aged from 45 to 60, and employed in the hospital for over ten years.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify personal and environmental factors influencing individual susceptibility to motion sickness during road transport. A questionnaire survey of 3256 coach travellers was conducted. Information on passenger characteristics, travel regularity, activity during travel, use of anti-motion sickness drugs and self-reported motion sickness susceptibility were collected over 56 private hire coach journeys. Details of the travel environment (visibility, temperature and seating) were also recorded. The relationship of these variables with passenger illness and more specific symptoms of motion sickness are examined. Overall, 28. 4 % of passengers reported feeling ill, 12. 8 % reported nausea and 1. 7 % reported vomiting during coach travel. Travel sickness decreased with increasing passenger age and greater travel experience. Females {{were more likely to report}} feeling ill during coach travel than males by a ratio of four to three. Poor forward visibility was found to increase sickness. Passenger illness occurrence was approximately three times higher for passengers with no view of the road ahead (mean, 34. 6 %) compared to passengers who could see the road ahead extremely well (mean, 12. 7 %). No relationships were found between the occurrence of travel sickness and temperature or time of travel. Differences in the pattern of sickness responses exhibited by coach travellers suggest: (1) habituation through greater travel regularity may occur independently of <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> travel <b>sickness</b> that occur with age; (2) females are more affected by poor forward visibility than males; and (3) the incidence of travel sickness could be significantly reduced by improving the external visibility afforded to passengers. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the cumulative effect of a routine (hot-to-) cold shower on sickness, quality of life and work productivity. Between January and March 2015, 3018 participants between 18 and 65 years without severe comorbidity and no routine experience of cold showering were randomized (1 : 1 : 1 : 1) to a (hot-to-) cold shower for 30, 60, 90 seconds or a control group during 30 consecutive days followed by 60 days of showering cold at their own discretion for the intervention groups. The primary outcome was illness days and related sickness absence from work. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, work productivity, anxiety, thermal sensation and adverse reactions. 79 % of participants in the interventions groups completed the 30 consecutive days protocol. A negative binomial regression model showed a 29 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence for (hot-to-) cold shower regimen compared to the control group (incident rate ratio: 0. 71, P = 0. 003).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of community- and workplace-based interventions to reduce sickness absence and job loss in workers with musculoskeletal disorders(MSDs). METHODS: We identified relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies, published since 1990, by screening citations from 35 earlier systematic reviews and by searching Medline and Embase to April 2010. We estimated effects by type of intervention and other features, including study quality. RESULTS: Among 42 finally included studies, 27 assessed return to work (RTW), 21 duration of sickness absence, and five job loss. Interventions included prescribed exercises, behavioural change techniques, workplace modifications and provision of extra services. Studies tended to be small (median sample 107 (IQR 77 – 148) and of limited quality. Most interventions appeared beneficial: the median RR for RTW was 1. 21 (IQR 1. 00 – 1. 60) and that for avoiding MSD-related job loss, 1. 25 (IQR 1. 06 – 1. 71); the median <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence was 1. 11 (IQR 0. 32 – 3. 20) days/month. Effects were smaller, however, in larger better quality studies, suggesting potential publication bias. No intervention type was clearly superior to others, although effort-intensive interventions were less effective than simple ones. No study established statistically significant net economic benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Benefits are generally small and of uncertain cost-effectiveness. Expensive interventions should be implemented only with careful cost-benefit evaluation planned from the start. Future research {{should focus on the}} cost-effectiveness of simple low cost interventions, and impacts on job retention...|$|E

40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) {{applications}} on Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) are {{now more}} common and accessible for personal viewing than before {{with the introduction of}} consumer-level devices like the Oculus Rift. However, exposure to VR applications on HMDs results in significant discomfort for the majority of people, the severity of which can both increase or decrease after repeated exposures. This is disadvantageous for the development and adoption of VR, as a long adaptation period cannot be relied on for making Virtual Environments palatable. Symptoms of discomfort caused by the viewing of content on VR devices including HMDs are historically described as “Simulator Sickness” and include eye fatigue, headaches, nausea and sweating; symptoms very similar to those experienced by sufferers of motion sickness. We refer to the specific subset of Simulator Sickness Symptoms caused by visual stimuli as symptoms of “Visual Discomfort”. A conflict between accommodation and vergence depth cues on stereoscopic displays is known to be a significant cause of visual discomfort. This report describes a psychophysical evaluation used for judging the effectiveness of dynamic Depth of Field (DoF) blurring on reducing visual discomfort caused by initial exposure to stereoscopic content on HMDs. Our DoF implementation adjusts the focal region of stereoscopic content based on an estimation of users’ view vectors in real time and is realised in a commercial game engine. Participants report a significant reduction of visual discomfort using a simulator sickness questionnaire when DoF blurring is enabled. On average, a 34 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> our <b>sickness</b> measure is observed, indicating that dynamic DoF blurring is an effective rendering technique for reducing visual discomfort...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{saturation}} decompression protocols use linear decompression {{rates that}} become progressively slower at shallower depths, consistent with free gas phase control vs. dissolved gas elimination kinetics. If decompression {{is limited by}} control of free gas phase, linear decompression is an inefficient strategy. The NASA prebreathe reduction program demonstrated that exercise during O 2 prebreathe resulted in a 50 % reduction (2 h vs. 4 h) in the saturation decompression time from 14. 7 to 4. 3 psi and a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> decompression <b>sickness</b> (DCS: 0 vs. 23. 7 %). Combining exercise with intermittent recompression, which controls gas phase growth and eliminates supersaturation before exercising, may enable more efficient saturation decompression schedules. A tissue bubble dynamics model (TBDM) was {{used in conjunction with}} a NASA exercise prebreathe model (NEPM) that relates tissue inert gas exchange rate constants to exercise (ml O 2 /kg-min), to develop a schedule for decompression from helium saturation at 400 fsw. The models provide significant prediction (p < 0. 001) and goodness of fit with 430 cases of DCS in 6437 laboratory dives for TBDM (p = 0. 77) and with 22 cases of DCS in 159 altitude exposures for NEPM (p = 0. 70). The models have also been used operationally in over 25, 000 dives (TBDM) and 40 spacewalks (NEPM). The standard U. S. Navy (USN) linear saturation decompression schedule from saturation at 400 fsw required 114. 5 h with a maximum Bubble Growth Index (BGI(sub max)) of 17. 5. Decompression using intermittent recompression combined with two 10 min exercise periods (75 % VO 2 (sub peak)) per day required 54. 25 h (BGI(sub max) : 14. 7). Combined intermittent recompression and exercise resulted in a theoretical 53 % (2. 5 day) <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> decompression time and theoretically lower DCS risk compared to the standard USN decompression schedule.

40|$|Traffic-related air {{pollution}} harms health, so whilst {{it would be}} advantageous to improve air quality, the socioeconomic impact of {{air pollution}} mitigation in Scotland is not fully understood. Evidence from research literature, current regulatory and policy directives and a socioeconomic analysis are required to assess the true health impact. This thesis presents the first health and socioeconomic analysis of traffic-related air pollution and health for Scotland. A critique of the literature was undertaken to determine the evidence base {{and the strength of}} evidence in terms of association and causation, between air pollution and ill health. The evidence was subsequently applied in epidemiological studies of Scottish residents, to assess the actual impact on health in Scotland. The perception of barriers and incentives for change were investigated to understand behavioural influences. Recent policy development in Scotland was reviewed, and a socioeconomic analysis of a proposed air pollution strategy in Scotland, was undertaken. The evidence from 30 cohort studies and nine literature reviews demonstrated a link between poor air quality, mortality and respiratory ill health, but the results for other health conditions were inconsistent. The links were associative rather than causal and therefore might be attributable to other factors other than air pollution. Furthermore, epidemiological studies on Scottish populations did not show health effects from traffic-related air pollution. The socioeconomic analysis suggested that an initial investment of between £ 27 m and £ 44 m to introduce Low Emission Zones (LEZ), and an effective active travel programme, might result in a saving of £ 38 m in terms of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence. It is unlikely that the Clean Air For Scotland Strategy will deliver improved air quality and health without substantial investment, better alignment of planning, and a greater public engagement to support public and active transport options...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, rates of {{sickness}} absence have increased and psychiatric disorders {{have become an}} important cause of sickness absence. The socio-demographic associations for psychiatric sickness absence are reported from the Whitehall II study, a longitudinal survey of 10, 308 London-based male and female civil servants between 35 - 55 years. Short spells ([less-than-or-equals, slant] 7 days), long spells (> 7 days) and very long spells (> 21 days) of sickness absence were examined in 5620 civil servants for whom reason for absence was available in civil service records. Civil service coding of reasons for absence was validated against report of general practitioners' diagnoses. Psychiatric disorder, largely neurosis and neurosis ill-defined, was the third {{most common cause of}} long spells of sickness absence in women and the fourth most common in men. For both men and women it was the second most common cause of very long spells of absence. Psychiatric sickness absence for short, long and very long spells was more frequent in lower employment grades than higher employment grades in keeping with the pattern for other illnesses. This partly explains the higher rate of sickness absence in women than men. Widowed and single men, and divorced women had high rates of psychiatric sickness absence. Comparing reason codes based on sickness certificates with general practitioners reports, there appeared to be evidence of under-reporting of psychosis on certificates. The general rise in levels of sickness absence and in particular psychiatric sickness absence may have several explanations: increased recognition of psychiatric disorder; greater reporting of psychiatric disorder; a real increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorder; or a change in employment opportunities for individuals with minor psychiatric disorder. The contribution of psychiatric disorder to the overall burden of sickness absence is likely to be underestimated. It is argued that greater preventative effort examining working conditions and social supports and earlier recognition and treatment of existing psychiatric disorder will lead to a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence. sickness absence psychiatric disorder social neurosis...|$|E

40|$|Aim and questions: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{responsibilities}} employers have for rehabilitation and to explore how it conforms to an employers' actual condi-tions. Furthermore, the intention is to increase knowledge of how employers interact with other partners in the rehabilitation process and what affects sick people to return to work. The following three questions form the basis of this paper: What are employers’ responsibilities for rehabilitation under the law and how is it consistent with an employer's actual conditions? What is the role of employers in the rehabilitation co- operation with other actors? What factors influence sick people to return to work? Method: The paper has used a true scientific and a legal sociological method to examine how the regulated employer responsibility for rehabilitation relates to what is practical in re-ality. To achieve the purpose, four empirical interviews were conducted with Örebro Municipality, Insurance, occupational health Previa and a doctor, which all of them have an important role in the rehabilitation process. The interviewees received questionnaires in advance so they knew what was requested. Results: Sickness absence rates increased in Sweden during 2000 -´s which has brought more attention to rehabilitation. Previous research shows that a dysfunctional workplace often has more sick leave than a well-functioning workplace and that employer’s incentives to improve working conditions differ. Employers have statutory occupational health and rehabilitation responsibilities, but the question is how it is fulfilled? The results show that Örebro Municipality has several documents that describe how they should proceed with their occupational health and rehabilitation work, and that they have introduced a so called health package. It is hoped that this preventative approach will lead to a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>sickness</b> absence. The statistics also show that the proportion of long-term sickness has subsided, which they among other things think may be due to the rehabilitation chain introduced in 2008 with fixed time limits. Conclusion: Prevention and health promotion is essential to reduce the risk of sick leave and that earlier rehabilitation measures, the better. The rehabilitation chain has led to an earlier and more structured rehabilitation program and that more cases of illnesses are concluded more quickly. However, the rehabilitation interaction needs further improvement, in hopes that ongoing efforts will bring...|$|E
