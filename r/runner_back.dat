Thanos changed the Runner to an old man and then reverted him to infancy and took the Space Gem from him. Thanos used the infant Runner as a pawn in his conflict with the Collector; Thanos gave the Runner to the Collector {{in exchange for the}} Reality Gem. When Thanos left, he restored the <b>Runner</b> <b>back</b> to adulthood; the Collector and the Runner then fought each other.|$|E
5000|$|The British troops {{arrived at}} Crooked Billet at daybreak on May 1. Simcoe had planned a [...] "pincer"-type attack, with his troops attacking {{from the north}} and east, and Abercromby's troops from the south and west. Lacey's pickets, in place to warn against any type of threat, noticed the British troops, but failed to fire off a warning shot for fear of being killed or captured. Neilsen sent a <b>runner</b> <b>back</b> to the camp to raise the alarm, but he never arrived. Surprised and outnumbered, the militia were soon routed and forced to retreat into Warminster, losing their {{supplies}} and equipment at their bivouac site.|$|E

50|$|The {{game was}} tied 4-4 {{at the end}} and went to extra innings, with South Australia making the break through, going ahead 5-4 going into the bottom of 12. The South Australian team {{realised}} that a 1 run win would not be enough to win the series and needed to score more runs, therefore they had to allow Victoria to score so they could chance a bigger win in the 13th inning. With a Victorian runner on third base the pitcher attempted a pickoff, deliberately throwing the ball away. The umpire called a dead ball and sent the <b>runner</b> <b>back</b> to third. The next pitch, the South Australian pitcher deliberately balked, which would have allowed the run to score, but the home plate umpire called the game over and gave the game to Victoria 9-0 on the technicality South Australia brought the game into disrepute.|$|E
5000|$|Huntsville sailed for Key West, Florida, {{arriving}} 11 May 1861, {{and joined}} the Gulf Blockading Squadron. In early August she steamed from the Florida coast westward and almost immediately captured two small schooners off Mobile, Alabama. She cruised on blockade duty from Alabama to Texas, and on 24 December she engaged Florida off Mobile Bay. Following an hour-long gun battle, she turned the blockade <b>runner</b> <b>back</b> into Mobile. Huntsville returned to New York {{in the spring of}} 1862, and she decommissioned 5 April. She recommissioned 11 June, Lt. Howard Rogers in command, and returned to blockade duty along the U.S. Gulf Coast. By the end of July she had taken three prizes, Confederate steamers Adela and Reliance and British schooner Agnes, carrying cargoes of cotton, rosin, and other commodities. Before the end of the year, she captured two additional blockade runners, schooners Courier and Ariel, trying to run into Mobile with cargoes of lead, tin, medicines, wines, and coffee.|$|E
5000|$|Trabolgan {{began his}} racing career in National Hunt Flat races, {{also known as}} [...] "bumpers" [...] {{starting}} with an event at Uttoxeter Racecourse on 21 December, {{in which he was}} made 7/4 favourite and finished second, four lengths behind the winner, Plastic Paddy. After a break of two months, he returned in a similar event at Kempton Park Racecourse and started the 2/1 favourite against eighteen opponents. Ridden for the first time by Mick Fitzgerald he took the lead three furlongs from the finish but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Chelsea Bridge. Despite failing to win, the gelding was moved up sharply in class for the Grade I Champion Bumper on 12 March at the Cheltenham Festival. He started a 50/1 outsider and was ridden by Seamus Durack, with Fitzgerald partnering the Henderson stable's more fancied <b>runner</b> <b>Back</b> to Ben Alder. Trabolgan produced by far his best performance up to that time, moving up to challenge for the lead in the straight and finishing second by half a length to the Martin Pipe-trained favourite Liberman.|$|E

50|$|All runners {{start at}} the same time, from a {{starting}} arc (or line) marked with lines or boxes for each team or individual. An official, 50 meters or more {{in front of the}} starting line, fires a pistol to indicate the start. If runners collide and fall within the first 100 meters, officials can call the <b>runners</b> <b>back</b> and restart the race, however this is done only once. Crossing the line or starting before the starting pistol is fired is considered a false start and most often results in disqualification of the runner.|$|R
50|$|The course circumnavigates {{the roads}} of Tonbridge and the Kent countryside. The route starts at K College on Brook Street and takes runners out of Tonbridge along Molescroft Way, Upper Hayesden Lane, and Ensfield Road {{to the village}} of Leigh. Runners pass through the village then head along the B2027 towards Hildenborough, turning left into Watts Cross Road and then left again at every {{junction}} back into Leigh.

5000|$|The platoon {{to which}} Private Cruickshank belonged came under very heavy rifle and machine-gun fire at short range and was led {{down a steep}} bank into a wadi, {{most of the men}} being hit before they reached the bottom. Immediately after {{reaching}} the bottom of the wadi the officer in command was shot dead, and the sergeant who then took over command sent a <b>runner</b> <b>back</b> to Company Headquarters asking for support, but was mortally wounded almost immediately after; the corporal having in the meantime been killed, the only remaining N.C.O. (a lance-corporal), believing the first messenger to have been killed, called for a volunteer to take a second message back. Private Cruickshank immediately responded and rushed up the slope, but was hit and rolled back into the wadi bottom. He again rose and rushed up the slope, but, being again wounded, rolled back into the wadi. After his wounds had been dressed he rushed a third time up the slope and again fell badly wounded. Being now unable to stand he rolled himself back amid a hail of bullets. His wounds were now of such a nature as to preclude him making any further attempt and he lay all day in a dangerous position, being sniped at and again wounded here he lay. he displayed the utmost valour and endurance, and was cheerful and uncomplaining throughout.Citation for Private Robert Edward Cruickshank, Lond.

50|$|The South Wales Traverse {{is a long}} {{distance}} fell running challenge across the mountains of south Wales. It is a linear route of 118 km taking in some 31 summits over 610 m high, giving about 5000 m of ascent. The aim is for participants to complete the route, on foot, within 24 hours. Runners may start at either end, but traditionally it is run from west to east, so that the prevailing wind is on the <b>runner's</b> <b>back</b> {{and much of the}} ascent is done {{during the first half of}} the route. The route takes in the mountain ranges of the Black Mountain, Carmarthenshire Fans, Fforest Fawr, Central Brecon Beacons, and the Black Mountains, across most of the Brecon Beacons National Park.|$|R

50|$|World record holder Hicham El Guerrouj was {{the clear}} {{favorite}} {{coming into the}} race, {{but he had a}} reputation for setting records in races set up by a pacemaker. His countryman Youssef Baba provided the service, sacrificing his own ambition in the final, he took the pace out in 54.14, the two Moroccan teammates leading the two Kenyan challengers Noah Ngeny and Bernard Lagat, separating {{from the rest of the}} field. On the second lap the pace lagged to 60.63, letting the other <b>runners</b> <b>back</b> in. Baba disappeared quickly leaving El Guerrouj to burn off the Kenyans taking the third lap in 56.90. But the Kenyans remained close with Mehdi Baala a step behind. Through the final turn Ngeny executed a textbook kick, moving onto El Guerrouj's shoulder, sliding into the second lane and sprinting past him for the gold. Lagat moved into lane 3 with hopes of passing as well but ran out of real estate to take the bronze.|$|R

50|$|In gambling, Dutching is {{sharing the}} risk of losing across a number of <b>runners</b> by <b>backing</b> more than one {{selection}} in a race or event.

Although not foolproof, because handicapping is still involved, there have been successful bettors throughout history who have applied this system. This is {{not to be confused with}} what constitutes a Dutch book which is when a bookmaker goes overbroke (the opposite to overround).|$|R

50|$|On Tower Hill, a short {{distance}} from the Tower's moat, the course makes a U-turn back to Lower Thames Street {{at the start of the}} return leg. Leaving Lower Thames Street, the route reaches The Monument dedicated to the Great Fire of London. After The Monument, the return leg has far fewer bends than the outward leg, as it takes the runners along the relatively straight and flat 1,600 m stretch following Cannon Street and back onto Queen Victoria Street. An S-bend takes the <b>runners</b> <b>back</b> onto the Victoria Embankment, at the far end of which are the Houses of Parliament. About 600 m before the end of the Embankment they rejoin the route taken on the first lap and pass the London Eye on the opposite side of the river. On the first lap, runners turn left onto Westminster Bridge, making a U-turn on the bridge before rejoining the main route. On the other laps, runners turn right at the end of the Embankment, and continue past Big Ben and Parliament Square and towards Buckingham Palace via Birdcage Walk on the periphery of St. James Park. As the runners approach the palace, another right turn brings the Victoria Memorial into view. The memorial, at the south-western end of the kilometre-long Mall, brings them past the start line which, on the last circuit, is also the finish line.|$|R
