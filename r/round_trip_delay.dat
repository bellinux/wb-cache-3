Expressions exist for these values only in the homogenous case and heuristics for the general case give uncertain results. In this paper we first derive an exact expression (in the setting of fluid models) for the window evolu-tion of TCP connections with different <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>delays.</b> We next apply this result in a particular context to derive expressions for the maximum window sizes and the throughputs of TCP connec-tions as well the idle periods and the utilization of the shared link. We show a bias in favor of connections with short <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>delays</b> persists even for large buffer sizes.

In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured for example in seconds per 30 years outage time as in the PSTN network) or security (say AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are often also assumed or defined as requirements.

50|$|In {{a two-way}} time {{transfer}} system, the two peers will both transmit, and will also receive each other's messages, thus performing two one-way time transfers {{to determine the}} difference between the remote clock and the local clock. The sum of these time differences is the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>delay</b> between the two nodes. It is often assumed that this delay is evenly distributed between the directions between the peers. Under this assumption, half the round-trip delay is the propagation delay to be compensated. A drawback is that the two-way propagation delay must be measured and used to calculate a delay correction. That function can be implemented in the reference source, in which case the source capacity limits the number of slaves that can be served, or by software in each slave. The NIST provides a time reference service to computer users on the Internet, based on Java applets loaded by each slave.

An additional carrier quite near the one described above that remained fixed in frequency and used as a phase reference. That carrier and the two frequencies (that the sweep changed between) were generated as multiples of the same basic oscillator frequency. In this way, all signals would have a fixed phase relationship, as was done in MISTRAM. A similar technique was used in the Soviet Luna 20 spacecraft at 183.54 MHz to survey the moon's surface.|$|E
