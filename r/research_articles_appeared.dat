40|$|Lot {{streaming}} is {{a technique}} of splitting production lots into smaller sublots in a multi-stage manufacturing systems so that operations of a given lot can be overlapped. This technique can reduce manufacturing makespan and is an effective tool for time-based manufacturing strategy. Several <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>appeared</b> in literature {{to solve this problem}} and most of these studies are limited to pure flowshop environments where there is only a single machine in each stage.

However, the issue of lot streaming in hybrid flowshop environment is not well studied. In this paper, we aim to initiate research in bridging the gap between the research efforts in flowshop lot streaming and hybrid flowshop scheduling. We present a comprehensive mathematical model for scheduling flexible hybrid flowshop with lot streaming. Numerical example demonstrated that lot streaming can result in larger makespan reduction in hybrid flowshop where there is a limited research than in pure flowshop where research is abundant...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyse the evolution and nature of published empirical research in the fields of medical ethics and bioethics. DESIGN: Retrospective quantitative study of nine peer reviewed journals in the field of bioethics and medical ethics (Bioethics, Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, Hastings Center Report, Journal of Clinical Ethics, Journal of Medical Ethics, Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, Nursing Ethics, Christian Bioethics, and Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics). RESULTS: In total, 4029 articles published between 1990 and 2003 were retrieved from the journals studied. Over this period, 435 (10. 8 %) studies used an empirical design. The highest percentage of empirical <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>appeared</b> in Nursing Ethics (n = 145, 39. 5 %), followed by the Journal of Medical Ethics (n = 128, 16. 8 %) and the Journal of Clinical Ethics (n = 93, 15. 4 %). These three journals account for 84. 1 % of all empirical research in bioethics published in this period. The results of the chi 2 test for two independent samples for the entire dataset indicate that the period 1997 - 2003 presented a higher number of empirical studies (n = 309) than did the period 1990 - 1996 (n = 126). This increase is statistically significant (chi 2 = 49. 0264, p <. 0001). Most empirical studies employed a quantitative paradigm (64. 6 %, n = 281). The main topic of research was prolongation of life and euthanasia (n = 68). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the proportion of empirical research in the nine journals increased steadily from 5. 4 % in 1990 to 15. 4 % in 2003. It is likely that the importance of empirical methods in medical ethics and bioethics will continue to increase. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Assessing the {{research}} of individual scholars is currently a matter of serious concern and worldwide debate. In order to gauge the long-term efficacy and efficiency of this practice, we carried out a limited survey of the operation and outcome of Mexico's 30 -year old National System of Investigators or SNI, the country's main instrument for stimulating competitive research in science and technology. A statistical random sample of researchers listed {{in the area of}} Humanities and Behavioral Sciences-one of SNI's first and better consolidated academic divisions comprising a wide range of research disciplines, from philosophy to pedagogy to archaeology to experimental brain research-was screened comparing individual ranks or "Levels of distinction" to actual compliance with the SNI's own evaluation criteria, as reflected in major public databases of scholarly production. The same analysis was applied to members of a recent Review Committee, integrated by top-level researchers belonging to that general area of knowledge, who have been in charge of assessing and ranking their colleagues. Our results for both sets of scholars show wide disparity of individual productivity within the same SNI Level, according to all key indicators officially required (books issued by prestigious publishers, <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>appeared</b> in indexed journals, and formation of new scientists), as well as in impact estimated by numbers of citations. Statistical calculation from the data indicates that 36 % of members in the Review Committee and 53 % of researchers in the random sample do not satisfy the official criteria requested for their appointed SNI Levels. The findings are discussed in terms of possible methodological errors in our study, of relevance for the SNI at large in relation to independent appraisals, of the cost-benefit balance of the organization as a research policy tool, and of possible alternatives for its thorough restructuring.

40|$|Arctic {{science is}} often {{claimed to have}} been {{transformed}} by the increased involvement of local people, but these claims of a new research paradigm have not been empirically evaluated. We argue that the "new" participatory research paradigm emerging in Arctic science embodies many of the principles of the Mode 2 knowledge production framework. Using the Mode 2 thesis as an assessment framework, we examined <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>appearing</b> between 1965 and 2010 in the journal Arctic to assess the extent to which there has been a paradigm shift toward more participatory approaches. Results suggest that the involvement of local people has increased only slightly over the last half century and continues to vary systematically among disciplines, organizations, and regions. Analysis of three additional journals focused on Arctic and circumpolar science establishes the generality of these slight increases in local involvement. There is clearly room for more community involvement in Arctic science, but achieving this will require either increasing the proportional representation of the organizations, disciplines, and regions with a track record of successful Mode 2 research, or encouraging Mode 2 research innovation within the organizations, disciplines, and regions currently predominated by Mode 1 approaches...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} Florida {{high-voltage}} power grid as a technological network embedded in space. Measurements of geographical lengths of transmission lines, {{the mixing of}} generators and loads, the weighted clustering coefficient, {{as well as the}} organization of edge conductance weights show a complex architecture quite different from random-graph models usually considered. In particular, we introduce a parametrized mixing matrix to characterize the mixing pattern of generators and loads in the Florida Grid, which is intermediate between the random mixing case and the semi-bipartite case where generator-generator transmission lines are forbidden. Our observations motivate an investigation of optimization (design) principles leading to the structural organization of power grids. We thus propose two network optimization models for the Florida Grid as a case study. Our results show that the Florida Grid is optimized not only by reducing the construction cost (measured by the total length of power lines), but also through reducing the total pairwise edge resistance in the grid, which increases the robustness of power transmission between generators and loads against random line failures. We then embed our models in spatial areas of different aspect ratios and study how this geometric factor affects the network structure, as well as the box-counting fractal dimension of the grids generated by our models.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{theoretical}} framework for interpreting long-range dynamical correlations unveiled in proteins through NMR measurements. The theoretical rationale relies on the hypothesis that correlated motions in proteins may be reconstructed as large-scale, collective modes sustained by long-lived nonlinear vibrations known as discrete breathers (DB) localized at key, hot-spot sites. DBs are spatially localized modes, whose nonlinear nature hinders resonant coupling with the normal modes, thus conferring them long lifetimes as compared to normal modes. DBs have been predicted to exist in proteins, localized at few $hotspot$ residues typically within the stiffest portions of the structure. We compute DB modes analytically in the framework of the nonlinear network model, showing that the displacement patterns of many DBs localized at key sites match to a remarkable extent the experimentally uncovered correlation blueprint. The computed dispersion relations prove that it is physically possible for some of these DBs to be excited out of thermal fluctuations at room temperature. Based on our calculations, we speculate that transient energy redistribution among the vibrational modes in a protein might favor the emergence of DB-like bursts of long-lived energy at hot-spot sites with lifetimes in the ns range, able to sustain critical, function-encoding correlated motions. More generally, our calculations provide a novel quantitative tool to predict fold-spanning dynamical pathways of correlated residues that may be central to allosteric cross-talk in proteins.

In particular, his research has focused on relativistic gravitation theory, the structure and behavior of accretion disks, stellar dynamics, radiative processes, and relativistic plasmas. Some of his significant achievements are his discovery, with Douglas Eardley, of a structural instability in orbiting disks of matter, called accretion disks, that form around massive condensed objects such as black holes, with wide application in astronomy; his proof, with David L. Lee, that all gravitation theories obeying the Weak Equivalence Principle (the experimentally verified fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field) must be metric theories of gravity, that is, must describe gravity as a geometrical warping of time and space; his discovery, independently of Roland Svensson of Sweden, of the negative heat behavior of optically thin, hot thermal plasmas dominated by electron-positron pairs, that is, the result that adding energy to thin hot gases causes their temperature to decrease rather than increase; and his work on unusual radiation processes, such as unsaturated inverse Compton scattering, in thermal media, also with wide application in astrophysics.

This mainly implies the indication of a knowledge gap and/or the criticism of any weak point in the previously published work by other researchers or the academic community itself.

In this study we discuss the development of a taxonomy to describe the rhetorical choices writers use when making the critical speech act, and the application of this taxonomy to 50 RAs from two distinct disciplines: Psychology, representing the social disciplines, and Chemistry, the natural disciplines. The application of this taxonomy, which categorises AC according to directness, writer mediation, and the target of the criticism, has yielded the following results: AC was manifested far more frequently in Psychology than in Chemistry, not only in total number of AC units, but also in the <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> themselves: it <b>appears</b> to be an essential rhetorical strategy for writers in the field of Psychology, but not so in Chemistry.

The mesopelagic boundary community off the leeward {{coasts of}} 2 Hawaiian Islands, Oahu and Hawaii, was investigated with an echosounder modified to read {{directly into a}} laptop computer. Acoustic sampling was conducted over a total distance of 12. 6 km off the Waianae coast of Oahu and 46. 3 km off the Kona coast of Hawaii. The density of organisms was determined using echo energy integration, and relative abundance was determined in a way analogous to catch-per-uniteffort. The vertical range of mesopelagic organisms expanded as the mesopelagic layer rose and then compressed as it descended. The vertical range of the layer off the Kona coast was larger than that off the Waianae coast, possibly because of the greater bottom depth off Kona. Near midnight, the boundary community 3 km from the shoreline was split into 2 distinct layers, one beginning approximately 25 m from the surface and one beginning approximately 90 m from the surface. The density and the relative abundance of mesopelagic organisms were consistently higher off the Waianae coast than the Kona coast.
