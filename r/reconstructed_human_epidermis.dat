40|$|In {{recent years}} many {{efforts have been}} made to replace dermal {{toxicity}} testing of chemicals in the animal by in vitro assays. As a member of a German research consortium, we have previously contributed to the validation of an in vitro test protocol for percutaneous absorption studies on the basis of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> and both human and pig skin ex vivo. Aiming to assess the barrier properties of a newly developed reconstructed skin model, this protocol has now been transferred to the Phenion (R) Full-Thickness Skin Model (FT model). The permeation of testosterone and caffeine was quantified in parallel to that of pig skin using Franz-type diffusion cells. In addition, the permeation of benzoic acid and nicotine was studied. As expected, the FT model is more permeable than pig skin, yet its barrier properties are well in accordance with those of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> when compared to previous data. In fact, the FT model most efficiently retards testosterone as the compound of highest lipophilicity, which can be explained by an additional uptake by a reservoir formed by the dermis equivalent. Thus, the structure closely parallels human skin. In consequence, the Phenion FT model appears to be suitable for percutaneous absorption studies in hazard analysis and should be subjected to a catch-up validation study. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

We show that SP is stimulating the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in a <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> model. qRT-PCR array analysis of 64 genes expressed by keratinocytes in the response to bacterial infection revealed a potential link between the action of SP on Staphylococci and skin physiopathology. qRT-PCR and direct assay of cathelicidin and human β-defensin 2 secretion also provided that demonstration that the action of SP on bacteria is independent of antimicrobial peptide expression by keratinocytes. Considering an effect of SP on S. aureus and S. epidermidis, we observed that SP increases the adhesion potential of both bacteria on keratinocytes. However, SP modulates the virulence of S. aureus and S. epidermidis through different mechanisms. The response of S. aureus is associated {{with an increase in}} Staphylococcal Enterotoxin C 2 (SEC 2) production and a reduction of exolipase processing whereas in S. epidermidis the effect of SP appears mediated by a rise in biofilm formation activity.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{effectiveness}} of any cosmetic formulation, the active ingredients {{should be able to}} penetrate the natural barrier of the skin, which is the stratum corneum (SC). In order to ensure that active ingredients penetrate the skin barrier, a carrier must be utilized to carry the active ingredients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a stable niosomal delivery system for Ficus deltoidea by using sorbitan monostearate (Span 60) as a surfactant. In addition, cholesterols, ß-sitosterols, and PEG- 8 caprylic/capric glycerides (Labrasol) were applied as additives. These vesicles were characterized based on zeta potential, vesicle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency (EE %), niosome morphology, and in-vitro permeation. Following application of Ficus deltoidea loaded niosome on <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> pigmented <b>epidermis,</b> the efficacy of the niosome in reducing melanin level was tested based on the microscopic observation of melanin distribution and measurement of melanin content. The developed niosomes (Span 60 /cholesterol/Labrasol and Span 60 /ß-sitosterols/Labrasol) were found to be the most stable and promising niosomes after 3 months of storage, as both niosomes preserved their stability in terms of zeta potential, vesicle size and loading capacity. Zeta potential for both niosomes was measured at approximately - 30 mV. The vesicle size was found to be in the range of 140 nm to 170 nm and both niosomes had high encapsulation efficiency (87. 55 ± 5. 35 % and 78. 38 ± 0. 37 % for Span 60 /cholesterol/Labrasol and Span 60 /ß-sitosterol/Labrasol niosomes, respectively). These results indicated that ß-sitosterols could also be option as additive since it displayed similar characteristics as cholesterol and the stability of loaded niosomes was improved with the inclusion of Labrasol.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Deletion of {{the late}} {{cornified}} envelope (LCE) proteins LCE 3 B and LCE 3 C is a strong and widely replicated psoriasis risk factor. It is amenable to biological analysis because it precludes the expression of two epidermis-specific proteins, rather than being a single-nucleotide polymorphism of uncertain significance. The biology of the 18 -member LCE family of highly homologous proteins has remained largely unexplored so far. OBJECTIVES: To analyse LCE 3 expression at the protein level in human epithelia, {{as a starting point}} for functional analyses of these proteins in health and disease. METHODS: We generated the first pan-LCE 3 monoclonal antibody and provide a detailed analysis of its specificity towards individual LCE members. LCE 2 and LCE 3 expression in human tissues and in <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> skin models was studied using immunohistochemical analyses and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Our study reveals that LCE 2 and LCE 3 proteins are differentially expressed in <b>human</b> <b>epidermis,</b> and colocalize only in the upper stratum granulosum layer. Using an in vitro <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> skin model that mimics epidermal morphogenesis, we found that LCE 3 proteins are expressed at an early time point during epidermal differentiation in the suprabasal layers, while LCE 2 proteins are found only in the uppermost granular layer and stratum corneum. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the localization of LCE 2 and LCE 3 in <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> we conclude that members of the LCE protein family are likely to have distinct functions in epidermal biology. This finding may contribute to understanding why LCE 3 B/C deletion increases psoriasis risk...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Deimination (also {{known as}} citrullination), the {{conversion}} of arginine in a protein to citrulline, is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs).

It aggregates keratins and is cross-linked to cornified envelopes. Following its deimination, it is totally degraded to release free amino acids, contributing to the natural moisturizing factor (NMF). The mechanisms controlling this multistep catabolism in human are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To test whether external humidity plays a role, and investigate the molecular mechanisms involved.

To solve this problem, we used cord blood-derived CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitors.

Interestingly, the same result was obtained by co-seeding a mixture of keratinocytes, melanocytes, and nondifferentiated CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitors on the dermal equivalent, indicating that keratinocytes provide the environmental conditions for hematopoietic progenitors to differentiate into resident epidermal Langerhans cells, expressing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, CD 1 a antigen, and Birbeck granules...|$|E
40|$|A protein exhibiting endoglycosidase {{activity}} was purified from plantar stratum corneum to apparent homogeneity in two sequential column chromatographic steps. Protein sequencing revealed its identity with the recently cloned human heparanase 1, an enzyme, {{the expression of}} which {{is reported to be}} related to the metastasic potential of tumor cells. By using a heparanase 1 specific antibody we were able to demonstrate that, in the plantar stratum corneum, heparanase 1 exists in two forms, the active 50 kDa protein and the inactive 63 kDa form, probably a proform of the enzyme. The antibody also decorated numerous degradation fragments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies as well as immunohistochemical analysis using <b>reconstructed</b> and normal <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> demonstrated clearly a keratinocyte differentiation related expression of heparanase 1.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the calmodulin-like skin protein, a recently discovered new skin-specific calcium binding protein, was studied in cultured keratinocytes, <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis,</b> and normal human skin. Using a calmodulin-like skin protein specific polyclonal antibody and Western blot analysis we could show that in cultured keratinocytes calmodulin-like skin protein expression is strongly induced after stimulating cell differentiation by increasing the medium calcium concentration. Known modulators of epidermal differentiation such as sodium butyrate and the synthetic retinoid CD 367 strongly affected calmodulin-like skin protein expression. A more than 10 -fold increase was observed {{in the presence of}} sodium butyrate, whereas CD 367 abolished almost completely calmodulin-like skin protein expression already at nanomolar concentrations. Calmodulin, another calcium binding protein that is expressed throughout the living layers of the epidermis, is not affected by these modulators.

40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory skin disorder characterized by defects in the epidermal barrier and keratinocyte differentiation. The expression of filaggrin, a protein {{thought to have}} {{a major role in the}} function of the epidermis, is downregulated.

This was investigated using lentivirus-mediated small-hairpin RNA interference in a three-dimensional <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> (RHE) model, in the absence of other cell types than keratinocytes. Similar to what is known for atopic skin, the experimental filaggrin downregulation resulted in hypogranulosis, a disturbed corneocyte intracellular matrix, reduced amounts of natural moisturizing factor components, increased permeability and UV-B sensitivity of the RHE, and impaired keratinocyte differentiation at the messenger RNA and protein levels. In particular, the amounts of two filaggrin-related proteins and one protease involved in the degradation of filaggrin, bleomycin hydrolase, were lower. In addition, caspase- 14 activation was reduced. These results demonstrate the importance of filaggrin for the stratum corneum properties/functions.

PROCEDURE: Human keratinocytes and melanocytes cultured in vitro were grown on a biological matrix (dead de-epidermized human dermis) and the system was kept at an air-liquid interface, in a suitable culturing medium, until a stratified <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> was formed, maintaining the histological characteristics of the epidermis in vivo. RESULTS: It was histologically demonstrated that it is possible to reproduce a differentiated epidermis through keratinocytes and melanocytes cultured on dead de-epidermized human dermis, thus obtaining a correctly positioned <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> <b>reconstructed</b> in vitro with functional keratinocytes and melanocytes that is similar to in vivo epidermis. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to obtain a completely differentiated <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> <b>reconstructed</b> in vitro from keratinocyte and melanocyte cultures on a dead de-epidermized human dermis...|$|R
40|$|The <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> {{has been}} studied by {{electron}} microscopy following osmium tetroxide and potassium permanganate fixation. An anatomically distinct cell in the <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> has been demonstrated with features similar to the melanocyte of the hair bulb described by Barnicot, Birbeck and Cuckow (3). It is dendritic in form and does not contain tonofilaments. "Intercellular bridges" are not formed. The mitochondria are larger and more numerous than those of other epidermal cells and the endoplasmic reticulum is more complex. Some of these cells contain melanin but others are melanin-free. The cell has been interpreted as being identical with the dopa-positive, clear cell of Masson (dendritic cell of Bloch or melanocyte). We have found that many membranous structures in the <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> are better preserved by permanganate fixation than by osmium tetroxide fixation...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is {{a stable}} cell cycle arrest {{that is the}} causative process of aging. The PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway is implicated in the control of cellular senescence and inhibitors of this pathway have been successfully used for life span prolongation experiments in mammals. PTEN is the major regulator of the PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway and loss of PTEN promotes a senescence response termed PICS. Here we report a novel-screening assay, for the identification of compounds that block different types of senescence response. By testing a library of more than 3000 natural and chemical compounds in PTEN deficient cells {{we have found that}} an extract from Salvia haenkei (SH), a native plant of Bolivia is a potent inhibitor of PICS. SH also decreases replicative and UV-mediated senescence in human primary fibroblasts and in a model of in vitro <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis.</b> Mechanistically, SH treatment affects senescence driven by UV by interfering with IL 1 -α signalling. Pre-clinical and clinical testing of this extract by performing toxicity and irritability evaluation in vitro also demonstrate the safety of SH extract for clinical use as anti-aging skin treatment...|$|E
40|$|Because its {{critical}} location, {{the skin}} is the main target of environmental stressors such as ozone (O 3). Although O 3 does not penetrate the deeper layers of skin {{it is able to}} react readily with stratum corneum lipids [1]. The toxic effects of O 3 on the uppermost layers, induced either directly by the oxidation of biomolecules or by driving the radical-dependent production of cytotoxic, non-radical species (aldehydes), have repercussions on deeper cellular layers, triggering a cascade of cellular stress and inflammatory responses that can lead to skin pathologies [2] and [3]. Furthermore, O 3 is able to induce the depletion of cutaneous antioxidants [4]. Therefore, topical application of antioxidants could prevent pollution induces cutaneous damages. In our recent work, the use of topical antioxidant mixtures (MIXs) has proven an effective defensive approach against O 3 -induced oxidative damage in human keratinocytes [5]. In the present study, which is a methodological extension of the one recently published [5], we evaluated the ability of the three MIXs to prevent the noxious effects of O 3 on a customized <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> (RHE, Episkin), where sebum was applied to reproduce a model resembling “in vivo” expectations [...|$|E
40|$|Fas ligand (FasL) causes {{apoptosis}} of epidermal keratinocytes and {{triggers the}} appearance of spongiosis in eczematous dermatitis. We demonstrate here that FasL also aggravates inflammation by triggering the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in keratinocytes. In HaCaT cells and in <b>reconstructed</b> <b>human</b> <b>epidermis</b> (RHE), FasL triggered a NF-κB-dependent mRNA accumulation of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β), chemokines (CCL 2 /MCP- 1, CXCL 1 /GROα, CXCL 3 /GROγ, and CXCL 8 /IL- 8), and the adhesion molecule ICAM- 1. Oligomerization of Fas was required both for apoptosis and for gene expression. Inhibition of caspase activity abolished FasL-dependent apoptosis; however, it failed to suppress the expression of FasL-induced genes. Additionally, {{in the presence of}} caspase inhibitors, but not in their absence, FasL triggered the accumulation of CCL 5 /RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) mRNA. Our findings identify a novel proinflammatory role of FasL in keratinocytes that is independent of caspase activity and is separable from apoptosis. Thus, in addition to causing spongiosis, FasL may play a direct role in triggering and/or sustaining inflammation in eczemas...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{possible}} {{health hazards}} due to radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitted by mobile phones have been investigated. Because several publications {{have suggested that}} RFR is stressful, we explored the potential biological effects of Global System for Mobile phone communication at 900 MHz (GSM- 900) exposure on cultures of isolated human skin cells and <b>human</b> <b>reconstructed</b> <b>epidermis</b> (hRE) using <b>human</b> keratinocytes. As cell stress markers, we studied Hsc 70, Hsp 27 and Hsp 70 heat shock protein (HSP) expression and epidermis thickness, as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cells were exposed to GSM- 900 under optimal culture conditions, for 48 h, using a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 2 W. kg- 1. This SAR level represents the recommended limit for local exposure to a mobile phone. The various biological parameters were analysed immediately after exposure. Apoptosis was not induced in isolated cells {{and there was no}} alteration in hRE thickness or proliferation. No change in HSP expression was observed in isolated keratinocytes. By contrast, a slight but significant increase in Hsp 70 expression was observed in hREs after 3 and 5 weeks of culture. Moreover, fibroblasts showed a significant decrease in Hsc 70, depending on the culture conditions. These results suggest that adaptive cell behaviour in response to RFR exposure, depending on the cell type and culture conditions, is unlikely to have deleterious effects at the skin level...|$|R
40|$|Background: Retinoids {{have been}} {{reported}} to exert depigmenting activity. Unlike most depigmenting agents that target tyrosinase, they are not phenolic agents and may act via different mechanisms. Objectives: We analysed the properties of retinaldehyde (RAL), a precursor of retinoic acid (RA), as a skin-lightening agent in various models. Methods: The viability and the depigmenting properties of RAL were assessed in murine melanocytes, in <b>human</b> <b>reconstructed</b> <b>epidermis,</b> and in mice and guinea pigs. The melanin content and cytotoxicity were assessed in melanocytes; in 3 -dimensional models, the melanin concentration and the number of active melanocytes were determined. Results: RAL was taken up by melanocytes and mostly metabolised to retinol and retinyl esters, {{and to a lesser extent}} to RA. RAL decreased the melanin concentration of guinea pig ears and mouse tails by 54 and 74 %, respectively, and decreased the number of active melanocytes by 42 and 77 %, respectively. In reconstructed epidermis the melanin concentration was increased by 52 %, whereas the number of active melanocytes decreased by 44 %. Conclusion: RAL exerts a significant depigmenting activity with a mode of action that looks different from that of RA. Our data suggest a skin-lightening effect related to a melanolytic action (i. e. a decrease in melanin concentration, whatever the mechanism) rather than to melanocytotoxicity, besides other still unknown actions of RAL on melanocytes...|$|R
