40|$|Constructing indoor radio maps {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many services and applications such as wireless base station planning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to constructing indoor radio maps by developing a novel indoor signal propagation model, called the Hidden Environment Model (HEM). The model is a hybrid because it combines on-site measurements with a number of different types of calculations. As part of this model, we introduce the idea of an Environment Factor Matrix (EFM). The EFM represents a model of the environmental features that affect <b>radio</b> <b>attenuation.</b> We also develop a Lazy Sampling Algorithm to help generate the EFM. The goal of the Lazy Sampling Algorithm is to balance the number of measurements that need to be taken with our model's accuracy. The goal is to minimize the measurement workload while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. We evaluate our model by comparing the radio maps calculated from the model to a radio map obtained by exhaustive measurements. The results show that our Hidden Environment Model achieves good accuracy. ...|$|E

Such neutrinos can be detected via coherent radio Cerenkov emission resulting from neutrino induced particle showers in ice. The Askaryan Under-Ice Radio Array (AURA) is an Antarctic test array of five detectors intended to study technology and analysis techniques for a future large scale radio Cherenkov neutrino array.

40|$|Barrier {{potential}} in {{quantum mechanics is}} not just a theoretical phenomenon but is often encountered in various physical realities. It involves reflection and transmission of some wave functions around a region with a given potential function. It is possible for particles of a wave function to slow down or speed up if they manage to go through a potential barrier or a region, in which case, the observed change in their velocities is as good as saying that the particle’s waves has gone through some processes of refraction. Therefore, reflection, transmission, absorption and refraction all involve phenomena which arise from the wave-like behavior of the motion of microscopic particles. Current analysis of the <b>radio</b> wave <b>attenuation</b> in satellite communications shows that there are no quantum mechanical models of the Bloch NMR flow equations for the analysis of <b>radio</b> wave <b>attenuation</b> in satellite communication system, especially {{in the area of the}} inter-dependence of the radio wave frequency and the refractive index of the atmosphere on the radio signal.

The plasma flow properties, such as electron number density, in the shock layer and wake region were obtained using a newly developed unstructured grid solver that incorporated real gas effect models and could treat thermochemically non-equilibrium flow. To predict the electromagnetic waves in plasma, a frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain method was used. Moreover, the complicated behaviour of electromagnetic waves in the plasma layer during atmospheric reentry was clarified at several altitudes. The prediction performance of the combined model was evaluated with profiles and peak values of the electron number density in the plasma layer. In addition, to validate the models, the signal losses measured during communication with the reentry vehicle were directly compared with the predicted results.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the transmission of radio/microwave pulses through salt in the Cote Blanche salt mine operated by the North American Salt Company in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. These results are from data taken in the southwestern region of the 1500 ft. (457 m) deep level of the mine on our third and most recent visit to the mine. We transmitted and received a fast, high-power, broadband pulse from within three vertical boreholes that were drilled to depths of 100 ft. (30 m) and 200 ft. below the 1500 ft. level using three different pairs of dipole antennas whose bandwidths span 125 to 900 MHz. By measuring the relative strength of the received pulses between boreholes with separations of 50 m and 169 m, we deduce the attenuation of the signal attributed to the salt medium. We fit the frequency dependence of the attenuation to a power law and find the best fit field attenuation lengths to be 93 ± 7 m at 150 MHz, 63 ± 3 m at 300 MHz, and 36 ± 2 m at 800 MHz.

However, despite {{the growing number}} of applications (e. g., forest fire detection, wildlife monitoring), the deployment challenges posed by the real-world natural environment still hinder the widespread adoption of this technology. In particular, the unpredictability of the low-power wireless channel in the presence of vegetation requires costly trial-and-error pilot campaigns to understand where and how to place the wireless nodes. In this paper, we propose a technique based on remote sensing for accurately estimating low-power <b>radio</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> in forest environments. We leverage airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instruments and related automatic data analysis systems to determine local forest attributes (e. g., tree density) that, once factored into a specialized radio path loss model, enable accurate estimation of the received signal power.
