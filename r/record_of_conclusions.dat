Thirty-two interviews were also carried out with general practitioners. Transcripts were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results Three key themes were identified: 1. Selective use of records; 2. Communication of care; 3. Negativity about the use <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> This study demonstrates that health care providers do not effectively share information using either a paper hand-held record or a shared electronic health record. Considering a national commitment to e-health innovation, a multi-professional input, organisational support and continuing education are identified as crucial to realising the potential of a maternity shared electronic health record to facilitate integrated care...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> smoking status and {{factors associated with}} the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> smoking status in general practitioner (GP) electronic medical records (EMRs) in New Zealand, and the suitability of this source as a prevalence measure. Setting General practices affiliated with an Auckland-based primary health organisation. Population Patients registered with 84 / 107 (78. 5 %) eligible GPs who had used EMRs {{for at least a}} year and had PREDICT-CVD,a web-based cardiovascular disease risk assessment and management decision support program, integrated with their practice software. Design Audit of EMRs using data from an evaluation of PREDICT-CVD. Main outcome measures The proportion of EMRs audited (Maori, non-Maori) with smoking status recorded and, among those with smoking status recorded,al so Read-coded, and factors associated with greater <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> smoking status. Results Smoking status was recorded among 49. 6 % of Maori and 38. 3 % of non-Maori prior to the installation of PREDICT-CVD. Among those with smoking status recorded, smoking status was also Read-coded among 49. 8 % of Maori and 62. 3 % of non-Maori. Factors associated with greater <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> smoking status were installation of PREDICT-CVD, male sex, Maori ethnicity, cardio-vascular disease and diabetes. Age was also associated with the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> smoking status. <b>Conclusion</b> General practitioner electronic medical records in New Zealand are currently not a suitable source of smoking prevalence data, even if manually searched, as a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>records</b> did not have smoking status recorded. Such records are an even less suitable source of smoking prevalence if data extraction by remote querying (using Read codes) is relied upon. The potential to estimate the prevalence of smoking from GP records has not yet become a reality. Installation of electronic decision support systems, such as PREDICT-CVD, could improve the <b>recording</b> and Read-coding <b>of</b> smoking status, and thereby the availability and accessibility of these data...|$|R

COUMT has not yet been fully adopted by staff in every organization. Our study intends to identify concepts that underlie its adoption and describe its current status in Dutch academic hospitals. Based on literature we have constructed a model that describes these concepts and that guided the development of a questionnaire investigating COUMT adoption. The questionnaire was sent to staff working with patient data or records in seven out of eight Dutch university hospitals. Results show high willingness of end-users to comply to COUMT in the care process. End-users agree that COUMT is important, and that they want to work in a structured and standardized way.

40|$|Abstract Background Within the {{subfamily}} Murinae, African murines represent 25 % {{of species}} biodiversity, making this group ideal for detailed {{studies of the}} patterns and timing of diversification of the African endemic fauna and its relationships with Asia. Here we report the results of phylogenetic analyses of the endemic African murines through a broad sampling of murine diversity from all their distribution area, based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the two nuclear gene fragments (IRBP exon 1 and GHR). Results A combined analysis of one mitochondrial and two nuclear gene sequences consistently identified and robustly supported ten primary lineages within Murinae. We propose to formalize a new tribal arrangement within the Murinae that reflects this phylogeny. The diverse African murine assemblage includes members of five of the ten tribes and clearly derives from multiple faunal exchanges between Africa and Eurasia. Molecular dating analyses using a relaxed Bayesian molecular clock put the first colonization of Africa around 11 Mya, {{which is consistent with}} the fossil record. The main period of African murine diversification occurred later following disruption of the migration route between Africa and Asia about 7 – 9 Mya. A second period of interchange, dating to around 5 – 6. 5 Mya, saw the arrival in Africa of Mus (leading to the speciose endemic Nannomys), and explains the appearance of several distinctive African lineages in the late Miocene and Pliocene fossil <b>record</b> <b>of</b> Eurasia. <b>Conclusion</b> Our molecular survey of Murinae, which includes the most complete sampling so far of African taxa, indicates that there were at least four separate radiations within the African region, as well as several phases of dispersal between Asia and Africa during the last 12 My. We also reconstruct the phylogenetic structure of the Murinae, and propose a new classification at tribal level for this traditionally problematic group. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aims: Vereda {{wetlands}} {{are among}} the most important aquatic habitats in Brazilian savannah (Cerrado) because of their association with river springs and its relevancy for biodiversity conservation. This study aimed to determine and compare the biodiversity of zooplankton in vereda lakes, differentiated by {{the presence or absence of}} aquatic macrophytes at an environmental reserve in Uberlândia, Minas Geais, Southeastern Brazil. Zooplanctonic abundance patterns and their relation with environmental parameters were also discussed and presented through multivariate statistics. Methods Twelve samples were taken at water surface, at 15 -day intervals in 2006. It was observed a total richness of 75 species, including 12 genera, 29 species and one sub-species as new records for Minas Gerais State. Results Rotifers were the predominant group and Lecanidae was the most diverse family. Among cladocerans, Chydoridae showed the greatest richness and Bosminidae the highest abundance. Few adult copepods were sampled in this study, but nauplii were very frequent. Cyclopidae was the most common family among copepods and there was no <b>record</b> <b>of</b> Calanoida. <b>Conclusions</b> The difference in composition among the studied lakes was remarkable. The lake with macrophytes showed the greatest richness but the lowest density, and the opposite situation occurred in the other lake. This can be explained by the fact that aquatic macrophytes, as primary producers, exert a bottom-up effect on zooplankton community, sustaining a high local diversity in contrast with a low numeric abundance of these microorganisms. Therefore, this pattern may have been created by the surround heterogeneity and, at the same time, by the reduction of available minerals of the system caused by macrophyte matter fixation. Many studies on zooplankton need to be developed in palm swamp communities in order to better comprehend the biological diversity and the energy balance in different habitats for the conservation of aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
