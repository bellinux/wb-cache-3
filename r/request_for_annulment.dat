40|$|This paper {{addresses}} specific quesitons {{in relation}} to the arbitral award. A first question dealt with, concerned the consequences and effects an arbitral award may have before a state court grants it exequatur. Two sub-questions are discussed : whether such award may have res judicata, and, if yes, what consequences may follow from the res judicata and second whether provisional measures may be ordered {{on the basis of the}} award before the exequatur is granted. In a second chapter, attention is devoted to the seminal question of the possibility to enforce an award which has been annulled. This is done by exploring the effects of a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> on the effects of an award and then discussing the consequences the annulment proper may have on the award. Finally, the position of the award debtor is also discussed {{in relation to}} enforcement proceedings. In particular, the possibility for the debtor to file a negative declaratory action and to request to be joined in enforcement proceedings are discussed...|$|E

[...] "Transfers and political upheavals nearly caused the total loss of all the archival material preceding Innocent III" [...] (reigned 1198-1216). From 1198 onwards, complete archives exist, though documentation is scant before the 13th century. Since that time, the documentation includes items such as Henry VIII of England's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a marriage <b>annulment,</b> a handwritten transcript of the trial against Galileo for heresy, and letters from Michelangelo complaining he hadn’t been paid for work on the Sistine Chapel.|$|R
40|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry VIII, England {{experienced}} a sudden change {{in the realm of}} religion. Initially, King Henry prided himself as the “Defender of Faith, ” a title given to him by Pope Clement VII due to Henry’s condemnation of Martin Luther. 1 However, after the Pope rejected his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> an <b>annulment</b> from his wife, Katherine of Aragon, King Henry broke away from the Catholic Church and established himself {{as the head of the}} Church of England. 2 Gerald Bray notes that “within months of the final break with Rome in 1534 …the province of Canterbury had petitioned the king to order ‘that the Holy Scripture should be translated into the vulgar English tongue by certain good and learned men. ’” 3 Before King Henry VIII could respond to this call, two separately translated versions of the Latin Bible emerged, one from Miles Coverdale and one from John Rogers. 4 Both versions received royal permission to be sold and read in England; 5 this, however, caused division among the readership. 6 When the case was brought to Thomas Cromwell, Henry’s secretary, he did not prefer one over the other, but had a different solution: to produce a better English Bible. 7 In 1538, Miles Coverdale was given the responsibility of revising John Roger’s Matthew’s Bible and producing a better English...|$|R

5000|$|In England, the Reformation {{followed}} a different course from elsewhere in Europe. There {{had long been}} a strong strain of anti-clericalism, and England had already given rise to the Lollard movement of John Wycliffe, which played {{an important part in}} inspiring the Hussites in Bohemia. Lollardy was suppressed and became an underground movement so the extent of its influence in the 1520s is difficult to assess. The different character of the English Reformation came rather {{from the fact that it}} was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. Henry had once been a sincere Roman Catholic and had even authored a book strongly criticizing Luther, but he later found it expedient and profitable to break with the Papacy. His wife, Catherine of Aragon, bore him only a single child, Mary. As England had recently gone through a lengthy dynastic conflict (see Wars of the Roses), Henry feared that his lack of a male heir might jeopardize his descendants' claim to the throne. However, Pope Clement VII, concentrating more on Charles V's [...] "sack of Rome", denied his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> an <b>annulment.</b> Had Clement granted the annulment and therefore admitted that his predecessor, Julius II, had erred, Clement would have given support to the Lutheran assertion that Popes replaced their own judgement for the will of God. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy made Henry the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under Thomas Cromwell, the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect. The veneration of some saints, certain pilgrimages and some pilgrim shrines were also attacked. Huge amounts of church land and property passed into the hands of the crown and ultimately into those of the nobility and gentry. The vested interest thus created made for a powerful force in support of the dissolutions.|$|R
