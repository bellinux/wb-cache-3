25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{the mirror}} coating can be measured using a <b>reflectometer</b> and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to infrared light.|$|E
25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain <b>reflectometer</b> (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E
25|$|Fibers {{have many}} uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical fiber. In other cases, fiber {{is used to}} connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a {{measurement}} system. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, {{or the fact that}} no electrical power is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be multiplexed along the length of a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an optical time-domain <b>reflectometer.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} a `detailed' {{form of the}} {{resolution}} kernel used to analyse data from reactor-based time-of-flight (TOF) neutron <b>reflectometers</b> is derived. In contrast to monochromatic neutron <b>reflectometers,</b> where the resolution kernel is close to Gaussian, TOF neutron <b>reflectometers</b> can have trapezoidal resolution kernels. This {{is a consequence of}} the disc chopper systems used to pulse the beam having a wavelength uncertainty that is rectangular in shape. The effect of using the detailed and approximate kernels is compared, with the main effects occurring where the width of the kernel is approximately the same as the width of the features in the reflectivity curve, i. e. around the critical edge and at high Qz. The difference between the two kernels is greatest when the wavelength and angular components are of different sizes. Â© 2013, Wiley-Blackwell...|$|R

The capacitance soil moisture probe has been demonstrated also to have a large number of potential uses. One factor that dielectric soil moisture determining techniques have in common is the need for calibration.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that the modules and phase of complex {{reflection}} coefficient can be determined by using a magnetic substrate and polarized neutrons. Several other methods have also been worked out based on measurement of polarizations of reflected neutrons from magnetic reference layers and magnetic substrate. However, due to the fact that available <b>reflectometers</b> are limited in the choice of polarization of reflected beam in the same direction as the polarization of the incident beam, neither of the methods which are based on polarization analysis, has been proven to be experimentally practical. In this paper, we have proposed a new method for determining the phase of reflection coefficient which is based on two measurements of polarization which correspond to two magnetic fields with the same magnitudes and different orientations. The polarization analysis is performed in the same direction as the polarization of the incident beam and is well suited for available <b>reflectometers.</b> The problems envisaged in implementation of the method are also discussed.
