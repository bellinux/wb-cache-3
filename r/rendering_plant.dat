[...] After severe flooding in 1936, B & O Railroad sold the canal to the National Park Service in October 1938. [...] The waterfront area retained its industrial character {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. Georgetown was home to a lumber yard, a cement works, the Washington Flour mill, and a meat <b>rendering</b> <b>plant,</b> with incinerator smokestacks and a power generating plant for the old Capital Traction streetcar system, located at the foot of Wisconsin Avenue, which closed in 1935, and was demolished in October 1968. In 1949, the city constructed the Whitehurst Freeway, an elevated highway above K Street, to allow motorists entering the District over the Key Bridge to bypass Georgetown entirely on their way downtown.|$|E

40|$|Spent {{laying hens}} are {{sometimes}} killed by gas and incinerated, {{due to a}} lack of <b>rendering</b> <b>plants</b> to produce meat and bone meal. An alternative could be to utilize the hens for fertilization purpose. This study was conducted to explore the decomposition of chopped complete hens in soil, and to measure the fertilization effect of residues after hydrolysation of grinded, slaughtered hens. Results are shown in this paper...|$|R

To introduce these synthetic pathways, the selected genes were stepwise integrated {{in the nuclear}} genome of wild-type plants. These plants were transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the binary vectors using the floral dip method. Selection of transformants was conducted using different selection agents and {{the expression of the}} transgenes was confirmed by PCR and enzyme activity measurements...|$|R
50|$|The cattle {{business}} is in trouble. Beef prices have dropped so low, cattle companies are being urged {{to sell their}} stock to a <b>rendering</b> <b>plant.</b> Ben tries to intervene, and eventually learns that banker Parker is colluding with Odell and the plant's owner, Sledge, {{to gain control of}} the ranchers' valuable land.|$|E
50|$|Just {{outside the}} city limits of Union City, Darling International {{operates}} a <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> that it acquired in the 2010 purchase of Griffin Industries, which in turn had acquired Duncan Tankage Corporation in 1988.

40|$|In recent years, {{after the}} bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE, or mad cow disease) crisis in Europe, and after the first case of BSE was found in Alberta, both regulation and producers’ initiatives have lead to an ever smaller demand for meat meal and animal fat used in animal feed. Meat meal and animal fat were produced in great part from the rendering of carcasses, i. e., animals that died on the farm due to disease or accident. In Quebec, agricultural producers used to sell the carcasses to <b>rendering</b> <b>plants.</b> Now however, demand for meat meal and animal fat has all but disappeared, so producers must instead pay the <b>rendering</b> <b>plants</b> {{to dispose of the}} carcasses. The financial burden gives producers an incentive {{to get rid of the}} carcasses in less costly ways, not only by legal burial at the farm, but also by illegal disposal at the farm or elsewhere in nature (Deglise, 2003; Radio-Canada, 2003; Larivière, 2003 a; Mercier, 2004). This leads to increasing environmental risks, specifically, soil, water and air pollution as well as potential health hazards, that need to be addressed.

5000|$|V-plant: The general flow of {{material}} is one-to-many, such as a plant that takes one raw material and can make many final products. Classic examples are meat <b>rendering</b> <b>plants</b> or a steel manufacturer. The primary problem in V-plants is [...] "robbing" [...] where one operation (A) immediately after a diverging point [...] "steals" [...] materials meant for the other operation (B). Once the material has been processed by A, it cannot come back and be run through B without significant rework.|$|R

50|$|A horse <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> {{was built}} on Spectacle Island in 1857, {{followed}} by a city trash incinerator that remained active until 1935. When the incinerator closed, trash was simply dumped on the island for the next thirty years. A bulldozer was supposedly {{swallowed up by the}} trash sometime during the 1950s. The island remained a smelly, leaking dump until the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2012, the Leo Group {{admitted}} breaching out-of-hours restrictions for lorries entering {{and leaving}} its <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> near Denholme. After lengthy court proceedings and an investigation, {{the firm had}} to pay £12,000 to Bradford Council as well as £15,000 {{to act as a}} bond against any future enforcement action by the council. The company admitted eight breaches of planning regulations and received eight formal cautions.|$|E
50|$|In 1918, the Modesto Tallow Company opened along a then-lonely Crows Landing Road. The tallow {{company was}} a <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> that {{processed}} dead animal carcasses and fleshy leftovers (meats, fats, bones) from area restaurants and butchers to make tallow, an important ingredient in animal feed, tooth paste, soap, and glue, among other household products. Since then, the Modesto Tallow Company has ceased operation {{and has been}} torn down.|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of computer generated plants has improved significantly due to {{recent advances in}} both modeling and rendering. In this paper we describe a system that further improves the {{appearance of}} CG plants by including the tiny hairs that cover many plant organs. A plant skeleton is generated using an L−system and graphically interpreted using generalized cylinders. The individual hairs are then mapped onto the surfaces and boundary edges of the mesh. Hair properties are specified and adjusted according to positional information. Sample images included in the paper illustrate the impact of hairs on the appearance of <b>rendered</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
50|$|Agriculture and cattle-raising {{have always}} {{dominated}} the Argentine plains. Leather and beef jerky obtained from <b>rendering</b> <b>plants,</b> or saladeros, were the leading income-producing products {{by the middle}} of the nineteenth century. Saladero Colon, property of Mr. Apolinario BenítezHistory goes that the foundation stone for progress in the area used to be a small saladero -a venue where meat is salted. Due to the various technological advances that reached the meat market in the late nineteenth century, English capital began to be invested and settled at this location to develop this kind of activities. That is how Liebig's Extract of Meat Company came here to stay.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a new representation for modeling and <b>rendering</b> <b>plants</b> and trees. The representation is multiresolution and can be automatically generated and rendered in an efficient way. For the trunk and branches we procedurally build a multiresolution structure that preserves the visual appearance of a tree, when rendered {{at different levels of}} detail. For the leaves we build a hierarchy of images by pre-processing the botanical tree structure. Unlike other representations, the visual quality of our representation does not depend on viewing position and direction. Our models can be applied to any computer graphics area that requires modeling outdoor scenes like interactive walkthroughs and fly-by’s, realistic rendering, simulation and computer games...|$|R
