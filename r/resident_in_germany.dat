Intended {{to serve as a}} liberation force for British-ruled India, it was made up of Indian prisoners of war and expatriates in Europe.

Initially raised as part of the German Army, {{it was part of the}} Waffen-SS from August 1944. Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose initiated the legion's formation, as part of his efforts to win India's independence by waging war against Britain, when he came to Berlin in 1941 seeking German aid. The initial recruits in 1941 were volunteers from the Indian students <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Germany</b> at the time, and a handful of the Indian prisoners of war who had been captured during the North Africa Campaign.

Due to empirical evidence the question posed is to be answered with ?yes?. The second intention {{is to examine the}} reasons for the discontent of <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> East <b>Germany.</b> For this purpose the analysis bases at first on classical economic indicators like the gros domestic product and the income. Secondly socio-economic operating figures like the development of life expectancy and the body size are considered. Third the social capital of a society as a welfare-affecting factor rounds off the analysis.
