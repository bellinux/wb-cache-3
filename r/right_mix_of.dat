Game Informers Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and {{was a place of}} wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it the <b>right</b> <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> creepy and cool, and appreciated the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that pixelated CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the world itself was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of poison gas and electric floors as obstacles.|$|E

500|$|Connery's {{interpretation}} of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version. Connery described Bond as [...] "a complete sensualist—senses highly tuned, awake to everything, quite amoral. I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict". Academic James Chapman observed that for Dr. No, Connery's {{interpretation of}} the character, although not complete, showed the actor [...] "should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero {{in the manner of}} an American leading man". In his second film, From Russia with Love, Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave [...] "a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style". Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery [...] "personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part"; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that [...] "Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema". Black also observed that Connery gave the character a [...] "spare, pared-down character... inner bleakness along with the style". Connery played Bond with [...] "the <b>right</b> <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> cool charisma, violence and arrogance... against which all others are judged". Raymond Benson perceived that Connery [...] "embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character". Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains [...] "an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male". Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that [...] "Sean was Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over—he was rough, tough, mean and witty... he was a bloody good 007". However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery. Christopher Bray says of him that [...] "in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture".|$|E

Since labor costs usually {{account for a}} substantial portion of a healthcare organization’s budget, optimizing the number and types of staff required was often the focus, especially for ACCs, where labor-intensive staff-patient interactions occur. A significant portion of tasks performed by clinical pharmacists might be completed by clinical pharmacist technicians, which are less-expensive resources. While nurse staffing models for a hospital inpatient unit are well established, these models are not readily applicable to staffing ACCs. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework for determining the <b>right</b> staff <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> clinical pharmacists and clinical pharmacy technicians that increases the efficiency of care delivery process and improves the productivity of ACC staff.

Data collected from the ACCs at VA Boston Healthcare System is used to illustrate the FTE calculator and the simulation model.
