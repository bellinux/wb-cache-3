5000|$|Digit {{selectors}} {{were similar}} to emitters, with one exit hub for each cycle point, but they also had an entry hub that was switched to the successive exit hubs as the cycle progressed. A digit selector could be converted to a digit emitter by wiring its entry hub to {{a constant source of}} cycle pulses. But it could also be fed other signals and used to detect a particular digit. Wiring a first <b>read</b> <b>brush</b> to a digit selector's entry and connecting, say, its 4 exit to a pilot selector's D entry would cause that selector to transfer on the next read cycle if a 4 was punched in that first <b>read</b> <b>brush's</b> column.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Read</b> <b>brushes,</b> 80 exit hubs, one {{for each}} card column. A tabulating machine might {{have two or three}} read stations, each with its own set of 80 hubs. A {{reproducing}} punch might have an additional read station after the punch station for verification.|$|R
5000|$|The 533 could punch 100 cards {{per minute}} {{and had a}} set of <b>read</b> <b>brushes</b> {{downstream}} from the punch station {{that were used to}} verify proper punching. The card reader was similar to that on the IBM 402 accounting machine and could read 200 cards per minute. The 533 was controlled by a plugboard control panel, typical of IBM unit record equipment of the time. p. 19 ff ...|$|R
5000|$|Reading {{data from}} the card reader was done in {{real-time}} [...] - [...] each row had to be read as it passed the <b>read</b> <b>brushes,</b> without stopping. Similarly for the card punch; the word for a particular row was prepared in advance {{and had to be}} ready when a given row of the card was in position under the punch knives. The normal mode of reading and punching was binary. Decimal input and output was performed via software.|$|R
50|$|Each {{input card}} was read at two {{successive}} reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card {{could be compared}} with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 <b>read</b> <b>brushes</b> at each <b>read</b> station, one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a colossal}} venture, but it {{suffered}} from the defect from which most big things suffer; it moved slowly. That it also moved steadily was to some extent a consolation to Mr. Scobell. Undoubtedly it would progress quicker and quicker, as time went on, until at length the Casino became a permanent gold mine. But at present it was being conducted at a loss. It was inevitable, but it irked Mr. Scobell. He paced the island and brooded. His mind dwelt incessantly on the problem. Ideas for promoting the prosperity of his nursling came to him at all hours--at meals, in the night watches, when he was shaving, walking, washing, <b>reading,</b> <b>brushing</b> his hair.|$|R
50|$|Cards may be <b>read</b> using {{mechanical}} <b>brushes</b> {{that make}} an electrical contact for a hole, and no contact if no punch, or photoelectric sensors that function similarly. Timing relates the {{signals to the}} position on the card. Cards may be read serially, column by column, or in parallel, row by row.|$|R

Two men stand on the canyon rim in the background looking out into the vast canyon as it spreads out in the distance...|$|R
50|$|In a read station, {{a set of}} 80 {{spring wire}} brushes pressed against the card, one for each column (the 407 read station, {{constructed}} without brushes, held the card stationary and could read a card multiple times, each time generating the same impulses as would be generated by an 80 spring wire station). When a hole passed under the brush, the brush would make contact with a conductive surface beneath the card that was connected to an electrical power source and an electrical pulse, an impulse in IBM terminology, would be generated. Each brush was connected to an individual hub on the control panel, from which it could be wired to another hub, as needed. The action caused by an impulse on a wire depended on when in the cycle it occurred, a simple form of time division multiplexing. Thus an impulse that occurred during 7-time on a wire connected to the column 26 punch magnet would punch a hole in row 7 of column 26. An impulse on the same wire that occurred at 4-time would punch a 4 in column 26. Impulses timed in this way often came from <b>read</b> <b>brushes</b> that detected holes punched in cards as they passed under the brushes, but such pulses were also emitted by other circuits, such as counter outputs. Zone impulses and digit impulses were both needed for alphanumeric printing. They could both be sent on a single wire, then separated out by relay circuits based on the time within a cycle.|$|R
50|$|A {{dispute in}} 1980 {{led to the}} show's cancellation. Ivan Owen aspired to a mid-evening timeslot, which the BBC were unwilling to agree. In 1982 the puppet reappeared on {{television}} in Let's <b>Read</b> With Basil <b>Brush,</b> an infant schools programme on ITV produced by Granada Television. Basil eventually returned to the BBC, as co-host of the long-running children's television series Crackerjack, broadcast at 4:55pm on Fridays, during the 1983-84 season.|$|R

Braille is a tactile written language which is <b>read</b> via touch, <b>brushing</b> the fingers over the raised patterns. Braille technology is the attempt to extend Braille to digital media and developing new tools to aid in the reading of web pages and other electronic devices often involves a combination of haptic and auditory cues.|$|R

She used a combination of techniques to depict bone structure, used stippling and hatching to capture the subject's features, and used a combination of thick and thin paint brush strokes. Her tools included two sizes of needles, for details, and two sizes of <b>brushes.</b> <b>Read</b> also created works using her own aquatint method.|$|R

40|$|Talent is {{an innate}} ability, which {{needs to be}} developed, {{therefore}} a simulative learning environment is of great importance. Lately, {{there has been a}} lot of talk about talented children in different school subjects. Talent is most commonly discussed when talking about art, music, physical education, and mathematics classes, but it is rarely connected to the social studies. This is the reason why this master thesis researches how class teachers adjust the social studies to the talented students in 4. and 5. classes of elementary school. The focus of the research was to establish which characteristics of a talent are recognized by the teachers, how teachers adapt the program to the talented students, which topics and activities are the most stimulating for the talented students, and how they learn at home and prepare themselves for the social studies. The theoretical part of the master thesis focuses on the talented students; i. e. their characteristics, different sorts of talents, where talents come from, detecting and identifying talents, working with talented students in Slovenia, mistakes and dangers with detecting talented students, and talents in the social studies. In the empirical part, qualitative approach and descriptive method were used. To get an insight into methods for working with talented students, interviews were carried out – with four class teachers teaching social studies at the elementary school and with eight students being in a process of identification or already being recognized as talented and who attend social studies. It was expected that the talented students are being treated like the other students who often shape classes and define difficulty level. The results show that teachers indeed do not treat talented students any different than the other students. Students taking part in the survey do co-shape class, but they do not define the difficulty level. There were not established any special adjustments for the talented students. These students normally get additional work but not necessarily at a higher level. Talented students take part in different school competitions and extracurricular activities. For such students which are eager to learn, schools organize camps. The most important topic in the social studies is history. Students have a quiet and permanent place to learn. They are very independent and organized. Most of the students learn for the social studies through <b>reading</b> and <b>brushing</b> up the subject matter. They as well learn a lot by taking part in the class. ...|$|R
40|$|A escovaÃÃo tem um papel importante na etiologia da hipersensibilidade dentinÃria. AbrasÃo pode estar relacionada a abrasivos contidos nos dentifrÃcios. O objetivo deste estudo foi comparar por perfilometria mecÃnica o efeito da abrasÃo da escovaÃÃo com dentifrÃcios clareadores e convencionais na dentina radicular. Noventa espÃcimes de dentina (4 x 4 x 2 mm) foram aleatoriamente divididos em cinco grupos experimentais (n= 18) de acordo com os dentifrÃcios: trÃs clareadores (W 1, W 2, e W 3) e dois convencionais (C 1 e C 2), produzidos por dois fabricantes distintos. Utilizando uma mÃquina de escovaÃÃo, cada espÃcime foi escovado com carga constante de 300 g por 2500 ciclos (4, 5 ciclos por segundo). Os dentifrÃcios foram diluÃdos na proporÃÃo de 1 : 3 em peso (dentifrÃcio/saliva artificial). A ponta diamantada do perfilÃmetro moveu-se em velocidade constante de 0, 05 mm/s com forca de 0, 7 mN. O valor mÃdio das leituras da abrasÃo da escovaÃÃo (&# 956;m; mÃdia Â desvio padrÃo) foi obtido de cinco leituras consecutivas em cada espÃcime: W 1 = 8, 86 Â 1, 58, W 2 = 8, 27 Â 2, 39, W 3 = 7, 59 Â 1, 04, C 1 = 2, 94 Â 1, 29 C 2 = 2, 89 Â 1, 05. Houve diferenÃa estatisticamente significante entre os grupos (ANOVA - p< 0. 0001). O teste de Tukey para mÃltiplas comparaÃÃes mostrou diferenÃas entre todos os dentÃfricios clareadores e os convencionais, mas nÃo entre os clareadores e os convencionais entre si. DentifrÃcios clareadores podem causar mais abrasÃo na dentina do que os convencionais. Toothbrushing {{abrasion}} has {{an important}} role in the etiology of dentine hypersensitivity. The abrasion may be related to the abrasivity of the toothpaste. The aim of this study was to compare by mechanical profilometry the effect of toothbrushing abrasion with whitening and regular toothpastes on root dentine. Ninety dentine specimens (4 x 4 x 2 mm) were randomly divided into five experimental groups (n= 18) according to the toothpaste: three whitening (W 1, W 2 and W 3) and two regular toothpastes (C 1 and C 2), produced by two different manufacturers. Using a brushing machine, each specimen was brushed with constant load of 300 g for 2500 cycles (4. 5 cycles/second). The toothpastes were diluted at a ratio of 1 : 3 w/w (dentifrice/distilled water). The brush diamond tip of the profilometer moved at a constant speed of 0. 05 mm/s with a force of 0. 7 mN. The average <b>reading</b> value of <b>brushing</b> abrasion (&# 956;m; mean Â standard deviation) was obtained from five consecutive measurements of each specimen: W 1 = 8. 86 Â 1. 58, W 2 = 8. 27 Â 2. 39, W 3 = 7. 59 Â 1. 04, R 1 = 2. 94 Â 1. 29 and R 2 = 2. 89 Â 1. 05. There was a significant difference between groups (ANOVA - p< 0. 0001). Post-hoc Tukey test for multiple comparison showed differences between all the whitening toothpastes and the regular ones, but not among the whitening or the regular against each other. Whitening toothpastes can cause more dentine abrasion than the regular ones...|$|R
