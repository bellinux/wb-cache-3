The spatial unit of analysis used is the J-SMSA, the Japanese version of the U. S. Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area.

40|$|Recently {{urban policy}} makers {{have begun to}} make “rightsizing” a watchword for the {{perceived}} mismatch between shrinking city populations, physical and infrastructural plants, and bud gets. Built for a population in some cases over twice that currently within the city limits, shrinking cities now have an unmanageably large array of streets, utilities, public buildings, parks, and housing. “Rightsizing” refers to the yet-unproved process of bringing cities down to a “right” size, meaning a size proportionate to city government’s ability to pay for itself. Rightsizing has thus far come to little in shrinking cities. In the United States, decades of optimistic master plans {{had little or no}} effect in reducing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> <b>loss</b> in deindustrializing cities such as Cleveland, Baltimore, or Philadelphia, all of which lost 25 to 57 percent <b>of</b> their <b>populations</b> between 1950 and 2010.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{examined}} the prognosis for long-term persistence <b>of</b> isolated <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> cut-throat trout Oncorhynchus clarki and {{the feasibility of}} using barriers {{to protect them from}} nonnative salmonids. In so doing, we estimated minimum stream lengths (MSL) required by cutthroat trout <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> varying abundances and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> <b>loss</b> to emigration and mortality. Using 2, 500 individuals (. 75 mm) as the target population size—corresponding to an effective <b>population</b> size, Ne, <b>of</b> 500 —we estimated that more than 8 km of stream were required to maintain a population with high fish abundances (0. 3 fish/m), and 25 km of stream were required to maintain a <b>population</b> <b>of</b> low abundance (0. 1 fish/m). Incorporating a <b>population</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 10 % increased MSL to 9. 3 km for the high and 27. 8 km for the low abundances. Our results suggest that many isolated populations may not persist over the long term because insufficient space exists to maintain the required Ne. Barrier construction to protect cutthroat trout from nonnative salmonids may be a necessary short-term solution, but it involves a long-term risk for maintaining viable cutthroat trout populations. We propose a watershed-based framework for cutthroat trout conservation in the central and southern Rocky Mountains that emphasizes protection <b>of</b> strong core <b>populations.</b> Distribution and abundance of cutthroat trou...|$|R

This rate resolves a major puzzle about the pandemic by indicating that the experience of Japan was similar to that of other parts of Asia. The influenza pandemic of 1918 – 19 caused unprecedented devastation (1); worldwide, it is estimated to have taken 25 – 100 million lives (2, 3), exceeding the combined death toll of both world wars. One of the strangest aspects of the currently held wisdom about the pandemic is the curiously low death rate attributed to Japan compared with other countries in Asia. Official records for Japan put the death toll at 257, 363 persons (4), resulting in a crude influenza-attributable death rate of 0. 47 %. Patterson and Pyle (2) reported 350, 000 deaths, and Johnson and Mueller (3) cited a figure from Palmer and Rice (5) of 388, 000 deaths. Given Japan’s population of> 54 million at the time (6), the influenza-attributable mortality rates (0. 64 %– 0. 71 %) are remarkably low by Asian standards, although they are similar to the rates calculated for the United States, Canada, and western Europe (0. 65 %, 0. 61 %, and ≈ 0. 48 %, respectively) (3). Patterson and Pyle’s (2) conservative estimate of a global rate of 1. 66 % and Johnson and Mueller’s (3) substantial upward revision of that percentage to 2. 77 % suggest that the estimates for Japan, which are less than one quarter of the latter estimate, merit closer scrutiny...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{the impact of the}} {{life-cycle}} dynamics of family composition on the aggregate propensity to save and on the relationship between the latter and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>population,</b> in the hypothesis of life-cycle behaviour. We depart from Modigliani-Brumberg’s basic model by assuming that the household, rather than the individual, is the relevant economic unit. In this framework we point out that in an economy with a steadily growing population the aggregate propensity to save is a function of several demographic parameters and, in particular, of the timing of births (T) and of the number of children generated by each household (f). We then explore the impact of T and f on the co-movements <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>population</b> and <b>of</b> the aggregate propensity to save. We show that, when the change <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>population</b> is brought about by a change of the number of children generated by each household, the aggregate propensity to save and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>population</b> move in the same direction, as suggested by Modigliani-Brumberg, unless the timing of births is very low and the number of children generated by each household relatively high. On the contrary, when the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>population</b> changes because the timing of birth changes, the aggregate propensity to save and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>population</b> move in opposite directions unless the number of children generated by each household is very close to two and therefore the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>population</b> very close to zero...|$|R
