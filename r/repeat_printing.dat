40|$|This Master&rsquo;s {{research}} investigated {{approaches for}} engineering of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> using digital textile printing technology and universally available computer-aided design software. Current practices for alignment of designs in yardage printed fabrics at garment seams are wasteful {{and do not}} allow for mass customisation. This inefficiency can be overcome with engineered digital printing, a method that allows for an integration of prints with garment patterns to generate Ready-to-Print images. Engineered printing offers more cost-effective use of materials, improved visual appearance, potential for mass customisation and more sustainable manufacturing. Still, technical difficulties exist in the integration of prints with garment patterns. As a result, application for apparel is limited to non-repeating prints and one-off fashion show garments. The integration of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> presents even more difficulties. However, the advances in digital printing and computer-aided design technologies call for an examination of possible approaches for achieving improved continuity of a <b>repeating</b> <b>print</b> across a garment. The research used a three-stage mixed method approach. The first qualitative stage examined current practices for design and <b>printing</b> of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints.</b> By undertaking Applied Thematic Analysis, the diversity of meanings assigned to words describing attributes of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> {{as a result of}} historical and current usage were identified and the terminology consolidated. A taxonomy of <b>repeating</b> <b>print</b> attributes was established, with three levels observed: a superordinate level for a surface, a basic for a repeat, and a subordinate for a motif. Quantifiable attributes of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> were assigned to each level. The analysis also suggested three potential directions for engineered repeating prints: Modularity Design, Flexible Tiling and Distortion. The second quantitative stage evaluated suggested design directions in four experimental studies: one for each of the directions and a final study combining all three directions to engineer <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> for a graded garment. Practical computer-aided design techniques, based on accessible Adobe software tools, were developed for integration of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> with garment patterns. The techniques were then tested in comparison with mainstream printing practices. In each experiment, <b>repeating</b> <b>print</b> attributes were examined for their impact on the adaptability of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> for engineered printing. All three directions were validated as suitable for engineering of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints.</b> Statistical analyses revealed relationships between <b>repeating</b> <b>print</b> attributes and their impact on the adaptability of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> for the engineered printing method. The final stage analysed the combined results of the previous two stages. Existing computer- aided design solutions were found to offer opportunities regarding their ability to be integrated into current digital production for innovative and sustainable engineered printing. While the suggested techniques require knowledge of more advanced dynamic editing tools, the research highlights the benefits for both fashion and textile designers to utilise such tools in order to fully embrace the potential digital printing technology has to offer. The research also highlights the need for dedicated software solutions for integration of <b>repeating</b> <b>prints</b> with garment patterns. The findings on the impact of <b>repeating</b> <b>print</b> attributes on the adaptability for engineered printing can help in the development of dedicated software...|$|R

40|$|Two com. {{thermoplastic}} {{block copolymer}} elastomers {{with a high}} stiffness were investigated as stamp materials for microcontact printing and compared to conventional poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Stamps with a relief structure were produced by hot embossing techniques, utilizing the thermoplastic properties of these rubberlike block copolymers. It is shown that the stamps based on these copolymers are able to transfer a thiol ink to a gold substrate. After printing, the thiol ink acts as an etch resist, which indicates that a coherent self-assembled monolayer is formed. Like PDMS stamps, specific copolymer stamps {{can be used for}} <b>repeated</b> <b>printing</b> without re-inking. Moreover, the higher stiffness of the thermoplastic stamps increases the load above which structural collapse occurs by a factor of 10 - 15 in comparison to that of identical PDMS stamps, which is potentially useful in the reprodn. of structures which are sensitive to sagging, buckling, or pairing.

60|$|Measurements.--It {{has been}} already shown that when both plots are present (Plate 4, Fig. 8, ~4~), they form the termini of a base line, from which {{any part of}} the pattern may be triangulated, as {{surveyors}} would say. Also, that when only one plot exists (~3~), and the pattern has an axis (which it necessarily has in all ordinary ii and oo cases), a perpendicular can be let fall upon that axis, whose intersection with it will serve as a second point of reference. But our methods must not be too refined. The centres of the plots are not determinable with real exactness, and <b>repeated</b> <b>prints</b> from so soft a substance as flesh are often somewhat dissimilar, the one being more or less broadened out than the other, owing to unequal pressure. It is therefore well to use such other more convenient points of reference as the particular pattern may present. In loops, the intersection of the axis with the summit of the innermost bend, whether it be a staple or the envelope to a rod (Fig. 14, second and third rows of diagrams), is a well-defined position. In spirals, the centre of the pattern is fairly well defined; also a perpendicular erected {{from the middle of the}} base to the outline above and below (Fig. 8, ~4~) is precise and convenient.|$|R

50|$|In 1298, Wang Zhen (ÁéãÁ•Ø/ÁéãÁ¶é), a Yuan dynasty {{governmental}} {{official of}} Jingde County, Anhui Province, China, re-invented {{a method of}} making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of Records of Jingde County („ÄäÊóåÂæ∑ÂéøÂøó„Äã), a book of more than 60,000 Chinese characters. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, <b>repeated</b> <b>printing</b> wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored. The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper. In 1322Ôºåa Fenghua county officer Ma Chengde (È©¨Áß∞Âæ∑) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed the 43-volume Daxue Yanyi („ÄäÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ë°ç‰πâ„Äã).

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model of coffee {{consumption in the}} U. K. is proposed, which is estimated and {{used to examine the}} influence of habit formation and advertising in the period 1957 - 80. This work challenges both the assumption of symmetrical consumer response and the statistical source for measuring coffee consumption. The model allows for asymmetrical consumer reactions. Explanatory variables are: price of coffee and of tea, income, advertising and the strength of the coffee drinking habit. This work is original in terms of interpreting and quantifying product field advertising and habit formation; and for allowing a minimal threshold level of predictors. Mistakes, <b>repeated</b> <b>printing</b> errors and unpublished changes in definitions were found in the statistics of domestic coffee supplies 0 Household coffee purchases estimated by the National Food Survey (N. F. S.) are consistently over-reported. Causes investigated provide grounds for correcting estimates by pooling N. F. S. with Family Expenditure Survey; the result is consistent with adjusted supplies. Advertising effect on demand is separated into two aspects. The first action increases sales by attracting new buyers, while protecting consumers from competitors' propaganda. The second action increases sales to habitual customers, while manufacturers are competing through advertising for a larger brand share. The transmission medium is a factor in both effects. The strength of the habit shifts market demand function. A routine way of thinking prevails under stationary conditions; yet shifts in the function occur in a non-stationary situation which initiates the problem-solving way of thinking. In the model, addiction can be either absolute or relative to changes in other factors. All the evidence supports the general model proposed, which shows that a non-symmetrical functional effect prevails and demonstrates the existence of an adjustment period. Irrefutably, coffee consumption depends on former consumption levels, coffee price, price-ratio tea to coffee, income and advertising...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignMinyoung SuhThe {{purpose of}} this study was to explore printed antennas as an {{alternative}} technique for applying hyperthermia treatment. The antenna consisted of a printed ground plane and a thin copper plate. The ground plane was made of silver conductive ink printed on a flexible substrate. The challenge of the printed ground plane was limited conductivity. Multi-layer printing was one of the ways to increase the conductivity of the printed trace. This study examined whether the multiple-layered printings on the ground plane influence the performance of the antenna. The ground plane printed on a flexible substrate was evaluated for its conductivity and capacity to handle the heat energy for the extended time duration at the elevated temperature. This research was conducted in two experimental stages. The first stage of the experiment was designed to test conductivity of the ground plane. Ground planes were printed on a 32. 5 mm √ó 17. 0 mm substrate. The thickness and resistance of up to five layers of conductive printing were tested to verify how <b>repeated</b> <b>printing</b> improved the resistance and resistivity. Results showed that the multi-layering technique reduced the resistance of the printed trace, but statistically, the ground plane had no significant improvement in resistance beyond the triple layer printing. With an increase of the thickness, resistivity rather increased after the triple layer printing. The second stage of the experiment was used to assess the performance of the entire antenna. Antennas were fabricated using ground planes with triple and quintuple layers based on resistance and resistivity measurements. The antennas showed an acceptable level of performance in terms of antenna return loss and temperature elevation. The statistical analysis of return loss, power handling capability over the time, and temperature elevation was not significant among the antennas with triple and quintuple layered ground planes. Antennas were able to achieve 42 ÀöC within 10 minutes at a 2 cm deep location with the return loss of - 13. 76 dB. Most importantly, experimental results showed that antennas were able to handle 15 watt power without degrading the antenna performance.
