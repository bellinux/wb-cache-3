Today, the prospect of membership for 34 countries (including here Turkey and Western Balkans) draws attention even more and start an important debate related with the values of EU. This paper address the current EU agenda on enlargement and also the historical and theoretical perspectives of the process {{in order to understand}} better the position on Turkey. It argues that with Turkey’s accession EU will expend for the first time outside the Europe’s geographical borders and by this will open the door for other non European countries. Based on this, Turkey is presented as a particular case with a big importance for the future of this policy and even for the EU’s future in general.

A similar system is used in Greece, Russia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine. Regions are as per ISO 3166-2:BG. The new 1992 issue of plates used a white background, in the format [...] "X(X) NNNN Y". All former yellow background plates became invalid.

During the mid-1990s, the [...] "X NNNN Y" [...] combinations began to run out in many provinces (as there were only 90,000 possible combinations), and so a second letter was added to the series. Between 2000-2008, the left-hand blue band Bulgaria flag was phased in, eventually becoming a legal requirement on 1 July 2006. These plates were all in the [...] "X(X) NNNN YY" [...] format, but the shape of the letters was changed to the current standard - namely, the letters were made more [...] "square" [...] and heavier-set than previously. These plates all began with the series [...] "AA", thereby repeating some combinations that had already existed before, albeit without the EU strip.

40|$|With the {{continued}} documentation of a persistent hostile or chilly climate {{for women in}} academe (Blum, 1991; Cooper, 2002; Curtis, 2005; Glazer-Raymo, 1999), questions arise about whether women faculty can find a home or welcome ground, both in the United States {{and around the world}} (Caplan, 1993; Cooper, Benham, Collay, Martinez-Aleman, & Scherr, 1999). The literature identifies a number of differing ways of viewing the academy as home. For example, Jane Roland Martin (2000) refers to the academy as "the home of thought" (p. 41). In discussing this concept, many women academics talk about finding or forging, if not a home, then welcome ground or a neighborhood. Whatever the term, the connotation is one of a place that is friendly, rather than hostile; one that counters the chilly climate image that Sandler and Hall (1986) have written about. This article explores the question of finding a home or welcome ground by asking if these concepts are relevant both in the new millennium and in the international arena. We examine the experiences of women academics in three countries: the United States (US), Aotearoa/New Zealand (NZ), and <b>Romania</b> (<b>Ro).</b> We build on the recent exploration of US women's efforts to find or forge a home (Cooper, Ortiz, Benham, & Scherr, 2002; Cooper, et al., 1999), and explore this concept in three countries that are geographically distant from one another. They are vastly different in size, from the giant United States to the tiny New Zealand, as well as culturally, politically, and economically different. We share the stories of twelve women, four each from the US, NZ, and Romania. Because experiences are embedded in the particular socio-cultural, political conditions of the individual country, the next section will describe existing research about women's experiences in each country...|$|E
40|$|Low-input {{and organic}} dairy systems {{are known to}} be managed {{differently}} than intensive and conventional production units. Especially pasture-based systems are perceived as more animal friendly, but only limited information is available on the welfare of dairy cows in low-input systems. In recent years, comprehensive, mostly animal-based on-farm welfare assessment systems have been developed. For example, the Welfare Quality® (WQ) assessment protocol combines a range of animal-based measures and information on management and resources. Ten low-input and/or organic dairy farms each in Northern Ireland (NI), <b>Romania</b> (<b>RO)</b> and Spain (SP) were assessed in the late winter and early spring of 2013 using the WQ assessment system. Scores for twelve WQ criteria and four WQ principles were calculated from the measures according to the WQ protocol. They may range from 0 - 100 (poor-good, with a score of 50 indicating a somewhat ‘neutral’ situation). For the identification of welfare problems, we applied a threshold of 40. In five out of the 12 criteria the average score was below 40 in at least one country; at the principle level this was the case for 2 principles. The average principle scores for 'Good Housing' all exceeded the threshold of 40, but the criterion ‘Comfort around resting’ (referring to lying down movement and cleanliness of the animals) scored lowest in NI. The principle ‘Good Health’ scored rather low in all production systems, but especially in farms in Spain. In all countries, the threshold was exceeded for the ‘Appropriate behaviour’ principle. In conclusion, across the production systems investigated the presence of injuries in the cows may be regarded a general welfare problem. Furthermore, ‘Comfort around resting’ and ‘Absence of pain induced by management procedures’ were identified as unsatisfactory in at least two countries. ‘Thermal comfort’, ‘Ease of movement’, ‘Absence of disease’ as well as most of the criteria related to ‘Appropriate behaviour’ may be considered at least acceptable. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore data from the DEMOCOPHES study {{population}} for Romania, Portugal and Poland, in order to assess smoking patterns and the extent of ETS exposure and compare the national study samples with reference to the respective anti-smoking laws. The subset of the DEMOCOPHES study sample consisted of 360 children and their mothers (120 in each of the three countries - <b>Romania</b> (<b>RO),</b> Portugal (PT) and Poland (PL). Smoking was assessed using a detailed questionnaire for the participants, which addresses both active and passive smoking. This assessment uses exposure-relevant questionnaire data, in particular on the home environment and residence, socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle such as nutrition, smoking behavior, other exposure-relevant behavior and occupational history, as well as urinary cotinine and creatinine measurements. We performed general statistical analysis and innovative receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Smoking prevalence as evaluated by the questionnaire was generally high, and higher than official statistics, which suggests some under-reporting in the countries, particularly in Romania. Urinary cotinine levels provided biochemical confirmation of the high and similar smoking prevalence for the three countries. Concerning ETS exposure, Romania presented significantly higher levels, for children as well as for non-smoking mothers, with Portugal showing significantly lower levels. Compared to non-smoking mothers, the children showed relatively higher ETS exposure levels in all three countries. The established country-specific optimal cut-off values in urinary cotinine to distinguish smokers from non-smokers vary more than those to discriminate ETS exposure extent in non-smoking mothers and children. Although different between countries, these values are a valuable output to monitor effectiveness of both national antismoking laws and educational programs in the three countries. The findings of this study point to the urgent need for stronger, more effective and well enforced smoke-free legislation in the three countries. DEMOCOPHES received funding through the LIFE þ financial instrument of the European Commision (DGENV), as well as through funding received from different national institutions of the DEMOCOPHES countries ([URL] cophes/project-partners) ...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{education}} system occupies {{a special place}} in the policy of each nation. Regardless of geographical location, socio-economic or cultural differences, the need to improve the education offered for population by facilitating access to higher education becomes more and more important. Providing a suitable framework for the personal development of each student is expensive and involves high amounts of money. From the analyses carried out we couldn't identify the substantial differences between the way it is structured and organized {{education system}} worldwide. However, we were able to identify a number of common elements that create a global University System. The need to invest in human resources through structural reforms in each country is present, and therefore a higher indention to pay greater attention {{to the development of the}} higher education system. In our work we decided to analyze education systems in countries like United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (GB), China (CHN), Germany (DE), France (FR), Russian Federation (RU), Japan (JPN) average values recorded for EU- 27 and last but not least <b>Romania</b> (<b>RO).</b> Although the investment in the University system is hard to quantify, it is unanimously acknowledged that a country can achieve a competitive advantage in international relations through a very well prepared and trained personnel. The countries reviewed in this paper have different policies when it comes to financial support of the University System. If Germany and France have decided to get involved directly in supporting the system by allocating the necessary funds from the State budget, another European country, the United Kingdom, decided to apply a policy diametrically opposite, similar to that existing in the USA and cover in a lesser degree the needs of universities in Government funds. Regardless of the policy adopted the results are intended to be the same: facilitating access to university education, a high quality of teaching and research process, greater mobility among teachers and students and last but not least, scientific and academic recognition worldwide. However, these reforms, even if they are creating value in an initial stage, over the long term can negatively affect the social situation of the country...|$|E
