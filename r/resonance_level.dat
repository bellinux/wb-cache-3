We study this effect, considering a <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> with time-dependent energy coupled to particle states in the Fermi sea. We find that, as the <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> is driven through the Fermi-level, particle-hole excitations can be suppressed for certain driving protocols. In particular, such noiseless transfer occurs if the level moves with constant rapidity, its energy changing linearly with time.

At least thirty-eight resonances were observed. Resonance energies and strengths are presented. At nine resonances angular distribution measurements lead to unique values of the spin of the <b>resonance</b> <b>level.</b> In two of these cases the parity of the <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> was also determined. In two other cases the angular distribution left two possibilities for the resonance spin. Angular distributions at ten other resonances could not be treated with a single level analysis...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the recent}} paper (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 216803, (2009)), we study the nonequilibrium {{occupation}} number and charge susceptibility of a <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> close to a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type between a de-localized phase for weak dissipation and a localized phase for strong dissipation. The <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> is coupled to two spinless fermionic baths with a finite bias voltage and an Ohmic bosonic bath representing the dissipative environment. The system is equivalent to an effective anisotropic Kondo model out of equilibrium. Within the nonequilibrium Renormalization Group (RG) approach, we calculate nonequilibrium magnetization and spin susceptibility in the effective Kondo model, corresponding to occupation number and charge susceptibility of a <b>resonance</b> <b>level,</b> respectively. We demonstrate the smearing of the KT transition in the nonequilibrium magnetization {{as a function of}} the effective anisotropic Kondo couplings, in contrast to a perfect jump in magnetization at the transition in equilibrium. In the limit of large bias voltages, we find both quantities at the KT transition and in the localized phase show deviations from the equilibrium Curie-law behavior. As the system gets deeper in the localized phase, both quantities decrease more rapidly to zero with increasing bias voltages. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{rise time}} of stellar x-ray bursts is a {{signature}} of thermonuclear runaway {{processes in the}} atmosphere of neutron stars and is highly sensitive {{to a series of}} (alpha, p) reactions via high-lying resonances in sd-shell nuclei. Lacking data for the relevant <b>resonance</b> <b>levels,</b> the stellar reaction rates have been calculated using statistical, Hauser-Feshbach models, assuming a high-level density. This assumption may not be correct in view of the selectivity of the (alpha, p) reaction to natural parity states. We measured the Si- 28 (p,t) Si- 26 reaction with a high-resolution spectrometer to identify <b>resonance</b> <b>levels</b> in Si- 26 above the alpha-emission threshold at 9. 164 MeV excitation energy.

40|$|Coherent {{electron}} transfer from a localized state {{trapped in a}} quantum dot into a ballistic conductor, taking place in on-demand electron sources, in general may result in excitation of particle-hole pairs. We consider a simple model for these effects, involving a <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> with time-dependent energy, and derive Floquet scattering matrix describing inelastic transitions of particles in the Fermi sea. We find that, as the <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> is driven through the Fermi level, particle transfer may take place completely without particle-hole excitations for certain driving protocols. In particular, such noiseless transfer occurs when the level moves with constant rapidity, its energy changing linearly with time. A detection scheme for studying the coherence of particle transfer is proposed. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures. Updated introduction, Fig. 1, and reference...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the excitation and ionization of dense Ba vapour (1019 to 2021 m- 3) by resonant (λ = 553. 5 nm) laser radiation {{and discuss the}} processes responsible for the transfer of energy from the laser-excited atoms into ionization. Ionization {{was found to be}} density-dependent and this pointed to collision-dominated ionization mechanisms. It has been established that seed electrons were heated in superelastic collisions with laser-excited atoms, and that subsequent electron-impact excitation and ionization - as well as photoionization of high-lying levels - lead to the creation of more electrons. The observed transfer of the excitation energy to the electrons by superelastic collisions requires contributions not only from the laser-pumped <b>resonance</b> <b>level,</b> but also from the lower-lying metastable Ba levels.

The total widths of a few <b>resonance</b> <b>levels</b> as obtained from yield measurement with a very thin target are compared {{with the results of}} elastic proton scattering.

40|$|Recently {{the authors}} {{developed}} a scattering approach {{that allows for}} a complete description of the steady-state physics of quantum-impurities {{in and out of}} equilibrium. Quantum impurities are described using scattering eigenstates defined ab initio on the open, infinite line with asymptotic boundary conditions imposed by the leads. The scattering states on the open line are constructed for integrable quantum-impurity models by means of a significant generalization of the Bethe-Ansatz which we call the Scattering Bethe-Ansatz (SBA). The purpose of the paper is to present in detail the scattering approach to quantum-impurity models and the SBA and show that they reproduce well-known thermodynamic results for several widely studied models: the <b>Resonance</b> <b>Level</b> model, Interacting <b>Resonance</b> <b>Level</b> model and the Kondo model. Though the SBA is more complex than the traditional Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) when applied to thermodynamical questions, the scattering approach (SBA) allows access to an array of new questions that cannot be addressed otherwise, ranging from scattering of electrons off magnetic impurities to nonequilibrium dynamics.

Introducing a generalization of the equilibrium Bethe-Ansatz - the Nonequilibrium Bethe-Ansatz (NEBA), we explicitly construct the scattering eigenstates for the Interacting <b>Resonance</b> <b>Level</b> model and derive exact, nonperturbative results for the steady-state properties of the system.

40|$|The {{experimental}} conditions are discussed for {{the observation of}} reactions proceeding through narrow isolated resonances. This includes a survey of gamma-ray resonant scattering or absorption techniques, making use of accelerator produced radiation. This general introduction is followed by some examples of recent Utrecht work on resonance reactions. The 23 Na(p,γ) 24 Mg reaction has been investigated at six <b>resonance</b> <b>levels</b> in the Ep = 300 – 800 keV region. The gamma-ray branching has been determined of these levels and of twelve lower levels in 24 Mg. Gamma-ray angular distributions have been measured at nine resonances in the 24 Mg(α,γ) 28 Si reaction, from which resonance spins and parities can be determined in a unique way. Isotopic spin selection rules explain the relative weakness of observed E 1 and M 1 transitions compared to E 2 transitions. From yield measurements in the 27 Al(p,γ) 28 Si, 27 Al(p,α) 24 Mg, and 24 Mg(α,γ) 28 Si reactions the partial widths have been obtained for the decay of the relevant 28 Si <b>resonance</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of topological band insulators, the topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) have also been theoretically predicted. The latter has ignited revival interest in the properties of Kondo insulators. Currently, the feasibility of topological nature in SmB$_ 6 $ has been intensively analyzed by several complementary probes. Here by starting with a minimal-orbital Anderson lattice model, we explore the local electronic structure in a Kondo insulator. We show {{for the first time}} that the two strong topological regimes sandwiching the weak topological regime give rise to a single Dirac cone, which is located near the center or corner of the surface Brillouin zone. We further find that, when a single impurity is placed on the surface, low-energy resonance states are induced in the weak scattering limit for the strong TKI regimes and the <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> moves monotonically across the hybridization gap with the strength of impurity scattering potential; while low energy states can only be induced in the unitary scattering limit for the weak TKI regime, where the <b>resonance</b> <b>level</b> moves universally toward the center of the hybridization gap.
