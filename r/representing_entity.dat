500|$|The name Pura Raza Española (PRE), {{translated}} as [...] "Pure Spanish Horse," [...] {{is the term}} used by the ANCCE, a private organization, and the Ministry of Agriculture of Spain. The ANCCE uses neither the term [...] "Andalusian" [...] nor [...] "Iberian horse", and only registers horses that have certain recognized bloodlines. In addition, all breeding stock must undergo an evaluation process. The ANCCE was founded in 1972. Spain's Ministry of Agriculture recognizes the ANCCE as the <b>representing</b> <b>entity</b> for PRE breeders and owners across the globe, {{as well as the}} administrator of the breed stud book. ANCCE functions as the international parent association for all breeders worldwide who record their horses as PRE. For example, the United States PRE association is affiliated with ANCCE, follows ANCCE rules, and has a wholly separate governance system from the IALHA.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{presents}} {{a sketch of}} a theory of intentionality introducing special entities called intentional objects {{which can be found}} in the works of Franz Brentano and Roman Ingarden. Nowadays the philosophers that are sympathetic to intentional objects are accused of planting an ontological jungle. All the problems of the theory of intentionality, it is claimed, can be resolved within the framework of a theory assuming a much more parsimonious ontology, like the adverbial theory, a version of which is typically associated with Chisholm. However, he shows that this competitor of the theory of intentional objects faces serious difficulties. The most serious of them is that within the framework of the adverbial theory the relation between the <b>representing</b> <b>entity</b> ('adverbially specified' mental property of the subject) and the external target object has to be construed as primitive, while in the theory of intentional objects it can be easily defined. The consequence is that within the framework of the adverbial theory we are forced to require a distinguished kind of epistemic access not only to the <b>representing</b> <b>entity</b> but also to this 'representing relation'. This consequence, which is very seldom made explicit, seems indeed to be fatal. Intentional objects appear in this light not as products of an ontological extravagance but instead as entities that are indispensable, if we are to be able to explain the phenomenon of intentionality at all.

How-ever, few of the methods pay attention to non-entity words and clicked websites in queries, which also help conveying user intent. In this paper, we tackle the prob-lem of intent understanding with innova-tively <b>representing</b> <b>entity</b> words, refiners and clicked urls as intent topics in a uni-fied knowledge graph based framework, {{in a way to}} exploit and expand knowl-edge graph which we call ‘tailor’. We collaboratively exploit global knowledge in knowledge graphs and local contexts in query log to initialize intent representa-tion, then propagate the enriched features in a graph consisting of intent topics us-ing an unsupervised algorithm. The ex-periments prove intent topics with knowl-edge graph enriched features significantly enhance intent understanding. ...|$|E

40|$|Authority {{control has}} long been used in library {{catalogue}} systems to handle the problem of ambiguous identifiers for entities, especially authors. With electronic and networked collections the need for authority control is only increased, and made more important {{by the possibility of}} extending defined entities to cover the content of full-text collections. The Entity Authority Tool Set (EATS) is a web application for recording, editing, and using authority information about entities. EATS was developed at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) and is now used to manage the 30, 000 + entities represented in the NZETC online collection of signi cant New Zealand and Pacific Island texts. This paper sets out the requirements for an entity authority system and makes the case that no existing system suits all of those needs. It presents the EATS model for <b>representing</b> <b>entity</b> authority information, and describes the NZETC implementation of the model along with associated tools...|$|E
40|$|The {{extended}} {{entity relationship}} model (EERM) attempts to capture more semantic detail than is otherwise {{possible in the}} standard entity relationship model. In particular, the specialisation hierarchy, which is conceptually similar to the Object Oriented notion of inheritance, is a construct used in EERM for <b>representing</b> <b>entity</b> supertypes and subtypes. Grouping entities into various types based on the generic and unique characteristics they contain, affords the benefit of avoiding null values in the resulting table structures. The approach also allows relationships that are unique to a particular subtype to be modelled. However, it is the author’s experience that while many course texts provide examples of how these specialisation hierarchies can be logically modelled, little is said on {{how they can be}} implemented within relational databases. A technique that has been used with second year IT degree students to map specialisation hierarchies to the internal model of a relational DBMS will be presented...|$|E

5000|$|In computing, an {{object-oriented}} {{user interface}} (OOUI) {{is a type}} of user interface based on an object-oriented programming metaphor. In an OOUI, the user interacts explicitly with objects that <b>represent</b> <b>entities</b> in the domain that the application is concerned with. Many vector drawing applications, for example, have an OOUI - the objects being lines, circles and canvases. The user may explicitly select an object, alter its properties (such as size or colour), or invoke other actions upon it (such as to move, copy, or re-align it). If a business application has any OOUI, the user may be selecting and/or invoking actions on objects <b>representing</b> <b>entities</b> in the business domain such as customers, products or orders.|$|R

40|$|An {{architecture}} that supports context-aware service {{provision in the}} All-IP network is proposed and analyzed. The main goal of this architecture is to provide representation of a nomadic user in each visited computing and communication environment so that his services are tailored to his preferences and needs. The user <b>representing</b> <b>entity</b> collects context information that pertains to the interactions between the user and his services in the current environment. The collected information is fed to the services along with any relevant preferences defined in the user profile. The services use the received information in order to adapt to their context. Actors in this architecture such as the users, the network providers and the service providers are represented by software agents, which exchange context information. A nomadic user is represented by a mobile agent, which follows him wherever he may roam. User agent mobility management is carried out {{by means of the}} cooperation of agents that belong to the network providers of the visited environments, and their interaction with the Mobile IP protocol that is used for terminal mobility in All-IP networks...|$|E

40|$|Graphs are {{commonly}} used to model relations in computer systems. Nodes are used to <b>represent</b> <b>entities</b> in an application, and edges <b>represent</b> relationships between <b>entities.</b> Many graph based applications need to provide user interfaces for the user to create and edit graphs depicted as diagrams. The underlying graph model should be powerful enough to represent {{a wide range of}} applications yet simple enough to enable good layout. In this paper we propose a new model: cigraphs. In a cigraph, each node may consist of a (sub) cigraph. Layout functions are assigned to nodes (that is, to sub-cigraphs) in an object-oriented fashion; this allows considerable user control of layout. Keywords: graph, graph drawing, formalism, cigraph, user interface. 1 Introduction Diagrams of graphs have been widely used in human-computer interaction. A graph is a set of nodes and edges.

LeadLine [17] is an interactive visual analytics system that supports the exploration of events detected automatically from news and social media. The LeadLine system extracts places mentioned in messages to identify where a piece of news was relevant. Event Registry [49] {{is a system that}} monitors media sources to detect news events in more than ten languages. It also presents a map visualization that displays each event as a bubble over the location where it happened. Our approach complements these systems by leveraging event information and the impact that its information had in social media.|$|R
