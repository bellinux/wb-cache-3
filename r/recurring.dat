40|$|Silicone rod is a {{commonly}} used synthetic suspension material in frontalis suspension surgery to correct blepharoptosis. The most challenging problem and a decisive drawback {{of the use}} of silicone rod is a considerable rate of ptosis recurrence after surgery. We examined patients with <b>recurred</b> ptosis and assessed the physical and micromorphological properties of implanted silicone rods to determine the causative mechanisms of <b>recurred</b> ptosis after frontalis suspension using silicone rod. This is a prospective observational case series of 22 pediatric patients with <b>recurred</b> ptosis after frontalis suspension using silicone rods for congenital ptosis. Implanted silicone rods were observed and removed during the operation for correction of <b>recurred</b> ptosis. The removed silicone rods were physically and micromorphologically evaluated to determine the cause of recurrence. Pretarsal fixation positions migrated upward, whereas suprabrow fixation positions migrated downward during ptosis recurrence. The breaking strength of implanted silicone rods was reduced by approximately 50 % during 3 years. Cracks, debris, and loss of homogenous structure with disintegration were observed on scanning electron micrographs of implanted silicone rods in patients with <b>recurred</b> ptosis. Preoperative severe degree of ptosis also contributed to <b>recurred</b> ptosis. Recurrence of ptosis after frontalis suspension using silicone rod was associated with physical changes of implanted silicone rods, including positional migration, weakened tensile strength, and micromorphological changes in combination with patients' characteristics...|$|R
