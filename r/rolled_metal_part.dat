40|$|Fixing {{hardware}} made of carbon, high-carbon, and alloyed wires {{is one of}} {{the widespread}} critical parts in mechanical engineering. The characteristics of fixtures and fasteners and their performance figures are assessed at all stages of steel-making operation, from the choice of burden stock for metal smelting to the method of preparing calibrated <b>rolled</b> <b>metal</b> <b>parts</b> and upsetting end products. Material used for producing long high-duty bolts must be both sufficiently strong and ductile, have homogeneous mechanical properties and chemistry, and no inner or surface defects. When manufacturing fasteners, hot-rolled metal is often plastically deformed by drafting before cold upsetting, and all unacceptable defects are removed by the expensive procedure of lathe-turning. Moreover, this technology of metal processing entails losses of up to 5. 5 % in chips. This paper suggests a resource-efficient and environmentally friendlier fabrication method for calibrated <b>rolled</b> <b>metal</b> items made of steel 38 XA, 9. 65 mm diameter, for cold die-forging of high-duty bolts used in automotive engines, which helps spare expensive lathe-machining processes. Moreover, rolled steel produced using this technology is characterized by high resistance to plastic deformation when cold, which leads to increase n wear-resistance of tools in cold die-forging of bolts...|$|R

50|$|Micro-blinds—currently under {{development}} at the National Research Council (Canada)—control the amount of light passing through in response to applied voltage. Micro-blinds are composed of <b>rolled</b> thin <b>metal</b> blinds on glass. They are very small and thus practically invisible to the eye. The metal layer is deposited by magnetron sputtering and patterned by laser or lithography process. The glass substrate includes {{a thin layer of}} a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer. A thin insulator is deposited between the <b>rolled</b> <b>metal</b> layer and the TCO layer for electrical disconnection. With no applied voltage, the micro-blinds are rolled and let light pass through. When there is a potential difference between the <b>rolled</b> <b>metal</b> layer and the transparent conductive layer, the electric field formed between the two electrodes causes the rolled micro-blinds to stretch out and thus block light. The micro-blinds have several advantages, including switching speed (milliseconds), UV durability, customized appearance and transmission. Theoretically, the blinds are simple and cost-effective to fabricate.A video available on YouTube describes briefly the micro-blinds.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the number of three-dimensional (3 D) models each year, to quickly and easily find the part desired has become a big challenge of enterprises. Meanwhile, many methods and algorithms have been proposed for part retrieval. However, most of the existing methods are designed for mechanical parts, and can not be well worked for sheet <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> retrieval. An approach to feature-based retrieval of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>parts</b> is presented. Firstly, the features frequently used in sheet <b>metal</b> <b>part</b> design are chosen as the “key words” in retrieval. Based on those features, a relative position model is built to express the different relationships of the features in 3 D space. Secondly, a description method of the model is studied. With the description method the relative position of features in sheet <b>metal</b> <b>parts</b> can be expressed by four location description matrices. Thirdly, based on the relative position model and location description matrices, the equivalent definition of relationships of two feature groups is given which is the basis to calculate the similarity of two sheet <b>metal</b> <b>parts.</b> Next, the formula of retrieval algorithm for sheet <b>metal</b> <b>parts</b> is given. Finally, a prototype system is developed to test and verify the effectiveness of the retrieval method suggested.
