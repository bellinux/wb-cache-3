40|$|Abstract. The <b>ring-test</b> {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the plastic shrinkage crack tendency of paste specimen added with silica fume in this investigation. Silica fume was used as a partial replacement by weight of cement from 0 % to 30 %. The compressive strength and drying shrinkage were also examined. The test results show that the addition of SF (up to 30 %) increases the compressive strength of paste. No significant influence of silica fume was found on the drying shrinkage of paste. The crack index is significantly increased in the paste specimen added with 10 % and 20 % replacement. This shows that the addition of SF increases the plastic shrinkage cracking tendency of paste. Using the <b>ring-test</b> method to detect the plastic shrinkage cracking of SF paste can provide more accurate measurements, which is helpful to understand the plastic shrinkage crack tendency of paste added with SF...|$|E

The objective {{of the study was}} to establish a standardised method which allows the impact of chemical stressors on terrestrial compartments at ecosystem level to be investigated and possible uses of such data in existing Environmental Risk Assessments (ERAs) for chemicals to be evaluated. This issue of Ecotoxicology presents in a series of papers the results of the TME <b>ring-test</b> and field-validation study. Additionally, results derived from an open-homogeneous terrestrial microcosm (Integrated Soil Microcosm, ISM) are included in this series as a separate paper. In this first paper of the series background information on the planning and organisation of the study are given. The conceptual approach and the design of the study with TMEs are briefly outlined, based on the scientific discussion on the use of terrestrial microcosms in ecology and applied environmental sciences during the last 25 years. Further, some suggestions are presented on the selection of measurement endpoints to quantify structural and functional aspects of terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the main results of the TME-study are summarised and conclusions are drawn on the technical feasibility of TMEs, their comparability with field studies and the potential use of TMEs in ERA.

In this paper, we summarize the standard draft protocol for a reproduction test with this species, and present inter-comparison results obtained in a 56 -day prevalidation <b>ring-test</b> using this protocol. Seven European laboratories performed semi-static tests with cultured snails of the strain Renilys (R) exposed to nominal concentrations of cadmium chloride (from 53 to 608 mu g Cd L- 1). Cd concentrations in test solutions were analytically determined to confirm accuracy in the metal exposure concentrations in all laboratories. Physico-chemical and biological validity criteria (namely dissolved oxygen content > 60 % ASV, water temperature 20 ± 1 degrees C, control snail survival > 80 % and control snail fecundity > 8 egg-masses per snail over the test period) were met in all laboratories which consistently demonstrated the reproductive toxicity of Cd in snails using the proposed draft protocol. Effect concentrations for fecundity after 56 days were reproducible between laboratories (68 < EC 50 - 56 d < 124 mu g L- 1) and were consistent with literature data. EC 50 - 56 d and EC 10 - 56 d values were comprised within a factor of 1. 8 and 3. 6, respectively, {{which is in the}} range of acceptable variation defined for reference chemicals in OECD {{test guideline}}s for invertebrates. The inter-laboratory reproducibility coefficient of variation (CV) for the Cd LC 50 - 56 d values was 8. 19 %. The inter-laboratory comparison of fecundity within the controls gave a CV of 29. 12 %, while exposure to Cd gave a CV of 25. 49 % based on the EC 50 - 56 d values.

The surface area was determined by a simplified BET method using water vapour as adsorbate. A rheometer and a slump flow test were used to measure the flowability of fresh concrete. A concrete dilatometer was used to measure the autogenous shrinkage, and a <b>ring-test</b> for the plastic cracking tendency. The compressive strength was determined at 28 Â days. It was found that the measure of BET(H 2 O) -area can be used to evaluate the water requirement for constant workability of the SCC, where a change in BET(H 2 O) -area of 1000 Â m 2 /kg corresponds to approximately 0. 8 % in moisture content. The results showed that filler with a large area will result in an increased autogenous shrinkage, decreased evaporation, lower plastic cracking tendency, and a higher compressive strength.

In particular, {{the definition of}} soil multi-element CRMs is particularly complex and involves an inter-laboratory program that employs numerous analytical techniques. In this study, we present {{the results of the}} inter-calibration experiment focused on the certification of two new soil standards named AMS-ML 1 and AMS-MO 1. The two soils developed on sandstone and serpentinite parent materials, respectively. The experiment involved numerous laboratories and focused on the evaluation of soil physicochemical parameters and geochemical analyses of major and trace elements by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Inductive Coupled Plasma techniques (ICP-OES and ICP-MS). The data was statistically elaborated. Three levels of repeatability and accuracy in function of the different analytical methods and instrumentation equipment was observed. The statistical evaluation of the results obtained by ICP-OES on Aqua Regia extracts (i. e., Lilliefors test for normally, Grubbs test for outliers, Cochran test for outliers in variances and ANOVA) allowed to computed some certified values for the two proposed soil standards.

40|$|In a reactivity-initiated {{accident}} (RIA), {{a control}} rod ejection or drop causes a sudden increase in reactor power, {{which in turn}} deposits {{a large amount of}} energy into the fuel. The resulting thermal expansion and fission gas release loads the cladding into the plastic regime and may cause it to fail. In order to predict cladding survivability, there has been considerable interest and effort in supplementing integral WA tests with separate-effects ring tests of cladding tubes. Such tests can give one insight into failure mechanisms and measure relevant mechanical properties (such as yield strength, uniform elongation, uniaxial stress-strain curve, etc.), for use in computer codes that attempt to predict cladding response during an RIA. The accuracy of such model predictions obviously depends on appropriate and accurate failure data. This study concerns itself with the proper development of ring tensile tests that (i) are similar to the loading conditions present in an RIA, (ii) measure the relevant mechanical properties and (iii) provide insight regarding the influence of the strain paths on the failure mechanisms present if Zircaloy cladding.

An international <b>ring-test</b> was performed to evaluate the precision of the test method. Four sediments (artificial, natural) were tested. Test duration was 10 d, and test endpoint was inhibition of growth rate (r) based on fresh weight data. Eighteen of 21 laboratories met the validity criterion of r = 0. 09 d(- 1) in the control. Results from 4 tests that did not conform to test-performance criteria were excluded from statistical evaluation. The inter-laboratory variability of growth rates (20. 6 %- 25. 0 %) and inhibition (26. 6 %- 39. 9 %) was comparable with the variability of other standardized bioassays. The mean test-internal variability of the controls was low (7 % [control], 9. 7 % [solvent control]), yielding a high discriminatory power of the given test design (median minimum detectable differences [MDD] 13 % to 15 %).

40|$|International audienceThe n-octanol/water {{partition}} coefficient (P-ow) {{is one of}} the most important parameters employed for estimating a chemical's environmental fate and toxicity. The currently adopted test guidelines for its determination do not allow for reliable determination of log P-ow greater than 5. The slow-stirring experiment, in contrast, has been demonstrated to provide reliable log P-ow data up to log P-ow of 8. 3. To validate this method and to obtain its approval as an official Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (Paris, France) test guideline, a ring test was performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the slow-stirring experiment for determination of log P-ow particularly for highly hydrophobic compounds. Up to 15 volunteer laboratories tested 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrachlorobenzene, hexachlorobenzene, 2, 2 ', 3, 3 ', 5, 5 ', 6, 6 '-octachlorobiphenyl, and decachlorobiphenyl (4. 5 < log P-ow < 8. 2).

The TMEs for the two tests (pre-test and <b>ring-test)</b> in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, were taken from the same site where the field-validation study was performed, the third TME test (pre-test) was performed in Bangor, Wales. Collembola communities showed large variations in numbers and no effects of carbendazim on species diversity were seen. Mites were not determined to species but only to four main taxonomic groups (Astigmata, Cryptostigmata, Mesostigmata, Prostigmata).

40|$|AbstractCracking {{is one of}} {{the main}} reasons for {{reduction}} of concrete durability, as it allows for penetration of water and aggressive chemicals leading to corrosion of rebars, deterioration and structural failure. Recently, rapid new developments in the new generation of concrete reveal the need for a better assessment of shrinkage and its effect on structural performance, as well as prevention and control of shrinkage. The shrinkage test methods that are codified in Poland (Graf-Kaufman and Amsler methods) allow for measurement of shrinkage deformation after removal of the forms, i. e. after 24 hours. In case of the new generation concrete with a low w/c ratio, the autogenous shrinkage is very important in the initial period of binding and hardening of concrete (up to 24 hours from casting). This paper presents the results of autogenous shrinkage tests for mortar and concrete. The autogenous shrinkage was tested using Auto-Shrink method. The crack resistance of concrete with regard to shrinkage deformations was tested using a <b>ring-test</b> method according to the ASTM Standard C 1698 - 09. Because autogenous shrinkage cannot be controlled by exterior curing procedures, the shrinkage tests were performed with light-weight aggregates saturated with water. Use of light-weight aggregates (LWA) allows for “interior curing” based on gradual release of water from presaturated LWA balancing interior moisture content. In addition, the effect of shrinkage reducing admixture on deformations of internally cured concrete was also tested. The test results confirmed the advantage of the considered internal curing for concrete. Internal curing can be successfully applied to concrete structures with low w/c ratio...|$|E
40|$|Early-age {{shrinkage}} {{and cracking}} have become reoccurring problem in concrete construction. Conditions such as reduced maximum aggregate size, increased amount of fines, presence of retarding admixtures, increased binder content and deficient covering and curing {{all contribute to}} this problem. At early age, when the cement paste is young and has poorly developed mechanical properties, autogenous and evaporating shrinkage, both incorporated in the plastic shrinkage, are the two main driving forces for cracking. For modern concretes developing large autogenous shrinkage, as the high performance and self-compacting concrete (SCC), early-age cracking is a highly topical and important area. When the concrete dries out due to evaporation there will be formation of water menisci near the concrete surface. The distance between the particles then tends to be reduced and the concrete will contract. These contracting capillary forces are in reverse ratio to the meniscus radius. The capillary tension stresses will therefore increase with decreasing interparticle spaces. For a concrete where the evaporation is prevented, the negative capillary pressure will also start to develop as the concrete sets. As a solid skeleton starts to form the chemical shrinkage is not totally transformed into external volume change and, if the water supply is restricted, empty pores will be formed inside the paste and water meniscus occurs. In this work, early age (< 24 h) autogenous deformation and crack tendency due to plastic shrinkage was measured. For the autogenous deformation, a specially developed digital dilatometer was used with great satisfactory, generating accurately measures of the linear displacements of the concrete cast in a vapor proof flexible tube mould. The plastic shrinkage cracking tendency was evaluated, using a modified Nordtest method (NT BUILD 433), where the concrete sample was exposed to early drying conditions and where the restraining inner steel ring causes development of tangential stresses which if sufficiently high leads to cracking. As the underlying mechanisms are not quantified by the <b>ring-test</b> and as plastic shrinkage strongly {{are related to the}} negative capillary pressure in fresh concrete, the test was complimented with transducer recording the development of the pore pressure. In some cases, pore pressure development was also measured on sealed specimens, referring to the autogenous deformation tests. A large number of different SCC constituents and mix compositions have been investigated; e. g. w/c-ratio from 0. 38 to 0. 67, coarse aggregate content, silica fume, fly ash, cement type, extra water and different admixtures (accelerator, retarder, shrinkage reducer, air entraining agent, superplasticizer dosage). For comparison, tests with standard concrete were made. The crack tendency test was also performed on mixes with different fibers and curing compounds. The influence of different constituents and mixes on the autogenous deformation and plastic shrinkage crack tendency was significantly observed. The results indicated that: • High crack tendency was generated when: - large autogenous shrinkage (silica addition, low w/c, high fineness) - high water evaporation (extra water, high w/c, low fineness) - retardation (retarder, slow hardening cement, high superplastisizer dosage), - low content of coarse aggregate • Minimum crack tendency at w/c 0. 55 IV • Reduced crack tendency by: - shrinkage reducing admixture (large positive effect on both autogenous shrinkage and evaporation, without influencing the time to initial- and final set) - acceleration (accelerator, rapid cement) - air entraining agent - fibers - wax membrane (effectively for concretes with high evaporation) Finally the <b>ring-test</b> method and the experimental results were clearly verified by field studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{concerned}} with the selection of suitable test protocols for the indication {{of the effects of}} environmental chemicals on Tetrahymena. Based on its wide acceptance and high degree of standardisation, the growth test was chosen for intercalibrating exercises on 6 reference chemicals involving 5 praticipating laboratories from Denmark, The Netherlands, the USA and Germany. The aim of this internationa research effort was to work out a harmonized proposal for an OECD growth-test protocol with protozoa. Results indicate that the ciliate species Tetrahymena pyrifomis and T. thermophila are equally suited as test organisms for exotoxicological purposes. The growth assay reveals predominantly higher sensitivities for the detection of chemical pollution than the vitality or oxygen consumption tests, or even than the chemosensory response, a behavioural parameter. Both species can be tested in axenic or monoxenic culture. Effects on proliferation-rate and stationary cell-density are almost identical. The highest effect potential of the test chemicals was found in synthetic medium. Growth inhibition in axenic, particle-free cultures with synthetic or the more complex PPY-medium can be measured not only by direct cell counting, but also photometrically. Tetrahymena growth tests can be miniaturezed to microplate scale. Semi-static and flow-through tests can also be performed. The marginal deviation of the <b>ring-test</b> results and the comparison of EC-data with the OECD standard tests reveal the Tetrahymena growth to be a highly reproducible and sensitive parameter. The inclusion of a protozoan test protocol would be an ecologically relevent supplement to the existing test battery in aquatic toxicity testing. (orig.)

Beta-glucosidase, acid- and alkaline phosphatase activities were chosen as they are all measurable by using substrates with wide applicability, i. e. p-nitrophenyl derivatives. The five labs preliminarily agreed and standardised the specific methodological procedure for each enzymatic activity, also taking into account factors such as practicability and equipment availability. Nine soils with contrasting physico- chemical and biological properties were adequately sampled, pre-treated and sieved, {{in order to ensure}} representativeness and homogeneity. Then they were sent to each laboratory. Results of ring test were evaluated using the Z-score procedure. Systematic error and random error of a specific lab were calculated, respectively, as the average Z-score and standard deviation of Z-score for a given enzyme in that specific lab. Due to large endogeneity (correlation between the parameter and the error term), only Z-scores below 1 were considered as satisfactory. Only two labs showed acceptable systematic errors for all three enzymes, i. e. average Z-score always less than 1. Even though the number of lab partecipating to the <b>ring-test</b> was small, some trends emerged: i) systematic errors appear to be mainly soil-dependent, i. e. generally each lab among soils indifferently overestimated or underestimated any enzymatic activity; ii) random error was more lab-dependent than enzyme-dependent; iii-beta-glucosidase is the enzyme which measurement is, in general, less variable among labs.

By modifying the glass surface {{it is possible to}} change the performance of the entire glass object, generally known as Surface Engineering. Ion exchange is a convenient technique to modify the glass surface composition and its properties, e. g. optical, mechanical, electrical and chemical properties, without ruining the surface finish of the glass.   This thesis reports the findings of two different research tasks; characterisation of the single-side ion exchange process and the novel properties induced. The characterisation of the ion exchange process was mainly performed by utilising a novel analytical equipment: the Surface Ablation Cell (SAC), allowing continuous removal of the flat glass surface by controlled isotropic dissolution. SAC-AAS has provided concentration vs. depth profiles of float glass ion exchanged with K+, Cu+, Rb+ and Cs+. In addition, SEM-EDX has provided concentration vs. depth profiles of Ag+ ion exchanged samples and validation of a copper concentration vs. depth profile. From the concentration vs. depth profiles, the effective diffusion coefficients and activation energies of the ion exchange processes have been calculated. Depending on the treatment time and treatment temperature, penetration depths in the range of 5 - 10 μm (Rb+, Cs+), 20 - 30 μm (K+, Cu+) and 80 - 100 μm (Ag+) can be readily obtained. The effective diffusion coefficients followed the order Ag+>K+>Cu+>Rb+>Cs+. This is in accordance with the ionic radii for the alkali ions (K+<Rb+<Cs+) but reverse for the noble metal ions (Cu+<Ag+).   The glass properties modified by single-side ion exchange have mainly been characterised by UV-VIS spectroscopy and flexural strength measurements. Cu+ and Ag+ ion exchange give rise to surface colouration, Cu+ copper-ruby and Ag+ yellow/amber. The surface-ruby colouration was found to depend on the residual tin ions in the tin-side of the float glass. The flexural strength was studied using the coaxial double <b>ring-test</b> method which also was suitable for holed specimens.

40|$|The waterflea Daphnia magna is {{a widely}} used test {{organism}} in ecotoxicological studies. Acute and chronic laboratory tests yield basic information {{for the development of}} water quality standards, assessment of potential hazards of (new) chemicals, waste water licences and sanitation measures for contaminated sediments. Environmental risk assessment also includes extrapolation from laboratory to field, for which theoretical models are applied. Reliable results can only be obtained if:toxicity test results are both accurate and reproducible, andextrapolation models take account of major ecological processes. It has been recognized that under current international guidelines for Daphnia toxicity tests interlaboratory variation of test results is disappointingly large (Cowgill, 1987; Baird et al., 1989 a). Differences in test conditions and culture techniques are regarded as a main source of variation, but their relative contributions are largely unknown. The distance between a single-species test under laboratory conditions and the response of an aquatic ecosystem is enormous, in terms of complexity. A first step has been made by Kooijman, who developed a model to predict effects of toxicants on Daphnia populations from effects on individuals (Kooijman, 1986; Kooijman et al., 1989). From comparisons between experimental and simulated population dynamics research questions regarding critical model assumptions were derived. The present study focuses on food availability, which plays {{a central role in the}} life history of D. magna. Its development and reproduction are dependent on food level, as well as its sensitivity to toxic stress. The importance of food for the culture of test animals was investigated, as a contribution to standardisation of toxicity tests. Besides, assumed relationships between food level and Daphnia growth and reproduction are validated, in order to support development of extrapolation models. The experimental approach has been chosen to address the research questions related to both toxicity testing and extrapolation models. New techniques were developed for that purpose. Cadmium, chromium and lead, which are designated as priority pollutants by the International Rhine Committee (1987), have been applied as model substances. The investigations have been carried out at the Instute for Inland Water Management an Waste Water Treatment in Lelystad. New experimental methodsLength measurements are basic to fife history research. Therefore, electronic sizing of living D. magna was pursued by development of a computer program, which was based on an existing image processing system. This method, which is described in chapter 2 , was much more rapid than manual measurements with a microscope, although it was less precise. Image analysis is recommended for determination of large samples, e. g. length frequency distributions of populations. Debris in the size range of the objects has to be removed. When it comes to precision, for instance determination of growth curves, the manual method should be used. Competition mechanisms within a Daphnia population were investigated with a newly developed culture system (chapter 6 ). it consisted of two interconnected culture vessels, each holding a cohort. An air-driven flow of medium plus algae circulated between these vessels, hence allowing the cohorts to share the same food conditions. The system proved to be a useful tool for competition studies. It enables detailed studies of the exploitation of a common food source by competitors that are similar in morphology, or should be kept apart for other reasons. Different, externally driven food dynamics can be simulated. With a few adaptations the system can easily be extended to hold three or more competing groups. StandardizationCurrent international guidelines predominantly aim at standardisation of conditions during toxicity tests. Therefore, culture methods, i. e. pre-test conditions, differ among research laboratories. As an example, methods practised at the Institute for Inland Water Management and Waste Water Treatment (RIZA) are described in chapter 2 . The experiments in the present study were conducted with D. magna cultered in natural water from Lake Ijssel. The green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa was used to feed the Daphnia. Transfer cultures were supplied with constant daily food rations, and young were removed three times a week. Hence, the density of algae varies with cumulative filtration rates of the mother cohort and the progeny which has not yet been removed. This may carry over into the results of ecotoxicological studies, as maternal feeding conditions can affect the quality of the young. Cowgill et al. (1985) showed an inverse relationship between brood size and weight of newborn D. magna in a laboratory population. They suggested the existence of a reproductive strategy, which earlier had been proposed by Hutchinson (1951) on the basis of field observations. According to this strategy females spread their genes around under favourable conditions by producing many small, 'cheap' neonates, while heavy, stress-resistent young are born when food is sparse. An important objective of the present thesis was to test the validity of this strategy and to explore ecotoxicological and ecological consequences by experimentation (chapters 3 and 4 ). It could be demonstrated in our studies that reproduction of females, which were exposed to an abrupt increase or decrease of food ration between the third and the fourth brood, was fully adapted to the new situation in three instars, or c. eight days at 20 °C (standard laboratory temperature). Brood sizes ranged from 7 to 76 and neonate carapace lengths from 1. 1 to 0. 92 mm. The smallest young (0. 80 mm) were observed in the first brood. The latter is a well-known phenomenon that is accounted for in toxicity test guidelines (e. g. OECD, 1984) by discouraging the use of the first brood. The main reason for this advice is reduced survival in controls, which may invalidate the test (e. g. Cowgill et al., 1986). The present study shows that large neonates contained more lipid reserves than small ones. Therefore we may expect a positive correlation between survival at starvation and body size. This was confirmed in the starvation experiments described in chapter 5 and Enserink (1989), but not in similar experiments in chapter 4 . In connection with unfed 48 h toxicity tests it is worth noting that median survival times never fen below 4 d, even for the smallest (0. 77 mm) neonates. An even more important reason to pay attention to neonate size is that small neonates can be more sensitive to toxicants than large young in acute (48 h) tests (chapter 3 ). When exposed to cadmium there was a threefold difference between the LC 50 's for small and large animals. However, no such effect was found in toxicity tests with chromium(VI), i. e. LC 50 's were similar in all tests, which probably relates to different modes of action of these two metals. In chronic (21 d) toxicity tests the initial size of test animals appeared to be less important (chapter 4 ). Whereas the trends observed in acute tests were consistent in several trials (e. g. Enserink, 1989), this was not the case in chronic tests. The results suggest that environmental conditions during the test mask subtle differences in neonate size and lipid reserves. The variation in effect concentrations caused by non-simultaneous replication was in the same order of magnitude, i. e. a factor of 2, as the effects of initial body size. Probably, food supply during these tests was inadequately controlled. The most conspicuous conclusion of the present studies is that maternal food ration is of paramount importance to neonate fitness and hence to the results of acute toxicity tests, at least for some chemicals (Enserink, 1989; Enserink et al., 1990). Similar results were obtained independently by Baird et al. (1989 b). More recently, a number of other investigators have confirmed these findings. The reproductive strategy in D. magna was also observed by Cox et al. (1992), Naylor et al. (1992) and Viganò (1993). According to Naylor et al. (1992) the inverse relationship between maternal food level and neonate size also holds for dry weight, although this parameter appeared to be more variable than body length. Even under normal culture conditions, when food level is not purposely varied, brood to brood oscillations of neonate weight and length were inversely related to oscillations of mean clutch size (Viganò, 1993; Lazorchak & Waller, 1993). Such variation can be caused by unstable quality or quantity of food supply, increased grazing capacity owing to body growth and periodic presence of neonates. The results of the current studies suggest that the influence of maternal food conditions on the results of acute (48 h) toxicity tests depends on test substance. Cadmium toxicity was modified by neonate size, but the toxicity of chromium remained unaffected. The largest influence was reported for 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, i. e. a factor of 6 (Baird et al., 1991). A significant positive correlation between neonate size and LC 50 was found for sodium bromide and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (Naylor et al., 1992), and copper (Lazorchak & Waller, 1993). Viganò (1993) found no effect of neonate size on LC 50 's for ethylbenzene and n -butylbenzene, but the variation of test results was very limited, as was the size range of the test animals. For cadmium however, the effect of maternal ration was confirmed (Baird et al., 1991), but neonate length showed no correlation with LC 50 in the experiments of Naylor et al. (1992), which is inconsistent with the results of the present studies. Several differences between our study and that of Naylor et al. (1992) might account for these results, e. g. the presence of food during the test, the use of another clone and a different test medium. It is of interest to note that both studies were carried out according to standard, but different, test protocols. Whereas maternal food ration, which was purposely varied, accounted for a within-laboratory variation of a factor 3 in the present study and the experiments of Baird et al. (1991), who worked at the same laboratory as Naylor et al. (1993), a 20 -fold difference occurred between the laboratories. From the viewpoint of standardization, sources of variation within and between laboratories are equally important. The significance of maternal food conditions for toxicity tests has been clearly demonstrated above. It is therefore recommended to include pre-test conditions in standardization programmes and test guidelines. Several other factors are known to be relevant, for instance feeding conditions during the test (Winner et al., 1977; Chandini, 1988 a, b; Soares, 1989; Lazorchak & Waller, 1993; Sims et al., 1993; Klüttgen & Ratte, 1994), genotype (Soares, 1989; Baird et al., 1991), medium (Winner, 1985) and even statistical evaluation of test results (Hoekstra, 1993). However, very little is known about their relative contributions and interactions. Ring-tests are excellent instruments to investigate such combined effects. At present, an international <b>ring-test</b> is conducted to improve the OECD guidelines (1984) for chronic toxicity tests, with respect to genotype, medium and feeding during the test. This investigation is coordinated by the University of Sheffield (UK), Department of Animal & Plant Sciences. In order to obtain a sufficient overview of sources of variation within and between laboratories and to identify the most important factors, further investigation is needed. Current guidelines do not garantee standardized test results in the strict sense of the word, which decreases the reliability of safe levels for water management and of bioassays conducted for regulatory purposes. Therefore, a collective decision should be made on:the desired quality of toxicity test results for water management andthe amount of detail in culture and test protocols that is required to meet this quality. ExtrapolationThe phenotypic plasticity of D. magna in response to its food source is impressive. All major life history traits can adapt rapidly to food availability, which undoubtly has evolutionary significance as Daphnia experiences a nutritionally variable environment during its lifespan. The challenge to designers of simulation models is to describe and incorporate those relationships which areindispensable for attaining the goals of the model. In the model of Kooijman (1986) for growth and development of individual Daphnia a balance between mathematical simplicity and biological realism was pursued. Modelled individuals were aggregated into simulated single-species populations (Kooijman et al., 1989; Van der Hoeven, 1991). In this way, physiological effects of toxic chemicals can be translated into population dynamics, which was regarded as a step towards modelling the response of ecosystems to toxic stress. Ecosystems contain many interacting populations. In order to avoid a complex tangle of detailed sub-models a collection of assumptions was produced, partly based on conceptions of physical mechanisms, partly on the premise that everything is extremely simple unless it proves to be more complex and partly on empirical data. The idea was to strip details from the sub-models in the process towards the ecosystem model. The Daphnia model was regarded as a test case for a more general model, which should be applicable to many species (Kooijman et al., 1987). Nevertheless, a certain amount of detail is nescessary for meaningful extrapolations to higher levels of organisation. A comprehensive list of Kooijman's (1986) model assumptions at the level of the individual is given by Van der Hoeven (1991). In the present thesis a number of these assumptions was evaluated experimentally:neonate size is fixed;size-specific storage of a neonate is identical to that of its mother at the moment of egg formation;a minimum size is required for reproduction;a fixed portion of utilized energy is spent on reproduction and the remainder on growth and maintenance;ingestion rate is proportional to body surface;energy costs for maintenance are proportional to body weight. An attempt was made to assess their relevance for extrapolation. In chapters 3 and 4 a reproductive strategy for D. magna in reponse to food availability is described. Body size and lipid content of neonates appeared to be inversely related to maternal food ration. Cox et A (1992) observed no further decrease of neonate size when food was no longer restrictive, i. e. above the incipient limiting level. These findings do not agree with two model assumptions: size at birth is independent of food level and size-specific energy storage of a neonate is identical to the size-specific storage of its mother. The reproductive strategy mentioned above has important consequences for survival and development of neonates under low food conditions. Survival time at starvation can increase from 4 to 9 days with increasing neonate size (chapter 5 ). In addition, large and fat young can develop into their third instar without food (chapter 4 ). This may decrease time to first reproduction, as will be shown below. In the model, deposition of the first clutch, i. e. the primiparous instar, is initiated as the female attains a certain body size, which is independent of food level. In chapter 5 however, body sizes of primiparae differed significantly among food rations, with minimum sizes at intermediate rations. A threshold body length for maturation was found two instars earlier, i. e. just before the preadolescent instar, in concordance with Ebert (1992). However, this threshold was not completely independent of food. At low food rations trade-offs occurred between growth and reproduction. One group of animals delayed their first brood in favour of body growth. The young of these delayed broods were significantly larger than young that were born earlier at the same maternal food ration, probably owing to increased instar duration. It was concluded that a minimum energy requirement for reproduction was met at this food ration. A remarkable phenomenon was observed at low food rations. Allocation of energy reserves, i. e. yolk, to the ovaries appeared reversible. Accumulation during the first half of an instar and redistribution towards the end of the instar suggested that energy needs for the production of a new carapace have priority over egg production. As yet mathematical models of Daphnia do notallow redistribution of material allocated to reproduction (Hanstveit et al., 1987; Gurney et al., 1990). From the distribution of biomass during the production of the first brood it was concluded that the proportion of energy allocated to reproduction increases with food availability. Similar results were obtained by McCauley et al. (1990), who improved the simulations of their Daphnia model by incorporating a food-dependent fraction to reproduction (Gurney et al., 1990). In the model of Kooijman, however, the fraction of assimilated energy allocated to reproduction is assumed constant, except for starvation conditions. Combined effects of food ration and exposure to lead on maturation were also investigated in chapter 5 . A significant interaction between food and lead concentration was observed, which means that toxic effects were dependent on food level. Body growth was reduced at both food levels, leading to smaller primiparae with smaller progeny at abundant food, whereas delayed maturation and egg mortality were observed at the low food ration. Except for egg mortality, the effects of lead on maturation resemble increased food stress. Similar observations have been made in experiments with copper (Winner et al., 1977) and cadmium (Chandini, 1989; Klüttgen & Ratte, 1994). Extrapolation from chronic toxicity tests, which are normally carried out with large food supply, to low food environments can therefore generate wrong conclusions. Density oscillations in laboratory populations with constant food supply are a common phenomenon. However, it is not clear whether such behaviour is mainly caused by intrinsic properties of the populations themselves or by experimental irregularities. On the basis of an analysis of published population behaviour, Van der Hoeven (1989) suggested that the latter option is very probable. Therefore, the simulations of the Daphnia model, which show regular, persistent oscillations, have been questioned (Kooijman et al., 1989). The major driving force of these oscillations is synchronisation of life cycles during the decline phase of a population. This prediction mainly follows from the assumption that food intake is proportional to surface (-length 2 ) and maintenance costs are proportional to weight (-length 3 ). As a consequence, the rate of body growth declines as the animal approaches an ultimate size, which in turn is depressed at low food levels. Individuals which are smaller than the ultimate size continue to grow, whereas body growth is suspended by those which are larger than this size. This mechanism leads to convergence of body lengths. The assumed growth model is referred to as Von Bertalanffy's type I model (1969). Reproduction is closely synchronised owing to another assumption, i. e. first reproduction occurs at a fixed body size (cf. chapter 5 ). Convergence and synchronisa...|$|E
