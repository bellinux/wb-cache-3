50|$|The Papuan <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> or New Guinea <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Drymodes beccarii) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Petroicidae. It {{was found to be}} genetically {{distinct}} from the northern <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> with which it was considered conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The Roper River <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Drymodes superciliaris colcloughi), {{also known}} as the allied <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> is a {{putative}} subspecies of the northern <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> a bird in the Petroicidae, or Australasian robin family. Whether it ever existed is doubtful; if it did it is almost certainly extinct.|$|R
50|$|The Kalahari <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Erythropygia paena) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Muscicapidae. It is {{sometimes}} known as the sandy <b>scrub</b> <b>robin.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bearded <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Cercotrichas quadrivirgata), {{also known}} as the eastern bearded <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae. It is found in eastern and {{southern}} Africa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scrub</b> <b>robins</b> {{are mainly}} African species of open {{woodland}} or scrub, which nest in bushes {{or on the}} ground, but the rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> also breeds in southern Europe and east to Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Drymodes superciliaris) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Petroicidae. It is found in northern Australia. It {{was found to be}} genetically distinct from the Papuan <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> with which it was considered conspecific.|$|R
50|$|In {{the reserve}} the {{following}} bird species may be seen: water thick-knee, osprey, swift tern, half-collared kingfisher, Kittlitz's plover, African black oystercatcher, giant kingfisher, black-bellied starling, red-capped robin-chat, white-browed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> brown <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> black-backed puffback, forest canary, green twinspot, orange-breasted bushshrike and grey-headed bushshrike.|$|R
25|$|The rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Cercotrichas galactotes) is a {{medium-sized}} {{member of the}} family Muscicapidae. Other common names include the rufous <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> rufous bush chat, rufous bush robin and the rufous warbler. It breeds around the Mediterranean and east to Pakistan. It also breeds south of the Sahara from the Sahel region east to Somalia; these African birds are sometimes considered to be a separate species, the African <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (C. minor). It is partially migratory, wintering in Africa (Kenya, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia) and India. This is a very rare visitor to northern Europe.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species was}} {{described}} as Thamnobia quadrivirgata by Reichenow in 1879. It was formerly placed in the genus Erythropygia. It forms a superspecies with the forest <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> miombo <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> and brown <b>scrub</b> <b>robin.</b> These four species are sometimes placed in the genus Tychaedon. Two subspecies of C. quadrivirgata are recognized: C. q. greenwayi in the Zanzibar and Mafia Islands, and C. q. quadrivirgata {{in the rest of}} the range. The specific epithet quadrivirgata means [...] "four-striped" [...] in Latin. The species is so named because of four diagnostic stripes on its face.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes the rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> {{is found}} in {{association}} with a woodchat shrike (Lanius senator), perhaps nesting in a neighbouring tree. The woodchat shrike perches {{near the top of}} a tree, ever alert to sparrowhawks, buzzards and other aerial predators while the <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> perches on a bush or lower branch, scanning the ground for the approach of snakes, cats, weasels, foxes, genets, ocellated lizards and other predators. Both birds are adept at luring away predators by flying towards them to attract their attention and then flitting away from the nest site through the undergrowth. The rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> can recognise the warning cries of other species of bird and take appropriate action.|$|R
50|$|The {{validity}} of the taxon is primarily based on whether a population of <b>scrub</b> <b>robins</b> existed in the Northern Territory, the only records of such being the two skins collected by Colclough in 1910 on the Roper River. Another member of the 1910 expedition, E. D. Frizelle, collected several clutches of eggs purporting to be those of northern <b>scrub</b> <b>robins</b> from the Roper. Some of these clutches {{are now in the}} H. L. White Collection at the National Museum of Victoria, but upon reappraisal {{have been found to be}} those of misidentified buff-sided robins.|$|R

50|$|Unusually for a passerine, the {{southern}} <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> lays {{only a single}} egg, which is grey-green in colour for camouflage amongst the sclerophyllous flora that forms its habitat. This egg is laid every year between July and December and hatches after sixteen days in a nest of twigs on the ground.|$|R
50|$|A {{putative}} subspecies, D. s. colcloughi, {{known as}} the Roper River <b>scrub</b> <b>robin,</b> was described by Gregory Mathews in 1914 from specimens supposedly collected from the Northern Territory of Australia. However, {{there have been no}} further records from the area, the provenance of the specimens has been questioned, and the taxon is controversial.|$|R
50|$|The <b>scrub</b> <b>robins</b> or bush chats are {{medium-sized}} insectivorous {{birds in}} the genus Cercotrichas. They were formerly in the thrush family, (Turdidae), but are more often now treated {{as part of the}} Old World flycatcher family, (Muscicapidae). They are not closely related to the Australian scrub-robins, genus Drymodes in the family Petroicidae.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Drymodes brunneopygia) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Petroicidae.It is endemic to Australia, where it occurs in mallee and heathland in the semi-arid southern parts of the continent, extending from the Little Desert in the east though South Australia {{to the west coast}} between Kalbarri and the Pinnacles.|$|R
5000|$|Drymodes is a genus of bird in {{the family}} Petroicidae. It was {{traditionally}} held to have two species, but molecular and behavioural differences led to the split of the New Guinea populations from the northern <b>scrub</b> <b>robin.</b> The paper by Les Christidis and colleagues was published in 2011 and the IOC adopted the split in 2015: ...|$|R
5|$|Several {{birds and}} other predatory organisms prey on the black-headed sugar ant. Birds {{such as the}} black-faced woodswallow, rufous treecreeper, noisy miner, jacky winter and {{southern}} <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> prey on this species, {{as indicated by the}} fact that workers body parts have been found in the birds' stomach contents. Other predators of the black-headed sugar ant include the rainbow trout.|$|R
5000|$|The white-browed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> (Cercotrichas leucophrys), {{also known}} as the red-backed scrub-robin ( [...] Erythropygia leucophrys), is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae.

25|$|The rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> is {{a partial}} migrant. Its {{breeding}} range extends from Portugal, southern Spain and the Balkan Peninsula, through the Middle East to Iraq, Kazakhstan and Pakistan. In Africa it breeds from Morocco to Egypt {{and south of}} the Sahara as far east as Somalia. It is an uncommon vagrant to northern Europe. It winters in North Africa and eastwards to India. Its habitat is dry scrubby open country with patches of dense bushes in lowlands or foothills; where it is numerous, it may also be found in parks, vineyards and large gardens.|$|R
25|$|The rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> {{is larger}} than the European robin. It has brown upper parts, whitish under parts, and a {{prominent}} whitish eye-stripe. The western race has a paler, warmer brown back than birds in southeastern Europe and Asia. The long rufous tail is frequently fanned, showing the black and white tips of the tail feathers. The adult male and female have similar plumage and the juvenile resembles the adult but is paler. These birds feed on insects mostly caught on the ground. Their clear thrush-like song has a sad tone.|$|R

25|$|The rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> {{is found}} flitting among dense cover {{but also in}} more open {{positions}} on trees, the tops of bushes and on posts. It is frequently seen on the ground hopping about and flaring and bobbing its tail up and down. When perched it also displays its tail in this way and also sometimes droops its wings before giving them a little flick forward. It feeds mainly on the ground on insects such as beetles, grasshoppers and the larvae of butterflies and moths, and on earthworms, turning over the leaf litter to find its prey.|$|R
2500|$|The male rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> has {{an unusual}} display flight {{involving}} a downward swoop with uplifted wings and may sing while displaying. The nest is built {{a few feet}} off the ground in a bush, a hedge of prickly pear, on a tree stump or other concealed place. It is usually well-hidden and is untidily built of grasses, stems, roots and other fibres. The inside is neatly cup-shaped and is lined with fine roots, hairs and often a piece of snakeskin. A clutch of four to five (occasionally fewer) eggs is laid. The eggs average about [...] and have a pale greenish or greyish-white background colour liberally sprinkled with greyish-brown spots.|$|R
2500|$|The rufous-tailed <b>scrub</b> <b>robin</b> has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at 4.3millionsquare kilometres (1.66million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 96 to 288 thousand individuals in Europe. As the European range is somewhere between a quarter {{and half of the}} global range, the global population may range from 196 thousand to 1.15 million individuals. The population size appears to be stable and the bird is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as being of [...] "Least Concern".|$|R
