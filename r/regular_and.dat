5|$|In September 1939, the North Staffordshire Regiment {{consisted}} of two <b>Regular</b> <b>and</b> two Territorial battalions – the 1st and 2nd <b>Regular</b> <b>and</b> the 6th and 7th Territorials.

The roles of the two regular battalions were reversed this time, with the 1st Battalion serving in India and Burma throughout the war, while the 2nd Battalion remained in Italy and North Africa.|$|E
