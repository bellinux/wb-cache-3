40|$|Radiographic {{studies are}} among the most {{important}} diagnostic procedures in the clinical evaluation of sea turtles. The anatomical structures for which it is possible to obtain an optimal assessment by radiographic examination are respiratory tact, digestive tract, skeleton, carapace, and plastron. The fundamental and indispensable projections for a proper radiographic estimation of the body are dorsoventral view, vertical beam, horizontal beam, lateral view, and craniocaudal view. Radiographs in the dorsal-ventral projection usually allow achieving the detection of fishhooks in the various sections of the digestive tract. In fact, hooks are poorly detectable in other projections due to the intense radiopacity determined by the superimposition of other anatomical structures, and to the inability to set the <b>radiographic</b> <b>cassette</b> in strict contact with the body of the animal. On the contrary, when the hooks are stacked in the esophagus wall, especially in the intracoelomatic tract, images in the dorsoventral beam do not allow to ascertain if the tip or the hook barbs are dangerously close to airways (trachea and bronchi) or great vessels (brachycephalic trunk). Without this information, the surgeon risks to cause irreparable injuries during the removal of the hook. On the other hand, a complete radiographic study in two orthogonal projections is invaluable to correctly assess position and orientation of the hook to properly schedule the surgery. The present study included 21 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) referred to the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Bari University (Italy), which showed drifting longlines hooks located in the caudal cervical or intracoelomatic esophagus subsequently to a first radiographic evaluation in dorsoventral beam. The other radiographic projections were obtained in horizontal beam lateral view, with turtles set on a radiolucent support (plastic box) with the surface of the <b>radiographic</b> <b>cassette</b> adherent to the lateral margin of the bridge. In order to reduce the overlap of soft tissues of the pectoral girdle, the front flippers were forward stretched below the neck, and temporarily wrapped together with self-adhesive elastic bandage. X-ray images were obtained with a digital acquisition system, which allowed improving contrast and brightness of images by graphic processing. The opportunity to evaluate different radiograms obtained in two orthogonal projections has allowed to precisely locate the position of hook, shank and bend with respect to the horizontal midsagittal plane the animal, the orientation of the tip (cranially, caudally or laterally), and above all the closeness to vital anatomical structures. These significant assessments have allowed choosing the most appropriate surgical approaches, and to avoid dangerous intraoperative maneuvers during removal of hooks...|$|E
40|$|Background Context: The {{role of the}} {{variation}} in the application manipulation itself is largely unknown. A greater understanding of its input parameters is necessary to better understand spinal manipulation outcomes. Purpose: The objective {{of this study is to}} determine if pressures generated during manipulation are altered by hand configuration. Design/Setting: Paired comparison of 2 different variable groups. Methods: Sixteen chiropractors provided 2 manipulations to a rigid surface using 2 hand configurations used commonly in clinical practice: arched and flat. Interposed between the hand and the rigid surface was a pressure sensor array and <b>radiographic</b> <b>cassette.</b> For each manipulation, pressures were recorded and a radiographic image was captured. Two radiologists then located the osseous features of the hand with respect to the sensor array. Results: In 15 of 16 cases, arched configurations produced peak pressures that corresponded to the radiographic location of the pisiform bone. In flat configurations, peak pressure migrated about the location of the hamate bone. Radiologists' agreement for bone position was high (κ = 0. 96). Measures of peak pressure, total pressure, and pressure distribution were statistically different between hand configurations. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that hand configuration influences the magnitude, location, and distribution of pressure generated by the hand during manipulation. This knowledge may have importance in understanding the relation among application parameters of manipulation, therapeutic benefit, and patient safety. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Methods of {{decreasing}} the fog density level in an autoradiographically intensified image were investigated. The methods included a more proportional conversion of silver to silver sulfide, {{decreasing the}} amount of fog silver in the original image, and minimizing the formation of fog in the original image. Thirty percent exposures of an aluminum 11 step wedge and a lead resolution target were made using Kodak film type XG- 1. The underexposed films were either developed in the Kodak RP X-Omat processor or manually developed. All the films were radioactivated in an alkaline solution of sulfur- 35 thiourea for 30 minutes. The activated films were exposed to Kodak film type NMC in a <b>radiographic</b> <b>cassette</b> for a specified period of time. The resulting autoradiographs were developed in the X-Omat processor. A more proportional conversion of silver to radioactive silver sulfide was obtained by increasing {{the amount of}} nonradioactive thiourea in the activating solution. The addition of 0. 0014 g. of nonradioactive thiourea resulted in a 70 % decrease in the fog density of the autoradiograph and a 40 % increase in gamma, but at the expense of a 40 % decrease in ASA speed. The use of potassium ferricyanide as an oxidizing agent during the radioactivation resulted in increased fog density, while the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent produced little or no effect on the intensification. Manually developing the underexposed image for a shorter period of time (1 min. instead of 3 min.) resulted in decreased fog from a density of 1. 31 to 0. 58 and increased contrast from 1. 2 to 2. 2, while the ASA speed remained unchanged in the intensified image. A fixed-out film which was treated in the photographic subtractive reducer prior to activation did not produce any intensified image; thereby, indicating that sulfur- 35 thiourea does not react with the gelatin...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract We introduce the concept, benefits, and general architecture for acquiring, storing, and displaying digital pho-tographs along with medical imaging examinations. We also discuss a specific implementation built around an Android-based system for simultaneously acquiring digital photo-graphs along with portable radiographs. By an innovative application of radiofrequency identification technology to <b>radiographic</b> <b>cassettes,</b> {{the system is}} able to maintain a tight relationship between these photographs and the radiographs within the picture archiving and communications system (PACS) environment. We provide a cost analysis demonstrat-ing the economic feasibility of this technology.

40|$|X-ray {{cassette}} is a light-tight container {{to cover}} radiographic film during <b>radiographic</b> examination. <b>Cassette</b> can {{directly or indirectly}} contact with the patient 2 ̆ 7 s body. It can be a spreading medium of bacteria from patient to patient, or patient to radiographer. The aims {{of this study are}} to determine the number of microorganisms contained in the cassette before and after cleaning, and to know the difference between those two numbers. The study is an observational study with cross-sectional approach. The survey was done to 17 cassettes to measure the number of bacteria using swap method. Then, the data were analyzed using Wilcoxon test. Result shows that the mean of bacteria, fungi, staphylococcus and ALT on cassettes before cleaning was larger than the mean after cleaning the cassette using 70...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: The {{quality of}} {{panoramic}} radiographs {{has a great}} role in the diagnosis of lesions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of BMI and the type of the <b>radiographic</b> <b>cassette</b> on the diagnostic quality of panoramic images through evaluation of maxillary sinus periphery, mandibular cortex, tooth enamel and tooth fillings. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 400 patients with an age range of 2 - 70 years, who required panoramic radiographs, were selected. Type of the cassette used and patients’ weights, heights and ages were recorded before radiography. After processing the images, each anatomical landmark was scored on a 3 -point scale. Total quality for each image was defined as the average of these scores for selected landmarks. The overall density of each image (i. e. the overall quality) was also scored. Data were analyzed by Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney test, t-test and regression test (α= 0. 05). Results: Spearman’s correlation coefficient revealed a significant correlation between BMI and resolution of the periphery of maxillary sinus and the overall image density (p value < 0. 0001). No correlation was found between BMI and resolution of mandibular cortex (p value = 0. 7) and tooth crown enamel and fillings (p value = 0. 2). Cassette type had no effect on image quality. Conclusion: The results indicated cassette type has no effect on image quality provided other exposure factors are properly chosen. Furthermore, an increase in BMI has no effect on resolution of anatomic landmarks provided that other exposure factors are properly chosen, although it increases image density. It appears panoramic radiographic technique is a useful diagnostic tool, especially for adults. Key words: Body mass index, Image quality, Panoramic, Radiography...|$|E
