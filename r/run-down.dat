5|$|Before privatisation, the King's Cross {{area had}} a {{reputation}} for <b>run-down</b> buildings and prostitution services in front of the main entrance. A major clean-up took place during the 1990s and the station's atmosphere was much improved {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
5|$|In the subplot, Moe {{decides to}} expand his {{customer}} base by turning his tavern into a family restaurant. The stress of running the business by himself ultimately unnerves him and he soon snaps at a little girl. The restaurant is a failure, forcing Moe to revert to a <b>run-down</b> tavern.|$|E
5|$|A big celebration {{is held by}} the city's {{population}} as the Simpsons are officially evicted from Springfield. When the family drives out {{into the middle of}} nowhere at night with no place to stay, they come across a man who takes them to a county called The Outlands, which is a dirty, <b>run-down</b> place where there are no rules and regulations. The Simpsons settle in The Outlands and meet Julian Assange—their unfriendly next-door neighbor who operates the WikiLeaks Headquarters there.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{depiction}} of Hollywood appears in Nathanael West's novel The Day of the Locust (1939), which many critics see {{as an important}} precursor to Barton Fink. Set in a <b>run-down</b> apartment complex, the book describes a painter reduced to decorating movie sets. It portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit. In both West's novel and Barton Fink, protagonists suffer under the oppressive industrial machine of the movie studio.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{section is}} being constructed {{at the city}} end that will {{reduce the number of}} congested intersections buses must traverse to enter the Adelaide city centre; this is due to open in late 2017. The development of the O-Bahn busway {{led to the development of}} the Torrens Linear Park from a <b>run-down</b> urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at Modbury.|$|E
5|$|As the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei {{began work}} on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his {{associate}} James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution {{in what was then}} a <b>run-down</b> neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres.|$|E
5|$|Barton Fink is a 1991 American period film written, produced, {{directed}} and edited by the Coen brothers. Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro {{in the title}} role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the <b>run-down</b> Hotel Earle.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was born}} in Cambridge on 16 December 1882, the first of 12 {{children}} to John Cooper Hobbs, a slater, and his wife Flora Matilda Berry. Hobbs {{was raised in a}} poor, <b>run-down</b> area of the city, and {{he spent most of his}} childhood in near-poverty. Hobbs senior, a lover of cricket, changed his career to become a professional cricketer, and in 1889 was appointed groundsman and umpire at Jesus College.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943 Thomas began a {{relationship}} with Pamela Glendower, one of several affairs he had during his marriage. The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943 Caitlin {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a <b>run-down</b> studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|On {{the border}} of Southcote and Tilehurst is the Meadway Precinct, which {{includes}} an Asda supermarket and a Boots pharmacy, {{as well as other}} smaller shops. The precinct opened in 1967, and a survey in 2012 revealed that the public thought the site had become <b>run-down</b> and required modernisation. In 2015 a planning application was submitted to Reading Borough Council by a developer who plans to renovate the site.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being {{a valuable}} commodity, Archer is {{startled by the}} lack of basic medical supplies and the <b>run-down</b> nature of the colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), the leader of the Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium because two pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic tell them to take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does not sit well with Archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support.|$|E
5|$|Dunst {{made her}} screenwriting and directorial debut with the short film Bastard, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010 {{and was later}} {{featured}} at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. She co-starred opposite Ryan Gosling in the mystery drama All Good Things (2010), {{based on a true}} story as the wife of Gosling's character from a <b>run-down</b> neighborhood who goes missing. The film received reasonable reviews, and earned $640,000 worldwide. Dunst co-starred with Brian Geraghty in Carlos Cuarón's short film The Second Bakery Attack, based on Haruki Murakami's short story.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely <b>run-down</b> with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E
5|$|Mac Sledge (Robert Duvall), a washed up, {{alcoholic}} country singer, awakens at a <b>run-down</b> Texas roadside motel and {{gas station}} {{after a night}} of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange for a room. Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were bought for US$4.7 million in 1988 by real estate investor Samuel A. Rappaport. Rappaport, {{who made a}} fortune by buying, improving, and then selling <b>run-down</b> properties, announced in 1989 {{that he planned to}} turn the building into his own personal headquarters and add a glass-enclosed ballroom on its top. Rappaport also planned to have an apartment in one of the York Row houses. However, like many other Rappaport-owned buildings, they ended up being left vacant and neglected, becoming a target for vandals and the homeless.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} works were complex, and many contractors {{were involved in}} delivering them. The CTRL Section 2 {{construction works}} had caused considerable disruption around the Kings Cross area of London; in their wake redevelopment was stimulated. The large redevelopment area includes the <b>run-down</b> areas of post-industrial and ex-railway land close to King's Cross and St Pancras, a conservation area with many listed buildings; this was promoted {{as one of the}} benefits for building the CTRL. It has been postulated that this development was actually suppressed by the construction project, and some affected districts were said still to be in a poor state in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{representations}} of social stratification {{are specific to}} Paris, perhaps the most densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocks– as Rastignac does continually– takes the reader into vastly different worlds, distinguished by their architecture and reflecting the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the post-Napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in Le Père Goriot: the aristocratic area around the Boulevard Saint-Germain, the newly upscale quarter of the rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and the <b>run-down</b> area on the eastern slope of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.|$|E
5|$|The two men later reach {{a nature}} reserve {{as the third}} killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's {{syndicate}} during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout {{in front of the}} three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a <b>run-down</b> apartment in Hong Kong to treat their wounds. Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had a bullet in his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many places}} in London, the Old Kent Road area {{did not suffer}} {{significant}} bomb damage during World War II. In 1968, a flyover opened at the northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the main flow of traffic. During the 1970s, <b>run-down</b> Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished {{to make way for}} new housing estates. Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943, which recommended new parkland in the area. Several tower blocks were built along the road, although some earlier 19th-century buildings, such as Nos.360–386, survived.|$|E
5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's <b>run-down</b> log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a <b>run-down</b> state both mentally and physically.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{five years}} later, the Soviet Union militarily {{intervenes}} in Afghanistan. Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, {{and then to}} Fremont, California, where they settle in a <b>run-down</b> apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods {{at a flea market}} in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{many of the}} city's slums were demolished, and {{replaced}} with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats. Large {{parts of the city}} centre were also cleared {{to make way for a}} new system of roads. Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills. The 1980s saw the worst of this <b>run-down</b> of Sheffield's industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK. The building of the Meadowhall Centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 World Student Games, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he had actually been aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story of The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a <b>run-down</b> amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E
5|$|Marylebone was reprieved {{from the}} threat of closure on 30 April 1986, and an £85million {{modernisation}} and refurbishment programme of the station and its services was granted. This was funded by selling part of the station to developers, including two of the original four platforms at the west of the station and the third span of the train shed. In order to replace these, the central cab road was removed, and two new platforms numbered 2 and 3 were created in its place. The <b>run-down</b> lines into Marylebone were modernised with new signalling and higher line speeds. In 1991, the fleet of Class 115 trains on local services was replaced by Class 165 Turbo trains, and service frequencies were increased. Services to Banbury were extended to the reopened Birmingham Snow Hill station in 1993, creating the first long-distance service into Marylebone since 1966. Initially this service ran at two-hourly intervals, but it proved popular and was increased to an hourly frequency in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{originally}} planned to shoot scenes in Oakland, California before visiting the actual Philadelphia locations {{described in the}} novel. Upon arriving in Philadelphia, he and producer Alan Marshall set up production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. Location scouting began as Parker was holding casting calls in New York City. Location manager Rory Enke and production designer Geoffrey Kirkland visited <b>run-down</b> areas of Philadelphia, and offered suggestions to Parker on his weekend visits from New York. Parker made an arrangement with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that permitted the British crew members to work alongside members of both {{the east and west}} coast union locals. He had to employ no less than four members of the two camera locals in order to allow his past collaboratorsdirector of photography Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts and editor Gerry Hamblingto work on the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate <b>run-down</b> economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E
5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the country, {{to the delight of}} the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a <b>run-down</b> property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as an officer in the Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Wilkinson {{was invited}} by the India League {{to join a}} small delegation, to report on {{conditions}} in India. During the three-month visit she met Gandhi, then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, The Condition of India, published in 1934. She visited Germany shortly after Hitler {{came to power in}} 1933, and published a pamphlet, The Terror in Germany, that documented early incidents of Nazi outrage. She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler's Germany, Edward Conze, to produce a major book, Why Fascism?, which condemned the Labour Party's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy, arguing for the need for grassroots workers' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe. Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for Jarrow, a Tyneside shipbuilding town. Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the <b>run-down</b> and closure of Palmers shipyard, the town's main source of employment. Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency, and received sympathy but no positive action. She was unimpressed by the government's Special Areas Act, passed late in 1934 and designed to assist distressed areas such as Jarrow; she thought the legislation provided inadequate funding, and benefited employers more than workers.|$|E
25|$|Task: To take a <b>run-down</b> rental {{property}} of current equal rental value and transform them using products bought from B Both teams were given €2,500 to spend.|$|E
25|$|Local {{photographer}} Harry Goodwin {{was hired}} to provide shots of non-appearing artists, and also to provide backdrops for the chart <b>run-down.</b> He would continue in the role until 1973.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, LT Bobbi Hovis {{volunteered to}} go to Vietnam, where she and four other nurses were tasked with {{converting}} a <b>run-down</b> Saigon apartment into the first US Navy Station Hospital—in four days.|$|E
25|$|The {{revival of}} the Docklands has had major effects in <b>run-down</b> {{surrounding}} areas. Greenwich and Deptford are undergoing large-scale redevelopment, chiefly {{as a result of}} the improved transport links making them more attractive to commuters.|$|E
25|$|The two additional, partly built H class {{locomotives}} remained incomplete while wartime {{production of}} armaments (and later postwar rebuilding of badly <b>run-down</b> infrastructure) took precedence over express passenger locomotive construction. They were never completed, and the parts were subsequently scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Show writer Steven Bochco {{attended}} {{college at the}} Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh. The <b>run-down,</b> shabby, drug-ridden impression of Pittsburgh's Hill District that Bochco acquired was apparently part of {{the inspiration for the}} show.|$|E
25|$|The {{railway station}} {{is on the}} line between London and Birmingham.Chiltern Railways have created an inter-city route out of the <b>run-down</b> {{remnants}} of what had become primarily a goods line.
