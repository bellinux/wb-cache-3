5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and <b>rattail</b> offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
5|$|The Pandurs {{arrived in}} Vienna for a {{military}} parade for the empress on 27 May 1741. The unit was headed by Trenck and included two captains, a senior lieutenant, five lieutenants, a quartermaster, an adjutant, two chaplains (a Catholic and an Orthodox Christian), two medics, 40 sergeants, five scribes, 80 corporals and twelve musicians equipped with flutes, a drum and cymbals. The musicians were called the Turkish band, after Ottoman military bands, and are considered pioneers of martial music in Europe according to Jurica Miletić. The Pandurs did not have specific uniforms—their clothes varied but were of Turkish style. Their oriental appearance was compounded by mandatory head shaving, leaving a <b>rattail,</b> {{as well as by}} the use of a horse tail bunchuk instead of a unit banner. Each Pandur carried four single-shot pistols, a fighting knife and a small knife.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Voices Carry" [...] was {{directed}} by D.J. Webster, and filmed at Dorchester's Strand Theater, Davio's Restaurant, and W. Brookline St in Boston. The clip incorporates dialogue and acting, and resembles a mini-movie. The plot centers on the band's lead singer, Aimee Mann, who appears as a musician with an abusive boyfriend, played by actor Cully Holland. He mistreats her for playing in a rock band, and demands that she change her look to fit in his upper-class lifestyle. The video uses spoken dialogue in between to interrupt the musical parts, including Mann's boyfriend demanding: [...] "Why can't you for once do something for me?". At the end, the couple attend a concert at Carnegie Hall where the boyfriend is angered to notice part of Mann's <b>rattail</b> sticking {{out from under her}} cap. At her breaking point, Mann lashes out at him, jumping up from her seat in the audience and yelling the lyrics—"He said, shut up! He said, shut up! Oh God, can't you keep it down?..."—as she removes her cap to reveal her spiky, rat-tailed hair, while the boyfriend now hides his face in embarrassment {{and the rest of the}} audience watches in shock.|$|E

500|$|The most {{dramatic}} deterioration has {{been caused by}} biological factors. It used to be thought that {{the depths of the}} ocean were a lifeless desert, but research carried out since the mid-1980s has found that the ocean floor is teeming with life and may rival the tropical rainforests for biodiversity. During the 1991 IMAX expedition, scientists were surprised by the variety of organisms that they found in and around Titanic. A total of 28 species were observed, including sea anemones, crabs, shrimp, starfish, and <b>rattail</b> fish up to a yard (1 m) long. Much larger creatures have been glimpsed by explorers. Some of Titanics fauna has never been seen anywhere else; James Cameron's 2001 expedition discovered a previously unknown type of sea cucumber, lavender with a glowing row of phosphorescent [...] "portholes" [...] along its side. A newly discovered species of rust-eating bacterium found on the ship has been named Halomonas titanicae, which has been found to cause rapid decay of the wreck. Henrietta Mann, who discovered the bacteria, has estimated that the Titanic will completely collapse possibly as soon as 2025. The Canadian geophysicist Steve Blasco has commented that the wreck [...] "has become an oasis, a thriving ecosystem sitting in a vast desert." [...] In mid 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the Institut Laue-Langevin demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [...] Halomonas titanicae to survive the osmotic pressure that causes salt water on their membranes. Analysis by Henrietta Mann and Bhavleen Kaur, both of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in conjunction with other scientists and researchers of the University of Seville in Spain, has determined that the wreck of Titanic will not exist by 2037 and that preservation of Titanic is impossible. [...] "Unfortunately, because Titanic is 2.3 miles down, it is very difficult or impossible to preserve. It is film which will preserve it for history now," [...] says Mann. [...] "It has already lasted for 100 years, but eventually there will be nothing left but a rust stain {{on the bottom of the}} Atlantic... I think Titanic has maybe 15 or 20 years left. I don't think it will have too much longer than that." [...] Other scientists have estimated that Titanic will last no longer than 14 years, as of 2017.|$|E
