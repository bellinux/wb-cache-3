40|$|SUMMARY Hollander's insulin {{test was}} {{evaluated}} by performing successively partial denervation of the parietal cell area, highly selective, selective, and truncal vagotomy operations on three dogs. The <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity, {{the timing of}} the highest <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity, and the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acid output were examined. The mean <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity (m-equiv/l) before vagotomy (106 ± SEl 1, 120 i 23, 60 ± 16) did not differ significantly from those obtained after partial denervation (67 ± SE 14, 125 ± 12, 45 ± 12). After selective vagotomy, a presumed complete denervation, the <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> acidity were significantly lower (0 + 0 1, 2. 5 ± 4, 0 ± 9). The Hollander test, however, was occasionally negative before any nerves had been divided, and was positive in 200 % of tests after presumed complete parietal cell denervation. The highest <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity before vagotomy most commonly occurred 30 minutes after insulin, and following partial denervation this rise occurred significantly later, most commonly at 60 minutes. After the other operations there was no consistent timing. The <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> insulin-stimulated acid output after presumed complete denervation provided near complete discrimination between innervated and denervated stomachs, and its repeatability as assessed by the coefficient of variation was significantly better than the repeatability of <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> acidity...|$|R

5|$|Coinciding {{with this}} {{cultural}} reemergence was {{the establishment of}} the Istanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the International Istanbul Film Festival and the Istanbul International Jazz Festival in the early 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and dance, the Istanbul Festival has been known as the Istanbul International Music Festival since 1994. The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the Istanbul Biennial, held every two years since 1987. Its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art, and it has since opened to international artists and <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> prestige to join the elite biennales, alongside the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Art Biennial.|$|E
5|$|Dacre Castle was {{probably}} built by Margaret Multon, {{the wife of}} Ralph Dacre, {{in the middle of}} the 14th century. The Dacre family had <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> prominence in Cumbria during the 12th and early 13th centuries, and William Dacre, Ralph's father, had acquired a licence to crenellate the property of Dunmallogt in 1307, quite close to the future site of Dacre Castle. Ralph married Margaret in 1317, becoming extremely wealth as a result, and received permission to found Naworth Castle in 1335. Margaret built Dacre Castle at some point between Ralph's death in 1339 and 1354, with the intention of creating a fortified home. Many tower houses were built across the region during the period in response to the threat of Scottish raids and invasions. There may have been an older building already on the site, possibly moated, but this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In winter 546/7, {{when the}} new Byzantine {{governor}} and commander-in-chief, John Troglita, arrived in Africa, Cutzinas and his followers joined him, and participated in the expedition that saw the defeat and submission of Antalas. Shortly after, Cutzinas received the supreme Roman military rank of magister militum from Troglita. In the summer of 547 Cutzinas accompanied Troglita in his campaign against the Tripolitanian tribes under Carcasan. Before the Battle of Marta he advocated attacking the rebel forces, but the Byzantine army was heavily defeated by Carcasan and Antalas, who had once more <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> revolt. In the same winter, Cutzinas quarreled with another pro-Byzantine Berber leader, Ifisdaias. Their dispute threatened to spill over into open armed conflict, but the intervention of Troglita prevented this and the official John effected a reconciliation between the two.|$|E

5|$|Lord Walder Frey {{receives}} {{word that}} Riverrun has been retaken by Brynden Tully, {{commonly known as}} the Blackfish, Catelyn Stark's uncle and a staunchly loyal officer in Robb Stark's army. Walder chastises his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers, who had been ordered to hold the castle. They defend their loss, as several Riverlords, including House Mallister and House Blackwood, have <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> rebellion against the Freys, and the Brotherhood Without Banners are raiding their supply lines and camps. Walder demands that the Tully stronghold be taken back, refusing to be humiliated by not being able to hold a single castle. He orders his men to bring in Edmure Tully, held as a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding, and declares that they will use him to retake Riverrun.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1873, a United States {{military}} commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island {{in exchange for}} the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S. At that time Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. U.S. control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.|$|E
5|$|In 1021/22, however, Xiphias, now {{posted at}} Caesarea as strategos of the Anatolic Theme, fell out with Basil II {{because he was}} not allowed to {{accompany}} the Emperor on his campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia. Xiphias allied himself against the Emperor with the magnate Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, whose father had <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> revolt {{in the early years of}} Basil II's reign. The two men planned to kill Basil, and that one of them should take his place; who it would be remained undecided, but it was mainly Phokas' name and followers that lent the conspiracy weight. The conspiracy was apparently also known and supported by King George I of Georgia, who thus hoped to force Basil to abandon his invasion. When the emperor learned of the plot, however, he did not turn back, but instead sent letters to the two rebel leaders separately, aiming to sow distrust between them. Basil's ploy bore fruit very soon, for on 15 August 1022, Xiphias assassinated Phokas. The latter's supporters dispersed, and the nascent rebellion collapsed. Xiphias was then forced to surrender to the Emperor's envoy, Theophylact Dalassenos, who became the new strategos of the Anatolics.|$|E

40|$|The skill premium in the United States {{has gone}} up {{significantly}} between the 1960 ’s and the 2000 ’s. During the same period, individual wage volatility has also increased. Using a model that incorporates the technology-education race model of Tinbergen (1974) into a standard incomplete markets model, this paper shows that the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> individual wage risk is an important contributor to the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> skill premium. Depending on the decomposition method, the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> wage risk explains 9 % or 17 % of the total <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> skill premium between the 1960 ’s and the 2000 ’s...|$|R

5|$|Manuel is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in 978, when he led the defence of Nicaea against the rebel general Bardas Skleros, who had risen up against Emperor Basil II (reigned 976–1025). Although his great-granddaughter, the princess Anna Komnene, claims in her Alexiad that he had been named strategos autokrator (commander-in-chief) of the East and sent with full powers to deal with the revolt, it is far more likely that he was merely a local commander. Manuel maintained the city's defence with some success, even though the besiegers managed to undermine and collapse one of its towers, until the lack of food became acute. At that point Manuel was able to fool Skleros, by pretending that he had mountains of wheat and was considering joining him, into allowing him and the inhabitants to depart freely for Constantinople. Manuel re-appears in 989, when he was sent as an envoy to Skleros, who had once more <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> revolt against Basil II, to persuade him to surrender. Manuel was successful in his task, and the elderly rebel ended his revolt and gave himself up on 11 October. The titles by which he is recorded were patrikios, anthypatos, and vestes.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 68, amidst growing {{opposition}} of the Senate and the army, Nero committed suicide, and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, during which the four most influential generals in the Roman EmpireGalba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasiansuccessively vied for the imperial power. News of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of Jerusalem. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis (modern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor. Before reaching Italy however, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> revolt, and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by {{one side or the}} other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> importance.|$|E
40|$|Several {{forms of}} {{psychological}} stress result <b>in</b> a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> body temperature in rats.

These data {{support the hypothesis that}} stress-induced "hyperthermia" is a regulated <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> temperature (i. e., a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> thermoregulatory "set-point," or fever), and is not simply the result of metabolic changes associated with the stress response itself...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{contrary}} models assert that, for example, a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> expected inflation {{would increase}} current real spending contingent on any nominal rate and hence increase income, limiting the <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the {{nominal interest rate}} that {{would be necessary to}} re-equilibrate money demand with money supply at any time.
