500|$|The {{greatest}} anatomical {{impediment to}} wheeled multicellular organisms is {{the interface between}} the static and <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly axle) {{must be able to}} rotate freely relative {{to the rest of the}} machine or organism. Unlike animal joints, which have a limited range of motion, a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be [...] "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism). There are several functional problems created by this requirement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{source of}} {{coefficients}} {{is coming out}} {{from the fact that}} <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> will in fact change the fluid properties, because of vibrations (compressibility of the flow change). So if one wants to correct the fuel flow then a theta correction exponent should be found through iterations, but for corrections for flow at engine entry (W2) then this aspect on <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> vibration is not accounted because much smaller than one inside an engine. As a consequence the inlet flow is corrected just by square root of Theta and divided by delta.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This paper investigates {{rotation}} routines {{that will}} produce uncorrelated <b>rotated</b> principal <b>components</b> for a dataset of stock returns, {{in an attempt}} to identify the macroeconomic factors that best explain the variability among risk-adjusted stock returns on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. An alternative to the more traditional rotation approaches is used, which creates subsets of principal components with similar variances that are rotated in turn. It is found that only one of the three normalisation constraints examined can retain uncorrelated principal components after rotation. The results also show that when subspaces of <b>components</b> are <b>rotated</b> that have close eigenvalues, the different rotation criteria used to <b>rotate</b> principal <b>components</b> will produce similar results. After rotating the suitable subsets using varimax rotation, it is found that the first <b>rotated</b> <b>component</b> {{can be explained by the}} African Industrials sector, the second <b>rotated</b> <b>component</b> is related to the African Consumer Services sector while the third <b>rotated</b> <b>component</b> shows a significant relationship to the African Finance factor...|$|R

50|$|A {{dog clutch}} {{is a type}} of clutch that couples two {{rotating}} shafts or other <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> not by friction but by interference. The two parts of the clutch are designed such that one will push the other, causing both to rotate at the same speed and will never slip.|$|E
5000|$|Impeller: The impeller, either elastomer, {{stainless}} steel or high-chrome material, {{is the main}} <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> which normally has vanes to impart the centrifugal force to the liquid.|$|R

25|$|Because {{of their}} role as a <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> {{and the risk of}} {{cracking}} and failure due to engine vibration, spinners require regular inspection, particularly of the back plate as well as the spinner dome itself.|$|R
50|$|The word spin is {{frequently}} {{used in this}} context without implying that the rotation is rapid. Making a mirror with a focal length of five metres, for example, requires a rotation speed less than ten revolutions per minute. Since the speed is low, accurate dynamic balancing of the <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> is not needed.|$|E

It produces about [...] of boost pressure.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} a propeller, a screw is a device that uses sloped {{surfaces}} to transition rotational motion created by the steam engine into an axial force that moves the vessel forward. Systems that use propellers are regarded as more efficient than comparative paddle-wheels due to the reduced weight of <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> and smaller equipment footprint.|$|E
50|$|Run-out is {{dynamic and}} cannot be compensated. If a <b>{{rotating}}</b> <b>component,</b> {{such as a}} drill chuck, does not hold the drill centrally, then as it rotates the rotating drill will turn about a secondary axis.|$|R
50|$|Typically run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} pressed against the <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> while it is turned. Total indicated run-out (TIR) is a technician's term for the measured run-out of any rotating system, including all forms of run-out, at the measured point.|$|R

50|$|A {{rotary phase}} {{converter}} is a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and {{power factor correction}} that produces balanced three-phase voltages. When properly designed, these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source. In such a device, the energy storage is performed by the inertia (flywheel effect) of the <b>rotating</b> <b>components.</b> An external flywheel is sometimes found on one or {{both ends of the}} shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic {{displacement}} {{air compressors}} include centrifugal compressors and axial compressors. In these types, a <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> imparts its kinetic {{energy to the}} air which is eventually converted into pressure energy. These use centrifugal force generated by a spinning impeller to accelerate and then decelerate captured air, which pressurizes it.|$|R

5000|$|Its {{primary use}} is as a balance weight which {{is added to}} the {{crankshaft}} of an automotive engine, where the existing counterweight is not large enough to compensate for the weight of the reciprocating and <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> attached to the crankshaft's connecting rod journals.Rather than add to the counterweight by welding or fabrication, holes are drilled in structurally safe positions in the counterweights, and [...] "slugs" [...] (cylindrical dowels) of Mallory metal are inserted and fastened securely.|$|E
40|$|The main form of machine’s working {{principle}} is rotation. The mechanical properties of <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> are significant importance {{to improve the}} machine’s reliability. In the measurement, the difficult thing is to transmit signals form sensors on a rotor to a stationary part. In this paper, using the FBG’s(Fibre Bragg Gauge) properties of wireless transmission, author measure the local strains of rotating cantilever beam cantilever by utilizing the strain principle gauge FBG(Fibre Bragg Gauge) and the rotary signal transmit equipment,. The result of analysis showed that rotating cantilever have complicate dynamic phenomenon, dynamic strain not only related to speed but also related to fluid action, the dynamic stiffing phenomenon were observe in the same time.

40|$|The {{instability}} {{modes of}} the infinitesimally thin self-gravitating disk, which {{is composed of}} rotating and non-rotating parts, are investigated. By solving the dispersion relation numerically under various physical situations, two growing modes are found. They are the modified Jeans mode of <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> or non-rotating one and the Landau mode by wave-particle (non-rotating component) interactions. Possible relevances to spiral arms are discussed briefly...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} the orbits and stellar parameters of three eccentric eclipsing binaries by light curve solutions of their Kepler data. KIC 8111622 and KIC 10518735 undergo total eclipses while KIC 8196180 reveals partial eclipses. The target components are G and K stars, excluding the primary of KIC 8196180 which is early F star. KIC 8196180 reveals well-visible tidally-induced feature at periastron, i. e. {{it is an}} eclipsing heartbeat star. The characteristics of the observed periastron feature (shape, width and amplitude) confirm the theoretical predictions. There are additional out-of-eclipse variations of KIC 8196180 with the orbital period which {{may be explained by}} spot activity of synchronously <b>rotating</b> <b>component.</b> Besides worse visible periastron feature KIC 811162 exhibits small amplitude light variations whose period is around 2. 3 times shorter than the orbital one. These oscillations were attributed to spot(s) on asynchronously <b>rotating</b> <b>component.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space Science. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1707. 0248...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{intended}} to be another of Johnson's famous organs, this device was adapted into a mail sorter (through such implements as a hopper {{and the presence of}} imps) in his continual striving for functional improvement.

50|$|When this ride is activated, {{multiple}} movements occur. The {{arm assembly}} rotates, the main arm is raised from the stationay position to an angle of approximately seventy {{degrees from the}} horizontal. Once this height is reached, the main arm is capable of rotating, with the combined rotations of both sections causing the seat sets to swing and rotate around the point of attachment. The <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> can move in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions, and the different movements can be activated in isolation of each other.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the pusher propfan with a free power turbine is its simplicity. The prop blades are attached directly {{to the outside of}} the rotating turbine disc. No gearboxes or drive shafts are required. The short length of the <b>rotating</b> <b>components</b> also reduces vibration. The static structure of the engine over this length is a large diameter tube within the turbine. In most designs, two contra-rotating rings of turbine and propeller are used. Intermeshed contra-rotating turbines can act as the guide vanes for each other, removing the need for static vanes.|$|E
30|$|Interpreting {{the factor}} analysis, it is {{apparent}} that the <b>rotated</b> <b>component</b> 1 accounts for the highest proportion of variance. Examining the items with the highest loadings this factor seems to be representing the concept of life satisfaction. Component 2 is for the most part examining negative personal relations, and component 3 could be labelled positive personal relations, although it had fewer than four items uniquely loading on it.|$|R

50|$|Axial run-out is {{the result}} of a <b>rotating</b> <b>component</b> not being {{parallel}} with the axis, such as a drill chuck not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less tolerant of axial run-out since the tool tip tends to dig in and further increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of axial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced less.|$|R
