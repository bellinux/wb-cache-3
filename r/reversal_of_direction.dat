2500|$|The {{objective}} in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than [...] "carry" [...] (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes {{the right side}} of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as [...] "riding the rail" [...] among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball moves down the row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as [...] "mixing"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.|$|E

60|$|In these ways, then, {{compromise}} may mean, not acquiescence in an instalment, on {{the ground}} that the time is not ripe to yield us more than an instalment, but either the acceptance of the instalment as final, followed by the virtual abandonment of hope and effort; or else it may mean a mistaken <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> which augments the distance that has ultimately to be traversed. In either of these senses, the small reform may become the enemy of the great one. But a right conception of political method, based on a rightly interpreted experience of the conditions on which societies unite progress with order, leads the wise conservative to accept the small change, lest a worse thing befall him, and the wise innovator to seize the chance of a small improvement, while incessantly working in the direction of great ones. The important thing is that throughout the process neither of them should lose sight of his ultimate ideal; nor fail to look at the detail {{from the point of view}} of the whole; nor allow the near particular to bulk so unduly large as to obscure the general and distant.|$|E

50|$|The <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> images by a {{plane mirror}} is {{perceived}} differently {{depending on the}} circumstances. In many cases, the image in a mirror appears to be reversed from left to right. If a flat mirror is mounted on the ceiling it can appear to reverse up and down if a person stands under it {{and looks up at}} it. Similarly a car turning left will still appear to be turning left in the rear view mirror for the driver of a car in front <b>of</b> it. The <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>directions,</b> or lack thereof, depends on how the directions are defined. More specifically a mirror changes the handedness of the coordinate system, one axis of the coordinate system appears to be reversed, and the chirality of the image may change. For example, the image of a right shoe will look like a left shoe.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{observe that}} {{characters}} in GA's world are multifaceted, {{but they are}} not independent. They lead their lives as if they are puppets guided by an unseen hand and are unable to change the direction. Why they follow that path to their demise or why they cannot change it by their volition is not known. In that sense, his work is a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> fostered by the modernist short story in Marathi. GA's earlier short stories depicted the tragic and cruel aspects of the human situation. His later works were almost Kafkaesque, without Kafka-like black humour. Some of his later works were allegorical and reminiscent of Borges.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} Triton X- 100 {{extracted}} model of Paramecium caudatum were prepared {{and effects of}} the ionic compositions of the reactivating medium on the swimming behaviour of the extracted models were examined. Type I, prepared by the method of Naitoh and Kaneko, did not change swimming direction depending on the concentrations of Mgt+ and K+ in the reactivating medium. Type II, prepared by a different method, however, reversed the swimming direction depending on the concentrations of Mgl+ and K+ in the reactivating medium, even when the concentration of Ca 2 + was kept at an extremely low level (below io" 8 M). Decreasing the concentration of Mg 1 + induced the type II model to swim backwards. Intracellular injection of EDTA into a live paramecium cell induced <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> ciliary beat.

5000|$|As shown above, also Laguerre's {{transformation}} by reciprocal directions or half-lines - {{later called}} Laguerre inversion - {{in the form}} given by Darboux (1887) leaves the expression [...] invariant. Subsequently, the relation to the Lorentz transformation was noted by several authors. For instance, Bateman (1910) argued that this transformation (which he attributed to Ribaucour) is [...] "identical" [...] to the Lorentz transformation. In particular, he argued (1912) that the variant given by Darboux (1887) corresponds to the Lorentz transformation in [...] direction, if , , and the [...] terms are replaced by velocities. Bateman (1910) also sketched geometric representations of relativistic light spheres using such spherical systems. However, Kubota (1925) responded to Bateman by arguing that the Laguerre inversion is involutory whereas the Lorentz transformation is not.

50|$|Original {{proposals}} for the HBLR {{called for a}} terminus at the New Jersey Turnpike Vince Lombardi Park-and-Ride in Ridgefield in Bergen County. Despite its name, it currently operates only in Hudson County. Service began its initial operating segment in April 2000, expanded in phases during the next decade, and was completed {{with the opening of}} its southern terminus on January 31, 2011. The line generally runs parallel to the Hudson River and Upper New York Bay, while its western branch and its northern end and travel through the lower Hudson Palisades. HBLR has twenty-four stations along a total trackage length of just over 21 mi and serves over 40,000 weekday passengers. From it southern terminus at 8th Street in Bayonne the HBLR travels through Jersey City, Hoboken, and North Hudson to its current northern terminus at Tonnelle Avenue.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that, for convolutionally coded {{transmission}} over bandwidth-constrained channels, a mere <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the switching <b>direction</b> at the encoder output produces {{a change in}} the system bit error probability performance. This change is significant when the Viterbi demodulator/decoder is matched to the total channel memory and is more significant for linear channels than for nonlinear ones. The <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> switching <b>direction</b> is a simple demonstration {{of the fact that the}} well-known optimum codes for the linear AGWN channel are no longer necessarily optimum for a bandwidth-constrained channel with or without the addition of channel nonlinearity. It is concluded that potentially significant performance improvement can be obtained by matching the encoder (through the appropriate choice of tap weights and modulo- 2 summers) to the channel in addition to matching the demodulator/decoder to the channel for a given encoder...|$|R

5000|$|The {{incoming}} ray {{is reflected}} three times, once by each surface, {{which results in}} a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction.</b> [...] To see this, the three corresponding normal vectors of the corner's perpendicular sides can be considered to form a basis (a rectangular coordinate system) (x, y, z) in which to represent the direction of an arbitrary incoming ray, b,. When the ray reflects from the first side, say x, the ray's x component, a, is reversed to −a while the y and z components are unchanged, resulting in a direction of b,. Similarly, when reflected from side y and finally from side z, the b and c components are reversed. Therefore, the ray direction goes from b, to b, to −b, to −b,, and it leaves the corner reflector with all three components of direction exactly reversed. The distance travelled, relative to a plane normal to {{the direction of the}} rays, is also equal for any ray entering the reflector, regardless of the location where it first reflects.|$|E
50|$|The first {{official}} {{use of the}} name Cambrian Coast Express was in 1927 when the train ran only on summer Fridays and Saturdays. By 1939 the through train was running only on summer Saturdays. It left London Paddington at 10:20 with calls at Leamington Spa, Birmingham Snow Hill, and Wolverhampton Low Level which was reached at 12:44. Here, owing to weight restrictions over the Cambrian line, the GWR Castle Class 4-6-0 locomotive was changed for two GWR Duke Class 4-4-0 engines or for a GWR Manor Class 4-6-0 for the non-stop run to Welshpool using the Shrewsbury Abbey Foregate curve (to avoid a stop and <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> at Shrewsbury). Beyond Welshpool, calls were made at Machynlleth, Dovey Junction and Borth to reach Aberystwyth at 15:55, a total of 5 hours 35 minutes for the 235 mi journey from London. In the reverse direction the journey was 25 minutes longer, at six hours; departing Aberystwyth at 10:00 with an additional stop at Newtown, but with otherwise unchanged station calls, and locomotive change at Wolverhampton. The train became the 14:00 departure from Birmingham to arrive at Paddington at 16:00.|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to appraise whether an increased amniotic fluid pressure by polyhydramnios can beneficially affect monochorionic twins that are haemodynamically connected by arterio-venous plus arterio-arterial placental anastomoses. We assessed the effects of polyhydramnios in monochorionic twin placentas, combining (a) data from previous in vitro placental perfusion experiments in singleton term placentas under simulated normal and increased amniotic fluid pressures with (b) logical deduction from observations made in monochorionic twins. Our hypothesis is that in monochorionic placentas, an increased amniotic fluid pressure increases the placental microvascular resistance but not the resistance of placental chorionic plate arteries. Hence, an increased amniotic fluid pressure increases the microvascular resistance of the joint cotyledon, the arterio-venous resistance, but not the arterioarterial resistance. This proposed mechanism reduces arterio-venous but not oppositely directed arterio-arterial transfusion. Therefore, <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the normal <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> net foeto-foetal transfusion may develop, which will reduce the circulatory imbalance that evolved between the monochorionic foetal twins. In contrast, in monochorionic twins connected by unidirectional or bidirectional arterio-venous anastomoses <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the normal <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> net foeto-foetal transfusion will not occur. In conclusion, <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the normal <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> net foeto-foetal transfusion, induced by polyhydramnios, is protective against the onset and severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome in monochorionic twins connected by arterio-venous plus arterio-arterial anastomoses, but not by unidirectional or bidirectional arterio-venous anastomose...|$|R
