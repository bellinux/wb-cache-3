5|$|Scientists once {{believed}} that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology, including {{the size of the}} mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion, which had the thickest, most extensive manes amongst wild lions. <b>Research</b> <b>results</b> indicate that environmental factors such as average ambient temperature influence the colour and size of a lion's mane. The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies. The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions.|$|E

The implementation of the <b>research</b> <b>result</b> towards biology learning process in the Xth grade of senior high school was a quasi-experimental research. The independent variable in this research is the modul-based learning source whereas the dependent variable is the interpreting data skill. The population of the fungal identification in taro tape (colocasia esculenta) was all the fungal in taro tape. The population of the implementation of the <b>research</b> <b>result</b> towards the learning process of fungal chapter was all of the students of the Xth grade of SMA Al Islam 1 Surakarta Academic Year 2011 / 2012. The sample of the implementation of the <b>research</b> <b>result</b> towards the learning process of fungal chapter of Biology subject consisted of two classes, i. e. control and experiment class.
