Pseudostationary segments of voiced sounds are used for feature selection. Parameters of the linear prediction model (LPC) of vocal tract and residue sig-nal or LPC derived cepstral parameters are used as features for speaker recognition. Speaker iden-tification is performed by applying nearest neighbour rule to average distance between speakers. Comparison of distributions of intraindividual and interindividual distortions is used for speaker verification. Speaker recognition performance is investigated. Results of experiments demonstrate speaker recognition performance.

30|$|A {{preliminary}} study was previously presented in [19], where we {{concentrated on the}} system’s description and on the PAPR simulation results. In this paper, we extend the performance analysis of the proposed scheme to the PAPR reduction, the complexity, the transmission bandwidth, etc. We will evaluate its performance in comparison with conventional OFDM and PTS-OFDM. The hardware complexity of the proposed scheme will be also discussed. Unlike [14 – 18], we utilize <b>residue</b> <b>signals</b> to present transmitted signals so as to reduce the PAPR at the transmitter in OFDM multicarrier systems. When an RNS-based transmission scheme is employed in OFDM, {{one of the big}} advantages is that the dynamic range of the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) output is limited by the corresponding modulus due to the characteristic of RNS modular operation. The main principle of the proposed scheme is to utilize the parallel property of RNS to divide the original frequency band into V equal portions and to convert the input signals into V smaller residues using the corresponding modulus set. Then, these V <b>residue</b> <b>signals</b> are preformed modulations (in particular, OFDM in this paper) in the corresponding V <b>residue</b> subchannels. <b>Signals</b> of each <b>residue</b> subchannel share the original frequency band through frequency division multiplexing (FDM). Specifically, the value of the corresponding modulus determines the dynamic range of the output in each residue subchannel. When the number of subcarriers is large, the proposed scheme is still able to limit the transmitted signals within a small dynamic range and reduce PAPR without nonlinear distortion. It is demonstrated that the PAPR performance has been improved by more than 5 dB compared with conventional OFDM. We also find that the proposed scheme outperforms PTS-OFDM in computational complexity.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{millions}} of pictures are shared {{through the internet}} without applying any authentication system. This may cause serious problems, particularly in situations where the digital image {{is an important component}} of the decision making process for example, child pornography and movie piracy. Motivated by this, the present research investigates the performance of estimating Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) and developing new estimation approaches to improve the performance of digital source camera identification. The PRNU noise is a sensor pattern noise characterizing the imaging device. Nonetheless, the PRNU estimation procedure is faced with the presence of image-dependent information as well as other non-unique noise components. This thesis primarily focuses on efficiently estimating the physical PRNU components during different stages. First, an image sharpening technique is proposed as a pre-processing approach for source camera identification. The sharpening method aims to amplify the PRNU components for better estimation. In the estimation stage, a new weighted averaging (WA) technique is presented. Most existing PRNU techniques estimate PRNU using the constant averaging of <b>residue</b> <b>signals</b> extracted from a set of images. However, treating all <b>residue</b> <b>signals</b> equally through constant averaging is optimal only if they carry undesirable noise of the same variance. Moreover, an improved version of the locally adaptive discrete cosine transform (LADCT) filter is proposed in the filtering stage to reduce the effect of scene details on noise residues. Finally, the post-estimation stage consists of combining the PRNU estimated from each colour plane aims to reduce the effect of colour interpolation and increasing the amount of physical PRNU components. The aforementioned techniques have been assessed on two image datasets acquired by several camera devices. Experimental results have shown a significant improvement obtained with the proposed enhancements over related state-of-the-art systems. Nevertheless, in this thesis the experiments are not including images taken with various acquisition different resolutions to evaluate the effect of these settings on PRNU performance. Moreover, images captured by scanners, cell phones can be included for a more comprehensive work. Another limitation is that investigating how the improvement may change with JPEG compression or gamma correction.

Three neural network predictors, namely, single-layer perceptron (SLP), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and Elman network (EN), and two linear predictors, namely, autoregressive model (AR) and finite-impulse response filter (FIR) are used. For all the predictors, uniform quantization is applied on the <b>residue</b> <b>signals</b> obtained as the difference between the original and the predicted values. The maximum allowable reconstruction error delta is varied to determine the theoretical bound delta(0) for near-lossless compression and the corresponding bit rate r(p). It is shown that among all the predictors, the SLP yields the best results in achieving the lowest values for delta(0) and r(p). The corresponding values of the fidelity parameters, namely, percent of root-mean-square difference, peak SNR and cross correlation are also determined. A compression efficiency of 82. 8 % is achieved using the SLP with a near-lossless bound delta(0) = 3, with the diagnostic quality of the reconstructed EEG signal preserved.

Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptors were cultured on the pattern-immobilized film. Pattern-immobilized insulin did not enhance cell adhesion but transduced {{a signal to}} the cells through phosphorylation of tyrosine <b>residues</b> of <b>signal</b> proteins. In addition, only cells on immobilized insulin grew in medium containing no serum. The enhancement of cell growth was considered to be a consequence of signal transduction. This microprocessing technique is useful for investigating the effect of immobilized biosignal molecules and for constructing new tissue engineering materials. © 1997 Federation of European Biochemical Societies...|$|R
