It {{was carried out in}} Berlin, where some of the pupils started at a Gymnasium after the 4th grade, while others stayed in primary school until 6th grade and started at different schools after the 6th grade.

50|$|<b>Regression</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} {{earliest}} such approaches to be developed. The data used to construct or discover a predictive relationship are called the training data set. Most approaches that search through training data for empirical relationships tend to overfit the data, meaning that they can identify apparent relationships in the training data that do not hold in general. A test set is a set of data that is independent of the training data, but that follows the same probability distribution as the training data. If a model fit to the training set also fits the test set well, minimal overfitting has taken place. A better fitting of the training set as opposed to the test set usually points to overfitting.|$|E
50|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} extracted data and results, a correlation between Flutrack’s and Google Flu Trends’ datasets hat to be examined. All tweets, from both data providers, were geolocated in the U.S. and extracted from December 2, 2012 to April 7, 2013. The location was chosen {{based on the fact}} that the query counts of Google Flu Trends are compared with reliable sources, such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other traditional flu surveillance systems for the U.S. The scatter plot of the normalized population of tweets both from Google Flu Trends and the Flutrack platform was plotted. To quantify the degree of the observed linear relation between the normalized uploads of the two social media, a linear <b>regression</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> performed. The corresponding coefficient of determination was estimated to be 0.79 thus showing a high degree of correlation between Google Flu Trends and the Flutrack platform.|$|E
