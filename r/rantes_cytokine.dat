40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: To measure {{multiple}} cytokine and chemokine {{production in}} tears of myopic patients {{before and after}} laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and in human corneal fibroblast (HCF) cultures before and after excimer laser treatment. SETTING: Department of Neuroscience, Ophthalmology Unit, University of Padua, Italy and Vissum-Instituto de Oftalmológico de Alicante, Alicante, Spain METHODS: Tear samples were obtained from 15 myopic patients before LASIK and 1 and 24 hours after LASIK. Quiescent HCF cultures were treated using the same laser energy. Culture medium was collected before treatment and after 1 and 24 hours. Cytokine concentrations were determined using multiplexed bead analysis. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, interleukin (IL) - 12 tear levels were significantly increased 1 hour after surgery and eotaxin levels were significantly increased at 24 hours (both P<. 05). Culture medium of HCF contained high levels of IL- 6, IL- 8, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) - 1 {{and low levels of}} IL- 1, eotaxin, and regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted (<b>RANTES)</b> <b>cytokine.</b> One hour after treatment, levels of all cytokines were significantly reduced. At 24 hours, IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, and MCP- 1 levels were significantly increased compared with values at baseline and at 1 hour while <b>RANTES</b> <b>cytokine</b> and eotaxin levels had returned to baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo and in vitro studies showed that after excimer laser treatment, cytokines are released to modulate the wound-healing process; however, they can potentially induce inflammation. However, these types of in vitro studies, although useful for evaluating changes in cytokine profiles before and after treatment, only partially reproduce in vivo corneal behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathological}} {{features of}} ascending gonococcal infection suggest that proinflammatory mediators secreted by tissue-resident macrophages are important {{components of the}} host response. Challenge of fully differentiated, mature macrophages with variants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain P 9 or purified bacterial surface components (pili, lipooligosaccharide, and outer membrane vesicles) induced the secretion of interleukin 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor alpha, growth-related protein alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP- 1 alpha), and <b>RANTES</b> <b>cytokines</b> but {{had no effect on}} IL- 8 production. No secretion of IL- 1 beta, epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant 78, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL- 10, or IL- 12 cytokines was observed. Notably, the P 9 -Opa(b) protein, in comparison to P 9 -Opa(a), increased the association of gonococci with macrophages and elevated the secretion of cytokines. Thus, variation in Opa protein expression by the gonococcus may be a determining factor in the severity of pelvic inflammatory disease...|$|R
40|$|TNFα induces {{expression}} of the chemoattractant <b>cytokine</b> <b>RANTES</b> in cultured mouse mesangial cells. We investigated the effect of several immune-relevant cytokines on {{expression of}} the chemoattractant intercrine/chemokine RANTES in a mouse mesangial cell line (MMC). Fifty ng/ml recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) induced a marked increase in RANTES transcripts after two hours. RANTES mRNA remained elevated for 24 to 48 hours after stimulation, and could be abolished by co-incubation with 30 µg/ml of a neutralizing rabbit anti-TNFα antibody. Protein expression of RANTES, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blotting, increased in MMCs 24 hours after TNFα stimulation. Interleukin- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFβ), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also increased expression of RANTES mRNA. In addition, RANTES mRNA expression was stimulated in glomeruli harvested from rats following renal in vivo perfusion with TNFα. Our results indicate that mesangial cells produce the small <b>cytokine</b> <b>RANTES.</b> This factor, in concert with other chemoattractants, {{may play a role}} in the glomerular recruitment of inflammatory cells like macrophages/monocytes...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) mediate immunologic selection pressure by both cytolytic and noncytolytic mechanisms. Non cytolytic mechanisms include {{the release of}} β-chemokines blocking entry of R 5 HIV- 1 strains. In addition, CD 8 + cells inhibit X 4 virus isolates via release of as yet poorly characterized soluble factors. To further characterize these factors, we performed detailed analysis of CTL as well as bulk CD 8 + T lymphocytes from six HIV- 1 -infected individuals and from six HIV- 1 -seronegative individuals. Kinetic studies revealed that secreted suppressive activities of HIV- 1 -specific CTL and bulk CD 8 + T lymphocytes from all HIV- 1 -infected persons are significantly {{higher than that of}} supernatants from seronegative controls. The suppressive activity could be blocked by monensin and brefeldin A, was heat labile, and appeared in a pattern different from that of secretion of chemokines (MDC, I- 309, MIP- 1 α, MIP- 1 β, and <b>RANTES),</b> <b>cytokines</b> (gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), and interleukins (interleukin- 13 and interleukin- 16). This suppression activity was characterized by molecular size exclusion centrifugation and involves a suppressive activity of > 50 kDa which could be bound to heparin and a nonbinding inhibitory activity of < 50 kDa. Our data provide a functional link between CD 8 + cells and CTL in the noncytolytic inhibition of HIV- 1 and suggest that suppression of X 4 virus is mediated through proteins. The sizes of the proteins, their affinity for heparin, and the pattern of release indicate that these molecules are not chemokines...|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} underlying relationship. OBJECTIVES: Samples of FDOJ were analyzed to assess expression of cytokines which can {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of breast cancer (MaCa). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples of FDOJ extracted from 23 patients with MaCa and 19 healthy control jawbone samples were analyzed for 7 immune messengers. RESULTS: RANTES was found to be highly overexpressed in disease samples. No change was observed in expression levels of the other immune mediators. DISCUSSION: This data provides a compelling confirmation that FDOJ produces high levels of <b>RANTES,</b> a <b>cytokine</b> implicated in MaCa and metasta-sis. Levels detected in FDOJ are five-fold higher than that previously reported for MaCa tissue suggesting its role as a cytokine source in MaCa. CONCLUSION: We thus hypothesize that FDOJ may serve as an expeditor of MaCa progression, through RANTES production...|$|R

The objective was to detect changes in cytokine expression within cochleae in a murine model of systemic inflammation, with or without aminoglycoside exposure. Four groups of mice received 1 of the following: saline only, systemic bac-terial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) for 6 hours to induce endo-toxemia and inflammatory responses, systemic gentamicin for 3 hours, or both treatments. After exsanguination, pooled cochleae (4 /group) were processed for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 16 cytokines. Gentamicin alone did not change cochlear cytokine levels, while LPS (6 gentamicin) substantially elevated cochlear expression of several cytokines, particularly interleukin- 1 a, interleukin- 6, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1, macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 a, and <b>RANTES.</b> Since <b>cytokines</b> increase blood-brain barrier permeability, we hypothesize that cytokine-enhanced permeability of the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) could potentiate aminoglycoside-induced oto-toxicity. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of detecting cytokine expression in murine cochleae using ELISA and facilitates future studies investigating BLB perme-ability in animal models of systemic inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Connective {{tissue growth}} factor (CTGF) is an {{important}} profibrotic factor in kidney diseases. Blockade of endogenous CTGF ameliorates experimental renal damage and inhibits synthesis of extracellular matrix in cultured renal cells. CTGF regulates several cellular responses, including adhesion, migration, proliferation, and synthesis of proinflammatory factors. Here, we investigated whether CTGF participates in the inflammatory process in the kidney by evaluating the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, a key signaling system that controls inflammation and immune responses. Systemic administration of CTGF to mice for 24 h induced marked infiltration of inflammatory cells in the renal interstitium (T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages) and led to elevated renal NF-κB activity. Administration of CTGF increased renal expression of chemokines (MCP- 1 and <b>RANTES)</b> and <b>cytokines</b> (INF-γ, IL- 6, and IL- 4) that recruit immune cells and promote inflammation. Treatment with a NF-κB inhibitor, parthenolide, inhibited CTGF-induced renal inflammatory responses, including the up-regulation of chemokines and cytokines. In cultured murine tubuloepithelial cells, CTGF rapidly activated the NF-κB pathway and the cascade of mitogen-activated protein kinases, demonstrating crosstalk between these signaling pathways. CTGF, via mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB activation, increased proinflammatory gene expression. These data show {{that in addition to}} its profibrotic properties, CTGF contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the kidney by activating the NF-κB pathway...|$|R

Materials and methods: To obtain a qualitative assessment of edentulous jawbone sections, the results from 2 D-OPG with a defined X-ray density (XrDn), expression of the <b>cytokine</b> <b>RANTES</b> (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), and a transalveolar ultrasound system for measuring jawbone density were compared. Results: The difference in the XrDn of healthy jawbone and FDOJ are minimal, whereas RANTES is up to 25 -fold higher in FDOJ. In contrast to 2 D-OPG, transalveolar ultrasound showed coincidental findings in FDOJ areas. Discussion: Comparisons of the data revealed a discrepancy between the XrDn of 2 D-OPGs and the medullary osteopathies in the jawbone like FDOJ. Conclusion: The data suggest that there is a critical attitude toward the use of 2 D-OPG as a sole imaging diagnostic tool for assessing chronic inflammatory processes in the jawbone. Specifically, 2 D-OPG is objectively not suitable for depicting FDOJ. Keywords: osteonecrotic jawbone, silent inflammation, RANTES, bone density measurement ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} NO on expressional regulation of the chemotactic <b>cytokine</b> <b>RANTES</b> (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) during tissue regeneration using an excisional wound-healing model in mice. Wound repair was characterized by a large and sustained induction of RANTES expression, and inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) during repair only slightly decreased RANTES expression levels. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed keratinocytes of the wound margins and the hyperproliferative epithelium {{to be the main}} RANTES-expressing cell type within the wound. Therefore we analysed the regulation of RANTES expression in vitro in cultured human keratinocytes of the cell line HaCaT. Here we demonstrate that NO very efficiently suppressed interleukin- 1 beta- and tumour-necrosis-factor-alpha-induced RANTES expression in keratinocytes. Furthermore, down-regulation of cytokine-induced RANTES mRNA in keratinocytes was dependent on endogenously produced NO, as inhibition of the co-induced iNOS by L-N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine increased cytokine-triggered RANTES expression in the cells. Moreover, we observed strongest RANTES-immunopositive labelling in epithelial areas which were characterized by a NO-mediated low cellularity. Thus our data implicate NO as a negative regulator of RANTES expression during wound repair in vivo, as decreased numbers of keratinocytes observed in the absence of wound-derived NO might compensate for the high levels of RANTES expression which are associated with normal repair...|$|R
40|$|Endometriosis is characterised by {{the growth}} of ectopic lesions at {{multiple}} locations outside the uterine cavity and may be considered a collection of distinct but related conditions. The exact aetiology of endometriosis is still not clear although a role for inflammation is increasingly accepted. We therefore investigated the inflammatory activity of eutopic tissue {{and that of the}} matching ectopic lesions from different locations by measuring the genetic expression of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. The gene expression in matching eutopic and ectopic tissue was compared, as was the gene expression in lesions from different locations. A significantly higher mRNA expression of the chemokines ENA- 78 and <b>RANTES</b> and the <b>cytokines</b> IL- 6 and TNF α was observed in endometriotic lesions of the rectovaginal septum (RVS) compared to that of matching eutopic tissue. Comparisons across lesion locations showed a significantly higher expression of IL- 6 and TNF α in the RVS compared to lesions from either the ovaries or the peritoneum. These results show that the production of some inflammatory chemokines and cytokines is significantly increased in the ectopic endometrial tissue compared to matching eutopic tissue. Furthermore, IL- 6 and TNF α are produced in significantly higher quantities in RVS lesions compared to other lesions...|$|R

METHODS Postmenopausal women (n[*]=[*] 34) not using menopausal hormone therapy and presenting with or without symptoms of vulvovaginal irritation were screened. Each participant underwent a vaginal examination and screening for vaginitis. A cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) with sterile saline and a peripheral blood sample were obtained. Main outcome measures were assessed by Luminex® X-map method on the Bio-Plex® platform. Main outcome measures were cervicovaginal and serum interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 12, IL- 13, TNF-α, GM-CSF, MIP- 1 -alpha and <b>RANTES</b> level. Cervicovaginal <b>cytokines</b> were adjusted to total protein concentration [pg/mcg protein]. RESULTS Twenty-six postmenopausal women were enrolled (symptomatic: n[*]=[*] 15; asymptomatic: n[*]=[*] 11). There {{were no significant differences}} between groups: age, age at menopause, vaginal pH and all CVL and serum cytokines (IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 12, IL- 13, TNF-α, GM-CSF, MIP- 1 -alpha and RANTES).

One is a novel oligospecific receptor with high affinity for Rantes (50 % maximal inhibitory concentration [IC 50], 0. 68 nM) and low affinity (IC 50, 35 nM) for MCP- 1, while {{the other is the}} previously described specific receptor for MCP- 1 (IC 50, 0. 5 nM). Receptor affinity for Rantes is enhanced on preparation of isolated membranes with a 12 -fold decrease in receptor Kd. The basis of this enhancement is not understood. The Rantes receptor appears to be G protein linked, as binding activity is abolished by guanosine 5 '-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (IC 50, 7. 3 nM). In contrast to the consequences of MCP- 1 binding, we were unable to demonstrate ligand-dependent calcium fluxes on binding of Rantes to human monocytes or THP- 1 cells. The binding of Rantes and MCP- 1 to mononuclear cells from dog, rabbit, and rat were tested. While high affinity binding could be demonstrated in dog and rabbit, differences in ligand-induced Ca 2 + fluxes could be shown between species.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which rhinovirus (RV) infections produce lower airway symptoms in asthmatic individuals are not fully established. To determine effects of RV infection on lung epithelial cells, primary human bronchial epithelial (BE) cells were infected with either RV 16 or RV 49, and viral replication, cell viability, and cell activation were measured. Both viral serotypes replicated in BE cells at 33 �C (�TCID 50 / ml � 2 to 2. 5 log units) and at 37 �C (�TCID 50 /ml � 1. 6 log units), but only high doses of RV 49 (10 6 TCID 50 /ml) caused cytopathic effects and reduced cell viability. In addition, regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) secretion was increased in epithelial cells infected with RV 16 or RV 49 (243 and 398 pg/ml versus 13 pg/ml uninfected control cells), and a similar pattern was seen for RANTES messenger RNA. RV infection also caused increased secretion of interleukin- 8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but did not alter expression of either intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 or human leukocyte-associated antigen-DR. These observations suggest that RVs can replicate in lower airway cells in vivo, and support epidemiologic studies that link RV with lower respiratory illnesses.

40|$|Infection {{with human}} {{herpesvirus}} 8 (HHV- 8), {{also known as}} Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) -associated herpesvirus, {{is necessary for the}} development of KS. The HHV- 8 lytic-phase gene ORF 74 is related to G protein-coupled receptors, particularly interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) receptors. ORF 74 activates the inositol phosphate/phospholipase C pathway and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases, JNK/SAPK and p 38. We show here that ORF 74 also activates NF-κB independent of ligand when expressed in KS-derived HHV- 8 -negative endothelial cells or primary vascular endothelial cells. NF-κB activation was enhanced by the chemokine GROα, but not by IL- 8. Mutation of Val to Asp in the ORF 74 second cytoplasmic loop did not affect ligand-independent signaling activity, but it greatly increased the response to GROα. ORF 74 upregulated the expression of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> (<b>RANTES,</b> IL- 6, IL- 8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and adhesion molecules (VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1, and E-selectin). Supernatants from transfected KS cells activated NF-κB signaling in untransfected cells and elicited the chemotaxis of monocytoid and T-lymphoid cells. Expression of ORF 74 conferred on primary endothelial cells a morphology that was strikingly similar to that of spindle cells present in KS lesions. Taken together, these data, demonstrating that ORF 74 activates NF-κB and induces the expression of proangiogenic and proinflammatory factors, suggest that expression of ORF 74 in a minority of cells in KS lesions could influence uninfected cells or latently infected cells via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, thereby contributing to KS pathogenesis...|$|R

Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with a central role in immunoreceptor (FcR) signaling and immune cell functionality. Syk kinase inhibitors have activity in antibody-dependent immune cell activation assays, in preclinical models of arthritis, and have progressed into clinical trials for RA and other autoimmune diseases. Here we describe the characterization of a novel triazolopyridine-based Syk kinase inhibitor, CC- 509. This compound is a potent inhibitor of purified Syk enzyme, FcR-dependent and FcR-independent signaling in primary immune cells, and basophil activation in human whole blood. CC- 509 is moderately selective across the kinome and against other non-kinase enzymes or receptors. Importantly, CC- 509 was optimized away from and has modest activity against cellular KDR and Jak 2, kinases that when inhibited in a preclinical and clinical setting may promote hypertension and neutropenia, respectively. In addition, CC- 509 is orally bioavailable and displays dose-dependent efficacy in two rodent models of immune-inflammatory disease. In passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), CC- 509 significantly inhibited skin edema. Moreover, CC- 509 significantly reduced paw swelling and the tissue levels of pro-inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> <b>RANTES</b> and MIP- 1 α in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model.

Aldosterone promotes atherosclerosis in animal models, but the mechanisms are poorly understood.

Aldosterone increased atherosclerosis in the aortic root 1. 80. 1 -fold after 4 weeks and in the aortic arch 3. 70. 2 -fold after 8 weeks, without significantly affecting plaque size in the abdominal aorta or traditional cardiac risk factors. Aldosterone treatment increased lipid content of plaques (2. 10. 2 -fold) and inflammatory cell content (2. 20. 3 -fold), induced early T-cell (2. 90. 3 -fold) and monocyte (2. 30. 3 -fold) infiltration into atherosclerosis-prone vascular regions, and enhanced systemic inflammation with increased spleen weight (1. 520. 06 -fold) and the circulating <b>cytokine</b> <b>RANTES</b> (regulated and normal T cell secreted; 1. 60. 1 -fold). To explore the mechanism, 7 genes were examined for aldosterone regulation in the ApoE/ aorta. Further studies focused on the proinflammatory placental growth factor (PlGF), which was released from aldosterone-treated ApoE/ vessels. Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by aldosterone in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) caused the release of factors that promote monocyte chemotaxis, which was inhibited by blocking monocyte PlGF receptors.

40|$|Introduction: The {{study of}} cytokines and chemokines {{in recent years}} has {{triggered}} a rapid improvement in our understanding of inflammatory reactions. For chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), certain cytokines and chemokines were defined, which obviously {{play a central role in}} the pathomechanism of the disease. The objective of this paper was to study both CRS-relevant chemokines and cytokines and the chemokine receptor 3 (CCR 3) that is dominant on eosinophils. This was achieved by means of precisely characterized and thus comparable case material, with special consideration being given to etiological factors. Methods: In 30 patients with chronic hyperplastic pansinusitis (comparable CT score/degree of eosinophilia) and 10 controls, the mRNA-content for CCR 3, CC-chemokines eotaxin and <b>RANTES</b> and <b>cytokines</b> IL- 4, IL- 5, IFN-γ and IL- 10 were quantitatively analysed by means of real-time TaqMan PCR in polypous tissue (patients) or the concha inferior (controls) ex vivo. Data obtained from the patient group were compared with those from the control group and, within the patient group, assessed between groups featuring different etiological factors (allergy, ASS-intolerance). In another study, the protein concentration of various CCR 3 -binding chemokines (eotaxin, eotaxin- 2, eotaxin- 3, RANTES, MCP- 3, MCP- 4) in tissue samples taken from CRS patients (n= 24) and controls from the concha inferior (n= 8) were analysed by means of ELISA; they were compared between the patient groups without/ with allergy or ASS-intolerance and correlated with the degree of tissue eosinophilia. Results: Significantly increased mRNA expression for CCR 3 (p Conclusions: The findings highlight a key role of the CCR 3 / eotaxin interaction in both the selective recruitment of eosinophils and the pathogenesis of chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis. Differences in the cytokine-chemokine profile are possibly due to different mechanisms influencing the development of CRS and to various etiological factors. The data corroborate the hypothesis of a multi-factorial genesis of CRS, with various factors triggering the activation of cells, the release of inflammatory mediators and the selective migration of eosinophils. The simultaneous expression of different chemokines or the reaching of a particular concentration threshold may be a prerequisite for the massive influx of eosinophils. The analysis of various inflammation mediators could help to better differentiate diseases of the paranasal sinuses and facilitate their pathophysiological classification in the future. The analysis of individual mediators is also important for the identification of selective therapeutic goals...|$|R

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the major immunomodulatory agents used to increase lung development and reduce the mortality and morbidity of preterm infants with RDS. However, their safety remains uncertain, and the precise mechanisms by which they improve lung function are unclear. In previous studies, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) enhances the innate immune response by respiratory epithelial cells, causes a monocytic infiltration into the lung, and reduces the severity of infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a respiratory pathogen known to affect preterm infants at a high prevalence. The {{purpose of this study}} is to measure the effects of VEGF administration on local immune responses in neonatal lambs, as the ovine lung is well suited for comparison to the human lung, due to similarities in alveolar development, immune responses, and RSV susceptibility. We hypothesized that VEGF induces the expression of genes necessary for host immune responses. We analyzed global gene expression profiles in the lungs of neonate lambs treated with VEGF by real-time qPCR. We report that VEGF induced the expression of chemokines (IL- 8, <b>RANTES,</b> MCP- 1), <b>cytokines</b> (IFN-γ, IL- 6, TNF-α, GMCSF), Toll-like receptor (TLR) - 4, complement family members (C 3, CFB, CFH) and collectins (SP-A, SP-D).

In this study, we compared the effects of zoledronate and teriparatide on lymphocyte populations and inflammatory cytokine production in mice. Materials and methods: Thirty female ICR mice were divided into three groups (n =  10 each) : a vehicle, a zoledronate, and a teriparatide group. Drugs were administered for 8  weeks in each group. Lymphocytes in the blood and thymus were analyzed and femurs were used for histological observation and lymphocytes analysis of bone marrow. Cytokines were measured in separated serum using Milliplex® multiplex immunoassay analysis. Results: Zoledronate decreased the T cell number in the bone marrow. Additionally, serum levels of interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 7, IL- 12, IL- 15 and <b>RANTES,</b> which are <b>cytokines</b> that affect T cell activation, differentiation and/or proliferation, were significantly lower in zoledronate treated mice. Conversely, teriparatide treatment induced an increase in gamma delta T cells in peripheral blood. Conclusion: Gamma delta T cells in the bone marrow are expected to decrease with zoledronate treatment and increase with teriparatide treatment. If BRONJ involves a loss of gamma delta T cells in the circulation or bone marrow, then the increase in gamma delta T cells that is induced by teriparatide may account for its ability to resolve BRONJ.

Viral strains belonging to both HHV- 6 subgroups (A and B) were able to productively infect human tonsil tissue fragments in the absence of exogenous stimulation.

Accordingly, HHV- 6 A infection resulted in the depletion of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, whereas in HHV- 6 B-infected tissue CD 4 + T cells were predominantly depleted. The expression of different cellular antigens was dramatically altered in HHV- 6 -infected tissues: whereas CD 4 was upregulated, both CD 46, which serves as a cellular receptor for HHV- 6, and CD 3 were downmodulated. However, CD 3 downmodulation was restricted to infected cells, while the loss of CD 46 expression was generalized. Moreover, HHV- 6 infection markedly enhanced the production of the CC chemokine <b>RANTES,</b> whereas other <b>cytokines</b> and chemokines were only marginally affected. These results provide the first evidence, in a physiologically relevant study model, that HHV- 6 can severely affect the physiology of secondary lymphoid organs through direct infection of T lymphocytes and modulation of key membrane receptors and chemokines...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} of Neisseria meningitidis with {{cells of the}} leptomeninges are pivotal events in the progression of bacterial leptomeningitis. An in vitro model based on the culture of human meningioma cells was used to investigate {{the role of the}} leptomeninges in the inflammatory response. Following challenge with meningococci, meningioma cells secreted specifically the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), the CXC chemokine IL- 8, the CC chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) and regulated-upon-activation, normal-T-cell expressed and secreted protein (<b>RANTES),</b> and the <b>cytokine</b> growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). A temporal pattern of cytokine production was observed, with early secretion of IL- 6, IL- 8, and MCP- 1 followed by later increases in RANTES and GM-CSF levels. IL- 6 was induced equally by the {{interactions of}} piliated and nonpiliated meningococci, whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) had a minimal effect, suggesting that other, possibly secreted, bacterial components were responsible. Induction of IL- 8 and MCP- 1 also did not require adherence of bacteria to meningeal cells, but LPS was implicated. In contrast, efficient stimulation of RANTES by intact meningococci required pilus-mediated adherence, which served to deliver increased local concentrations of LPS onto the surface of meningeal cells. Secretion of GM-CSF was induced by pilus-mediated interactions but did not involve LPS. In addition, capsule expression had a specific inhibitory effect on GM-CSF secretion, which was not observed with IL- 6, IL- 8, MCP- 1, or RANTES. Thus, the data demonstrate that cells of the leptomeninges are not inert but are active participants in the innate host response during leptomeningitis {{and that there is a}} complex relationship between expression of meningococcal components and cytokine induction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The genome of {{measles virus}} {{consists}} of a non-segmented single-stranded RNA molecule of negative polarity, which is encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid. The N protein possesses an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (aa 401 – 525, N TAIL) that is exposed at {{the surface of the}} viral nucleopcapsid. Thanks to its flexible nature, N TAIL interacts with several viral and cellular partners. Among these latter, the Interferon Regulator Factor 3 (IRF- 3) has been reported to interact with N, with the interaction having been mapped to the regulatory domain of IRF- 3 and to N TAIL. This interaction was described to lead to the phosphorylation-dependent activation of IRF- 3, and to the ensuing activation of the pro-immune <b>cytokine</b> <b>RANTES</b> gene. Results After confirming the reciprocal ability of IRF- 3 and N to be co-immunoprecipitated in 293 T cells, we thoroughly investigated the N TAIL -IRF- 3 interaction using a recombinant, monomeric form of the regulatory domain of IRF- 3. Using a large panel of spectroscopic approaches, including circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we failed to detect any direct interaction between IRF- 3 and either full-length N or N TAIL under conditions where these latter interact with the C-terminal X domain of the viral phosphoprotein. Furthermore, such interaction was neither detected in E. coli nor in a yeast two hybrid assay. Conclusion Altogether, these data support the requirement for a specific cellular environment, such as that provided by 293 T human cells, for the N TAIL -IRF- 3 interaction to occur. This dependence from a specific cellular context likely reflects the requirement for a human or mammalian cellular co-factor. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Complement 3 (C 3), a key {{component}} of the innate immune system, is involved in early inflammatory responses. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP; aka C 3 adesArg), a C 3 cleavage product, is produced in adipose tissue and stimulates lipid storage. We hypothesized that, depending on the diet, chronic ASP administration in C 3 (-/-) mice would affect lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity via an adaptive adipose tissue inflammatory response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: C 3 (-/-) mice on normal low fat diet (ND) or high fat diet (HFD) were chronically administered recombinant ASP (rASP) for 25 days via an osmotic mini-pump. While there was no effect on food intake, there was a decrease in activity, with a relative increase in adipose tissue weight on ND, and a shift in adipocyte size distribution. While rASP administration to C 3 (-/-) mice on a ND increased insulin sensitivity, on a HFD, rASP administration had the opposite effect. Specifically, rASP administration in C 3 (-/-) HFD mice resulted in decreased gene expression of IRS 1, GLUT 4, SREBF 1 and NFκB in muscle, and decreased C 5 L 2 but increased JNK, CD 36, CD 11 c, CCR 2 and NFκB gene expression in adipose tissue as well as increased secretion of proinflammatory <b>cytokines</b> (<b>Rantes,</b> KC, MCP- 1, IL- 6 and G-CSF). In adipose tissue, although IRS 1 and GLUT 4 mRNA were unchanged, insulin response was reduced. CONCLUSION: The effects of chronic rASP administration are tissue and diet specific, rASP administration enhances the HFD induced inflammatory response leading to an insulin-resistant state. These results suggest that, in humans, the increased plasma ASP associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease could be an additional factor directly contributing to development of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Eosinophils (Eos) and {{fibroblasts}} {{are known}} {{to play a major}} role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and fibrotic lung disease. Therefore, we investigated whether Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines stimulate the production of Eo-activating chemokines by lung fibroblasts. Analyses of the culture supernatant using multiple steps of high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that interleukin (IL) - 4 preferentially stimulates lung fibroblasts to secrete a peak of eosinophil chemotactic activity (ECA) which, upon N-terminal analyses, showed similar sequence to eotaxin, whereas interferon (IFN) - � had negligible effect on the release of this chemokine. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - � stimulated lung fibroblasts to release two peaks of activity that were found to correspond to eotaxin and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES), respectively. Interestingly, IL- 4 synergized with TNF- � to increase greatly the production of three biochemically distinct eotaxin forms. In contrast, IFN- � synergized with TNF- � to increase RANTES production. Neither IL- 2, IL- 5, IL- 6 nor IL- 10 had an effect on lung fibroblasts’ capacity to express or release eotaxin and <b>RANTES.</b> Upon appropriate <b>cytokine</b> stimulation, lung fibroblasts were also found to express messenger RNA for monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) - 3 and MCP- 4 but not eotaxin- 2. However, no ECA like MCP- 3 or MCP- 4 was detected. These observations suggest that the release of Th 1 or Th 2 cytokines in the lung tissue polarizes lung fibroblasts to produce either RANTES or eotaxin as major Eo attractants. Teran, L. M., M.

We hypothesized that de novo synthesis of IL- 4 and RANTES occurs in nascent eosinophils, leading to storage of newly produced proteins in crystalloid granule-like structures. Cytokine mRNA and protein expression were examined in cultured eosinophil colonies, which were derived from purified cord blood CD 34 + cells and generated in semisolid media (methylcellulose) in the presence of recombinant human (rh) IL- 3 and rhIL- 5. Cytokine mRNA profiles were analysed by the reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) to determine transcription of IL- 4 and RANTES in cells on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 of culture. The expression of translated cytokine products and granule major basic protein (MBP) was confirmed, from day 23 onwards, for colonies cultured in semisolid media, by immunofluorescent labelling and confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM). We found that mRNA sequences encoding IL- 4 and RANTES were expressed in freshly prepared, non-differentiated CD 34 + cells. Furthermore, RANTES mRNA localized to carbol chromotrope 2 R-positive colony cells, as assessed using in situ RT–PCR on day 21 of culture in semisolid media, and was found to gradually decrease (relative to β 2 -microglobulin) in rhIL- 3 - and rhIL- 5 -treated colony cells (comprising > 90 % eosinophil-like cells) up to day 28. Immunoreactivity for IL- 4 and RANTES co-localized with MBP in maturing colony eosinophils on day 23 of culture in semisolid media, as judged by CLSM.

40|$|Concurrent {{infections in}} {{patients}} with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection stimulate HIV replication. Chemokine receptors CXCR 4 and CCR 5 can act as HIV coreceptors. The authors hypothesized that concurrent infection increases the HIV load through up-regulation of CXCR 4 and CCR 5. Using experimental endotoxemia {{as a model of}} infection, changes in HIV coreceptor expression were assessed in 8 subjects injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 4 ng/kg). The expression of CXCR 4 and CCR 5 on CD 4 (+) T cells was increased 2 - to 4 -fold, 4 to 6 hours after LPS injection. In whole blood in vitro, LPS induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in the expression of CXCR 4 and CCR 5 on CD 4 (+) T cells. Similar changes were observed after stimulation with cell wall components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (lipoarabinnomannan) or Staphylococcus aureus (lipoteichoic acid), or with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. LPS increased viral infectivity of CD 4 -enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a T-tropic HIV strain. In contrast, M-tropic virus infectivity was reduced, possibly because of elevated levels of the CCR 5 ligand <b>cytokines</b> <b>RANTES</b> and MIP- 1 beta. LPS-stimulated up-regulation of CXCR 4 and CCR 5 in vitro was inhibited by anti-TNF and anti-IFN gamma. Incubation with recombinant TNF or IFN gamma mimicked the LPS effect. Anti-interleukin 10 (anti-IL- 10) reduced CCR 5 expression, without influencing CXCR 4. In accordance, rIL- 10 induced up-regulation of CCR 5, but not of CXCR 4. Intercurrent infections during HIV infection may up-regulate CXCR 4 and CCR 5 on CD 4 (+) T cells, at least in part via the action of cytokines. Such infections may favor selectivity of HIV for CD 4 (+) T cells expressing CXCR 4. (Blood. 2000; 96 : 2649 - 2654...|$|R

Previous studies have revealed that TIM 2 -deficient mice (TIM 2 −/−) {{are more susceptible to}} the Th 2 -mediated immune response in an airway inflammation model. Here, we investigated the phenotypic response of TIM 2 −/− mice to cisplatin-induced kidney toxicity. A lethality study in male BALB/c wild-type (TIM 2 +/+) and TIM 2 −/− mice, administered with 20 mg/kg cisplatin ip, resulted in 80 % mortality of TIM 2 −/− mice as compared with 30 % mortality in the TIM 2 +/+ group by day 5. The TIM 2 −/− mice showed approximately fivefold higher injury as estimated by blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine at 48 h that was confirmed by significantly increased proximal tubular damage assessed histologically (H & E staining). A significantly higher expression of Th 2 -associated cytokines, TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and TGFβ, with a significant reduction of Th 1 -associated <b>cytokines,</b> <b>RANTES</b> and MCP- 1, by 72 h was observed in the TIM 2 −/− mice as compared with TIM 2 +/+ mice. A higher baseline protein expression of caspase- 3 (approximately twofold) coupled with an early onset of p 53 protein activation by 48 h resulted in an increased apoptosis by 48 – 72 h in TIM 2 −/− compared with TIM 2 +/+. In conclusion, the increased expression of the proinflammatory and proapoptotic genes, with a higher number of apoptotic cells, and a pronounced increase in injury and mortality of the TIM 2 -deficient mice collectively suggest a protective role of TIM 2 in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The {{cellular}} {{and molecular}} events involved in ischaemia reperfusion (IR) injury {{are complex and}} not fully understood. Previous studies have implicated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) as major inflammatory cells in IR injury. However, anti-PMN antiserum treatment offers only limited protection, indicating that other inflammatory cells are involved. We have therefore investigated the contribution of resident macrophages in IR injury using an IR gut injury model. Methods: DA rats were divided into sham operation and IR groups. The superior mesenteric artery was clamped for 30, 45, or 60 minutes (ischaemia) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. IR injuries were evaluated by histological staining. Expression of early growth response factor 1 (Egr- 1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proinflammatory cytokines was analysed by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting analysis. The specific role of macrophages in IR gut injury was also evaluated in resident macrophage depleted rats. Results: Mucosal sloughing and villi destruction were seen in 45 / 60 minute and 60 / 60 minute IR guts. PMN infiltration at the damaged mucosal area was undetectable in 45 / 60 minute and 60 / 60 minute IR guts. PMN were localised around the capillaries {{at the base of}} the crypts in 60 / 60 minute IR gut. Obvious PMN infiltration was only observed in damaged villi after three hours of reperfusion. Elevated nuclear Egr- 1 immunostaining was localised in resident macrophages at the damaged villi before histological appearance of mucosal damage. Furthermore, resident macrophages at the damaged site expressed MPO. Protein levels of the proinflammatory <b>cytokines</b> <b>RANTES</b> and MCP- 1 were increased in IR gut. Depletion of resident macrophages by dichloromethylene bisphosphonate significantly reduced mucosal damage in rat guts after IR. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that resident macrophages play a role in early mucosal damage in IR gut injury. Therefore, macrophages should be treated as a prime target for therapeutic intervention for IR damage. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{characteristics}} of airway inflammation in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), I measured the sputum concentration of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin- 5 (IL- 5), and <b>RANTES,</b> which are <b>cytokines</b> involved in the migration and activation of neutrophils and eosinophils. I also measured myeloperoxidase (MPO) as a parameter of neutrophil activity and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) as a parameter of eosinophil activity. Spontaneous sputum samples were obtained from 33 patients with stable COPD and 30 patients with asthma. Induced sputum samples were obtained from 12 healthy controls. The sputum concentrations of IL- 8 and TNFα were significantly higher in the patients with COPD than in the patients with asthma (p< 0. 0001, p< 0. 001, respectively) or in the controls (p< 0. 0001, p< 0. 001, respectively). Concentrations of IL- 5, RANTES, MPO and ECP were significantly higher in the patients with COPD than in the controls (p< 0. 01, p< 0. 05, p< 0. 0001, p< 0. 0001, respectively) but did not differ significantly betweenn the patients with COPD and those with asthma. In the patients with COPD, the sputum concentration of IL- 8 was significantly correlated with the concentration of TNFα (r= 0. 45, p< 0. 01), of MPO (r= 0. 55, p< 0. 001) and of ECP (r= 0. 53, p< 0. 01). The sputum concentration of IL- 8 was negatively correlated with FEV 1 /FVC(r=- 0. 78, p< 0. 0001) in these patients. In conclusion, these results suggest the activation of both neutrophils and eosinophils in the airway of patients with COPD. It appears that IL- 8 is mainly involved with this activation. The sputum concentration of IL- 8 appears to be closely associated with the degree of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD and may serve as a marker in evaluating the severity of airway inflammation, which is a risk factor for COPD...|$|R
40|$|Stressful {{life events}} have been {{associated}} with the onset and/or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). To investigate the effects of stress on the pathogenesis of MS, we employed restraint stress (RST) in the Theiler??????s virus-induced demyelination (TVID) model, an animal model for human MS. Intracerebral inoculation of susceptible strain of mice with Theiler??????s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) results in a biphasic disease ?????? an acute encephalomyelitis and chronic demyelination. The establishment of persistent viral infection is critical in inducing immune-mediated demyelination during the chronic disease. The exposure of mice to RST prior to viral infection produced a stress response as evidenced by elevated circulating corticosterone (CORT). To further study the effect of stress on the immune response to TMEV infection and demyelination, we first examined the cytokine and chemokine response during the acute TMEV infection. We demonstrated that RST down-regulated the virus-induced expression of chemokines, Ltn, IP- 10, <b>RANTES,</b> and pro-inflammatory <b>cytokines,</b> TNF, IFN and LT in both the brain and spleen during early infection. Histologically, a decreased pattern of inflammation was observed in the brain of restrained mice as compared to non-restrained mice. The increased viral titer was noted in the CNS of restrained mice and was correlated with the decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine, suggesting an impaired immune response by RST. Secondly, the duration of stress on the late demyelination was investigated. Repeated and chronically stressed SJL/J mice developed an early onset of clinical signs and a delayed onset was observed in acutely stressed mice. Both acute and chronic RST suppressed the antibody response to TMEV and stressed displayed a higher incidence of demyelination than non-restrained mice. Axonal loss was also noted in chronic stressed mice. Additionally, RST caused an increased systemic viral infection in extraneural organs during the acute infection and cardiotropic TMEV was isolated from the heart of stressed mice. Taken together, stress resulted in profound immunsuppression during acute infection, which may consequently increase the incidence of demyelination. The present study may be generalized in human MS which is potentially triggered by viral infection...|$|R
40|$|Mastitis, an {{inflammation}} in the mammary gland, is one {{of three}} major diseases in the dairy industry. One in three cows will encounter the disease which is also a problem in humans and other species. While E. coli bacterial infections lead to acute mastitis, S. aureus lead to chronic mastitis. Dynamics of the regulation and identification of differentially expressed genes between two bacterial infections are important factors for understanding mastitis and assist in the development of pharmaceutical and breeding targets. Previous studies have identified differentially expressed genes. However, they have not compared expression between two bacterial infections over time. Neither have the dynamics of the signalling and gene network regulation that leads to the differential expressions been investigated. This thesis aims to provide new insight into immune defence in mastitis by analysing dynamics of the signalling and gene regulation in mammary epithelial cells. The main focus is to develop a mathematical model of the signalling and gene network regulation in mastitis. First, the genes differentially regulated between the two clinical presentations of the disease are identified. Time series microarray experiments of E. coli and S. aureus challenged mammary epithelial cells are analysed, and confirm that each type of mastitis has a significantly different gene expression time profile from healthy cells. The differentially expressed gene time profiles are then compared between the bacterial challenges. RANTES is identified as the key cytokine which is responsible for two distinctly different time profiles between the bacterial challenges. In this second part the mathematical model is developed and a systems biology approach applied to investigate the complex dynamics of signalling proteins and gene network regulation of three different <b>cytokines</b> (<b>RANTES,</b> IL 8 and TNFα) in mastitis. A modification to a conversion method allows us to use relative microarray expression data in the model. The method opens up a large amount of datasets for use in future modelling. The model explains signalling and gene network regulation of three cytokines in acute mastitis. No fit could be found for the S. aureus experimental data indicating that there is a difference in the regulatory mechanisms between the two types of mastitis. In the third part sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the role of parameters on the model output. The analysis reveals that each cytokine is sensitive to specific parameter changes. This indicates different dynamics in the regulatory mechanism. As a result, pharmaceutical and breeding targets need to be evaluated in the context of all cytokines to prevent undesirable side effects. The importance of modelling prior to experimental design is also revealed; each cytokine has a specific time frame for the most informative experimental measurement. In the fourth part robustness analysis is used to investigate the role of the bacterial load on the model output. Robustness analyses indicate that robustness does not originate in the nuclear NFκB time profile and is specific for each cytokine. Finally, future directions of the model and biological experiments are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a gram-positive, cocci-forming {{pathogen}} {{capable of}} causing serious-life-threatening illnesses (e. g. meningitis). In 2010, {{it was the}} number one cause of bacterial deaths in the USA. Moreover, SA is one {{of just a few}} bacteria that are able {{to gain access to the}} central nervous system (CNS) via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB comprises a monolayer of unique brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMvEC), which act as a seal to separate the CNS from the main circulatory system. BMvEC are equipped with specialised interendothelial tight and adherens junction protein complexes that regulate the paracellular traffic of fluids and solutes into the neural microenvironment. However, when this barrier is compromised by injury and/or infection it can result in BBB dysfunction. The main objective of this project was to investigate the effects of SA infection on the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) microvascular endothelium in-vitro with respect to: (i) interendothelial tight/adherens junction (TJ/AJ) protein expression; (ii) endothelial permeability and; (iii) to pro-inflammatory signalling. Methods: Primary-derived human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMvEC) were infected with either “formaldehyde-fixed” or “live” SA Newman wild-type (NWT) or mutant staphylococcal protein A (ΔSpA) strains. Infection dose- (multiplicity of infection/MOI) and time-dependency studies were routinely performed. The impact of infection was monitored on: (i) cell viability (by flow cytometry);(ii) bacterial adherence to HBMvEC; (iii) interendothelial junction protein expression (by Western blotting); (iv) HBMvEC monolayer paracellular permeability (by transendothelial permeability assay using FITC-dextran); (v) activation of NF-κB (by Western blotting for NF-κB phospho-p 65); (vi) inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release (by ELISA and cytokine array panel); (vii) reactive oxygen species production (by flow cytometry) and; (viii) endothelial microparticle release post-infection (by flow cytometry). Main Results: Following 48 hrs infection using “fixed” NWT-SA bacterium (MOI 0 - 250), the expression of HBMvEC junctional proteins (VE-Cadherin, ZO- 1 and claudin- 5) were dose- dependently downregulated, in parallel with increased monolayer permeability. Fixed NWT-SA infection significantly induced activation of NF-κB within just 1 hour of infection, whilst showing significant dose-dependent increases in release of IL- 6, TNF-α and thrombomodulin. A cytokine array panel for fixed SA infections using MOI 0 and MOI 250 media samples showed six upregulated <b>cytokines</b> (<b>RANTES,</b> IP- 10, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP- 1 and IL- 6). By contrast, minimal junctional protein decreases were recorded post-infection with “live” NWT-SA (MOI 0 - 100, 3 hrs), in parallel with minimal barrier disruption, although NF-κB was activated in a time- dependent manner. There was no difference in cytokine release using live SA media samples after 3 and 12 hrs infection. Further infection studies using fixed NWT-SA showed dose-dependent increases in ROS generation and also release of annexin-V/VE-cadherin-positive endothelial microparticles. In a final series of experiments, the contribution of the virulence factor, SpA, to the effects of SA on HBMvEC barrier properties was investigated using the mutant bacterium (ΔSpA). The ΔSpA strain was attenuated in disrupting HBMvEC barrier properties as seen in the downregulation of adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin), barrier permeabilization at low concentrations and in the activation of NF-κB in comparison to NWT-SA. Conclusion: Both SA strains (NWT-SA and ΔSpA) have shown decreased expression of interendothelial adherens/tight junction proteins, in parallel with elevated barrier permeabilization and pro-inflammatory index, albeit at different infection times and doses. Ultimately, the effects of SA infection result in BBB dysfunction and barrier compromisation indicative of a cerebral bacterial infection...|$|R

In this study essential 				methodological improvements concerning future studies on 				immune response were elaborated. The developed 				TaqMan-PCR allows a quantification of YFV and 				YFV-infection related gene expression in infected 				samples (serum, tissue) with high accuracy. Three genes 				(L 13, TBP, PPI) were determined as reference genes, 				which are in contrast to ?-actin constitutively 				expressed in YFV infected cells and tissue. The 				cytokine array permits in comparison to other methods a 				cost-efficient, rapid, broad, and semi-quantitative 				determination of cytokines. The set of primers for 				sequence analysis of highly variable regions within the 				YFV genome allows a fast characterization of virus 				strains in vaccinated persons with or without side 				effects, so that virus mutations could be excluded as 				cause of complications. With these 				established and improved methods YFV infections after 				vaccination and after wild type infection could be 				examined. From the comparative analysis of the immune 				response of YFV-wild type infected (YFVInf), YFV 				vaccinated (vaccinees) and YFV adverse events (YEL-AE) 				new insights regarding YFV induced immune response could 				be achieved. The clinical data, the virus titer as 				well as the neutralizing antibodies of YFVInf and YEL-AE 				indicate that persons with YFV infection and YFV 				viscerotropic adverse events (YEL-AVD) with fatal 				outcome (YEL-AVDFat) show a very similar image and are 				hardly differentiated. YEL-AE with non fatal outcome 				vary in their manifestations. A reverse mutation from 				vaccine to wild type strain can be excluded as cause for 				YEL-AE due to the here performed sequence analysis. 				Therefore the focus for future studies should be laid on 				host factors. In this study a partial issue of the 				cellular immune response was investigated as a host 				specific factor. It could be shown that the activation 				of the immune response by YFV-infection regarding the 				cytokines is lower as well in the vaccinees as in YEL-AE 				than in YFVinf. The number of the cytokines and the 				amount of their release are considerably stronger in 				YEL-AE than in vaccinees. This could be linked with the 				severity of side effects. Thereby the cytokines IL- 6, 				IL- 8, GRO, MIG, MCP- 1, TGF-? 1, TNF-? und RANTES could 				play a major role. In the YEL-AVDFat the same cytokines 				(IL- 6, IL- 8, MCP- 1) were highly elevated as well as in 				YFVInf. GRO and MIG could also be measured in high 				concentrations in YEL-AVDFat. In the measurement of 				cytokines on protein level, persons without side effects 				showed only a high reactivity for <b>RANTES,</b> while other 				<b>cytokines</b> were only rarely or not detectable. 				Furthermore three mutation sites were analyzed in the 				E-protein region of the YFV- 17 D vaccine strain, which 				are suspected to be the reasons for the attenuation of 				YFV. The E-protein is supposed to be responsible for the 				virulence. Eight amino acids of the E-protein seem to be 				very interesting targets. Three of them were changed for 				mutation studies to get insights about the molecular 				determinants of the attenuation. The substitution 				mutants pMutE 52 and pMutE 200 showed in contrast to the 				wild type and the vaccine strain a similar replication 				efficiency while pMutE 299 could not replicate in cell 				culture.
