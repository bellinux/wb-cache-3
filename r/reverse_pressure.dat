In this paper, the design and fabrication of a normally-closed (NC) all-polymer membrane-type microvalve is described. The microvalve with a diameter and thickness of 5 mm and 3 mm, respectively, is fabricated completely in biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The opening pressure, which depends on the adhesion between the membrane and the slab, is reduced to the noticeably low value of 3. 4 kPa by the surface oxidation of the PDMS layers. This technique in combination with a selective bonding by Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) shadow masking allows for the fabrication of a high <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> microvalve (no flow up to 0. 6 MPa <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure).</b> Other major fabrication steps include PDMS doctor-blading and soft lithography in order to fabricate the thin and surface patterned membranes, respectively.

40|$|AbstractDiastolic mitral {{regurgitation}} is {{a common}} finding that can be detected with use of Doppler echocardiographic techniques in patients with atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities. With use of simultaneous hemodynamic and Doppler techniques, mitral flow velocity, mitral valve motion and transmitral pressure gradient were studied during 50 cardiac cycles each of spontaneous or atrial paced first- and second-degree AV block in five lightly sedated dogs. Diastolic mitral regurgitation was detected during atrial relaxation on all beats in which ventricular contraction was delayed > 190 ms. In all dogs the diastolic regurgitation {{was associated with a}} reverse transmitral pressure gradient (3. 7 ± 1. 1 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3. 2 ± 1. 5 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) that occurred primarily {{as the result of a}} decrease in atrial pressure with atrial relaxation. These <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients were as large as the maximal forward transmitral gradients in early diastole (2. 9 ± 0. 9 mm Hg in first-degree AV block and 3. 1 ± 0. 7 mm Hg in second-degree AV block) and larger than the maximal forward pressure gradients at atrial contraction (1. 7 ± 0. 5 and 1. 4 ± 0. 6 mm Hg, respectively, p < 0. 05). The maximal <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient during atrial relaxation was also as large as the <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient in mid-diastole (2. 7 ± 0. 9 and 2. 8 ± 1. 0 mm Hg, respectively), associated with deceleration of early diastolic mitral flow. Peak diastolic mitral regurgitation velocity coincided with the maximal reverse transmitral gradient and was usually larger than anterograde mitral flow velocity. In second-degree AV block the velocity and duration of diastolic regurgitation were variable, with smaller reverse transmitral gradients and peak flow velocities on beats with a shorter QP interval. The mitral valve opened widely with a forward transmitral pressure gradient, and demonstrated rapid and near closure with a reverse transmitral pressure gradient. The smallest valve opening coincided with the maximal <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient and the peak velocity of diastolic regurgitation. Complete valve closure occurred only with ventricular systole. These results demonstrate that a reverse transmitral pressure gradient is present during diastolic mitral regurgitation in AV block, is related to the peak velocity and duration of regurgitation and is equal to or larger than the diastolic forward transmitral gradient. The results also suggest a role for a reverse diastolic transmitral gradient in causing near closure of the mitral valve leaflets and preventing significant regurgitant volume during diastole. However, complete closure of the mitral valve appears to occur only during ventricular systole...|$|E
40|$|Funded by the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management, EM- 31, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{partnered with}} SpinTek Filtration{trademark} {{to develop a}} filter disk that would {{withstand}} a <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> or flow during operation of the rotary microfilter. The ability to withstand a <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> and flow eliminates a potential accident scenario that could have resulted in damage to the filter membranes. While the original welded filter disks {{have been shown to}} withstand and reverse pressure/flow in the static condition, the filter disk design discussed in this report will allow a reverse pressure/flow while the disks are rotating. In addition, the laminated disk increases the flexibility during filter startup and cleaning operations. The new filter disk developed by SRNL and SpinTek is manufactured with a more open structure significantly reducing internal flow restrictions in the disk. The prototype was tested at the University of Maryland and demonstrated to withstand the <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> due to the centrifugal action of the rotary filter. The tested water flux of the disk was demonstrated to be 1. 34 gpm in a single disk test. By comparison, the water flux of the current disk was 0. 49 gpm per disk during a 25 disk test. The disk also demonstrated rejection of solids by filtering a 5 wt % Strontium Carbonate slurry with a filtrate clarity of less the 1. 4 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) throughout the two hour test. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has been working with SpinTek Filtration{trademark} to adapt the rotary microfilter for radioactive service in the Department of Energy (DOE) Complex. One potential weakness is the loose nature of the membrane on the filter disks. The current disk is constructed by welding the membrane at {{the outer edge of the}} disk. The seal for the center of the membrane is accomplished by an o-ring in compression for the assembled stack. The remainder of the membrane is free floating on the disk. This construction requires that a positive pressure be applied to the rotary filter tank to prevent the membrane from rising from the disk structure and potentially contacting the filter turbulence promoter. In addition, one accident scenario is a reverse flow through the filtrate line due to mis-alignment of valves resulting in the membrane rising from the disk structure. The structural integrity of the current disk has been investigated, and shown that the disk can withstand a significant <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> in a static condition. However, the disk will likely incur damage if the filter stack is rotated during a <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure.</b> The development of a laminated disk would have several significant benefits for the operation of the rotary filter including the prevention of a compromise in filter disk integrity during a reverse flow accident, increasing operational flexibility, and increasing the self cleaning ability of the filter. A laminated disk would allow the filter rotor operation prior to a positive pressure in the filter tank. This would prevent the initial dead-head of the filter and prevent the resulting initial filter cake buildup. The laminated disk would allow rotor operation with cleaning fluid, eliminating the need for a recirculation pump. Additionally, a laminated disk would allow a reverse flow of fluid through the membrane pores removing trapped particles...|$|E

Experimental campaigns allowed the acquisition of performance curves of a centrifugal compressor in deep choke up to <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> and indicated a large region of safe operating conditions at low peripheral Mach number. In stable reverse flow, the trends of work coefficient and pressure ratio were acquired for a large range of flow rates together with the evolution of vibration and pressure fluctuation along the speed lines.

40|$|An Immersed Boundary fluid-structure {{interaction}} model is developed {{to investigate the}} dynamic behaviour of a prosthetic chorded mitral valve (MV) inside the left ventricle (LV). In order to simulate more realistic physiological flow conditions, in vivo magnetic resonance images of the LV are {{used to determine the}} anatomical structure and the motion of the LV. The LV geometry and its motion are incorporated into the dynamic MV model. This model allows us to investigate the influences of the flow vortex generated by the LV motion on the MV dynamics, as well as the impact of the motion of the chordae attachment points (CAPs). Results are compared with two other cases: (i) an LV model with no prescribed motion of the CAPs, (ii) a Tube model in which the LV is replaced by a tube, although the motion of the chordae is incorporated. These special cases enable the influence of the chordae motion and the vortex on the behaviour of the MV to be analysed independently. It is found that when the MV is placed inside a dynamic LV, the chordae and the valve stretch are significantly increased in the commissural region, and the flow field is strongly asymmetric, with a clockwise single vortex appearing after the early rapid filling phase of the diastole. Given that we impose a flow rate boundary condition, the <b>reverse</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient cannot be established and, hence, the valve does not close properly.
