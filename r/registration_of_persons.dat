2500|$|The first {{applicant}} in the CFA case, Evangeline Banao Vallejos, {{is a native}} of the Philippines, where she was previously a businesswoman. She came to Hong Kong in 1986 as an FDH, while the territory was still a British colony. During her first year in Hong Kong, she switched employers, but afterwards continued to work for the family of Barry Ong for more than two decades. She performed volunteer work and became active in a church. She approached the Immigration Department for verification of eligibility for permanent residence in April 2008. In November that year, the Immigration Department informed her that her application was not successful; she was not considered to be [...] "ordinarily resident" [...] in Hong Kong by reason of Immigration Ordinance Article 2(4)(a)(vi). The following month, she approached the <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Persons</b> Office to apply for a Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card, for which she was also rejected. She appealed to the <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Persons</b> Tribunal, which in June 2009 ruled against her. At that point, Vallejos applied to the Legal Aid Department for help; local law firm Barnes and Daly, as well as barrister Gladys Li, agreed to assist Vallejos in applying for judicial review to rule on whether the relevant provision of the Immigration Ordinance complied with the Basic Law. The case came to mainstream media attention in December 2010.|$|E
