40|$|In Australia {{there have}} been {{increased}} calls for the adoption of an alternative tax vehicle, especially {{for the use of}} small businesses. One option that has been raised is for the introduction of a new <b>hybrid</b> corporate <b>entity.</b> This proposed entity would provide members with limited liability, but would be taxed in a similar manner to a partnership, in that income and losses would be directly attributed to members. Internationally since the early 1990 's there has been considerable movement towards providing alternative legal forms for business. Through these developments, economic gains can be attained providing real choice in the way that investments can be organised and utilised. Recently Australia recognised to a limited extent such <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> for international taxation purposes for controlled foreign companies. Should the Australian Government extend beyond this international recognition and introduce a <b>hybrid</b> <b>entity</b> for Australian domestic tax purposes? New Zealand has already adopted two <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> for taxation purposes known as Qualifying Companies and Loss Attribution Qualifying Companies. What lessons can be learnt from the New Zealand experience? This paper will review both Australia's recent international recognition of <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities,</b> and the calls for such an entity to be adopted domestically.

40|$|Various {{business}} entities {{are found}} in today's business community, however, such varieties of business entities often cause tax problems. While in one country, a <b>hybrid</b> <b>entity</b> is taxed as a corporation, it is dealt as a transparent entity in which equity holders are subjected to taxation in another country. The difference in taxation of <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> {{can be used to}} international tax arbitrage. In the U. S., many regulations on tax planning using <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> have been implemented, such as (i) Creating dual consolidated loss, (ii) Avoiding Subpart F rule application, (iii) Tax deferral on transferring intangible properties, (iv) Abusing foreign tax credit mechanism, (v) Obtaining benefit of tax treaty, (vi) Avoiding capital gain taxation, however, these regulations do not necessarily have enough effectiveness to prevent tax avoidance. As the U. S. experience in this area can be very instructive for Japan, this article goes over the U. S. regulations considering implications for the tax treatment on various entities in Japan. In order to tackle international tax arbitrage surrounding taxation of <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities,</b> foremost importance is each country's own effort.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe OECD {{made certain}} {{recommendations}} in its 2014 discussion draft, "Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements", comprising recommendations on domestic law and double tax convention measures. This dissertation assesses the potential implication of these recommendations for South Africa's tax laws and double tax conventions as these relate to cross border financing arrangements between two taxpayers using hybrid instruments or <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities.</b> These <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> and mismatches and which {{give rise to}} mismatch outcomes either through a deduction arising in either jurisdictions or a deduction arising in one jurisdiction without an inclusion in income in the other jurisdiction. This assessment is made to understand how these recommendations could impact on South Africa's tax laws and double tax conventions. This impact is assessed by determining the publically expressed sentiment of the South African government towards the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting proposals and thereafter by assessing how the above noted recommendations may interact with the Income Tax Act and South Africa's double tax conventions to address mismatches {{within the scope of}} this dissertation. This interactions is assessed by: reviewing the treatment of cross border hybrid instrument and <b>hybrid</b> <b>entity</b> arrangements in the Income Tax Act, the withholding tax measures in the Income Tax Act, the treatment of these arrangements in double tax conventions concluded by South Africa, and the interaction of the recommendations in the above OECD report with the Income Tax Act and double tax conventions concluded by South Africa. Conclusions are then drawn from this analysis. The review of publically expressed sentiments of the South African government evidenced support for the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting proposals but also a sensitivity to South Africa's tax sovereignty. The review of the treatment in the Income Tax Act of the arrangements within the scope of this dissertation found that at times the Income Tax Act potentially did not resolve the mismatches of concern and that withholding tax may not have the potential to comprehensively preserve the tax base against these arrangements, particularly taking into account the influence of double tax conventions. The review of the recommendations in the above OECD report found that these recommendations could assist existing domestic tax law measures in addressing the mismatch outcomes of concern, albeit not necessarily comprehensively and potentially at the cost of added complexity. It was also found that the double tax convention recommendations appeared to have limited impact to clarifying and confirming the existing treatment of arrangements involving <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities.</b> These findings are significant as they indicate a support for the OECD's recommendations by the South African government and that the recommendations could assist in addressing the mismatch outcomes addressed in this dissertation...|$|R

50|$|Two major efforts {{occurred}} in the 1950s. One of these efforts was by G. Moore and K. Berman at General Electric. The duo used 90% H2O2 (high test peroxide, known as HTP) and polyethylene in a rod and tube grain design. They drew several significant conclusions from their work. The fuel grain had uniform burning. Grain cracks did not affect combustion, like it does with solid rocket motors. No hard starts were observed (a hard start is a pressure spike seen close {{to the time of}} ignition, typical of liquid rocket engines). The fuel surface acted as a flame holder, which encouraged stable combustion. The oxidizer could be throttled with one valve, and a high oxidizer to fuel ratio helped simplify combustion. The negative observations were low burning rates and that the thermal instability of peroxide was problematic for safety reasons. Another effort that {{occurred in}} the 1950s was development of a <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid.</b> In a standard hybrid rocket motor, the solid material is the fuel. In a <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid</b> rocket motor, the oxidizer is solid. William Avery of the Applied Physics Laboratory used JP and ammonium nitrate, selected for their low cost.

40|$|The need to {{maintain}} Australia as an attractive place for business requires that Australia's tax and corporate regulatory system be readily adaptive {{in responding to the}} increasing global business economy. Over the last number of years there has been the growing utilisation of new business forms around the world, known as <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities.</b> These <b>hybrids</b> <b>entities</b> often provide the corporate characteristics of a separate legal entity and limited liability for members, however adopt partnership taxation with the income and or losses being directly attributed to members. For example fifty-one states in the United States of America have introduced Limited Liability Companies, and its Federal Government has introduced S Corporations. Other examples around the world include the Limited Liability Partnership in United Kingdom and the Loss Attributing Qualifying Company in New Zealand. Given the growing international utilisation of these new business forms and Australia's only limited recognition of them, a thorough analysis of what have been the political and economic forces influencing this emerging global trend is important. With a thorough understanding of these key drivers preliminary conclusions can be made about whether these forces are likely to be present in Australia. Such conclusions will assist in determining whether Australia should expand its current offering of business forms to include hybrids. This particularly important to consider, as it is disturbing that Australia's current tax and corporate regulatory system may be generating an incentive for investors to adopt suboptimal forms to conduct their business operations.

40|$|The {{difference}} between a non-living machine such as a vacuum cleaner and a living organism as a lion seems to be obvious. The two types of entities differ in their material consistence, their origin, their development and their purpose. This apparently clear-cut borderline has previously been challenged by fictitious ideas of “artificial organism” and “living machines” {{as well as by}} progress in technology and breeding. The emergence of novel technologies such as artificial life, nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology are definitely blurring the boundary between our understanding of living and non-living matter. This essay discusses where, at the borderline between living and non-living matter, we can position the future products of synthetic biology that belong to the two <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> “synthetic organisms” and “living machines” and how the approaching realization of such <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> affects our understanding of organisms and machines. For this purpose we focus on the description of three different types of synthetic biology products and the aims assigned to their realization: (1) synthetic minimal cells aimed at by protocell synthetic biology, (2) chassis organisms strived for by synthetic genomics and (3) genetically engineered machines produced by bioengineering. We argue {{that in the case of}} synthetic biology the purpose is more decisive for the categorization of a product as an organism or a machine than its origin and development. This has certain ethical implications because the definition of an entity as machine seems to allow bypassing the discussion about the assignment and evaluation of instrumental and intrinsic values, which can be raised in the case of organisms...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) {{project has}} been one of the biggest issues in {{international}} taxation. The OECD refers to BEPS as “tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations. ” In 2014, the OECD released BEPS Action 2 as responds on Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements (“HMA”s), which are arrangements exploiting differences in the tax treatment of instruments, entities or transfers between two or more countries. Two of the major factors of HMAs are <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> and <b>hybrid</b> instruments. In Action 2, OECD recommends that counties introduce a “linking rule” that denies the deduction of costs which give rise to HMA outcomes in the payer jurisdiction, such as double deduction, deduction with no inclusion, indirect deduction with no inclusion, as the main measures for addressing HMAs. Among the 15 Actions of the BEPS Project, Action on HMAs is strongly recommended by OECD and G 20 to the 100 countries that plan to implement BEPS. However, considering the historical and economic background of each country, it is difficult to solve HMAs solely with the uniform introduction of a linking rule. Some countries have developed their own countermeasures to HMAs. To successfully counter HMAs, one needs to study the HMA phenomenon and research the current rules.
