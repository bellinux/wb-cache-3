50|$|The FACIT ECM 64, {{manufactured}} by Swedish company Facit AB, is {{a prototype of}} carousel memory. To avoid having a single, long magnetic tape, it instead has 64 small rolls of 9 meters each, with 1.6-cm wide tape on each roll, divided into 8 channels per <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> speed is 5 m/s. To read a particular roll, the carousel rotates so the desired roll ends up at the bottom. A counterweight sits at the free end of the tape, and facilitates the roll in moving out and down into a mechanism with a read-and-write head. The tape is then rewound. The average seek time is 2 seconds and the storage space is 2560 kilobytes. The control system is operated by transistors. Both the carousel and individual spools are replicable.|$|E

5000|$|Jack was recruited, by E.F. Sanquenetti, to be {{the display}} manager, for the Utah Museum of Fine Arts. He held that {{position}} for several years. At the museum, he mentored several young artists. He was legendary, with his skill and craftsmanship. During that period, he was also attending the University of Utah school of Fine Arts Masters Program. Jack often took a common sense approach toward making displays. He sometimes used automotive materials (Bondo) to build stands for stone fragments. He was very pragmatic towards his work and developed methodology for creating fine exhibits. Of note was his aid in creating an installation work for Chris Burden, the performance artist. Chris {{had wanted to be}} displayed on a wall in medical tape cocoon. Jack laid out <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> adhesive side down on the museum floor, and then he carefully pulled it up into a single sheet.

He then screwed the 1 x 2 into the wall and Chris just hung there for 8 hours. When it was all over Chris thanked Jack and he said that Jack was instrumental in realizing the work. Jack would work on his MFA, after hours, in the museum workshop. His work was in a small room about 10 feet by 20 feet. His entire portfolio was stuffed in the room along with several welding tanks and a 57 Pontiac Front nose and grill.Jack was fairly notorious for pranks in the museum. He would place Ceramic high electrical insulators in display cases showing tang dynasty sang de bœufs (ox blood) red bowls, a baroque picture frame around Frank's Parking spot sign, or questionable photographs in Frank's Slide carousel. He once painted, signage on the loading dock, which said: Loading Dock, [...] "A place where you can get loaded". Frank made him scrub it off.

To understand the mechanism(s) that limited Jc in flat-rolled Sr 0. 6 K 0. 4 Fe 2 As 2 (Sr 122) tapes, microstructure analysis has been considered the most direct and efficient way.
