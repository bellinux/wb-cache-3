2500|$|An inquest {{into the}} death of Lawrence was held in February 1997. The five {{suspects}} refused to answer any questions, claiming privilege against self-incrimination. The inquest concluded on 13 February 1997, with the jury returning a verdict after 30 minutes' deliberation of unlawful killing [...] "in a completely unprovoked <b>racist</b> <b>attack</b> by five white youths"; this finding went {{beyond the bounds of}} their instructions. On 14 February 1997, the Daily Mail newspaper labelled all five suspects [...] "murderers". The headline read, [...] "Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us." [...] Underneath this headline appeared pictures of the five suspects: Dobson, Neil and Jamie Acourt, Knight, and Norris.

2500|$|All three {{witnesses}} at the {{bus stop}} {{at the time of the}} attack said in statements that the attack was sudden and short; none was later able to identify any of the suspects. In the days following Lawrence's murder, several residents came forward to provide names of suspects and an anonymous note was also left on a police car windscreen and in a telephone box naming a local gang as the five main suspects. [...] The suspects were Gary Dobson, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight and David Norris. [...] In February 1999, officers investigating the handling of the initial inquiry revealed that a woman who might have been a vital witness had telephoned detectives three times within the first few days after the killing, and appealed for her to contact them again. The five suspects were previously involved in racist knife attacks around the Eltham area. Four weeks before Lawrence's death, Dobson and Neil Acourt were involved in the <b>racist</b> <b>attack</b> of a black teenager, Kevin London, whom they verbally abused and attempted to stab. Neil's brother Jamie was accused of stabbing teenagers Darren Witham in May 1992 and Darren Giles in 1994, causing Giles to have a heart attack. The stabbing attacks of Gurdeep Bhangal and Stacey Benefield, which both occurred in March 1993, in Eltham, were also linked to Neil and Jamie Acourt, David Norris and Gary Dobson.|$|E
