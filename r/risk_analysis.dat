40|$|Abstract—Competing <b>risks</b> <b>analysis</b> is a {{field of}} applied {{statistics}} with research {{dating back to the}} eighteenth century. Starting in the 1980 s, the interaction with survival analysis has lead to significant advances in competing <b>risks</b> <b>analysis,</b> especially in dealing with the dependency and identifiability issues, both of which are often intermingled with each other and have been the focus of the controversy surrounding classical competing <b>risks</b> <b>analysis.</b> The usefulness of competing <b>risks</b> <b>analysis</b> in engineering reliability has been recognized since the 1960 s, and several important models in competing <b>risks</b> <b>analysis</b> were developed in the context of reliability modeling [e. g., Marshall-Olkin (1967) model].

5|$|According to {{an article}} on The Conversation written by Robert Merkel, Heartbleed {{revealed}} a massive failure of <b>risk</b> <b>analysis.</b> Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance to performance than to security, which no longer makes sense in his opinion. But Merkel considers that OpenSSL should not be blamed as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs will cause vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions {{the use of the}} C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
