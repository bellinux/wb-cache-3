Recently, at Ontario Power Generation, a routine inspection on one of the hydro pump generators revealed a very serious condition on the <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> that was unknown to exist before the inspection took place.

40|$|Unit 5 at Ohau A {{power station}} has been closely {{monitored}} since 2002 following {{the identification of}} a defect in a construction weld of one <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> arm. In 2003 {{it was determined that}} the defect, initially identified in 1996, was beginning to grow and there was evidence of further defects developing. By the end of 2005, after substantial analysis, risk studies and the discovery of a further 18 defects, the unit was removed from service to effect a rotor arm replacement. The following paper covers the four years of condition monitoring, defect analysis and risk studies that were carried out on the <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> prior to the complex physical works of replacing a <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> arm. The paper will also cover, in brief, the physical works carried out during the rotor arm replacement. This work highlights the benefits of routine engineering assessments and the use of non destructive testing methods in assessing critical defects. 1. Meridian Energy Assets Meridian Energy is the largest state owned electricity generator in New Zealand. It owns and operates nine hydro stations in the South Island, New Zealand's largest wind farm in the North Island, and a wind turbine in Wellington. The hydro assets are broken up in to the Waitaki Valley and Manapouri. The Waitaki scheme consists of eight power stations containing 32 generating units ranging in size from 15 MW to 90 MW. The Manapouri scheme consists of one station and seven 135 MVA units. Hydro units generate electricity by harnessing the gravitational potential energy available from the water. The water flows down to the turbine via the penstock and into the scroll case. The turbine runner is located in the centre of the scroll case in a circle of guide vanes and wicket gates that direct and control flow to the runner to vary the output power. The runner is connected to the generator rotor via the main shaft rotating a set of electromagnets within the stator to generate electricity. 1. 1.

40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are part. During the last century the machines for electricity production have been developed from a few mega watts per unit up to several hundreds mega watts per unit. The development and increasing of size of the hydropower machines have also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurements are still the most reliable and commonly used method to avoid failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and as protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces in different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the guide bearing bracket. This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft depending on misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and C. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim. The magnetic pull force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper C, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic force. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the rotor rim position relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that the natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the rotor rim position in relation to the <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> is considered. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements together with analysis of the rotordynamics are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads as acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without redesign of the bearings. During commissioning of hydropower unit, measurements of shaft vibrations and forces are the most reliable method to investigate the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behavior of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behavior is important before the generator is put in operation, after rehabilitation or when new machines will be installed. Godkänd; 2005; 20061214 (haneit...|$|E

This method was used in Paper C to investigate bearing stiffness and damping. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft due to misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and D. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim.

The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the position of the rotor rim relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the position of the rotor rim in relation to the <b>rotor</b> <b>spider</b> is considered. In Paper E, the effect of damping rods was included in the analysis of the magnetic pull force. The resulting force was found to be reduced significantly when the damper rods were taken into account. An interesting effect of the rotor damper rods was that they reduced the eccentricity forces and introduced a force component perpendicular to the direction of eccentricity. The results from the finite-element simulations were used to determine how the forces affect the stability of the generator rotor. Damped natural eigenfrequencies and the damping ratio for load and no-load conditions were investigated. When applying the forces computed in the time- dependent model, the damped natural eigenfrequencies were found to increase and the stability of the generator rotor was found to be reduced, compared with when the forces were computed in a stationary model. Damage due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring have been observed in several hydroelectric power units. The damage can cause high repair costs to the runner and the discharge ring as well as considerable production losses. In Paper F a rotor model of a 45 MW hydropower unit is used for the analysis of the rotor dynamical phenomena occurring due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring for different grades of lateral force on the turbine and bearing damping. The rotor model consists of a generator rotor and a turbine, which are connected to an elastic shaft supported by three isotropic bearings. The discrete representation of the rotor model consist of 32 degrees of freedom. To increase the speed of the analysis, the size of the model has been reduced with the IRS method to a system with 8 degrees of freedom. The results show that a small gap between the turbine and discharge ring can be dangerous, due to the risk of contact with high contact forces as a consequence. It has also been observed that backward whirl can occur and in some cases the turbine motion becomes quasi-periodic or chaotic. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements, together with analysis of the rotor dynamics, are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of the bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without re-designing the bearings. During commissioning of a hydropower unit, measurement of shaft vibrations and forces is the most reliable methods for investigating the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behaviour of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behaviour is important before a generator is put in operation, after overhaul or when a new machine is to be installed. Godkänd; 2008; 20081111 (ysko...|$|E
