5|$|Throughout June6, Blanca's {{convective}} structure {{became more}} symmetric as it completed its eyewall replacement cycle. Aided by impressive outflow, the hurricane regained Category4 status by 12:00UTC, marking its secondary peak intensity with winds of 130mph (215km/h). Soon thereafter, Blanca moved back over cooler waters and began weakening. A {{turn to the}} north-northwest also occurred at this time as it <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> mid-level ridge over Mexico. The hurricane passed roughly 30mi (45km) northeast of Socorro Island on June7. An automated weather station there recorded sustained winds of , with a peak gust of , before it ceased reporting. Additionally, a pressure of 977.3mbar (hPa; 28.86inHg) was observed. Deep convection steadily weakened and the hurricane's eye filled as the winds decreased.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|Unsuccessful {{contacts}} {{were the}} exception {{rather than the}} norm for the RLI, particularly on Fireforce. An example is an encounter with guerrillas in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north of Mount Darwin, on 19 July 1975. On that day a Territorial Force (TF) unit engaged a group of cadres near a river and killed two without suffering casualties. The nationalist fighters retreated into a defensive ambush position on the banks, beneath the roots of some overhanging trees. The Territorials then summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando from Mount Darwin, and on arrival made a sweep of the river line, accompanied by 10 Troop. When the Rhodesians <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> bend in the stream the concealed insurgents opened fire, immediately killing a Territorial sergeant and RLI Rifleman Hennie Potgieter. Rifleman Ken Lucas, an FN MAG gunner, suffered a wound to his leg. After the initial burst of fire, the insurgents remained behind their cover and waited, concealed from security force eyes. Judging from the silence and inactivity that the guerrillas had fled, and thinking that the two downed men were still alive, Major Hank Meyer told Lieutenant Joe du Plooy to sweep around the river with two 7 Troop sticks and send a medic out to give treatment.|$|E

25|$|The corners on this {{rear part}} of the {{building}} are <b>rounded,</b> <b>a</b> somewhat unusual condition for corners in buildings of this type of architecture. After a recent remodeling, most windows and doors were finished in near-duplicative (usually louvered casement) designs. The new annex on the side features arched openings to the street and has glass fenestration. This addition does not contribute to the property's architectural value but due to its disposition and volume it does not harm the main structure's integrity. Even with the 1928 alterations this building is still a magnificent example of Spanish architecture in Ponce and of the neoclassical style.|$|E
500|$|As the Union cavalry's {{advance guard}} <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> sharp turn, it {{encountered}} four rebel scouts, and captured two of them. [...] From the two prisoners, Major Powell's group {{was able to}} learn the location and strength of the two rebel camps. [...] The two escaped rebels were not strongly pursued, and {{did not see the}} entire advance guard. [...] They assumed they had encountered a small group of Union home guard, and had no concerns as they returned to a very quiet camp of about 500 men.|$|E
500|$|For four days, Connie {{maintained}} its peak intensity as its track {{shifted from the}} west-northwest toward the northwest, passing to the northeast of the Bahamas as it <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> large ridge. On August7, its eye had decreased to a diameter of [...] By August10, the eye had lost its definition as Connie slowed its northwest track. It began a west-northwest drift due to slight Fujiwhara interaction with developing Hurricane Diane to its southeast, {{as well as a}} building ridge to its northeast. The hurricane turned to the north on August11 and was steadily weakening, due to the combination of upwelling and entrainment of cool air. Connie turned toward the north-northeast on August12, by which time it had weakened to a minimal hurricane.|$|E

5000|$|Tournament {{scores are}} {{reported}} by totalling scores relative to par in each round (there are usually four rounds in professional tournaments). If {{each of the}} four <b>rounds</b> has <b>a</b> par of 72, the tournament par would be 288. For example, a golfer could record a 70 in the first <b>round,</b> <b>a</b> 72 in the second <b>round,</b> <b>a</b> 73 in the third <b>round,</b> and <b>a</b> 69 in the fourth round.

500|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} peak intensity, Typhoon Vera turned westward {{in the general}} direction of Okinawa. The storm weakened as it approached land, and late on August25, Vera tracked directly over the island, with both the JTWC and JMA estimating winds of [...] Vera's motion began to slow as the storm <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> subtropical ridge to its north, and after reaching the western periphery of the ridge at 06:00UTC on August26, Vera turned to the northwest, and later to the north. Meanwhile, Vera began to lose tropical characteristics and transition into an extratropical cyclone. After passing almost [...] east of Shanghai, Vera continued to weaken due to decreased outflow that was previously aided by the storm's connection to the monsoon trough. Midday on August28, Vera made landfall near the Kunsan Air Base in South Korea as a tropical storm. At 18:00UTC, Vera cleared the Korean Peninsula. After accelerating towards the northeast, the JTWC estimated that Vera completed its transition on the morning of August29, although the JMA continued to watch its remnants until September2.|$|E
500|$|Their sampan {{was soon}} spotted by North Vietnamese troops, {{some of whom}} fired at them, but Norris and Nguyen {{could not afford to}} return fire. They paddled furiously, using the current and dense foliage along {{the far side of the}} river to their advantage, and trying to out-distance the soldiers. However, when they <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> bend in the river, the NVA fired on them with a heavy caliber machine gun. They pulled the sampan to the bank and turned it over to provide some cover. Icke in Bilk 11 {{overhead}} called in air support and five U.S. Navy A-4 Skyhawks led by Lt. Denny Sapp from the carrier Hancock killed a number of North Vietnamese troops and provided cover for his final escape. Two A-1 Skyraiders also assisted, dropping both explosives and MK47 smoke bombs, providing a smokescreen. Returning to the river, the three men were soon able to receive support from South Vietnamese forces. Landing on the river bank, they were met by some ARVN soldiers. Hambleton was unable to walk and they carried him back to their bunker. There, an M113 armored personnel carrier carried Hambleton, Norris and Nguyen back to Brigade Headquarters in Dong Ha.|$|E

2500|$|The Alternative Forks: Riders would float along a {{relatively}} smooth path until they <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> corner with a waterfall, and another fork. [...] One path would take riders {{back to the}} main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end. [...] The other fork would reconnect with the main path before the rock pool. [...] Originally, a fork carried riders down a set of steep drops, before a curved drop into the main path right at the end. [...] In the late 1980s, this path was merged into the main pathway, creating the rock pool, and final hill, that are still in use today. [...] Today, the first fork is closed off, but the points where the forks reconnect to the main path are still connected to the ride.|$|E
2500|$|The third division, the Alpine Division, {{opened in}} 1896 and {{consisted}} of [...] of [...] narrow gauge track with 127 curves and 18 bridges and trestles. On this line there were three cars available for shuttling between Echo and the end-of-line, though only one car ever operated at a time due to electrical limitations, {{and there was no}} two-way traffic. The division spanned the broad face of Las Flores Canyon, <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> promontory called the “Cape of Good Hope,” traveled deep into Millard Canyon, reappeared at the front face of the mountain, and eventually disappeared into Grand Canyon where it terminated at the foot of Mount Lowe. This location was called Crystal Springs (elev.

2500|$|In early 1932, May was {{involved}} in another manhunt, this time for Albert Johnson, soon known as the [...] "Mad Trapper of Rat River." [...] While serving a search warrant for illegal trapping on the Rat River, Constable King of the RCMP was shot and wounded by Johnson, sparking off a long chase that became front-page news across the continent. Johnson killed Constable Edger Millen. May was again hired {{to see if he}} could find Johnson, who had seemingly disappeared. On February 13, May solved the mystery when he noted a set of footprints leading off from caribou tracks in the middle of the frozen river. Johnson had been following their tracks to hide his own, but had to strike off the path to set up camp at night. Following the trail over the next few days, the RCMP <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> bend on the river on February 17 to find Johnson in the middle of the trail again, unable to dodge for the bank without his snowshoes on. A firefight broke out during which one of the RCMP officers was seriously wounded and Johnson killed. May arrived just after the action ended. He landed beside the injured officer and flew him [...] to a doctor and was credited with saving his life.|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 2013, a 52-year-old {{woman from}} Dallas, Texas, fell [...] {{to her death}} while riding the New Texas Giant roller coaster. According to one {{eyewitness}} account, the victim, who was overweight, was concerned about being properly secured after boarding the ride because her restraints clicked once while the other restraints click three times. A ride attendant assured her {{that as long as}} she heard a click, it was secure. Other eyewitnesses believed the seat restraint locked into place normally and reported seeing it in the lowered position when the roller coaster returned. Some riders informed investigators that the woman was thrown from the roller coaster as it <b>rounded</b> <b>a</b> turn, and one rider tweeted that he saw the restraint come undone. The ride closed for two months during the investigation. The victim was found on top of the metal roof of one of the coaster tunnels, near the Music Mill Amphitheater. Due to the similarity of Texas Giant and Iron Rattler, Six Flags Fiesta Texas ceased running the new Iron Rattler pending investigation findings from Six Flags Over Texas. In under a month, Iron Rattler reopened on August 14 with seat belts as another added restraint to the two trains. Representatives from Gerstlauer, the German company that designed and built the ride's trains, are planning on participating in the investigation. While Gerstlauer would not discuss specifics of the incident, the company did state that their restraint system could not open while the ride was in motion. Then on September 10, 2013, Six Flags Over Texas released a statement stating that the park has finished its investigation on the recent incident and will reopen the Texas Giant on September 14, 2013. With the reopening of the coaster the park has re-designed the restraint-bar pads and added seat-belts to the three trains and added a test seat at the entrance so riders can test if they are able to ride. The woman's family filed lawsuits against both the park and manufacturer. The park and manufacturer subsequently sued each other saying the other was responsible for the accident. On November 18, 2014, attorneys for the victim's family announced that they had reached an undisclosed settlement with both Six Flags and Gerstlauer, with a spokesperson saying the family [...] "is very pleased with the settlement and appreciates the condolences offered by Six Flags and Gerstlauer".|$|E
