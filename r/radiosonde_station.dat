From three year's mid-seasonal-month grid data, measures of extrapolation error are obtained {{over half of the}} Northern Hemisphere. Verifying tests with <b>radiosonde</b> <b>station</b> data indicate that the error in low latitudes is substantially due to analysis noise in the 500 -mb. grid data. When the same techniques are applied to 200 -mb. information, further error studies show considerably less feasibility of extrapolation from that level to 500 mb.

40|$|Adaptive {{observation}} is {{an approach to}} {{improving the quality of}} numerical weather forecasts through the optimization of observing networks. It is sometimes referred to as Data Targeting (DT). This approach has been applied to high impact weather during specific field campaigns in the past decade. Adaptive observations may involve various types of observations, including either specific research observing platforms or routine observing platforms employed in an adaptive way. The North-Atlantic TReC 2003 and the EURORISK-PREVIEW 2008 exercises focused on the North-Atlantic and Western Europe areas using mainly routine observing systems. These campaigns also included Mediterranean cases. The most recent campaign, DTS-MEDEX- 2009, is the first campaign in which the DT method has been used to address exclusively Mediterranean high impact weather events. In this campaign, which is an important stage in the MEDEX development, only operational <b>radiosonde</b> <b>stations</b> and commercial aircraft data (AMDAR) have provided additional observations. Although specific diagnostic studies are needed {{to assess the impact of}} the extra-observations on forecast skill and demonstrate the effectiveness of DTS-MEDEX- 2009, some preliminary findings can be deduced from a survey of this targeting exercise. After a description of the data targeting system and some illustrations of particular cases, this paper attempts some comparisons of additional observation needs (through effectively deployed radio-soundings) with sensitivity climatologies in the Mediterranean. The first step towards a sensitivity climatology for Mediterranean cases of high impact weather is indirectly given by the frequency of extra-soundings launched from the network of <b>radiosonde</b> <b>stations</b> involved in the DTS-MEDEX- 2009 campaign...|$|R

A reliable average requires more than 40 model runs, which are differentiated by the direction and speed of the geostrophic wind under the assumption of neutral stratification.

40|$|A {{neural network}} {{algorithm}} inverting selected channels from the Advance Microwave Sounding Unit instruments AMSU-A and AMSU-B {{was applied to}} retrieve layer averaged relative humidity. The neural network was trained with a global synthetic dataset representing clear-sky conditions. A precision of around 6 % was obtained when retrieving global simulated radiances, the precision deteriorated less than 1 % when real mid-latitude AMSU radiances were inverted and compared with co-located data from a <b>radiosonde</b> <b>station.</b> The 6 % precision outperforms by 1 % the reported precision estimate from a linear single-channel regression between radiance and weighting function averaged relative humidity, the more traditional approach to exploit AMSU data. Added advantages are not only a better precision; the AMSU-B humidity information is more optimally exploited by including temperature information from AMSU-A channels; and the layer averaged humidity is a more physical quantity than the weighted humidity, for comparison with other datasets. The training dataset proved adequate for inverting real radiances from a mid-latitude site, but it is limited by not considering the impact of clouds or surface emissivity changes, and further work is needed in this direction for further validation of the precision estimates.
