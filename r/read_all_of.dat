Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, {{where her mother}} worked in the science department. When {{she was a young}} teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling <b>read</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> her books.|$|E

He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to <b>read</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them.

Shortly thereafter, she married Evan Maxwell, a now former newspaper reporter who spent over fifteen years {{working for the}} LA Times, covering international crime. Early in their marriage, Maxwell became very bored. Her husband worked from 4:00 PM to midnight, and as there was no bus service near their house and Evan needed the car for work, Maxwell found herself alone {{at home with their}} toddler son. Maxwell did not like television and claims to have <b>read</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the science fiction books in the local public library, in addition to everything science fiction in a local second-hand book store.

[...] He conceptualised 16moves and practised them with wooden swords, filming his sessions as references for the game's animation. [...] One move, the Web of Death, was copied from the 1984 sword and sorcery film Conan the Destroyer. [...] Spinning the sword like a propeller, Brown [...] "nearly took [...] eye out" [...] when he practised the move. [...] Playing back the videos, the team traced each frame of action onto clear plastic sheets laid over the television screen. [...] The tracings were transferred on a grid that helped the team map the swordplay images, pixel by pixel, to a digital form. [...] Brown refused to follow the convention of using small sprites to represent the fighters in the game, forcing the coders to conceive a method to animate larger blocks of graphics: Palace Software's co-founder Richard Leinfellner said they [...] "multiplexed the sprites and had different look-up tables for different frames." ...|$|E

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured {{him he would}} get the role of Bond, and Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them. A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig <b>read</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisors on the set of Munich as inspiring because, [...] "Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer.

500|$|A third Dooley collection, Mr. Dooley's Philosophy, {{appeared}} in 1900. The lead story was [...] "A Book Review", that is, Mr. Dooley's discussion of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt's wartime memoir, The Rough Riders. In Mr. Dooley's version, Roosevelt wins the whole war by himself, a role slightly {{greater than that}} in his actual book. Dooley's conclusion: [...] "No man that bears a grudge against himself'll ever be governor of a state. [...] And if Teddy done it all he ought to say so and relieve the suspense. [...] But if I were him I'd call the book Alone in Cuba." [...] Somewhat to Dunne's surprise, [...] "Rosenfelt" [...] (as Dooley called him) took the sting in good humor, and when the two met, told Dunne of a young female admirer of his, who told the governor that she had <b>read</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his books, with her favorite Alone in Cuba. Roosevelt was elected vice president on McKinley's ticket in 1900, and when he succeeded after the president was assassinated the following year, Dunne wrote of the new chief executive, the youngest to hold that position, [...] "a man is... {{old enough to be}} president when he becomes president.

500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta. Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson. It took Lieberstein and Celotta {{four or five days}} to write this episode. Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was {{inspired}} by the days that he was an administrative assistant for Countrywide Home Loans. Farrell recalled watching the company try new online initiatives and seeing them all be unsuccessful. The talking head interview wherein Michael compares Holly to a baker came after what the writers call [...] "blitzes", in which all the writers write a talking head on a specific topic, such as [...] "Michael's feelings to Holly". Then they all <b>read</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them out loud and see which one gets the biggest reaction. The YouTube video of Ryan being arrested was set on a private account. After [...] "Goodbye, Toby" [...] aired, the video was released to the public. When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character. After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I <b>read</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the stuff he had to do, I {{had to look at}} it {{from the point of view}} of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E
