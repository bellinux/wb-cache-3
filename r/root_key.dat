A <b>root</b> <b>key</b> is a term for a unique passcode that must be generated for secure server interaction with a protective network, usually called the root zone.

50|$|TKIP and {{the related}} WPA {{standard}} implement three new security features to address security problems encountered in WEP protected networks. First, TKIP implements a key mixing function that combines the secret <b>root</b> <b>key</b> with the initialization vector before passing it to the RC4 initialization. WEP, in comparison, merely concatenated the initialization vector to the <b>root</b> <b>key,</b> and passed this value to the RC4 routine. This permitted {{the vast majority of}} the RC4 based WEP related key attacks. Second, WPA implements a sequence counter to protect against replay attacks. Packets received out of order will be rejected by the access point. Finally, TKIP implements a 64-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC).|$|E

50|$|A related {{method is}} to {{exchange}} a master key (sometimes termed a <b>root</b> <b>key)</b> and derive subsidiary keys as needed from that key and some other data (often referred to as diversification data). The most common use for this method is probably in SmartCard based cryptosystems, such as those found in banking cards. The bank or credit network embeds their secret key into the card's secure key storage during card production at a secured production facility. Then at the Point of sale the card and card reader are both able to derive {{a common set of}} session keys based on the shared secret key and card-specific data (such as the card serial number). This method can also be used when keys must be related to each other (i.e., departmental keys are tied to divisional keys, and individual keys tied to departmental keys). However, tying keys to each other in this way increases the damage which may result from a security breach as attackers will learn something about more than one key. This reduces entropy, with regard to an attacker, for each key involved.|$|E
