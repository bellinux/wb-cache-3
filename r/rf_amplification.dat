These methods can reduce the PAPR to some extent with the price of higher processing complexity or data redundancy.

5000|$|In 1956, GE {{engineers}} {{added an}} NPN transistor companion to the 2N107. They designated it the 2N170, manufactured with the rate grown junction process originally developed by Bell Labs. It {{was designed for}} use in higher frequency applications, such as radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>amplification,</b> while the 2N107 was for low frequency audio amplifier applications. The 2N170 was priced slightly higher than the 2N107. The 2N170 was a fallout from the 2N167, 2N168 and 2N169 transistor lines. In the 1950s, General Electric distinguished their PNP and NPN transistors by their case styles.

5000|$|Tuned Radio Frequency sets (TRF sets) {{were the}} most popular class of early radio, {{primarily}} because the RCA company had a lock on the superheterodyne circuit patents and it was more profitable for companies to jump into radio manufacturing TRF sets. These used several valves (tubes) to provide <b>RF</b> <b>amplification,</b> detection, and audio amplification. Early TRF sets only operated headphones, but by the mid-1920s it was more common to use additional amplification to power a loudspeaker, despite the expense. The sound quality produced from [...] "moving-iron" [...] speakers used on such sets is sometimes described as torturous, although by the late 1920s the Kellogg-Rice dynamic (moving-coil) speaker had begun to find favor due to its superior sound-reproduction ability.|$|E

50|$|The TRF {{receiver}} was patented in 1916 by Ernst Alexanderson. His {{concept was}} that each stage would amplify the desired signal while reducing the interfering ones. Multiple stages of <b>RF</b> <b>amplification</b> {{would make the}} radio more sensitive to weak stations, and the multiple tuned circuits would give it a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity than the single stage receivers common at that time. All tuned stages of the radio must track and tune to the desired reception frequency. This {{is in contrast to}} the modern superheterodyne receiver that must only tune the receiver's RF front end and local oscillator to the desired frequencies; all the following stages work at a fixed frequency and do not depend on the desired reception frequency.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more serious}} {{drawback}} {{was that it}} could act as an inadvertent radio transmitter, producing interference (RFI) in nearby receivers. In AM reception, {{to get the most}} sensitivity the tube was operated very close to instability and could easily break into oscillation (and in CW reception did oscillate), and the resulting radio signal was radiated by its wire antenna. In nearby receivers, the regenerative's signal would beat with the signal of the station being received in the detector, creating annoying heterodynes, (beats), howls and whistles. [...] Early regeneratives which oscillated easily were called [...] "bloopers", and were made illegal in Europe. One preventative measure was to use a stage of <b>RF</b> <b>amplification</b> before the regenerative detector, to isolate it from the antenna. [...] But by the mid 1920s [...] "regens" [...] were no longer sold by the major radio manufacturers.|$|E

Power dividers/combiners {{are one of}} the essential and crucial components of the modern RF communication systems since dividing makes <b>RF</b> power <b>amplification</b> easier to handle. As the data rates of the systems increase, the demand for wide bandwidth devices become more urgent and essential. Also, wide bandwidth systems show broadband performance in electronic warfare applications such as jamming. However, for RF power combiners/dividers increasing the bandwidth comes along with an engineering trade-off; the isolation of the divider decreases signifcantly. There are several studies in literature that offer various types of trivial solutions for improving both the bandwidth and the isolation performance of generic Wilkinson and Gysel power divider structures. This work concentrates on the conventional Gysel power divider structure since for high-power applications Gysel divider is preferred mainly for the feasibility of external isolation resistors. We propose a modified Gysel divider structure with a series LC circuit resonant at the center frequency to correct the impedance at the output and the isolation ports and the generic transmission line impedances optimized to adapt to this modification. We both show the interrelations of the capacitor and inductor values and also their relations to the scattering parameters and offer a guideline to choose the appropriate filter for the required application.

Our analyses indicate that the adiabatic approach will eventually lead to orders-of-magnitude improvements in power-performance and even cost-performance, compared to competing approaches, for all power-limited applications.

40|$|The low {{frequency}} rf linacs and bunch compressors in the NLC are heavily loaded by beam currents up to 0. 9 A. Beam loading generates bunch-to-bunch energy deviations, which {{need to be}} compensated to operate with long bunch trains in the linear collider. There are two basic compen-sation techniques, namely T and F schemes. The F scheme is operationally straightforward but requires addi-tional rf systems which are powered at slightly different frequencies. In contrast, the T scheme does not require any additional rf and is thus expected to be less expen-sive. Here, the loading compensation is realized by early injection combined with rf phase and amplitude modula-tion. The phase/amplitude modulation is performed with fast phase shifters at low <b>rf</b> power before <b>amplification</b> by the klystrons.

The Digital base-band signals cannot be transmitted directly through wireless channels due to the properties of electromagnetic waves. The baseband signals need to be converted to analog through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), up converted to higher frequency using an up conversion mixer and then transmitted through the channel. The received signals are down converted to base band frequency and then converted to digital again using the {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC).

In this study we compared the courses of infections with these two viruses in EL 4 cells in order to investigate at which step(s) the infection process of MVMp 3 is interrupted. The two viruses bound equally well to EL 4 cells, and similar amounts of MVMi and MVMp 3 input virion DNA appeared in the nuclear fractions of EL 4 cells 1 h after infection. However, double-stranded replicative-form (RF) DNA of the two viruses appeared at different times, at 10 h postinfection with MVMi and at 24 h postinfection with MVMp 3. The amount of MVMp 3 RF DNA detected at 24 h was very small because it was produced only in a tiny subset {{of the population of}} EL 4 cells that proved to be permissive for MVMp 3. Replication of double-stranded viral DNA in EL 4 cells was measured after transfection of purified RF DNA, cloned viral DNA, and cloned viral DNA with a mutation preventing synthesis of the capsid proteins. In each of these cases, DNA replication was comparable for MVMi and MVMp 3. Production of virus particles also appeared to be similar after transfection of the two types of RF DNA into EL 4 cells. Conversion of incoming 32 P-labeled single-stranded MVM DNA to 32 P-labeled double-stranded RF DNA was detected only after <b>RF</b> DNA <b>amplification,</b> indicating that few molecules serve as templates for viral DNA amplification.

40|$|Abstract Digital Predistortion for Broadband Radio-over-Fiber Transmission Systems Zichen Xuan Concordia University 2015 With the {{increase}} of the demand of high capacity wireless access, design of cost effective broadband wireless signal distribution system is required, particularly for future massive multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) wireless. Recently, Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) transmission systems have been revisited for broadband wireless signal distribution between central processing unit (CPU) and remote radio unit (RRU) (i. e., antenna towers). RoF, {{which is based on}} optical subcarrier modulation and thus an analog transmission system, fully utilize the advantages of broadband and low-loss fiber transmission, and also radio signal transmission. Unfortunately, RoF transmission systems are very susceptible to nonlinear distortions, which can be generated by all inline functional components of the RoF systems. However, two typical functions, i. e., optical subcarrier modulation and <b>RF</b> power <b>amplification,</b> are the two key sources of the nonlinear distortions. Various linearization techniques have been investigated for power RF amplifiers. It has been found that digital predistortion (DPD) linearization {{is one of the best}} approaches for RF bandwidth of up to 20 MHz. In this thesis, DPD linearization is explored for broadband RoF transmission systems. Instead of DPD implemented in baseband previously, a DPD linearization technique implemented in RF domain is investigated and demonstrated experimentally for broadband RoF transmission systems. Memory polynomial (MP) model is used for theoretical modeling of nonlinear RoF transmission systems, in which both nonlinear distortion and memory effect can be included. In order to implement the predistorter of the DPD using the MP model, least square (LS) method is used to extract the coefficients of the predistorter. Using the obtained coefficients, the trained predistorter is implemented and then verified in two experiments of directly modulated RoF transmission systems. In the first experiment, the DPD is verified in WiFi over fiber transmission systems, and more than 8 dB and 5. 6 dB improvements of error vector magnitude (EVM) are achieved in back to back (BTB) and after 10 km single mode fiber (SMF) transmission. In the second experiment, both WiFi and ultra wide band (UWB) wireless signals are transmitted in the RoF system, which occupies over 2. 4 GHz transmission bandwidth. It is shown that the implemented DPD leads to EVM improvements of 4. 5 dB (BTB) and 3. 1 dB (10 km SMF) for the WiFi signal, and 4. 6 dB (BTB) and 4 dB (10 km SMF) for the UWB signal...|$|R
