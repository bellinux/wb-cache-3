5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to following the main storyline, the player character will witness {{and can take}} part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if {{a group of people}} <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player character can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player character must be a faster draw than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on wanted posters; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and Five Finger Fillet; and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.|$|E
25|$|Passenger service began May 29, 1912. It {{was thought}} that commuters would trade a direct ride to GCT for a lower fare but more {{comfortable}} <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> the Bronx, where they would transfer to a 5 cent ride on the Third Avenue El into Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|In December 1999, Dreamworld added {{a variety}} of kids rides in a new themed area called Kennyland. The area took over the {{northern}} portion of Village Oval. It consisted of a selection of rides and attractions including Wild Wheels (SBF Visa Group Convoy), Dream Copters (SBF Visa Group Jets), Adventure Trails (jumping castle) and Kenny's Cars (SBF Visa Group Mini Bumper Cars). Around the same time, the Creature Cruise was converted from a boat <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> a walkthrough attraction.|$|E

25|$|On June 16, 2016, it was {{announced}} that late-night R service would be extended north to Whitehall Street in order to provide a one-seat <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> Manhattan. This eliminated the need for northbound trains to skip 45th Street and 53rd Street as R trains no longer needed to relay on the express tracks at 36th Street. The change took place on November 5, 2016. During evenings, many R trains originating from Forest Hills-71st Avenue used to short-turn at Whitehall Street, resulting in long headways along the R in Brooklyn. As part of the changes, these short-turns were extended to 95th Street.|$|E
25|$|The {{race has}} {{finished}} since 1975 with laps of the Champs-Élysées. This stage rarely challenges the leader {{because it is}} flat and the leader usually has {{too much time in}} hand to be denied. But in 1987, Pedro Delgado broke away on the Champs to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche. He and Roche finished in the peloton and Roche won the Tour. In modern times, there tends to be a gentlemen's agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, {{it is not uncommon for}} the de facto winner of the overall classification to <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> Paris holding a glass of champagne.|$|E
25|$|The {{player is}} then free to roam around the gas station, and after being {{introduced}} to some more NPCs, including Bella Goth, who claims to be abducted by aliens, completing tasks and being taught the basic objective of the game which is 'Secret Hunting' for the store clerk. The player then exits the shop {{only to find the}} garage around the back has completely disappeared along with Oscar and their car, with only the foundation of the garage remaining. The only thing left from the disappearance is a cell phone, which the player answers and a man named Doctor Dominic Newlow offers the player a job, requiring him or her to get a <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> town and find a place to stay.|$|E

25|$|At the Indian village, Anderson is ambushed by renegade Indian Two Feathers. After {{defeating}} him, Two Feathers praises Anderson's {{strength in}} battle, {{and out of}} sympathy because he once had a child he had lost, tells him the real location of Sarah: Bob Graham's estate, Big Rock ranch. Anderson blasts his way into Graham's villa, and finally confronts him. After a fierce gunfight, Graham is believed dead and falls to the ground, and Anderson reunites with his daughter. Graham, clinging to life and gun trained on Anderson, reveals {{that was the one}} who murdered Anderson's father. Just as Graham is about to finish off Anderson, Sarah manages to shoot Graham with Anderson's gun. After a tearful reunion, father and daughter <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> the sunset.|$|E
25|$|In 1803 the Year XI {{system was}} {{introduced}} {{but it was}} only half-way established by 1809. The Year XI system included 6- and 12-pounder cannons and 5½-inch and 6⅓-inch howitzers. Gribeauval field artillery continued to be used however. In 1829 France adopted the Valée system which reduced the calibers of field artillery to 8- and 12-pound cannons and 24-pound and 6-inch howitzers. Mobility was improved by building only two limber sizes. The 8-pounders and 24-pound howitzers employed the smaller limber while 12-pounders and 6-inch howitzers used the larger limber. Instead of having to march beside the guns, the Valée system allowed all gunners to <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> action while sitting on the limbers. All batteries were standardized at four cannons and two howitzers.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, Jöns {{searches}} {{an abandoned}} village for water. He saves a mute servant girl (Gunnel Lindblom) from being raped {{by a man}} robbing a corpse. He recognizes the man as Raval (Bertil Anderberg), a theologian, who ten years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land. The squire promises to brand the theologian on the face if they meet again. The servant girl joins the squire. The trio <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> town, where the actors met earlier are performing. Skat the actor-manager introduces the other actors to the crowd, then is enticed by Lisa (Inga Gill)—wife of the sentimental and violent blacksmith Plog—away for a tryst. They run off together.

25|$|The {{process for}} {{selecting}} {{an artist to}} design the memorial was somewhat convoluted. Many artists made inquiries with the UDC about designing the memorial in 1909, and some submitted proposals, but the ACMA declined to consider any design because it was still raising funds. The design committee first met on May 16, 1910. Rev. McKim made the motion that the memorial should depict an event in which General Robert E. Lee attempted to <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> the Battle of the Wilderness to rally his troops. Lee was stopped by a private who seized the bridle of Lee's horse and prevented him from going, declaring that the troops would rally themselves. His motion was accepted. Herbert submitted the proposed design to an undisclosed artist to have a model developed and to get an aesthetic opinion about McKim's idea.|$|E
25|$|On September 7 Essex {{rejected}} the meeting place, but the impatient O'Neill found a spot to <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> the river {{up to his}} horse's belly. It was a gesture of humility, and Essex rode with a troop of horse to an overlooking hill before going down alone to the ford, where he conversed with the rebel for half an hour. Both men withdrew to their companies on the hills. A formal meeting followed later, with six witnesses on either side: Essex rode down to the ford with his men and remained on the bank, while the Irish rode into the river - again, up to their horses' bellies. O'Neill spoke bare-headed for a good while, saluting the viceregal party with great respect. After half-an-hour a further conference was arranged at Lagan ford for the following morning.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into Ottoman hands in 1463, the Ottomans quickly {{expanded}} westward, threatening the southern and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia. Since then, Ottoman raids were becoming more frequent. These raids were being carried out by the Akıncı, irregular light cavalry of the Ottoman Empire. They would <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> Christian territory and plunder the countryside during spring and summer, avoiding the fortified border towns and direct military conflict. These continuous raids forced the local population to abandon their land, leaving the frontier castles without supplies. One such raid began in September 1491, with the Ottoman cavalry crossing the Kupa River and reaching Carniola. On their way back, the Ottomans were intercepted by the army of Croatian Ban Ladislav of Egervár and Count Bernardin Frankopan near Udbina, and were defeated in the Battle of Vrpile. The defeat at Vrpile forced the Ottomans to stop their attacks during 1492. After Hadım Yakup Pasha became the sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia, the Ottomans renewed their raids.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he {{testified that he}} had known {{for five or six}} years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time {{afterward}} Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> town, so he went to his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E
500|$|According {{to another}} tradition, Richard {{consulted}} a [...] in Leicester before the battle who foretold that [...] "where your spur should strike on the <b>ride</b> <b>into</b> battle, your head shall be broken on the return".
