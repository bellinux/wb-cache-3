50|$|Risk {{perception}} is the subjective judgement {{that people make}} about the characteristics and severity of a risk. The phrase is most commonly used in reference to natural hazards and threats to the environment or health, such as nuclear power. Several theories have been proposed to explain why different people make different estimates of the dangerousness of risks. Three major families of theory have been developed: psychology approaches (heuristics and cognitive), anthropology/sociology approaches (cultural theory) and interdisciplinary approaches (social amplification of <b>risk</b> <b>framework).</b>|$|E

First, we present the capital asset pricing models and the {{performance}} measures in the downside <b>risk</b> <b>framework</b> as an alter-native to traditional CAPM and to traditional performance measures, respectively.

The results obtained also support the Sortino ratio, the upside potential ratio and Omega measure over Sharpe ratio. Similarly, the results support our two performance measures over Treynor Index and the Jensen alpha. JEL Classifi cation: G 1...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{methods are}} {{inapplicable}} in estimation problems involving non-identifiable parameters. Bayesian methods, {{on the other}} hand, are often both feasible and intuitively reasonable in such problems. This paper establishes the foundations for studying the efficacy of Bayesian updating in estimating nonidentifiable parameters in the competing <b>risks</b> <b>framework.</b> We obtain a useful representation of the posterior distribution of the multiple decrement function, assuming a Dirichler process prior, and derive the limiting posterior distribution. It is noted that posterior estimates of a nonidentifiable parameter may be inferior to estimates based on the prior distribution alone, even when {{the size of the}} available sample grows to infinity. This leads, among other things, to the search for distinguished parameter values, or models, in which Bayesian updating necessarily improves upon one's prior estimate. In a companion paper, it is shown that the multivariate exponential distribution can play such a role in the competing <b>risks</b> <b>framework.</b> Nonidentifiability Efficacy Survival function Bayesian updating Dirichlet process Multivariate exponential distribution...|$|R

Yet no single framework is perfect or perfectly applicable to homeland security, mainly because of the uncertainty and complexity of terrorism. This leaves the decision maker with a series of challenges, the most pressing of which is to manage risk in the ever-evolving arena of homeland security. This paper analyzes the principles of decision making and links them with the risk management processes illustrated in each of the frameworks. The final product is an integrative <b>risk</b> management/governance <b>framework</b> and an evaluation of its utility in a sample context: the nation's passenger rail system. This study narrows the focus even further by conducting a threat analysis on the passenger rail system for the New York and New Jersey region, and applying the integrative <b>risk</b> management/governance <b>framework</b> against a hypothetical terrorist threat on that system.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an Operational <b>Risk</b> <b>Framework</b> for the Performing Arts and Creative Industries. Drawing on established theories of risk management {{widely used in}} financial services, expert sampling methods are used to construct an operational <b>risk</b> <b>framework</b> for the creative industries. Key findings suggest that while commonly identified operational risk categories in banking and finance are relevant, specific sub-categories and event types must be adapted {{to take into account}} idiosyncratic characteristics in the performing arts and creative industries. These include: aspects of organization, employment,institutional frameworks and participant behaviour. Confidentiality and contracting risks in particular are introduced in this paper as new Level 1 categories. The operational <b>risk</b> <b>framework</b> developed here can be used by entrepreneurs and policy-makers across the creative industries to assess risk profiles as well as manage and mitigate exposures. This in turn would enable creative entrepreneurs to present to investors a clear risk/return proposition thereby contributing to growth and value creation in these increasingly important sectors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{development}} of a framework for information security risk assessments within an organisation. A <b>risk</b> <b>framework</b> is a convenient and communicable tool {{that can be used to}} describe the principles and essential components of the security risk management process of an organisation. The framework shows how significant risks can be identified, assessed and treated. It also explains the measures that can be taken to mitigate or ‘treat’ the risk exposure of the organisation for the future. The <b>risk</b> <b>framework</b> will provide a common language, which can be used by all of the parties that are involved in the process, from the members of the board, through the security and audit staffs, to the end users of the systems, as a vehicle for communication and improved understanding. In addition, a <b>risk</b> <b>framework</b> will provide a high level outline for the way in which an organisation will implement information security risk management and define the roles of the key participants in the process...|$|E

The proposed open-source financial risk model separates the dual function that internal risk models perform within financial institutions, first to attempt to optimize the risk-return profile of mostly private economic rent-seeking entities, and second to maximize safety and soundness considerations for the public which is at risk of bearing the consequences of financial actors.
