40|$|This book chapter {{considers}} the liability of entrepreneurs of ‘user-generated content’ (UGC) sites. These immensely popular fora, such as YouTube and My Space, enable their participants to post and view {{a great variety}} of content, not all of it in fact generated by the posting user. The legislative compromise worked out between telecommunications providers and content owners in the 1998 ‘Digital Millennium Copyright Act’ provides the statutory framework, at once insulating the operators of UGC sites from debilitating copyright sanctions, while still affording meaningful relief to copyright owners. The statutory criteria to qualify for the section 512 (c) safe harbor are designed to ensure that the beneficiaries of the safe harbor remain copyright-neutral with respect to the content they host. The recent District Court decision in Viacom v. YouTube, however, indicates that the statutory safe harbor may shield even the entrepreneur who anticipates – indeed “welcome(s) ” – massive infringements so long as the entrepreneur lacks “actual or constructive knowledge of specific and identifiable infringements of individual items. ” While the statute makes clear that the entrepreneur should not be pressed into service as the investigative arm of the copyright owner, the Viacom decision does not simply decline to impose an obligation to seek out the infringers who may lurk within the user base. Rather, the decision arguably rejects neutrality to read into the statute a high degree of solicitude not only for online entrepreneurs whose businesses occasionally may accommodate infringing users, but also for those who effectively solicit infringers. If, by contrast, the neutrality principle does animate the statute, a court could appropriately apply that principle through a duty to take reasonable precautions to avoid apparent and <b>repeat</b> <b>infringements...</b>|$|R

5000|$|For the 2010 ANZAC Test, Thaiday was {{selected}} to play for Australia at second-row forward and was named man of the match in their victory against New Zealand. During his career Sam Thaiday has often seen himself under attack for {{the way in which}} he plays the game, most notably his tendency to enter brawls and scuffles late to [...] "protect" [...] his team-mates. Loved by Brisbane and Queensland fans for his role as an 'enforcer', he's also vilified by opposition fans for what they claim as cheap shots, bullying and his consistency as the [...] "Third man in". In the 2010 State of Origin series Thaiday was much maligned by NSW Blues fans for the way in which he played the game. In Game 2 Luke O'Donnell was a guilty party in a dangerous tackle that sparked an , the likes of which hadn't been seen for several years. Most notable was a moment {{towards the end of the}} melee in which O'Donnell could be seen to headbutt and then uppercut Queensland's Dave Taylor, upon seeing this Sam Thaiday re-entered the fray and punched O'Donnell twice. Speaking on his involvement Thaiday said, [...] "I saw the headbutt and I made a bee-line straight over to it. That's just not football; fair is fair if you want to punch on with a bloke I'm all for that. But headbutting - that's a bit below the belt". But the New South Welshman saw things differently, [...] "I keep getting asked about the headbutt - I don't think there was much in that," [...] O'Donnell said. [...] "I was getting pulled and pushed in every direction, and Taylor kept scruffing me up. I was doing whatever I could to get out of there. Sam Thaiday ran in and started throwing punches. There were a few dog shots coming in. Someone said I should've been sent off. That's a bit rich considering they were coming in and hitting from behind with some cheap shots. I've got a bruised eye from a nice cheapy from someone when I was on the ground. Self-preservation crosses your mind at some stage." [...] Regardless, Thaiday said he felt comfortable with his role in taking on O'Donnell after coming to Taylor's aid. [...] "I look after my mates. I'm a big family man, I look after my family and all these boys are my family," [...] he said. In a 2010 NRL game, between the Brisbane Broncos and the North Queensland Cowboys, Sam again came under criticism, again for entering a fight as the [...] "Third-man-in" [...] (though technically he was fourth).

40|$|Within {{many areas}} of {{medicine}} and science animal experiments are seen as indispensable, however ethically not unproblematic {{by the majority of}} the general public. In Germany these experiments are subject to notification or licensing. In Great Britain regulated procedures must also be licensed. In both countries, the compliance with legal rules and regulations as well as with licensing terms and conditions must be guaranteed through appropriate forms of supervision and control. The present study examines German regulations and their practical implementations in view of a forthcoming amendment of German animal welfare legislation, resulting from changes in the German constitution of 2002. Comparisons with Great Britain might show further potential for improvement for German procedures. To include all relevant aspects, the legal situation of both countries, literature searches, as well as results from a study via questionnaire are being evaluated. Regarding the countries’ legal situation {{it must be noted that}} Germany and Great Britain both share the same legal foundations due to both of them being members of the European Union. However, legal implementation differs between the two countries. In Germany, supervision of animal experiments and of laboratory animals husbandry is being dealt with according to regional law: in four federal states a regional licensing authority and in further twelve states the Veterinäramt (veterinary department) are responsible. In comparison, in Great Britain official supervision is centrally organised and subdivided between two departments within the Home Office: Animal Scientific Procedures Division and Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. Internal control is required explicitly in the German Tierschutzgesetz (Animal Welfare Act). Every establishment carrying out experiments on vertebrates must appoint a Tierschutzbeauftragter (Animal Welfare Officer) who among other duties must take care of the compliance with rules and regulations as well as with terms and conditions in the interest of animal welfare. An obligation for internal control as comprehensive as this does not exist in the British Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. As an element of internal control the local Ethical Review Process of the establishment should, among other things, allow for retrospective project reviews. Furthermore, some of its members like the Named Animal Care & Welfare Officer, the Named Veterinary Surgeon and the project licence holder have additional duties and powers in the interest of internal supervision of regulated procedures. To fulfil their supervision roles there are various possibilities available to the authorities. Visits represent the most important official supervision method and are to be used as often as possible in both Germany and Great Britain. In Germany however, these and other official supervision methods are highly limited by an unsatisfactory staff situation (on average one visit per establishment and year compared with an average of eleven visits per designated establishment and year in Great Britain). In Great Britain a similar number of announced and unannounced visits take place, whereas in Germany unannounced visits are rare. Unannounced visits have the advantage of allowing an insight into everyday routine, but bare the risk that important contact people are unavailable or no experiment currently takes place. Whilst qualification of the supervising staff in Great Britain is no cause for discussion, in Germany it is criticised particularly when delegated to the Veterinärämter. Furthermore, the partly divided responsibility for licensing and supervision or for differing supervision methods and non-uniform nation-wide enforcement in Germany are subject to serious criticism. The necessity for effective supervision is shown clearly by the variety of infringements described. In Germany as in Great Britain, mild consequences such as further instructions or letters of admonition dominate. Although tougher sanctions such as fines or imprisonment are legally possible in both countries, they are rarely imposed. Regarding internal supervision too, on-site controls are viewed as particularly helpful but in Germany as well as in Great Britain are conducted only in a small portion of all animal experiments taking place. Additionally, retrospective project reviews can make a positive contribution to laboratory animal welfare. They are a required method of control in Great Britain and therefore are used regularly, whilst in Germany so far they are applied considerably less often. For the Tierschutzbeauftragter as well as for the Ethical Review Process and its members it is necessary to be supported by the establishment. Although the personnel reviewed in both countries mainly expressed satisfaction with their access to project licence holders, personal licence holders and certificate holders and did not need to reckon with negative consequences for themselves when voicing criticism, German discrimination prohibition for the Tierschutzbeauftragter obviously is not always met and criticism and suggestions in Great Britain are not always taken into account. However, as it has turned out the supervisors’ personal commitment plays an important role, too. Involving the authorities in cases of serious or on-going infringements seems to be seen as a breach of the use of official channels by the Tierschutzbeauftragte reviewed. In comparison, in Great Britain there seem to be no misgivings regarding this. Thus, it can be noted that in Germany internal supervision and control is handled very differently depending on each establishment and its Tierschutzbeauftragter, whereas in Great Britain it is insufficiently regulated and therefore can be regarded as moderately efficient. On the basis of the data, information and findings collected in this study, the nation-wide responsibility of the licensing authorities also for the supervision of projects licensed by them can be recommended for Germany particularly regarding professional competence. Establishments conducting regulated procedures should be visited by the authority considerably more often, at least twice yearly, with as many unannounced as announced visits. For this it is necessary to provide more staff to the authorities responsible. During those visits the authority representatives of both countries should watch the conduction of animal experiments more often to assess the practical abilities of those performing them. In cases of <b>repeated</b> or serious <b>infringements,</b> considerably tougher action with use of those legal instruments available is necessary. To provide effective internal supervision or control by the Tierschutzbeauftragter, his authority to issue directives as legally granted to him, his support by the establishment as well as his personal commitment regarding his regular presence in the laboratories and at experiments taking place must be assured. In Great Britain, however, a comprehensive legal obligation for further control would need to be considered to provide effective internal supervision. Overall it can be noted that regarding supervision and control of regulated procedures there seems to be potential for improvement in both Germany and Great Britain. Germany’s federally structured official supervision seems to be less efficient than the centrally organised supervision by the British Home Office. However, some arguments seem to suggest that compulsory German Tierschutzbeauftragte, despite potential for improvement, can achieve a higher level of efficiency than Great Britain’s Ethical Review Processes...|$|R
