25|$|Several slivers are combined. Each sliver {{will have}} thin and thick spots, and by {{combining}} several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. Since combining several slivers produces a very thick rope of cotton fibres, directly after being combined the slivers are separated into <b>rovings.</b> These <b>rovings</b> (or slubbings) are {{then what are}} used in the spinning process.|$|E
25|$|The {{throstle}} and {{the later}} water frame pulled the <b>rovings</b> through {{a set of}} attenuating rollers. Spinning at differing speeds, these pulled the thread continuously while other parts twisted it as it wound onto the heavy spindles. This produced thread suitable for warp, but the multiple rollers required much more energy input and demanded that the device be driven by a water wheel. The early water frame, however, had only a single spindle. Combining ideas from these two system inspired the spinning mule.|$|E

40|$|Relative to {{integrated}} circuit (IC) systems, on-chip fault detection entails determi- nation {{of whether or}} not a fault exists. The cause of the fault could be some faulty logic resource or some faulty interconnect (wiring) resource, but typically, fault detection only determines if a fault exists, not what exactly is faulty. Beyond pure fault detection some work has been done relative to on-chip fault analysis to fur- ther determine not only if a fault exists, but exactly what is faulty. Even less work has been done to actually tolerate faulty resources once they have been found. For this work, we take advantage of previous work (<b>ROVING</b> STARS) that detects on-chip faults and analyzes those faults to determine exactly what is faulty. We developed, tested and demonstrated an on-chip technique that takes advantage of dynamic partially reconfigurable field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to automatically reconfigure the FPGA for tolerating logic faults...|$|R

Yet inside Afghanistan today, where the Saudi Arabian lives in exile, Osama is a minor character. He is ill and always in hiding - usually [...] "somewhere near Kabul". Once in a while he travels incognito to Peshawar. His organization, the Al Qa'Ida, is split, and in tatters. The Taliban owe him a lot for his past deeds towards the movement and in putting them in power in Afghanistan - contributing with a stack of his own personal fortune of millions of dollars. But no longer an asset, he has become a liability." ...|$|R
25|$|Connection is then {{established}} between the attenuated <b>rovings</b> and the spindles. When {{the latter are}} bare, as in a new mule, the spindle-driving motion is put into gear, and the attendants wind upon each spindle a short length of yarn from a cop held in the hand. The drawing-roller motion is placed in gear, and the rollers soon present lengths of attenuated roving. These {{are attached to the}} threads on the spindles, by simply placing the threads in contact with the un-twisted roving. The different parts of the machine are next simultaneously started, when the whole works in harmony together.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1770s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using flax and wool. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would card the fibre — break up and clean the disorganized fluff into long bundles. The women would then spin these rough <b>rovings</b> into yarn wound on a spindle. The male weaver would use a frame loom to weave this into cloth. This was then tentered in the sun to bleach it. The invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for cotton yarn to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Crompton {{invented the}} {{spinning}} mule in 1779, so called {{because it is}} a hybrid of Arkwright's water frame and James Hargreaves' spinning jenny {{in the same way that}} mule is the product of crossbreeding a female horse with a male donkey (a female donkey is called a jenny). The spinning mule has a fixed frame with a creel of cylindrical bobbins to hold the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage with the spindles. On the outward motion, the <b>rovings</b> are paid out through attenuating rollers and twisted. On the return, the roving is clamped and the spindles reversed to take up the newly spun thread.|$|E

25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} <b>rovings</b> bobbins {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E
25|$|A pair of mules {{would be}} manned {{by a person}} called the minder and two boys called the side piecer and the little piecer. They worked barefoot in humid temperatures, the minder and the little piecer worked the minder half of the mule. The minder would make minor {{adjustments}} to his mules {{to the extent that}} each mule worked differently. They were specialists in spinning, and were only answerable to the gaffer and under-gaffer who were in charge of the floor and with it {{the quantity and quality of}} the yarn that was produced. Bobbins of <b>rovings</b> came from the carder in the blowing room delivered by a bobbin carrier who was part of the carder's staff, and yarn was hoisted down to the warehouse by the warehouseman's staff. Delineation of jobs was rigid and communication would be through the means of coloured slips of paper written on in indelible pencil.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spinning}} jenny {{allowed a}} group of eight spindles to be operated together. It mirrored the simple wheel; the <b>rovings</b> were clamped, and a frame moved forward stretching and thinning the roving. A wheel was rapidly turned as the frame was pushed back, and the spindles rotated, twisting the <b>rovings</b> into yarn and collecting it on the spindles. The spinning jenny was effective and could be operated by hand, but it produced weaker thread {{that could only be}} used for the weft part of cloth. (Because the side-to-side weft {{does not have to be}} stretched on a loom in the way that the warp is, it can generally be less strong.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Alpaca fiber {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to sheep wool fiber. [...] Its softness comes from having a different smoother scale surface than sheep wool. American breeders have enhanced the softness by selecting for finer fiber diameter fiber, similar to merino wool. Fiber diameter is a highly inherited trait in both alpaca and sheep. The difference in the individual fiber scales compared to sheep wool also creates the glossy shine which is prized in alpaca. Alpaca fibers have a higher tensile strength than wool fibers. In processing, slivers lack fiber cohesion and single alpaca <b>rovings</b> lack strength. Blend these together and the durability is increased several times over. More twisting is necessary, especially in Suri, and this can reduce a yarn's softness.|$|E

60|$|These Liverpool days, however, were {{a famous}} thing for me; who, thereby, was enabled after my day's work aboard the Highlander, to ramble about the town for several hours.

60|$|In {{the day she}} was herself; but, {{when the}} night fell, she was restless and uneasy until she heard the call. Then follow it she would, even through storm and darkness.

60|$|Other <b>rovings</b> ensued; {{until at}} last, {{entering}} {{on board a}} Nantucket ship, he hunted the leviathan off the Western Islands and {{on the coast of}} Africa, for sixteen months; returning at length to Nantucket with a brimming hold.

60|$|Since {{the heat}} of this business, which has of late so much and so justly {{concerned}} this kingdom, is at last, in a great measure over, we may venture to abate something of our former zeal and vigour in handling it, and looking upon it as an enemy almost overthrown, consult more our own amusement than its prejudice, in attacking it in light excursory skirmishes. Thus much I thought fit to observe, lest the world should be too apt to make an obvious pun upon me; when beginning to dream upon this occasion, I presented it with the wild nocturnal <b>rovings</b> of an unguided imagination, on a subject of so great importance, as the final welfare or ruin of a whole nation.|$|E
60|$|For {{five days}} he wandered and wandered. Without leaving statelier haunts unvisited, {{he did not}} {{overlook}} those broader areas--hereditary parks and manors of vice and misery. Not by constitution disposed to gloom, there was a mysteriousness in those impulses which led him {{at this time to}} <b>rovings</b> like these. But hereby stoic influences were at work, to fit him at a soon-coming day for enacting a part in the last extremities here seen; when by sickness, destitution, each busy ill of exile, he was destined to experience a fate, uncommon even to luckless humanity--a fate whose crowning qualities were its remoteness from relief and its depth of obscurity--London, adversity, and the sea, three Armageddons, which, at one and the same time, slay and secrete their victims.|$|E
6000|$|The {{lives of}} the voyageurs are passed in wild and {{extensive}} <b>rovings,</b> {{in the service of}} individuals, but more especially of the fur traders. They are generally of French descent, and inherit much of the gayety and lightness of heart of their ancestors, being full of anecdote and song, and ever ready for the dance. They inherit, too, a fund of civility and complaisance; and, instead of that hardness and grossness which men in laborious life are apt to indulge towards each other, they are mutually obliging and accommodating; interchanging kind offices, yielding each other assistance and comfort in every emergency, and using the familiar appellations of [...] "cousin" [...] and [...] "brother" [...] when there is in fact no relationship. Their natural good-will is probably heightened by a community of adventure and hardship in their precarious and wandering life.|$|E
60|$|Nor even at {{the risk}} of meriting the charge of absurdly believing in enchantments, can I {{restrain}} the admission that sometimes, even now, when leaving the crowded city to wander out July and August among the Adirondack Mountains, far from the influences of towns and proportionally nigh to the mysterious ones of nature; when at such times I sit me down in the mossy head of some deep-wooded gorge, surrounded by prostrate trunks of blasted pines and recall, as in a dream, my other and far-distant <b>rovings</b> in the baked heart of the charmed isles; and remember the sudden glimpses of dusky shells, and long languid necks protruded from the leafless thickets; and again have beheld the vitreous inland rocks worn down and grooved into deep ruts by ages and ages of the slow draggings of tortoises in quest of pools of scanty water; I can hardly resist the feeling that in my time I have indeed slept upon evilly enchanted ground.|$|E
6000|$|From these fear-stricken <b>rovings</b> Markheim's eyes {{returned}} {{to the body of}} his victim, where it lay both humped and sprawling, incredibly small and strangely meaner than in life. In these poor, miserly clothes, in that ungainly attitude, the dealer lay like so much sawdust. Markheim had feared to see it, and, lo! it was nothing. And yet, as he gazed, this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood began to find eloquent voices. There it must lie; there was none to work the cunning hinges or direct the miracle of locomotion--there it must lie till it was found. Found! ay, and then? Then would this dead flesh lift up a cry that would ring over England, and fill the world with the echoes of pursuit. Ay, dead or not, this was still the enemy. [...] "Time was that when the brains were out," [...] he thought; and the first word struck into his mind. Time, now that the deed was accomplished--time, which had closed for the victim, had become instant and momentous for the slayer.|$|E
60|$|As Bridge {{moved through}} the quiet road at the {{outskirts}} of the little town he let his mind revert to {{the events of the past}} twenty four hours and as he pondered each happening since he met the youth in the dark of the storm the preceding night he asked himself why he had cast his lot with these strangers. In his years of vagabondage Bridge had never crossed that invisible line which separates honest men from thieves and murderers and which, once crossed, may never be recrossed. Chance and necessity had thrown him often among such men and women; but never had he been of them. The police of more than one city knew Bridge--they knew him, though, as a character and not as a criminal. A dozen times he had been arraigned upon suspicion; but as many times had he been released with a clean bill of morals until of late Bridge had become almost immune from arrest. The police who knew him knew that he was straight and they knew, too, that he would give no information against another man. For this they admired him as did the majority of the criminals with whom he had come in contact during his <b>rovings.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And {{still less}} so, if the {{domiciliary}} laws {{which they are}} sent to execute, playing [...] "God save the Queen," [...] be perchance precisely contrary to that God the Saviour's law; and therefore, such as, in the long run, no quantity either of Queens, or Queen's men, could execute. Which is a question I have for these ten years been endeavouring to get the British public to consider--vainly enough hitherto; and will not at present add to my own many words on the matter. But a book {{has just been published}} by a British officer, who, if he had not been otherwise and more actively employed, could not only have written all my books about landscape and picture, but is very singularly also of one mind with me, (God knows of how few Englishmen I can now say so,) on matters regarding the Queen's safety, and the Nation's honour. Of whose book ("Far out: <b>Rovings</b> retold"), since various passages will be given in my subsequent terminal notes, I will content myself with quoting for the end of my Preface, the memorable words which Colonel Butler himself quotes, as spoken to the British Parliament by its last Conservative leader, a British officer who had also served with honour and success.|$|E
60|$|On {{considering}} political societies, their origin, their constitution, {{and their}} effects, I have sometimes {{been in a}} good deal more than doubt, whether the Creator did ever really intend man for a state of happiness. He has mixed in his cup a number of natural evils, (in spite of the boasts of stoicism they are evils,) and every endeavor which the art and policy of mankind has used {{from the beginning of the}} world to this day, in order to alleviate or cure them, has only served to introduce new mischiefs, or to aggravate and inflame the old. Besides this, the mind of man itself is too active and restless a principle ever to settle on the true point of quiet. It discovers every day some craving want in a body, which really wants but little. It every day invents some new artificial rule to guide that nature which, if left to itself, were the best and surest guide. It finds out imaginary beings prescribing imaginary laws; and then, it raises imaginary terrors to support a belief in the beings, and an obedience to the laws.--Many things have been said, and very well undoubtedly, on the subjection in which we should preserve our bodies to the government of our understanding; but enough has not been said upon the restraint which our bodily necessities ought to lay on the extravagant sublimities and eccentric <b>rovings</b> of our minds. The body, or as some love to call it, our inferior nature, is wiser in its own plain way, and attends its own business more directly than the mind with all its boasted subtlety.|$|E
6000|$|As I have observed, {{it was the}} dreamy {{nature of}} the name that first beguiled me in the holiday <b>rovings</b> of boyhood into this sequestered region. I shunned, however, the populous parts of the Hollow, and sought its retired haunts far in the foldings of the hills, where the Pocantico [...] "winds its wizard stream" [...] {{sometimes}} silently and darkly through solemn woodlands; sometimes sparkling between grassy borders in fresh, green meadows; sometimes stealing along the feet of rugged heights under the balancing sprays of beech and chestnut trees. A thousand crystal springs, with which this neighborhood abounds, sent down from the hill-sides their whimpering rills, as if {{to pay tribute to}} the Pocantico. In this stream I first essayed my unskilful hand at angling. I loved to loiter along it with rod in hand, watching my float as it whirled amid the eddies or drifted into dark holes under twisted roots and sunken logs, where the largest fish are apt to lurk. I delighted to follow it into the brown accesses of the woods; to throw by my fishing-gear and sit upon rocks beneath towering oaks and clambering grape-vines; bathe my feet in the cool current, and listen to the summer breeze playing among the tree-tops. My boyish fancy clothed all nature around me with ideal charms, and peopled it with the fairy beings I had read of in poetry and fable. Here it was I gave full scope to my incipient habit of day dreaming, and to a certain propensity, to weave up and tint sober realities with my own whims and imaginings, which has sometimes made life a little too much like an Arabian tale to me, and this [...] "working-day world" [...] rather like a region of romance.|$|E
6000|$|We find it {{very natural}} {{accordingly}} {{to speak of the}} breadth of humor, while wit is, by the necessity of its being, as narrow as a flash of lightning, and as sudden. Humor may pervade a whole page without our being able to put our finger on any passage, and say, [...] "It is here." [...] Wit must sparkle and snap in every line, or it is nothing. When the wise deacon shook his head, and said that [...] "there was a good deal of human natur' in man," [...] he might have added that there was a good deal more in some men than in others. Those who have the largest share of it may be humorists, but wit demands only a clear and nimble intellect, presence of mind, and a happy faculty of expression. This perfection of phrase, this neatness, is an essential of wit, because its effect must be instantaneous; whereas humor is often diffuse and roundabout, and its impression cumulative, like the poison of arsenic. As Galiani said of Nature that her dice were always loaded, so the wit must throw sixes every time. And what the same Galiani gave as a definition of sublime oratory may be applied to its dexterity of phrase: [...] "It is the art of saying everything without being clapt in the Bastile, in a country where it is forbidden to say anything." [...] Wit must also have the quality of unexpectedness. [...] "Sometimes," [...] says Barrow, [...] "an affected simplicity, sometimes a presumptuous bluntness, gives it being. Sometimes it rises only from a lucky hitting upon what is strange, sometimes from a crafty wresting of obvious matter to the purpose. Often it consisteth in one knows not what, and springeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the numberless <b>rovings</b> of fancy and windings of language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Camel-like, {{laden with}} woe,' said Ozonna, 'after many wild <b>rovings</b> in quest of a maiden long lost--beautiful Ady! and after being {{repelled}} in Maramma; and in vain hailed {{to land at}} Serenia, represented as naught but another Maramma;--with vague promises of discovering Ady, three sirens, who long had pursued, at last inveigled me to Flozella; where Hautia made me her thrall. But ere long, in Rea, one of her maidens, I thought I discovered my Ady transformed. My arms opened wide to embrace; but the damsel knew not Ozonna. And even, when after hard wooing, I won her again, she seemed not lost Ady, but Rea. Yet all the while, from deep in her strange, black orbs, Ady's blue eyes seemed pensively looking:--blue eye within black: sad, silent soul within merry. Long I strove, by fixed ardent gazing, to break the spell, and restore in Rea my lost one's Past. But in vain. It was only Rea, not Ady, who at stolen intervals looked on me now. One morning Hautia started as she greeted me; her quick eye rested on my bosom; and glancing there, affrighted, I beheld a distinct, fresh mark, the impress of Rea's necklace drop. Fleeing, I revealed what had passed to the maiden, who broke from my side; as I, from Hautia's. The queen summoned her damsels, but for many hours the call was unheeded; and when at last they came, upon each bosom lay a necklace-drop like Rea's. On the morrow, lo! my arbor was strown over with bruised Linden-leaves, exuding a vernal juice. Full of forbodings, again I sought Rea: who, casting down her eyes, beheld her feet stained green. Again she fled; and again Hautia summoned her damsels: malicious triumph in her eye; but dismay succeeded: each maid had spotted feet. That night Rea was torn from my side by three masks; who, stifling her cries, rapidly bore her away; and as I pursued, disappeared in a cave. Next morning, Hautia was surrounded by her nymphs, but Rea was absent. Then, gliding near, she snatched from my hair, a jet-black tress, loose-hanging. 'Ozonna is the murderer! See! Rea's torn hair entangled with his!' Aghast, I swore that I knew not her fate. 'Then let the witch Larfee be called!' The maidens darted from the bower; and soon after, there rolled into it a green cocoa-nut, followed by the witch, and all the damsels, flinging anemones upon it. Bowling this way and that, the nut at last rolled to my feet.--'It is he!' cried all.--Then they bound me with osiers; and at midnight, unseen and irresistible hands placed me in a shallop; which sped far out into the lagoon, where they tossed me to the waves; but so violent the shock, the osiers burst; and as the shallop fled one way, swimming another, ere long I gained land.|$|E
