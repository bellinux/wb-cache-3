40|$|This paper explores how {{trade and}} foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) condition the effect of foreign aid on environmental protection in aid-recipient countries. We suggest that (1) environmental protection {{should be viewed as}} a public good and (2) all else equal, resource flows from abroad (via aid, trade, and FDI) influence governments’ incentives to provide public goods. (3) Because these resources shape governments’ incentives differently, their interactive effects should be examined. We begin with the assumption that developing country governments seek some optimal level of environmental protection, a level conditioned by their factor-intensive growth phase. We hypothesize that at low levels <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>receipts</b> or FDI inflows from the developed world, foreign aid is associated with superior environmental protection. This is because foreign aid, as an environmentally neutral addition to revenue, allows recipient governments to partially relax the trade-off between economic growth and environmental protection. As levels <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>receipts</b> or FDI inflows from the developed world increase, however, the salutary effect of foreign aid will diminish and eventually be reversed. This is because foreign aid mitigates the recipient government’s dependence on traders and investors in the developed world, and concomitantly reduces their pro-environmental policy leverage. Our analysis of 88 aid recipients, for the period 1980 – 2005, lends support to our argument...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, an {{integral}} part of some Pacific island countries (PICs’) economic policy rhetoric has been export-led growth. However, despite the policy and technical support provided by many international organizations and bilateral donors, and an abundance of natural resources, their export sectors remain narrow and, with few exceptions, export industries have experienced little growth. Therefore, if these countries are to do better, it is critical to understand the supply- side constraints to export-led growth. Hence, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify and subsequently analyse the impact of supply-side constraints on <b>export</b> <b>receipts</b> for selected PICs, using Linear Programming (LP) models <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>receipts.</b> The study also provides estimates of the magnitude of the increase in <b>export</b> <b>receipts</b> that may be achieved if some of these constraints are removed. The results show the maximum <b>export</b> <b>receipts</b> that these PICs can achieve, given the supply-side constraints that they face. It is also seen that if some of the supply-side constraints are removed, the increase in <b>exports</b> <b>receipts</b> would be very promising. Finally, the paper provides some policy recommendations for the removal of some of the supply-side constraints. export-led growth, suppy-side constraints...|$|R
