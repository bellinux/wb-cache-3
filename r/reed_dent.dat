40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop fundamentally new approaches for processing fibers into textile structures using MEMS technology. The specific objectives of our research are to: 1. Explore combining MEMS and small-scale robotic devices to automate the process of repairing broken warp yarns. 2. Identify new applications for MEMS in textiles. 3. Improve traditional textile manufacturing. Micro electro-mechanical systems or MEMS technology has gone from an interesting academic exercise to an integral part of many common products in several industries such as medical, automotive and ink jet industries. However, as with the most new technologies, the practical implementation of MEMS technology has taken a while to happen. We elected to demonstrate the capability of combining MEMS with small-scale robotic devices to automate one of the few tasks that still need the weaving machine operator intervention; repair of broken warp yarns. To achieve our goal, a knowledge regarding warp break distribution is needed since the location of warp break along and across the weaving machine dictates the design of devices and the steps needed to automate the repair of the broken ends. Additionally, two devices (modules) have been designed and are being built. These are termed as broken warp ends finder and <b>reed</b> <b>dent</b> finder modules...|$|E

50|$|One thread per dent is {{most common}} for coarse work, for finer work (20 or more ends per inch) {{two or more}} threads are put through each dent. Threads can be doubled in every other space, so that a <b>reed</b> with 10 <b>dents</b> per inch could give 15 ends per inch, or 20 if the threads were simply doubled. Also, threads can be put in every other dent {{so as to make}} a cloth with 6 ends per inch from a <b>reed</b> with 12 <b>dents</b> per inch. Putting more than one thread through each dent reduces {{friction}} and the number of reeds that one weaver needs, and is used in weaving mills. If too many threads are put through one dent there may be reed marks left in the fabric, especially in linen and cotton.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} weave many {{different}} {{patterns on the}} same loom different reeds are useful. Modern floor looms and several other types of loom use interchangeable reeds, with a different number of dents per inch. The most common sizes available for the hand-weaver are 6, 8, 10, 12, or 15, though more are made, and sizes between 5 and 24 are not uncommon. The finer the <b>reed,</b> the more <b>dents</b> per inch, and, in general, the more ends per inch in the final woven fabric. This is because by beating the weft into place the reed determines the distance between threads, or groups of threads. Having interchangeable reeds allows a weaver to do {{many different types of}} weaving on the same loom. By changing the reed the weaver can move from weaving fine fabric to coarse fabric without needing a different loom.|$|R
50|$|The two enter a restaurant, {{where they}} meet {{a married couple}} who takes them to a {{homeless}} shelter in Hammond, Indiana, for the night. At the shelter, Doyle grows fond {{of a young girl}} and her family. While getting to know them, he finally realizes that he has been neglecting his mother and indeed wants to be with her for the holidays. The next day, the family drives Dutch and Doyle to Natalie's home, where Reed is waiting. Doyle shares an emotional embrace with his mother and reveals to Reed that he knows the truth about his trip to London. Doyle decides to stay with his mother instead of going with Reed for Thanksgiving. An angry Reed evicts Natalie from the house, which he owns. Dutch follows Reed outside as he departs and <b>dents</b> <b>Reed's</b> forehead with his pinky ring. He then demands that Reed show more respect to Natalie and become a better father to Doyle, to which a dazed Reed agrees.|$|R
