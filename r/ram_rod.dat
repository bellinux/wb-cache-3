Contenders receive 3 points for each Gladiator they pass with the contender with the quickest time through scoring a bonus point. There {{was no time}} limit on this event, effectively meaning contenders automatically received 9 points for taking apart.

5000|$|One of the {{problems}} miners faced when introducing gunpowder into their operations {{was that it was}} relative easy to ignite when exposed to sparks, intense heat, or flames. The method used by miners to blast away rock involved drilling several holes across a rock face which would be filled with charges of gunpowder. In order to confine the gases produced on ignition, the gunpowder was confined within each shot hole by inserting a pointed rod known as a [...] "needle" [...] in the gunpowder-charged hole and then packing in soft clay and tamping it down to form a plug. The [...] "needle" [...] was then removed and replaced by a fuse. To prevent sparking, a copper needle and a non-metallic <b>ramming</b> <b>rod,</b> typically made from hickory, were used.|$|R

50|$|In New Zealand {{during the}} period 1818 to 1842, native Maori bought {{increasingly}} large numbers of Trade Muskets which were regularly used in intertribal warfare. The Maori developed a number of special techniques to overcome their lack of professional training. The first was to enlarge the priming hole to ensure combustion with the coarse grain trade black powder that was available to them. The second was {{to do away with}} the <b>ram</b> <b>rod</b> altogether. The balls were inserted in the muzzle and then the butt thumped hard on the ground to settle the ball. In battle the barrel was never cleaned, so progressively smaller balls were used to load the musket to compensate for lead and ash fouling. The balls were held between the fingers of the right hand.|$|E
5000|$|According to reports, {{at least}} one {{contestant}} has had {{to withdraw from the}} opening episode, while one of the Gladiators slipped on a bridge and had to leave the set. Another Gladiator had a stomach bug and Enigma suffered from an injured ankle. In addition, Enigma was involved in an incident on Gauntlet where a contender kicked a <b>ram</b> <b>rod</b> into her face, resulting in a confrontation and the contender being disqualified. Contestants also suffered injuries including a broken toe, a damaged knee, a neck injury, as well as one contestant suffering a broken arm in the quarter finals. One finalist was so badly injured that he refused to start after his whistle and the other contender won the show by default. In the second episode of [...] "Gladiators: The Legends Strike Back" [...] female legend Scorpio suffered an ankle fracture while participating in The Wall.|$|E

In the case of ammunition for the D-30, the standard 122 mm howitzer shell weight of 21.8 kg was retained, with a metal cartridge case holding variable propelling charges. Cartridge and shell are loaded separately; {{this means that the}} shells have to be hand-rammed by a man {{to the right of the}} breech with a <b>ramming</b> <b>rod.</b> The D-30 could fire the older M-30 ammunition; however, new shells were also introduced, eventually including a rocket assisted projectile with a range of 21.9 km. The M-30’s range of propelling charges, comprising base and eight increments, was replaced by a new set comprising base and four increments; single base propellant was retained. A more effective High Explosive (HE) shell was developed, as well as smoke, illumination and chemical filled projectiles.|$|R

Mandy made it across in 26.6 seconds scoring herself five points while Sonia made it across in 27.7 seconds scoring herself five points. The mens gauntlet {{was made up}} of Warrior, Hunter, Cobra, Wolf and Raider. Mark, who had a stare up with Warrior who walked up to him before the start, made it across in 10.7 seconds scoring himself ten points while Lawrence who went out of the gauntlet in seven seconds and {{had to go back to}} the start eventually made it across in 20.7 seconds scoring himself five points. But after that, Raider swung his <b>ram</b> <b>rod</b> at Lawrence when he was getting up, squared up to him and pushed him which Lawrence reacted angrily by taking his helmet off and slamming it to the floor. Referee John Anderson showed Raider a red card for his actions which meant he would miss the next program and get fined.|$|E

5000|$|However, the Rams' defense put {{an abrupt}} end to the Cowboys' dreams of {{engineering}} another miraculous last minute comeback victory after <b>Rams</b> DB <b>Rod</b> Perry intercepted a pass by Cowboys QB Roger Staubach and returned it for a 43-yard TD to seal the Rams' 27-14 victory. In response to the game winning interception return by Perry, over 65,000 fans that filled the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that day simultaneously erupted into a bedlam of deafening cheers. Then, what started off as a very loud overly exuberant celebration over the game clinching interception return, eventually, developed into openly taunting the Cowboys over the loss {{during the last few}} minutes of the game, by both the fans {{and a few of the}} Rams players. Which provoked a very rare display of anger and frustration by Roger Staubach, who was seen pointing his finger at the celebrating Rams players on the sideline, and telling them that the Cowboys [...] "will get them" [...] the next time they meet each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded <b>ram</b> shafts (piston <b>rods)</b> {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|R
40|$|This year a trend {{which has}} been gaining {{momentum}} is the rise of environmentalism. With increasing global environmental awareness has come increased consumer expectations for environmental quality in production processes. At the same time, {{there has been a}} proliferation of domestic policies in New Zealand's agricultural markets targeting the protection of the environment, and these will impinge in various ways on our trade. Within New Zealand, there has been increasing pressure for our own agricultural sector to address issues relating to the environmental effects of production systems. In a paper given at this Conference two years ago, Stuart Morris identified these three trends. I would like to make reference to some of the points he made at that time. The growth of green consumers has led to a growth in demand for green products, with consumers being prepared to pay a premium for products produced in an environmentally friendly way. This raises the question {{of the degree to which}} the green market can be managed to provide the necessary incentives for producers to change to more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Associated with this is the issue of quality assurance. Overseas consumers are becoming skeptical about unsubstantiated environmental claims, and quality systems are required which provide consumers and trading partners with the assurance they demand about the environmental quality of agricultural products from New Zealand. The trade effects of overseas domestic environmental policies are also of concern In Europe, the instruments of support for farmers are shifting from product price support to direct and indirect income support. Indirect support can be in the form of payments for environmentally acceptable or sustainable farming. Such agro-environment polices have implications for exporting nations such as New Zealand. They are exempt from the support reduction commitments of the GATT Agreement and pose a potential trade threat. Within New Zealand, pressure from environmental interests led to the Resource Management Act of 1991. The aim of this Act was to promote the sustainable management of natural and physical resources. Its operation and impact has since become a source of great debate. At a more general level, various measures and economic instruments can be used to achieve sustainable agricultural systems. These can include knowledge generation, improved information flows, rural adjustment assistance, institutional change, pricing mechanisms, transferable property rights, pollution charges, subsidies, income tax measures and direct regulation. There has been, and will continue to be, much debate on which of these approaches are appropriate for the New Zealand situation.

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bolt actions {{which contain}} {{the firing pin}} centered in the bolt, the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the bolt in place via a short stubby handle. The hammer of the weapon (located {{on the right side}} of the receiver like all other percussion fired rifles of the time period) holds the firing pin at the tip. A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single shot action, the cartridges were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, <b>ram</b> <b>rod</b> and percussion cap which consumed time during loading procedures. The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the breach of the gun in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled.|$|E
