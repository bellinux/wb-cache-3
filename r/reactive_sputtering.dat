Eliminating or decreasing the hysteresis would significantly simplify the use of <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> processes. In this work, we present <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> deposition modeling of vanadium oxide with a revolutionary substrate, aiming to study the influence of it on hysteresis effect.

40|$|Reactive {{magnetron}} sputtering {{is widely used}} for synthesis of various compound thin films. The technique is very versatile and scalable. Especially in industry, high productivity is essential {{and there is a}} need for processes with high deposition rates. Achieving high deposition rate and true compound stoichiometry of the deposited film is, however, challenging in <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering.</b> As a consequence of complex interaction between the reactive gas and the sputtered metal, the relation between deposition rate or composition of the coating and flow of reactive gas is very non-linear and usually exhibits hysteresis behaviour. This contribution deals with modelling based development of <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> processes. First, the basic model of <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> is briefly reviewed. A steady state model is derived, discussing the most important assumptions and illustrating the physical processes taking place in <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering.</b> The model is then used to discuss some strategies for high deposition rate processes, such as using high pumping speed or substoichiometric targets. Another strategy for increased deposition rate employs sputtering yield amplification. Here, the sputtering target is doped by a heavy element in order to reduce the depth of collision cascades thus increasing the sputtering yield of target. This technique is suitable for <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> of oxides as demonstrated for reactive deposition of Al 2 O 3 with W doping. In this case, the deposition rate may be increased by about 100 % as confirmed experimentally. Although <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> is well understood, recent research on reactive High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) brought some intriguing experimental results. In order to develop a comprehensive model applicable to reactive HiPIMS, more accurate description of the individual effects taking place in sputtering is essential.

It is shown that in HiPIMS, the discharge behaviour is strongly influenced by ionized particles sputtered from the target...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for high precision coatings on large areas via in-line <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering,</b> which requires advanced process control techniques. Thus, an improved theoretical understanding of the <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> process kinetics is mandatory for further technical improvement. We present a detailed Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) gas flow model of an in-line sputtering coater for large area architectural glazing. With this model, the pressure fluctuations caused by a moving substrate are calculated {{in comparison with the}} experiment. The model reveals a significant phase shift in the pressure fluctuations between the areas above the center and the edges of the substrate. This is a geometric effect and is e. g. independent of the substrate travelling direction. Consequently, a long sputtering source will observe pressure fluctuations at its center and edges, which are out of phase. For a heuristic model of the <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> process, we show that in certain cases a two-dimensional model treatment is sufficient for predicting the film thickness distribution on the moving substrate. In other cases, a strong phase shift between averaged pressure fluctuations and <b>reactive</b> <b>sputtering</b> process response is observed indicating that a three-dimensional model treatment is required for a realistic simulation of the in-line deposition process...|$|E
