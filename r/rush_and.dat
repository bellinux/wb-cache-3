50|$|Statistically Ohio State {{racked up}} 400 yards of {{balanced}} offense with 214 yards <b>rushing</b> <b>and</b> 186 passing, but had an impressive 2—1 ratio of run-to-pass, with 50 <b>rushes</b> <b>and</b> 25 passes. The defense held Iowa to 87 yards <b>rushing</b> <b>and</b> limited Tate to 249 passing (Tate completed 19 of 41 attempts), but did yield its first rushing touchdown on the 2006 season.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{commonly}} called [...] "grasses", seagrasses, <b>rushes,</b> <b>and</b> sedges fall outside this family. The <b>rushes</b> <b>and</b> sedges {{are related to}} the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales, but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales.|$|R
5|$|Both teams' {{responses}} to Liverpool's third goal {{were to make}} substitutions in the final quarter of the game. Liverpool defender Rob Jones was swapped for striker Ian <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> Newcastle's Darren Peacock was changed for Steve Howey in order to tighten up the Newcastle defence. As the match looked likely to end in a draw, in stoppage time <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> John Barnes began to play a series of one-twos towards the Newcastle end. Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop. In contrast, Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings in distress.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Rush won {{the title}} of Champion of the Clarence from Prospero Coulon. The two men then joined forces as a rowing team and competed at the Anniversary Day Regatta of 26 January 1870 held at Port Jackson. <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> Coulon contested several events, notably winning the single-scull and pair-oar races, and while the prize money they {{received}} was modest, their performances were noted by Sydney rowers who quickly challenged them to private matches for large stakes. <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> Coulon remained in Sydney for some months after the January regatta, and continued to win as a team.|$|E
5|$|Smooth Meadow-grass and Broad-leaved Meadow-grass are {{widespread}} in damp lowland conditions, Wood Sedge (Carex sylvatica) in woodlands, and Oval Sedge and Early Hair-grass on upland moors. In damp conditions Phragmites reeds and {{several species of}} Juncus are found abundantly including Jointed Rush, Soft <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> Toad <b>Rush,</b> <b>and</b> less commonly the introduced species Slender Rush. Common Cottongrass is a familiar site on marshy land, but Saltmarsh Sedge (Carex salina) was only discovered {{for the first time}} in 2004 at the head of Loch Duich.|$|E
25|$|During the game, Oklahoma {{recorded}} 195 <b>rushing</b> <b>and</b> 74 passing yards, while NC State compiled 136 <b>rushing</b> <b>and</b> 103 passing yards. Sooners' halfback Joe Golding {{rushed for}} 91 yards on 12 attempts {{and was named}} the most valuable player.|$|R

5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Ford {{represented}} Wales on 38 {{occasions and}} became his country's all-time record top goalscorer with 23 goals which stood {{until it was}} equaled by Ivor Allchurch and later surpassed by Ian <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> Gareth Bale. Due to his suspension from the game at the time, Ford was overlooked for selection for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. John Charles described Ford as his idol.|$|E
5|$|Elias C. Laycock was his 'chief rival'. Just a year {{younger than}} <b>Rush,</b> <b>and</b> like him, a large and {{powerful}} man, Laycock came {{to live on the}} Lower Clarence River around 1874. The two scullers met first at the Queen's Birthday regatta in Grafton in May 1874. Laycock, untried at boat racing, was beaten, though undeterred. During the following years, Laycock challenged <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> others to sculling matches, until in April 1879, he beat World Champion Trickett at a State regatta. A series of matches followed to determine the current Australian sculling Champion, who would defend the World Title. Laycock beat Rush again and again, but Trickett eventually beat Laycock. Trickett once more went to the Thames to row against Ned Hanlan, but these preliminary contests in Sydney marked the end of Rush's World Championship ambitions.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada or the United States. Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E
5|$|Machine Head's sixth studio album, titled The Blackening, was {{released}} in North America on March 27, 2007. It entered the Billboard 200 at number 53, the highest charting position for the band at that time, with first-week sales of 15,000. It also made the top 20 in several European countries. Robb Flynn stated during an interview that the band are fans of <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> received {{a great deal of}} influence from their album A Farewell to Kings while creating The Blackening.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, <b>Rush,</b> <b>and</b> Jacobi {{began at}} Ely Cathedral, the {{location}} used for Westminster Abbey. The production {{had asked for}} permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due {{to the demands of}} tourism. Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{employment}} and better opportunities than their native land offered, <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> his brother John emigrated in 1860, arriving in Sydney in February 1861 per Hotspur, as assisted immigrants.

5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the California gold <b>rush,</b> <b>and</b> in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E

Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man's canine sidekick <b>Rush</b> <b>and</b> the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.|$|E
