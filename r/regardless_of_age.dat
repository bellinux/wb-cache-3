Men suffer {{twice as many}} TBIs as women do and have a {{fourfold}} risk of fatal head injury, and males account for two thirds of childhood and adolescent head trauma.

5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Impact {{properties}} of solder ball joints with Sn- 9 mass%Zn and Sn- 3 mass%Ag- 0. 5 mass%Cu lead-free solders were investigated under aging at 423 K. In {{the case of}} the joints with Cu electrodes, both Sn- 9 Zn and Sn- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu joints have similar impact forces before aging. For the Sn- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu joint, fracture occurred in an intermetallic compound (IMC) layer formed in a joint interface <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>aging,</b> and thus the impact force was stable upon aging at 423 K for 500 h. For the Sn- 9 Zn joint, fracture mode changed from solder fracture to other fracture upon aging and thus this change led a decrease in the impact force. In the Sn- 9 Zn joint with an electroless Ni/Au plated electrode, fracture occurred in the solder <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>aging,</b> and thus impact properties improved compared with the joint using the Cu electrode. The impact properties are superior to those of the Sn- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu joints with the Cu and the electroless Ni/Au electrodes...|$|R

For early learners, similar parts of Broca's area are activated for both language—whereas late learners have shown to use different parts of Broca's area. In contrast, there is overlap in active regions of L1 and L2 within Wernicke's area, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> of L2 acquisition.|$|E
