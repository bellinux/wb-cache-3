Reciprocation produces a sense of obligation, {{which can be a}} powerful tool in persuasion. The <b>reciprocity</b> <b>rule</b> is effective because it can be overpowering and instill in us a sense of obligation. Generally, we have a dislike for individuals who neglect to return a favor or provide payment when offered a free service or gift. As a result, reciprocation is a widely held principle.

We extend the analysis to continuous strategies and then further extend the basic model of reciprocity to (a) asymmetric players and (b) nonlinear payoff functions. Then we examine the welfare properties of the reciprocity-induced equilibrium. In many game-theoretic situations, reciprocity constraints facilitate the achievement of cooperative outcomes.

50|$|There {{are more}} subtle ways of {{initiating}} the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>rule</b> than merely doing something nice for someone {{so you may}} expect something in return. One form of this more subtle form of reciprocity {{is the idea of}} reciprocal concessions in which the requester lowers his/her initial request, making the respondent more likely to agree to a second request. Under the rule of reciprocity, we are obligated to concede to someone who has made a concession to us. That is, if an individual starts off by requesting something large and you refuse, you feel obligated to consent to their smaller request even though you might not be interested in either of the things they are offering. Robert Cialdini illustrates an example of this phenomenon by telling a story of a boy who asks him to buy five-dollar circus tickets and, when Cialdini refuses, asks him to buy some one dollar chocolate bars. Cialdini feels obligated to return the favor and consents to buying some of the chocolate bars.|$|E

The rule predicts that the gravitropic response should be proportional to the product of the applied acceleration and the stimulation time. Seedlings were cultivated on 1 g centrifuges and transferred to test centrifuges to apply a transverse g-stimulation. Since responses occurred in microgravity, the uncertainties about the validity of clinostat simulation of weightlessness was avoided. Plants at two stages of coleoptile development were tested. Plant responses were obtained using time-lapse video recordings that were analyzed after the flight. Stimulus intensities and durations were varied and ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 0 g and from 2 to 130 min, respectively. For threshold g-doses the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>rule</b> was obeyed. The threshold dose was of the order of 55 g s and 120 g s, respectively, for two groups of plants investigated. Reciprocity was studied also at bending responses which are from just above the detectable level to about 10 degrees. The validity of the rule could not be confirmed for higher g-doses, chiefly because the data were more variable. It was investigated whether the uniformity of the overall response data increased when the gravitropic dose was defined as (gm x t) with m-values different from unity. This was not the case and the reciprocity concept is, therefore, valid also in the hypogravity region. The concept of gravitropic dose, the product of the transverse acceleration and the stimulation time, is also well-defined in the acceleration region studied.

40|$|Complex social {{behaviors}} {{are at the}} heart of primate societies. Abiding by social rules that govern these behaviors is a critical part of the life of a social primate. In communication, social rules exist to regulate if, when, and what an individual vocalizes, as well as how a receiver responds. These rules are crucial to the efficacy of social communication systems. But what happens when individuals stop following these rules? Here, I investigated the consequences of rule-breaking during communication in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). I utilized one of their natural rule-governed behaviors known as antiphonal calling, which involves a back and forth exchange of calls between conspecifics. Rules guiding this vocal behavior include a high level of reciprocity, short response latencies, and turn-taking with minimal interrupting. This dissertation examines how captive marmosets respond to individuals breaking vs. following these rules. I created a novel interactive playback environment where subjects communicated with two marmosets called Virtual Monkeys (VMs). Each VM was a speaker that represented an individual by broadcasting prerecorded calls from a single marmoset. In Chapter 1, I manipulated timing and <b>reciprocity</b> <b>rules</b> by varying how quickly and how likely each VM was to respond when subjects vocalized. I found that subjects were biased against communicating with rule-breakers (i. e., one that responds slowly and infrequently) when a rule-follower (i. e., one that responds quickly and often) was also present. In Chapter 2, I manipulated turn-taking rules by having one VM occasionally interrupt subjects (a rule-breaker) and the second VM behave normally (a rule-follower). I found that subjects were less likely to respond to interruptions, though there was no lasting bias in communication preferences to either VM. In Chapter 3, I sought to establish a foundation for investigating auditory processes in the awake marmoset brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using a battery of auditory stimuli, I found representative properties of the auditory system, including strong activation of auditory cortices, a tonotopic auditory core, and secondary regions driven by complex stimuli. This preparation can one day be used to investigate brain areas involved in processing rule violations during antiphonal calling. Taken together, this dissertation demonstrates that marmosets use flexible strategies during communication and adapt their behavior to different contexts. This likely reflects a broader social cognitive strategy for successfully navigating primate societies and the close relationship between communication and cognition in our Order...|$|R

But, as the quality of obtained benefits has not been varied, it is yet unclear whether rats use the value of received help as decision criterion to pay help back.

40|$|This chapter reports {{data from}} a {{longitudinal}} exploratory case study of two strategic alliances {{with the aim of}} achieving a better understanding of interpartner dynamics. Combining insights from the response strategy perspective and interpersonal theory, we propose that response strategies are organized along the circumference of a circle in a two-dimensional space. In such a circumplex structure, the complementarity principle, explaining how partners respond to each other, is composed of two rules: the <b>rule</b> of <b>reciprocity</b> and the <b>rule</b> of correspondence. The objective of this chapter is to explain when and why alliance partners follow or deviate from these rules. Evidence from the two strategic alliances indicates that the response behaviors derived from interpersonal theory can be identified at the interorganizational level in a strategic alliance. Moreover, partners often use a complementary behavior. The findings, however, also provide insights into three mechanisms that trigger partners to use noncomplementary behavior.
