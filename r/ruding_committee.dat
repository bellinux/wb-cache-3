40|$|In 1992, the <b>Ruding</b> <b>Committee,</b> {{appointed}} by the European Commission to examine the need for company tax (CT) harmonisation in the European Union (EU), presented its findings and recommendations. 2 Although the Committee concluded that differences in CTs distort {{the workings of the}} internal market — differences which most likely would not be eliminated by market forces or tax competition — it none the less proposed to leave the CTs in the EU essentially the same as it had found them, replete with their widely diverging domestic and cross-border treatment of different kinds of returns and different kinds of recipients of the various returns. As argued below, however, differential treatment will perpetuate the distortions inherent to the current CTs and erode the taxing authority of source states. A minimum statutory CT rate of 30 per cent, proposed by the <b>Ruding</b> <b>Committee,</b> and the adoption of the (draft) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Ruding</b> <b>Committee</b> {{began work}} in January 1991 on three {{questions}} posed by the European Commission: (1) Do differences in business taxation among Member States cause major distortions in {{the functioning of the}} internal market, particularly with respect to investment decisions and competition? (2) In so far as such distortions do arise, are they likely to be alleviated or eliminated simply through the interplay of market forces and competition between national tax regimes, or is action at the Community level required? (3) What specific measures are required at the Comminity level to remove or mitigate these distortions...|$|E
40|$|Statutory {{rates of}} {{corporation}} tax {{in developed countries}} have fallen substantially {{over the last two}} decades. The average rate amongst OECD countries in the early 1980 s was nearly 50 %; by 2001 this had fallen to under 35 %. In 1992, the European Union's <b>Ruding</b> <b>Committee</b> recommended a minimum rate of 30 %- then lower than any rate in Europe (with the exception of a special rate for manufacturing in Ireland). Ten years later, already one third {{of the members of the}} European Union have a rate at or below this level. One possible reason for these declining rates is a process of tax competition: countries compete with each other to attract inward flows of capital by reducing their tax rates on corporate profit. This has led to a number of attempts at international coordination in order to maintain revenue from corporation taxes. Both the European Union and the OECD introduced initiatives in the late 1990 s designed to combat what they see a...|$|E
40|$|There is {{controversy}} over awarding punitive damages by arbitration in securities disputes. Securities disputes are unique because {{the vast majority}} of such disputes are filed at Self Regulatory Organizations (“SROs”) which are subject to SEC oversight. However, other securities disputes are filed at the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which is not subject to SEC oversight. As a result differing rules evolved for SRO arbitrations than those applicable at the AAA. No SRO rule directly authorized punitive damages but section 31 (d) of the Uniform Code of Arbitration prohibits limiting the ability of arbitrators to make any award. Whereas a AAA rule specifically provided that arbitrators may award any remedy or relief which the arbitrators deem just and equitable. Predictably, the turmoil over punitive damages continued in the courts. The <b>Ruder</b> <b>Committee</b> Report proposed the imposition of a cap on punitive damages of $ 750, 000. Even if the SEC approved the rigid cap rule in a filing by the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”), the question arises where is the legislative authorization to deprive an investor of relief otherwise available in court? The Supreme Court through McMahon gave an investor the ability to obtain in arbitration whatever relief was available in court, which the Ruder Report’s cap rule clearly violates. The rigid cap rule must be rejected {{in view of the fact}} that it bears no reasonable relationship to compensatory damages, its unilateral imposition by an SRO subjects it to questionable validity, it is strongly opposed by the public, it is not imposed at the AAA or at the other SRO arbitration forums, it violates Section 31 of the Uniform Code of Arbitration, it buttresses the argument that the pre-dispute arbitration agreement has become an unenforceable contract of adhesion, it rekindles public distrust of the SRO arbitration process, it violates the spirit under which McMahon was decided, and there are less objectionable ways to solve the securities industry’s fears of a runaway punitive award...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} efforts of the Public Private Comparator (PPC) at the decentralized level in the Netherlands. The PPC is a financial-economic assessment tool that can be used before a tender to determine whether there is a surplus value for a specific project (real estate or infrastructure) {{in the form of a}} Public Private Partnership based on a DBFM(O) -contract compared to a traditional form of contract. At state level, this assessment tool has been successfully implemented for a few years now whereas at the decentralized level there is still little experience with this tool and there are mainly pitfalls. Recently the Ministry of Finance launched a pilot for local authorities to examine the need for knowledge and experience regarding DBFM(O) -contracts, after an advice of the Commission on Private Financing of Infrastructure, also known as the <b>Ruding</b> <b>Committee.</b> The main question that will be answered by means of this research is: Under which conditions, with regard to content and process, is it possible to use the PPC within the municipality? This study shows which conditions are needed at State level and how these can be translated to a municipal situation and organization. The result of these findings is converted in a report and a step-by-step plan with regard to content and process for the implementation of the PPC at municipal level. This research has been conducted within, and focuses specifically on the municipality of Rotterdam. Particularly for the theoretical part, the practical part (case studies) and most of the conclusions it is possible to see the results in a broader context, so that this research also applies to local authorities more generally.
