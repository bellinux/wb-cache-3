40|$|We {{propose the}} {{implementation}} of a Josephson <b>Radiation</b> Comb <b>Generator</b> (JRCG) based on a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) driven by an external magnetic field. When the magnetic flux crosses a diffraction node of the critical current interference pattern, the superconducting phase undergoes a jump of π and a voltage pulse is generated at the extremes of the SQUID. Under periodic drive this allows one to generate a sequence of sharp, evenly spaced voltage pulses. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to a comb-like structure similar to the one exploited in optics and metrology. With this device it is possible to generate up to several hundreds of harmonics of the driving frequency. For example, a chain of 50 identical high-critical-temperature SQUIDs driven at 1 GHz can deliver up to a 0. 5 nW at 200 GHz.

The article discusses the possibility of creating a spin LED emitting circularly polarised light. Methods. In a spin LED, spin-polarised carriers are injected from a ferromagnetic contact combined with a quantum well. Results. Quantum selection rules for describing recombination establish {{a connection between the}} circular polarisation of light, emitted along the normal to the surface, and the spin polarisation of the electrons. Conclusion. Physical methods for coding and transmitting information by means of polarised spin devices using the spin degree of freedom are formulated. The configuration principles of a polarised <b>radiation</b> <b>generator</b> (spin LED) are proposed. The approach is based on a heterostructure containing the quantum well InGaAs / GaAs (luminescent layer) and the ferromagnetic layer GaMnAs. It is established that the quantum well emission line is split into two circularly polarised components, which opens up new possibilities for coding and transmission of information in fibre-optic data transmission lines by the methods of polarisation modulation. The circular polarisation of the photoluminescence from the InGaAs / GaAs quantum well is caused by the magnetisation of a nearby ferromagnetic GaMnAs layer.

The mean neutron yield was 3 x 10 (8) neutrons of 2. 45 MeV per shot, corresponding to a 10 (6) neutrons/cm² fluence on the external surface of the chamber. A technique to detect the presence of water in the neighborhood of a compact Plasma Focus is presented. The measuring system is composed by two neutron detectors operated simultaneously on every shot. The first detector is used to register the PF neutron yield in each shot; whereas the other one was designed for detecting neutrons scattered by the blanket. The results indicate that the system is able to detect water contents of few percents in volume. The correlation of the counts recorded by thedetectors located at different positions was mapped with the water distribution around the neutron source. The complete detecting system is very simple and inexpensive. Among many other potential applications, the technique is specially suited for soil humidity prospection. X rays radiation emitted by the compact Plasma Focus operated in Deuterium has been used for introspective radiographic imaging of metallic objects.

Correspondingly a voltage pulse is generated at the extremes of the junction. Under periodic driving this allows us to produce a comb-like voltage pulses sequence. In the frequency domain it is possible to generate up to hundreds of harmonics of the fundamental driving frequency, thus mimicking the frequency comb used in optics and metrology.

Current theory cannot explain how such quantities {{are derived from}} the emitting particles (electrons). For an electron undergoing cyclotron emission in a uniform and constant magnetic field (z direction by convention) the following basic conservation laws must hold {{as a result of}} the configurational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Energy conservation. The total Hamiltonian of an interacting system of radiation and an electron does not have explicit time dependence. Energy is conserved. We may write where dEe/dt =-dE,/dt (1) d Ee/dt = d (fmr:u:) / dt (2) (rl is the radius of the electron orbit, u, is the cyclotron frequency) and dE,/dt, the rate of energy loss to radiation, is given in the appendix. Angular momentum conservation. In the absence of <b>radiation,</b> the gauge-invariant <b>generator</b> of infinitesimal rotation about the z axis is given for the electron as (Johnson and Lippmann 1949) L', = fmu,(r:- ri) where rg = xz + yg is the radial position of the electron guiding centre. L', is conserved because of azimuthal symmetry. In the presence of radiation, the symmetry property remains in the Hamiltonian. The total angular momentum of (electron+radiation) is conserved, i. e. dL',/dt =-dL:/dt.

The experimental technique. The study was conducted «in vitro». The suspension of bone marrow cells of rats in saline was the object of irradiation. One of the cell suspensions was seen, as a control and the other three parts were subjected to irradiation of 10, 20 and 30 minutes.

Outlet steam from primary reactor coolant system with the temperature of 410 C was led to 6 modules of steam generators {{and from there to}} turbine generators. Refueling was carried out on-line at plant full power. The first serious incident associated with refueling occurred in 1976 when a locking mechanism at a fuel assembly failed. The core was not damaged during that incident and following a reconstruction of the damaged technology channel, the plant continued in operation. However, serious problems were occurring with the integrity of steam generators (CO 2 gas on primary side, water and steam on secondary side) when the plant had to be shut down frequently due to failures and subsequent repairs. The second serious accident occurred in 1977 when a fuel assembly was overheated with a subsequent release of D 2 O into gas cooling circuit due to a human failure in the course of replacement of a fuel assembly. Subsequent rapid increase in humidity of the primary system resulted in damages of fuel elements in the core and the primary system was contaminated by fission products. In-reactor structures had been damaged, too. Activity had penetrated also into certain parts of the secondary system via leaking steam <b>generators.</b> <b>Radiation</b> situation in the course of both events on the plant site and around it had been below the level of limits specified. Based on a technical and economical justification of the demanding character of equipment repairs for the restoration of plant operation, and also due to a decision made not to continue with further construction of gas cooled reactors in Czechoslovakia, a decision was made in 1977 to terminate plant operation. The decision on the A 1 plant decommissioning was issued in 1979...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} two years, {{considerable}} effort has been expended in developing the TRNSYS Hybrid Lighting Model. The work {{has resulted in a}} software tool that can simulate impacts associated with utilizing the hybrid lighting technology. All of the physical parameters of a hybrid lighting system are included as variables within the software. By utilizing this work, the hybrid lighting team can make design decisions based upon computer predictions of the performance of a hybrid lighting system. The hybrid lighting system is modeled using the transient system simulation program TRNSYS. The TRNSYS model is implemented using interconnected components, which include a weather <b>generator,</b> <b>radiation</b> processors, a hybrid lighting model, a building model, building schedules, utility rate schedules, and output components. The results from the simulation include the annual energy and monetary savings gained from the hybrid lighting system. An economic model has been incorporated into the hybrid lighting model to calculate the break-even capital cost of a hybrid lighting system based on the annual savings. A narrow-band and wide-band hybrid lighting model has been developed. The wide- band model uses direct normal solar radiation from either a TMY 2 data file or the TRNSYS weather generator. The incoming direct normal radiation is weighted by the average spectral properties of the hybrid lighting components which include concentrator reflectance, secondary element transmittance and reflectance, thermal photovoltaic quantum efficiency, light fiber attenuation, and luminaire efficiency. The narrow-band model uses TMY 2 data or the TRNSYS weather generator to obtain the magnitude of the direct normal radiation, but the direct normal spectral distribution is predicted based on the atmospheric transmission model SMARTS. The narrow-band model predicts the direct normal spectral radiation at five nanometer bandwidths. Next it reads the available spectral component data, applies the component data to the solar spectral distribution, and calculates the amount of light and electricity that is generated by the system. The outputs from both models include the light produced by the hybrid lighting system as well as electricity generated by the TPV. Within TRNSYS, the light output from the hybrid lighting system model is sent to the building model. The building is modeled using the TRNSYS type 56 multi-zone building model. Type 56 is a FORTRAN subroutine which is designed to provide detailed thermal models of buildings. The model consists of two windowless 2500 m 2 zones. One zone uses efficient fluorescent lighting and the other zone uses hybrid lighting with dimmable fluorescent auxiliary lighting. Identical schedules in the two zones simulate the heating, cooling, and ventilation of a typical mixed-use environment. Gains in the model account for the people, computers, and lights in the building. Cooling in the building is supplied using a chiller with a constant COP of 3 and heating loads are met using an 80 % efficient natural gas furnace. Using local utility rate schedules, energy costs can be calculated for the two zones of the building model with the difference representing the energy savings due to the hybrid lighting system. The hybrid lighting model calculates the break-even capital cost of a hybrid lighting system based on the system energy savings. The break-even capital cost is defined as the initial cost of the hybrid lighting system that will provide a life cycle savings (LCS) of zero over the economic lifetime. At this point in the design stage, realistic component prices are not available for determining economic parameters such as years to payback, LCS, or return on investment. Instead the break-even capital cost was calculated {{to be used as a}} price target where the energy savings predicted by the TRNSYS model will economically compensate for the system components. Simulations were performed to determine effectiveness of the hybrid lighting technology across the United States. Hybrid lighting systems located in Tucson, AZ and Honolulu, HI performed best with break-even capital costs of $ 2050 and $ 2800 based on a 10 year analysis period. Other daylighting strategies were evaluated to determine their cost competitiveness with hybrid lighting. Photovoltaics and toplighting were both evaluated using TRNSYS models. The break-even capital cost of the hybrid lighting system was approximately five times that of a toplighting or photovoltaic system.
