5000|$|A pele {{tower was}} {{originally}} built on this site, {{near the village}} of Burgh, by Robert le Brun in 1307, on the site of a former tower that had been part of Hadrian's Wall. The construction used <b>red</b> sandstone <b>masonry</b> from the wall for its construction. Thomas Dacre rebuilt the castle in 1518, producing what contemporaries described as [...] "neither castle nor tower but a house of strength". The house was altered again between 1678 to 1681 by John Alglionby, producing the current design. The property today has a distinctive first floor doorway and staircase - a later addition to the castle - decorated with the Dacre coat of arms, and has parts of a Roman shrine incorporated into its stonework.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{increased}} use of earth for construction of buildings in developed countries, largely because of concerns with the environmental impact and embodied carbon from fi red bricks and cement-based products. Of all forms of earth construction, the widest impact on modern construction is likely to come from commercially produced unfi <b>red</b> earth <b>masonry</b> where large-scale production can signifi cantly reduce costs. While there are benefi ts to using earth masonry, structural design with earth masonry raises some specifi c issues that are not necessarily relevant {{to other forms of}} masonry construction. This paper summarises these issues and presents results of extensive structural testing on modern earth masonry. The structural properties required for design are compared with typical values for other masonry types in Eurocode 6, showing that commercially produced earth masonry can meet or even exceed the structural capacity of other commonly used masonry systems...|$|R
50|$|In 1951, a new {{building}} was erected at 1658 Lurting Avenue, {{at the intersection of}} Van Nest Avenue, in the Morris Park section of the Bronx. The church building was blessed and re-dedicated by Cardinal Spellman with more than 1000 people attending the ceremony. The architecture of the church is very monumental for its neighborhood, if a bit retrograde for its post-ward period of design. However, in contrast to the post-war Modernist brick box churches of this period, St. Francis Xavier's Church is designed in an early Gothic style with pointed arched windows and entrances accentuating a stolid masonry mass of low gabled nave and hipped square tower. in leafy and manicured lawned surroundings. The architecture is in the style of thirteenth-century Italian Gothic. The general <b>red</b> brick <b>masonry</b> of the walls is elegantly trimmed with white limestone, as is the corbelled tower cornice, which match the white masonry statues above the principal entrance gable and on the tower upper stage side elevations.|$|R
5000|$|The former Maryland National Bank, {{once the}} largest banking chain in Maryland, {{originated}} as the Baltimore Trust Company {{in the early}} 20th Century. It later was challenged by the expenses and problems from the building of its landmark iconic art deco-style skyscraper of <b>red</b> brick, <b>masonry</b> and limestone trim, headquarters in downtown Baltimore at 10 Light Street between East Redwood (formerly German Street before World War I) and East Baltimore Streets. The new BTC Building which immediately became the tallest building in Baltimore and Maryland, surpassing the neighboring Citizens National Bank to the south, was begun in 1924 and completed in 1929, just before the avalanche of economic disaster, unemployment and the now deepening Great Depression in the early 1930s following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After a series of reorganizations during the [...] "New Deal" [...] administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his bank holiday in 1933, shortly after taking office in March, the bank was reorganized as the Maryland National Bank.|$|R

50|$|The Île Perrot {{was granted}} to François-Marie Perrot by Jean Talon in 1672. From then until 1721 {{it was part}} of the Pointe-Claire parish, but {{residents}} often traveled to the nearer parish of Sainte-Anne du Bout (now Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue) for religious services. Either way, they had to go by canoe.A small chapel was built on the island in 1743. This soon proved too small for the growing population, and in 1753 the seigneur Jean-Baptiste Leduc granted the site on which the present church was built. Construction did not start until 1773, and was completed in August 1774.Work continued until 1783.The original church was rectangular, with roughly the same dimensions as the present nave, ending in a semi-circular apse.The exterior walls were built of <b>red</b> ocher sandstone <b>masonry.</b> In 1838 they were covered in cement, which was repaired several times afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|Virtually all {{octagonal}} {{churches in}} Norway are built from timber in a log construction, notable exceptions are Sør-Fron Church, Vang Church at Ridabu in Hamar and Røros Church (stone buildings). Trinity Church (Oslo) {{is the only}} octagonal church in Norway built in <b>red</b> brick. These <b>masonry</b> buildings are also the largest among the octagonal churches. The octagonal plan creates different angles and accordingly more challenging work for the carpenter compared to buildings with straight angels such as the cruciform plan. The cruciform paln was the dominant church design in Norway when the octagonal plan was introduced. The octagonal plan offers {{better view of the}} choir compared to the cruciform plan. The octagonal plan also creates a more rigid wood construction then the simple rectangular plan ("long church" [...] or [...] "hall church") allowing taller and wider buildings with a single room. Håkon Christie believed that these are the reasons the octagonal church became popular in Norway. In the basilica-shaped Samnanger church aisles' corners are cut creating an octagonal plan. This design was chosen to make walls shorter and avoiding the need to splice logs.|$|R
5000|$|Built of <b>red</b> {{sandstone}} and <b>masonry,</b> it is {{a double}} storied building. The roof is partly of slate and partly of brick. There is a gabled porch.

The hall is situated on the right a features a ceiling of panelled plaster. There is a notable pendant with eight ornamental flutings, more than 30 x 15 ft. A cornice surrounds the room, except {{in the area of the}} fireplace and the carved partition. The partition's cornice, made of plaster, is ornamented with figures and mottoes. On the north wall are two figures—a man apparently giving a cloak to a poor man or monk. Further on, a representation of Herodias' daughter bringing John the Baptist's head to Herod, with the decapitated body in the background. To the left of the fireplace, between it and the square-headed and stone-mullioned window, is an oak partition, panelled and carved, surmounted by a plaster partition between it and the ceiling, and over the door are the initials [...] "I. T." [...] Inside the partition is a room referred to as a chapel, though it has the appearance of an ordinary parlour or drawing room, with nothing ecclesiastic in its features. The c. 1640 ceiling features an angel with trumpet on Judgement Day.|$|R
50|$|The Jarvis Street Baptist Church was {{designed}} in the Gothic Revival style by the architectural firm of Henry Langley and Edmund Burke who served for many years at Jarvis Street Baptist Church as a Sunday-school teacher, chair of the choir committee, and deacon. It {{was one of the}} first churches in Canada to be built with an amphitheatre-shaped interior. The ground floor seating is grouped in a semicircle, while the gallery above is horseshoe shaped.The main façade of the building is made out brown stone that is obtained from the regions of Queenstown. The stone is laid unevenly with a pattern that varies in different shades of browns and dark yellows. The material used for the roof is Canadian slate. The roof is constructed from a series of pitched segments that are centrally connected by a horizontally sliced dome. There are eight entrances, each consisting of solid oak double doors framed with pointed sandstone arches. Several of these doors have been blocked off with black cast iron gates. Triangular sets of small rosette windows are placed above every door to fill the space in between the entrance and the top of the arch. The building has number of columns with slim tall shape and different capitals that are loosely based on a Corinthian order. The capitals are made of gray stone while the columns are of a high quality bronze shaded granite found in St. George, New Brunswick. The main entrance is set under the only tower of the building facing the south west side which serves as a vertical axis to the building. A copper spire sits on top of the tower, adding approximately nine metres to the existing roof height. In addition to the vertical axis the building also has a horizontal symmetry axis that goes diagonally through the building. The flat-roofed extension of the church, built after the 1938 fire, was constructed with <b>red</b> brick <b>masonry</b> which contrasts with the charred Queenston façade. Tall, thin arched windows cover the walls of the church, with the exception of the extension building whose windows are rectangular. The windows are divided into squares and diamonds of yellow and colourless textured glass. Many of the windows are aligned with one another. However a few of the smaller windows are offset to form a step-like pattern. The white wood framing of the windows contrasts with the colourful exterior stone. The building is heavily decorated with ornaments at the top of every pitched roof and throughout the spire. Gargoyles align with the entrance doors, and rippled arches are engraved in the building.|$|R
