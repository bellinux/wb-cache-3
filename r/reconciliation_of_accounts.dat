40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relationship between earnings and profits and retained earnings and the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>of</b> the two <b>accounts</b> by outside corporate investors. Deductive conclusions are based on data derived from publicly available literature, seventeen earnings and profits studies prepared by selected certified public accounting firms, and {{an interview with a}} representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ Ninety-two potential transactional differences between earnings and profits and retained earnings are analyzed and classified as resulting in no differences, timing differences, or permanent differences between the accounts. Corroborative inferences are drawn from the data developed from the seventeen earnings and profits studies and from the interview with the representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ This dissertation concludes that earnings and profits and retained earnings (1) only in extremely rare situations are equal in amount and (2) cannot be reconciled using publicly available information. In addition, the inference is drawn that retained earnings is not a valid surrogate for earnings and profits. The consequences of these conclusions and inference are that outside investors are not receiving useful information about earnings and profits and cannot generate that information. ^ The dissertation recommends that the United States Congress define earnings and profits, that the Internal Revenue Service require calculation <b>of</b> the <b>account</b> by all corporate taxpayers on an annual basis, and that the Financial Accounting Standards Board consider the issue <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>of</b> earnings and profits and retained earnings. In addition, recommendations for future research in this area are offered. ...|$|R

40|$|The 1997 SAM for Costa Rica {{takes into}} account the new {{non-traditional}} export sectors spurred by the export promotion policies of the past two decades. The existing SAMs for Costa Rica do not include these new sectors and the productive linkages between these {{and the rest of the}} economy. To attend this serious gap,an effort was carried out to compile a 1997 SAM for Costa Rica, the construction of which is explained in this document along the lines of a ‘top-down’ estimation procedure. The entries of the new SAM were first adjusted in a summary set <b>of</b> national <b>accounts</b> and then subsets of estimates were adjusted to the controlling aggregate totals. The elimination of data discrepancies, in particular the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>of</b> national <b>accounts</b> data and survey data, was successfully implemented using the Cross-Entropy (CE) method whereby a comprehensive set of constraints could be imposed using all the prior reliable information available. The macro SAM was disaggregated to arrive at a ‘raw micro SAM’. The activity account was split into the 17 production activity accounts, including but not limited to domestic, traditional and non-traditional export agriculture, food industries, textiles, wood products, oil and chemicals, paper, construction, trade, restaurants and hotels, transport and communucation, electricity, gas and water, financial services and insurance. In consistency with the activity breakdown, the flows in the commodity account were split into 17 accounts. Row-wise these flows included intermediate consumption, private and government consumption, gross fixed capital formation, inventory change,export subsidies, and exports. Column-wise the disaggregation was for sale and consumption taxes, import tariffs, export taxes and imports, using national accounts data at the commodity level.
