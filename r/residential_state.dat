50|$|State Road 298 Alternate (SR 298A, {{also known}} as West Jackson Street) is a former <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> highway in Escambia County, within the U.S. state of Florida. It was an {{alternate}} route to SR 298 in case there was a traffic accident on US 90/US 98 or {{any one of the}} roads intersecting SR 298. It was approximately 6 mi long, passing the western suburbs, Myrtle Grove, West Pensacola, and Brownsville before ending at US 29 in Downtown Pensacola. Oddly, it was less than 1 mi south of a major road. One of them is US 90. The entire road was only 2 lanes wide. The western terminus was at an intersection with SR 727, 2 blocks south of SR 298. Its eastern terminus was at an intersection with US 29 in Pensacola.|$|E

50|$|SR 625 {{begins at}} the signalized {{intersection}} of US 224 and Tippecanoe Road in Boardman Township. Known as Lockwood Boulevard, SR 625 begins in a northeasterly direction, passing through a commercial district up through its intersection with Tippecanoe Road, which turns off to the northwest. From here, {{the west side of}} SR 625 is primarily residential, while {{the east side of the}} highway abuts the western boundary of Mill Creek Park. Eventually, a residential cul-du-sac, an apartment complex, and then the Mill Creek Park Golf Course appear on the east side of SR 625. Beyond there, the highway arrives at a signalized intersection with Shields Road. Continuing to the northeast, SR 625 passes by a number of homes and scattered patches of woods, before intersecting Truesdale Road. The primarily <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> route continues to the northeast through the point where the highway departs Lockwood Boulevard, and turns north onto Arden Boulevard. SR 625 intersects Midlothian Boulevard, at which point it enters into Youngstown. With houses lining both sides of the route, SR 625 continues north for a short distance, curving slightly to the north-northwest as it enters into the signalized T-intersection with US 62 that marks its endpoint.|$|E
50|$|Continuing {{north of}} Forestburgh Pond, NY 42 bends {{northeast}} as a two-lane field road, {{passing through the}} hamlet of Forestburgh, north of Merriewold Lake. In the hamlet, NY 42 passes several residences on the southern end and in downtown, where CR 108 (St. Josephs Road) intersects. After bending northeast alongside some residences, NY 42 comes near St. Josephs Lake {{in the town of}} Thompson. In Thompson, NY 42 continues northward as a two-lane residential roadway, passing east of Wildwood Lake and to the west of Monticello Airport, which is accessible via Cantrell Road. After Cantrell Road, NY 42 bends northwest, varying as a two-lane residential and rural roadway through Thompson. The route bends northeast once again, returning to its <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> as it intersects with CR 45 and CR 45A (Sackett Lake Road). After crossing under power lines, NY 42 enters the village of Monticello.In Monticello, NY 42 gains the moniker of Forestburgh Road, passing through a large residential section of the village. After passing Monticello High School, the route bends northeast, entering downtown Monticello. The route becomes commercial just before an intersecting with Broadway, where NY 42 turns east onto Broadway and crosses through town as a two-lane residential street. A block after intersecting with the village continuation of CR 102 (St. John Street), NY 42 abandons Broadway for Pleasant Street, another two-lane commercial street through downtown Monticello. After an intersection with Rock Ridge Avenue, NY 42 enters an interchange with NY 17 (the Quickway; exit 105). The Pleasant Street moniker is dropped after the cloverleaf interchange, as NY 42 returns into the town of Thompson.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{empirical}} evidence on substance use {{among young people}} living in <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> care during adolescence is comparatively limited. This paper reports on substance use trends of young people living in <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> care during three annual datasweeps when aged 14, 15 and 16 years. A repeated cross-sectional research design was utilised in the research. The findings suggest some similarities for lifetime prevalence rates for tobacco and alcohol use for those living in <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> care {{with a group of}} same-age young people not living in <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> care who participated in the research. However, solvent abuse and cannabis use was higher among those living in care. More frequent substance use was reported by the residential care sample for all substances at each stage of the study. These findings suggest that young people living in state care continue to merit higher levels of vigilance from researchers and policy-makers in order to fully understand this behaviour and develop appropriate prevention initiatives to meet their needs regarding potential drug problems...|$|E

40|$|The first oral {{contraceptive}} {{was introduced in}} the United States during the 1960 s, and, subsequently, there was an increase in women’s labor force participation rates. Although the economic role of {{oral contraceptive}}s is still highly debated by scholars, previous studies have found that the pill had a statistically significant impact on women’s labor force participation rates. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, I will analyze how hours worked, hourly wages, weekly earnings and occupations for women were affected by oral contraceptives. By controlling for various governing statutes that affected the availability of the use and distribution of oral contraceptives in different states, I am able to provide evidence highlighting the extent of the pill’s significance. I find that early legal access (ELA) to oral contraceptives that resulted from <b>residential</b> <b>states</b> legalizing abortion before others positively and significantly affects women’s hours worked, hourly wages, weekly earnings and whether or not women entered into professional occupations...|$|R
40|$|Fujiwara Toyonari 2 ̆ 7 s (藤原豊成) wooden house {{seems to}} be very {{important}} as a clue to the <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> of the eighth century in Japan. Shosoin 2 ̆ 7 s (正倉院) documents describe the length, width, thickness and number of the building materials. But {{it is almost impossible to}} know how the above-mentioned wooden house was built in those days. About twenty years ago, Dr. M. Sekino restored it as a dwelling enclosed by earthern walls, doors, and latticed windows. When Dempodo, (伝法堂) which was built in the eighth century as a residence, and now is a temple in the eastern area of Horyuji (法隆寺), was recently dismembered and reconstructed, Dr. K. Asano examined the cut of the wood, and the oldness etc. of the materials, and concluded that the original Dempodo must have had two different rooms : one being an ordinary room, the other a kind of terrace. Now, the Main House of Daijogu, (大嘗宮正殿) according to a ninth century document, had also two different rooms, viz. ""Do""(堂), an open room and "" Shitsu "" (室) a closed one. Since Dempodo and the Main House of Daijogu are the only examples which enable us to know, in practice (Dembodo) or from document (Daijogu), the <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> around the eighth and the ninth centuries respectively, it may be concluded that Fujiwara 2 ̆ 7 s house, too, had two different rooms : one being an ordinary room, board-floored, enclosed by doors, latticed windows and a wall; the other, a kind of terrace or open room. ...|$|E

40|$|Background—Excessive {{alcohol use}} remains an {{important}} lifestyle-related contributor to {{morbidity and mortality}} in the U. S. and worldwide. It is well documented that drinking patterns differ across racial/ethnic groups, but not how those different consumption patterns would respond to tax changes. Therefore, policy makers are not informed on whether the effects of tax increases on alcohol abuse are shared equally by the whole population, or policies in addition to taxation should be pursued to reach certain sociodemographic groups. Aims of the Study—To estimate differential demand responses to alcohol excise taxes across racial/ethnic groups in the U. S. Methods—Individual data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 1984 - 2009 waves (N = 3, 921, 943, 39. 3 % male; 81. 3 % White, 7. 8 % African American, 5. 8 % Hispanic, 1. 9 % Asian or Pacific Islander, 1. 4 % Native American, and 1. 8 % other race/multi-race) are merged with tax data by <b>residential</b> <b>state</b> and interview month.
