The most commonly used mixture is nitrox, also referred to as Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN), which is air with extra oxygen, often with 32% or 36% oxygen, and thus less nitrogen, reducing the risk of decompression sickness or allowing longer exposure to the same pressure for equal risk.

5000|$|The method {{consists}} of heating a substance with sulphuric acid, which decomposes the organic substance by oxidation {{to liberate the}} <b>reduced</b> <b>nitrogen</b> as ammonium sulphate.

The amount of ammonia present, and thus the amount of nitrogen present in the sample, is determined by back titration. The end of the condenser is dipped into a solution of boric acid.

50|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae—a {{free-living}} anaerobic nitrogen-fixing bacterium. It {{contains a}} total of 20 nif genes located on the chromosome in a 24-Kb region. nifH, nifD, and nifK encode the nitrogenase subunits, while nifE, nifN, nifU, nifS, nifV, nifW, nifX, nifB, and nifQ encode proteins involved the assembly and incorporation of iron and molybdenum atoms into the nitrogenase subunits. nifF and nifJ encode proteins related to electron transfer {{taking place in the}} reduction process and nifA and nifL are regulatory proteins in charge of regulating the expression of the other nif genes. Rhodospirillum rubrum—a free-living anaerobic photosynthetic bacterium which, in addition to the transcriptional controls described above, regulates expression of the nif genes also in a metabolic way through a reversible ADP-ribosylation of a specific arginine residue in the nitrogenase complex.
