5|$|Animation enthusiasts {{have noticed}} {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International).

Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a <b>rip-off</b> of Aladdin.|$|E
