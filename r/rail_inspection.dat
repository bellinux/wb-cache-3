5000|$|The {{techniques}} {{mentioned above}} are utilized {{in a handful}} of different ways. The probes and transducers can be utilized on a [...] "walking stick", on a hand pushed trolley, or in a hand held setup. These devices are used when small sections of track are to be inspected or when a precise location is desired. Many times these detail oriented inspection devices follow up on indications made by a <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> cars or HiRail trucks. Handheld inspection devices are very useful for this when the track is used heavily, because they can be removed relatively easy. However, they are considered very slow and tedious, when there are thousands of miles of track that need inspection. [...] <b>Rail</b> <b>inspection</b> cars and HiRail trucks are the answer to today’s high mileage inspection needs. The first <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> cars were created by Dr. Sperry. Since then, many new models have rolled out. These <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> cars are basically their own train with inspection equipment on board. The probes and transducers are mounted on carriages located underneath the inspection car. Modern day inspection cars now use multiple NDT methods. Induction and ultrasound methods can be used in <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> cars and operate at testing speeds of more than 30 mph. The next generation will go even faster.|$|E
50|$|The first rail {{inspections}} {{were done}} visually. Many sources cite {{that the need}} for better rail inspections came after a derailment at Manchester, New York, in 1911. That particular accident resulted in the death of 29 people and injuries to 60 others. The investigation of the accident revealed that the cause was a transverse fissure (a critical crack which lies perpendicular to the length of the rail) in the rail. Further investigation in the late 1920s showed that this type of defect was quite common. With increased rail traffic at higher speeds and with heavier axle loads today, critical crack sizes are shrinking and <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> is becoming more important. In 1927, Dr. Elmer Sperry built a massive <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> car under contract with the American Railway Association. Magnetic induction was the method used on the first <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> cars. This was done by passing large amounts of magnetic field through the rail and detecting flux leakage with search coils. Since then, many other inspection cars have traversed the rails in search of flaws.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this article, a {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to evaluate the}} economic life of rail using a sto-chastic analysis of rail failures. The occurrence of rail defects and failures is analysed and issues related to rail maintenance are addressed. The hazard rate of alumino-thermic weld failures is predicted for continuously welded rail, where the expected number of welds is increasing in ton-nage {{as a result of}} replacement. Imperfect inspections are modelled for predicting the expected number of failures by employing a filtered non-homogeneous Poisson process. The impact of maintenance on failure occurrence and whole life-cycle cost (LCC) is analysed and integrated within the model. The application and capability of the proposed model and sensitivity of parameters are illustrated {{through the use of a}} practical example. It is shown that an optimal economic life of rail can always be found, as the repair cost and the risk cost of accident are increasing with tonnage that passed through it. In addition, the inspection frequency has a significant impact on rail LCC. The results also suggest that the proposed model is also valid for optimizing the interval between <b>rail</b> <b>inspections...</b>|$|R

50|$|A speeder (also {{known as}} railway motor car, putt-putt, track-maintenance car, crew car, jigger, trike, quad, trolley or {{inspection}} car, and {{also known as}} a draisine (although that can also be unpowered) is a maintenance of way motorized vehicle formerly used on railroads around the world by track inspectors and work crews to move quickly to and from work sites. Although it is slow compared to a train or car, it is called speeder because it is faster than a human-powered vehicle such as a handcar. Motorised inspection cars date back to at least 1896, when it was reported that the U.S. Daimler Motor Company created a gasoline-powered <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> car capable of 15 mph.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automobile}} built {{related to}} the company was a four-seater designed by Gustaf Erikson in Surahammar in 1897.

50|$|With {{increased}} {{rail traffic}} carrying heavier loads at higher speeds, a quicker more efficient way of inspecting railways is needed. Lasers inspect railway geometry, {{but one day}} they might be utilized {{as a form of}} non-contact evaluation of the rail. This most likely will be done with laser-optical transmitting transducers in ultrasonic testing. Eliminating contact with the rail could one day allow high speed detection of flaws. (Testing of rail is currently able to be done at 80 km per hour with a Speno US-6 Ultrasonics train) Another need for the future is a complete <b>rail</b> <b>inspection</b> system. A step in this direction is deeper investigation of the rail by using low frequency eddy currents. Other advancements could include neural network analysis of signals to improve defect detection and identification and longitudinal guided ultrasonics. Improved rail quality, composition, and joining techniques could lead to better wear characteristics and a longer lifespan of the rail. Some investigation into banitic steels looks promising. A safe and portable means of filmless radiography could assist with onsite defect evaluation. These are just a few advancements {{in the process of being}} developed for future use.|$|E
