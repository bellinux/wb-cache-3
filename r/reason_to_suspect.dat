5|$|Echmarcach's hold on Dublin was {{short-lived}} as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that Ímar replaced him as King of Dublin in 1038. This annal-entry {{has been interpreted}} to indicate that Ímar drove Echmarcach from the kingship. There is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065) extended his presence into the Isles and the Irish Sea region at about this period. The evidence of Þórfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. In fact, Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038.|$|E

5|$|The {{islands of}} the Clyde may well have formed the power base of Somhairle mac Giolla Brighde and his {{descendants}} by {{the last half of}} the 12th century. At about this time period, the authority of the Steward of Scotland seems to have encroached into the region; and there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that, by the turn of the 13th century, the islands were consumed by the expanding Stewart lordship. The western extension of Scottish authority appears to have been one of the factors behind a Norwegian invasion of the region in 1230, in which the invaders seized Rothesay Castle.|$|E

5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> {{that he was}} forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), {{was old enough to}} assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|At the {{midpoint}} of the twelfth century, the kingdom was under the overlordship of Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster (died 1171). The latter's ultimate overking, however, was Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1166). The year after Brodar's death, numerous sources indicate that Mac Murchada, with a force of Dubliners in tow, formally rendered submission to Mac Lochlainn. In 1162, the fifteenth–sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals that Mac Murchada gained an almost-unprecedented authority over Dublin. There is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that his success stemmed from assistance received from Mac Lochlainn. The latter, for example, is recorded by the same source to have laid siege to the town within the year. In fact, this military campaign may have been undertaken to counter the Dubliners' attempt to install Gofraid mac Amlaíb, King of the Isles (died 1187) to the kingship of Dublin, as recounted by the thirteenth–fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann.|$|E
5|$|Since Echmarcach's {{extensive}} imperium {{appears to}} have spanned the Irish Sea region, {{it is possible that}} he was regarded as a threat by Siward, Earl of Northumbria (died 1055). There is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that, by the mid eleventh century, this Anglo-Danish magnate extended his authority into what had previously been the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Echmarcach's apparent descent from the Uí Ímaira dynasty that once reigned over York as kingscombined with Echmarcach's accumulation of power after Knútr's demise, could well have been a cause of concern to the York-based earl. Such unease could partly account for Siward's extension of power into the Solway region, a sphere of insecure territory which may have been regarded as vulnerable by Echmarcach.|$|E

5|$|Gernot Wilhelm saw no {{ground for}} Richter's {{assumption}} concerning {{the identification of}} the Nuhaššite monarch with the Qaṭanean king. This identification rests on the theory that Qatna belonged geographically to the region of Nuhašše, but no solid evidence supports this assumption, and the Shattiwaza treaty between the Hittites and Mitannians clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuhašše during the first Syrian war when the Nuhaššite king ruled. If Qatna was part of the Nuhaššite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately in the treaty. It is a fact that Qatna was ruled by Idanda during the first war and the Hittite documents do not mention a change of rulers in Qatna made by Šuppiluliuma, leaving no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that Idanda ascended the throne {{as a result of the}} war. Jacques Freu likewise rejected Richter's hypothesis. Citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše was a contemporary of Idanda, the successor of the Qaṭanean Adad-Nirari.|$|E
5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, {{then it would be}} unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing {{off the face of the}} earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the early}} diocesan {{succession}} of Argyll is uncertain, the jurisdiction itself {{appears to have}} lain outwith the domain of Rǫgnvaldr's direct control, allowing the meic Somairle to readily act as religious patrons without his interference. Like the Kingdom of the Isles itself, the great geographic size of the Diocese of the Isles appears to {{have contributed to the}} alienation of outlying areas, and to its eventual disintegration. In fact, there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that portions of the new diocese were likewise detached from the Scottish dioceses of Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Moray. Although the Scottish Crown may have welcomed the formation of the new diocese, as it may have formed part of a plan to project Scottish royal authority into the region, the meic Somairle rulers of the region were in fact hostile to the Scots, and the diocese's seat on Lismorealbeit first recorded in the early fourteenth centurylay far outwith the Scottish king's sphere of influence. Whatever the case, the foundation of the Diocese of Argyll {{appears to have been a}} drawn-out and gradual process that was unlikely to have been the work of one particular mansuch as Somerled, Dubgall, or Ragnall himself. Although the early diocese suffered from prolonged vacancies, as only two bishops are recorded to have occupied the see before the turn of the mid thirteenth century, over time it became firmly established in the region, allowing the meic Somairle to retain local control of ecclesiastical power and prestige.|$|E
5|$|Ímar's {{probable}} uncle, Sitriuc, ruled Dublin {{for almost}} fifty years between 989 and 1036. There is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that the latter's realm included Mann {{by the second}} or third decade of the eleventh century. His reign in Dublin was finally put to an end by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065), who drove Sitriuc from the coastal town and claimed the kingship for himself. Previously, Sitriuc seems to have been closely aligned with Knútr Sveinnsson (died 1035), ruler of the kingdoms of England, Denmark, and Norway. Knútr's apparent authority in the Irish Sea region, coupled with Sitriuc's seemingly close connections with him, could account for the remarkable security enjoyed by Sitriuc during Knútr's reign. It is possible that Echmarcach had been bound from taking action against Sitriuc whilst Knútr held power, and that the confusion caused by the latter's death in 1035 enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation and seize control of the Irish Sea region. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann by this date, Sitriuc {{does not appear to have}} taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems to suggest that the island was outside Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the chronicle's bias against the {{descendants}} of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson {{is one of the}} two miracle narratives preserved by this source. The story in question is about a miracle attributed to St Mary, which may have been incorporated into the chronicle in order to discredit the reign of Haraldr Guðrøðarson. Whatever the case, the story deals with an aged chieftain named Domnall, who is described as a close friend of Haraldr Óláfsson, and regarded by the latter as worthier than others. The chronicle relates how Domnall and his young son were forced to flee from Haraldr Guðrøðarson to the sanctuary of the Church of St Mary at Rushen. The latter, however, is stated to have tricked them into leaving the church-grounds, whereupon they were immediately seized. It was in this time of need, so the story says, that Domnall's prayers to St Mary were answered, and that it was through her divine intervention that he and his son escaped from their imprisonment. The chronicle states that Domnall himself recounted the story to the chronicle's compilers. The account itself seems to have been used as means to portray Haraldr Guðrøðarson as a distrustful oath-breaker, and thereby further discredit the line of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson; conversely, the connection between Haraldr Óláfsson and the divinely favoured Domnall may have been intended to imply legitimacy in regards to Óláfr's line. Although the identities of Domnall and his son are uncertain, there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that they are identical to Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, and his son, Aonghus Mór (died c. 1293).|$|E

5|$|Knútr {{may have}} sought the {{submission}} of the assembled kings {{in an attempt}} to protect his northern borders. Additionally, he may have sought to prevent these kings from allowing military aid to reach potential challengers to his authority. If Echmarcach's father was indeed a son of Ragnall mac Gofraid, it would have meant that he was a nephew of Lagmann mac Gofraid. The latter was closely associated with Óláfr Haraldsson (died 1030), and together both lent military assistance to Richard II in the early eleventh century. There is also evidence to suggest that the predecessors of Ragnall mac Gofraid and Lagmann possessed connections with the Normans. In consequence, there is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>suspect</b> that Knútr sought to counter a potential association between Echmarcach and Richard II. Knútr and Óláfr were certainly at odds. In 1028, only a few years before the meeting of kings, Knútr seized control of Norway after defeating Óláfr. Knútr proceeded to appoint his own nephew, Hákon Eiríksson (died 1029/1030), as regent in Norway. Unfortunately for Knútr, Hákon perished at sea in late 1029 or early 1030. About three years later, Knútr's overlordship in Norway was challenged by a certain Tryggvi Óláfsson (died c.1033). This man apparently possessed connections with Dublin and the Isles, as saga-tradition appears to reveal that his mother, Gyða, was a daughter of Amlaíb Cuarán. Although Tryggvi apparently enjoyed considerable local support when he landed in Norway in about 1033, he was nonetheless overwhelmed by forces loyal to Knútr and killed. Tryggvi is unlikely to have been Knútr's only challenger, and the episode itself evinces the way in which potential threats to Knútr could emerge from the Scandinavian settlements in Britain and Ireland.|$|E
