In this paper, an indirect solid freeform fabrication process based on Stereolithography (SL) and gelcasting to shape complicated ceramic parts. A lost <b>resin</b> <b>mold</b> with negative image of part was first fabricated by SL. And then aqueous ceramic slurry with high solids loading and low viscosity were prepared and poured into the <b>resin</b> <b>mold,</b> a wet gelcast body was obtained by in-situ polymerized, and the vacuum freeze-drying technology was used to eliminate the deionized water in the gelcast body for improving efficiency and decrease drying shrinkage. Based on the thermogravimetric analysis results of <b>resin</b> <b>mold</b> and gel ceramic body, a sintering process was carried out to remove mold, organic binder and to sinter ceramic. Finally, the desired ceramic part was successfully fabricated to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel process...|$|E

The micro-molding process consists of four steps: fabrication of the <b>resin</b> <b>mold,</b> electroless plating of the mold, electrolytic grinding to open the interior structure, and extraction. An epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>mold,</b> which is suitable for two-photon micro-polymerization, was successfully plated with nickel through this electroless process. Electrolytic plating was found to be useful for applying a thick nickel film on non-conductive resin with low crystal lattice distortion and few impurities.

30|$|Iji and Yokoyoma (1995) has {{conducted}} research using recovered NMFs as a filler for viscoelastic materials made of epoxy resin compounds, comparing the powder with common fillers, such as calcium carbonate, talc and silica. The epoxy resin compound {{consists of an}} epoxy resin matrix (48 wt%), a hardener (20 wt%) and a filler (32 wt%). The NMFs found improved mechanical strength and thermal expansion properties of the epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>mold,</b> being NMFs more effective than talc, calcium carbonate and silica. This improvement in properties was {{probably due to the}} compatibility between the NMFs and the epoxy resin matrix, and also because of the inclusion of fiberglass. The viscosity of the compound with the NMFs was comparable to the compound with powder. The bond strength of epoxy resin with casts of NMFs was sufficient, that is, it was almost equal to the mold with calcium carbonate, talc or silica.|$|E

Electrical circuits are formed by suitable printing sequence and sintering processes. In this paper, we present a concept of inkjet deposited System-in-Package (SiP). The package contains bare ICs and discrete passive components that are encapsulated with <b>resin</b> <b>mold.</b> Encapsulation material works as a substrate for interconnections, which are directly deposited {{on top of the}} mold. All connections between the components and connections to the I/O pins are formed by inkjetting silver nano-particle and dielectric inks. Silver nano-particles are sintered in an oven at 220 °C and resistivity values lower than 5 µΩcm are reported. Precuring of a substrate in a higher temperature than the sintering temperature of silver nano-particles, decreases the resistivity of the lines. As a conclusion, the sintering profile needs to be considered carefully in order to achieve resistance requirements set by the design.

Fifty carbon fiber posts received surface treatments in order to verify their influence on the retention of the core material.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} an alkaline solution and two 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) -based primer agents on bond strength to zirconia (yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconium polycrystal [Y-TZP]) through the shear bond strength (SBS) test. Materials and Methods: Sixty square-shaped Y-TZP samples were embedded in an acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>mold,</b> polished, and {{randomly assigned to one}} of six groups (n= 10) according to treatment surface: group CR, no treatment (control); group NaOH, 0. 5 M NaOH; group AP, Alloy Primer; group ZP, Z-Primer Plus; group NaOH-AP, 0. 5 M NaOH + Alloy Primer; and group NaOH-ZP, 0. 5 M NaOH + Z-Primer Plus. The resin cement (Rely X U 100) was applied inside a matrix directly onto the Y-TZP surface, and it was light-cured for 40 seconds. The samples were stored in distilled water at 37 C for 24 hours prior to the test, which was performed in a universal machine at a crosshead-speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey tests (p< 0. 05). Light stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to assess the surface topography and failure mode. Results: The SBS was significantly affected by the chemical treatment (p< 0. 0001). The AP group displayed the best results, and the use of NaOH did not improve SBS results relative to either AP or ZP. The samples treated with Alloy Primer displayed mainly mixed failures, whereas those conditioned with Z-Primer Plus or with 0. 5 M NaOH presented a balanced distribution of adhesive and mixed failure modes. Conclusions: The use of a NaOH solution may have modified the reactivity of the Y-TZP surface, whereas the employment of a MDP/ 6 - 4 -vinylbenzyl-n-propyl amino- 1, 3, 5 -triazine 2, 4 -dithione-based primer enhanced the Y-TZP bond strength.

40|$|Purpose: Conventional {{investment}} casting of turbine blades {{is a time}} consuming and expensive process due to the complications in wax injection steps and the complex shape of airfoil surfaces. By using rapid {{investment casting}}, a substantial improvement in the gas turbine blade manufacturing process can be expected. However, this process {{needs to be able}} to compete with conventional investment casting from a dimensional accuracy view of point. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the manufacture of gas turbine blades via two indirect rapid tooling (RT) technologies, namely epoxy (EP) resin tooling and silicon rubber molding. Design/methodology/approach: The second stage blade of a Ruston TA 1750 gas turbine (rated at 1. 3 MW) was digitized by a coordinate measuring machine. The aluminum-filled EP resin and silicon rubber molds were fabricated using StereoLithography master models. Several wax patterns were made by injection in the EP resin and silicone rubber molds. These wax patterns were utilized for ceramic shell fabrication and blade casting. Findings: Dimensional inspection of cast blades showed that silicone rubber molding was not a suitable approach for production of blade wax patterns. The maximum deviation for the final cast blade made using the silicone rubber mold was þ 0. 402 mm. The maximum deviation for the final cast blade made using the EP <b>resin</b> <b>mold</b> was lower at 20. 282 mm. This showed that EP resin tooling could enable new cost-effective solutions for small batch production of gas turbine blades. Practical implications: The research results presented will give efficient industrial approach and scientific insight of the gas turbine blade manufacturing by use of rapid technologies. Originality/value: There are some general research works related to utilization of rapid technologies for manufacturing of gas turbine blade. However, this paper presents a unique procedure of integrated reverse engineering and RT technologies for rapid investment casting of gas turbine blade through presenting comprehensive comparison between two techniques from dimensional accuracy view of point...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ascorbic {{acid and}} its salts are low-toxicity products, which are {{routinely}} used in food industries as antioxidants. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the effect of 10 % sodium ascorbate on the bond strength of two all-in-one adhesive systems to NaOCl-treated dentin. Material and Methods: After exposing the dentin on the facial surface of 90 sound human premolars and mounting in an acrylic <b>resin</b> <b>mold,</b> the exposed dentin surfaces were polished with 600 -grit SiC paper under running water. Then the samples were randomly divided into 6 groups of 15. Groups 1 and 4 were the controls, in which no surface preparation was carried out. In groups 2 and 5 the dentin surfaces were treated with 5. 25 % NaOCl alone for 10 minutes and in groups 3 and 6 with 5. 25 % NaOCl for 10 minutes followed by 10 % sodium ascorbate for 10 minutes. Then composite resin cylinders, measuring 2 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height, were bonded on the dentin surfaces in groups 1, 2 and 3 with Clearfil S 3 Bond and in groups 4, 5 and 6 with Adper Easy One adhesive systems according to manufacturers’ instructions. The samples were stored in distilled water for 24 hours at 37 °C and then thermocycled. Finally, the samples underwent shear bond strength test in a universal testing machine at a strain rate of 1 mm/min. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests at α= 0. 05. Results: The differences between groups 1 and 2 (P = 0. 01), 1 and 5 (P = 0. 003). 1 and 6 (P = 0. 03) and 4 and 5 (P = 0. 03) were statistically significant.

40|$|A high {{resolution}} reconfigurable mold {{has been sought}} after for over 150 years. An ideal reconfigurable mold {{would be capable of}} producing detailed surfaces for use in molding and be capable of fast surface reconfiguration. Such a device would combine the fast speed and repeatability of formative processes, like injection molding, with the flexibility of additive processes, like 3 D printing. An affordable, {{high resolution}}, reconfigurable mold could be a practical tool for a lean, short-run shop or factory, serving as a <b>resin</b> <b>mold,</b> fixturing surface or concrete formwork; to name only a few possible applications. Resembling the common pin art toy, a discrete element pin bed has often been proposed as a design for a reconfigurable mold. Conventional actuation strategies are often cumbersome and expensive, due to the quadratic increase in number of pin elements with increasing surface resolution. Very few designs exist that are capable of producing a reconfigurable pin array at sufficiently high resolution to compete with the cost of making a fixed geometry mold. A practical pin tool, an inexpensive but high resolution molding tool, could be an asset to shops and small business everywhere, but nothing like this currently exists. This thesis presents a concise design strategy, backed up by analytical arguments and empirical evidence which can used to construct an affordable, high resolution reconfigurable pin tool. We address the challenge of quadratic scaling by edge-addressing simple, nonlinear mechanisms to actuate each pin. Edge addressing, along rows and columns of pins, reduces the number of control inputs to a small, linearly increasing value. Nonlinear mechanisms at each discrete pin site allow for a predictable, localized expression of the edge addressed inputs. Two embodiments of this design strategy are proposed and tested. First, a diode/resistive heater array allows for electrical edge addressing and control of a fusible alloy brake to grip or release targeted, sliding pins. Second, an array of screws is edge addressed by mechanical oscillations to generate nonlinear tangential forces in targeted screws, resulting in controllable screw translations. We conclude by summarizing our results and discuss directions for future work. by Benjamin J. Peters. Thesis: S.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} gold/gold thermocompression bonding at silicon wafer level. The first samples contains sealing rings and electrical pads and are characterized on pull and shear test showing bond strength similar to silicon/glass anodic bonding (10 MPa- 80 MPa). A sealed cavity and a piezoresistor on a 30 µm-thick silicon membrane are added in the second samples. Helium test, membrane deflection and piezoresistor signal monitoring after aging 14 days at 250 °C confirm the vacuum stability inside the cavity after bonding. Motivation and results Several bonding techniques [1 - 5] exist to ensure hermeticity and protection of sensor inside micro-cavities. The analysis of gold thermo-compression bonding performed here contains both sealing ring and electrical contacts. To qualify our process, two different structures are realized to test bond strength (Figure 1) and hermeticity (Figure 2). For both structures, two 4 inches 500 µm-thick, double-sided polished silicon wafers with 200 nm-thick thermal SiO 2 are used. On each wafer, a diffusion barrier followed by 50 nm/ 500 nm Ti/Au evaporated seed layer is deposited. Then a 3 µm-thick electroplating gold is deposited inside a patterned <b>resin</b> <b>mold</b> in order to define sealing rings and electrical pads. For the second structure, a square membrane (30 µm-thick and 2000 µm-side) and piezoresistors are added. For both structures, we used a SUSS-SB 6 bonder to perform the thermocompression bonding (420 °C, 5, 7 MPa, 50 minutes). We include spacers between the wafers during alignment to obtain vacuum inside the cavity (5. 10 - 3 mbar). After bonding and dicing, some dies are polished to observe the gold structure at the interface (Figure 3). No delamination is observed between the different materials showing a complete atomic diffusion at the gold interface bonding. Batches of 20 dies are then selected from different wafer areas for pull and shear tests. Most of the dies exhibit cohesive fracture in silicon with tensile strength comparable or superior to silicon/glass anodic bonding (figure 4). Even if pull tests are often used for the qualification of bond strength, this technique don't give reproducible results compared to shear test. High rate leakage through bonding interface has been evaluated with structure 2 by monitoring the membrane deflection several hours after bonding with a mechanical profiler. Measurements show deflection between 4 µm and 5 µm for 75 % of the cells, {{which is consistent with}} simulation and technological process variations. In order to check more precisely the leakage, the dies (after breaking the thin silicon membrane) are glued on a special tool where one side of the die is exposed to He and the other side is connected to vacuum (1. 10 - 9 mbar) detector equipment (Figure 5). The mean leak measured by He detector was 10 - 8 mbar. l/s for the best dies structure bonded which correspond to an excellent hermeticity. The hermeticity reliability has been characterized by following the response of a piezoresistor placed on the membrane after aging at 250 °C during 14 days for 6 cells (Figure 6). The piezoreristance shift is lower than 250 ppm for the best cell which correspond to a 75 mbar variation inside the cavity...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} article, an open gap is present between the fibrous {{reinforcements}} {{and the upper}} mold during the filling stage of <b>resin</b> injection/compression <b>molding</b> (I/CM). Thus <b>resin</b> can quickly fill up the gap. After that, the mold platens are brought together and drive the resin through the preform. The resin motion in the gap is simplified using the Hele-Shaw flow model, while Darcy’s law {{is used to calculate}} the flow fields in the fiber mats. The numerical simulation is based on the body-fitted finite element method (FEM). Results show that the resin injection time is short and most filling time is elevated to the closing of the cavity in the simultaneous I/CM filling process. Small gap size and high compression speed can be used to achieve the minimum mold filling time. However, the improper process parameters can cause the incomplete filling or reversed flow at the gate. In order to avoid the above conditions, the restrictive conditions of simultaneous I/CM are also discussed. The simultaneous I/CM can reduce either the mold filling time or injection pressure significantly compared to <b>resin</b> transfer <b>molding</b> (RTM).
