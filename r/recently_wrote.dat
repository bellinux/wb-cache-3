25|$|The {{works of}} Carr and his {{influence}} among conspiracy theorists {{has been studied}} by the American historian Daniel Pipes (1997) and the folklorist Bill Ellis (2000).

6000|$|Again I protested. [...] "Don't be hasty. There {{are nice}} ones. My own mother had this power in her youth, so my father tells me. Her people {{were living in}} Wisconsin {{at the time when}} this psychic force {{developed}} in her, and the settlers from many miles around came to see her 'perform.' An uncle, when a boy of four, did automatic writing, and one of my aunts <b>recently</b> <b>wrote</b> to me, in relation to my book The Tyranny of the Dark, that for two years (beginning when she was about seventeen) these powers of darkness made her life a hell. It won't do to be hasty in condemning the mediums wholesale. There are many decent people who are possessed by strange forces, but are shy of confessing their abnormalities. Ask your family physician. He will tell you that he always has at least one patient who is troubled by occult powers." ...|$|E

My sister, who is writing this for me, reads me the Oz books, but I wish I could read them myself." [...] Another letter says: [...] "I'm a great girl 13 years old, so you'll be surprised when I tell you I am not too old yet for the Oz stories." [...] Here's another letter: [...] "Since I was a young girl I've never missed getting a Baum book for Christmas. I'm married, now, but am as eager to get and read the Oz stories as ever." [...] And still another writes: [...] "My good wife and I, both more than 70 years of age, believe that we find more real enjoyment in your Oz books than in any other books we read." [...] Considering these statements, I wrote the college professor that my books are intended for all those whose hearts are young, no matter what their ages may be.|$|E
