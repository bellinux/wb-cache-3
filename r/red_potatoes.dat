5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree <b>Red</b> <b>potatoes.</b> The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimental}} potatoes {{had been}} transformed with the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree <b>Red</b> <b>potatoes</b> as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin. Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{potatoes}} {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree <b>Red</b> <b>potatoes.</b> The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E

40|$|Sweet potato (Ipomea batatas (L.) Lam.) {{is one of}} {{functional}} foods that can maintain and improve human health. Due to the very hard texture of <b>red</b> sweet <b>potato,</b> it cannot be consumed directly. Therefore, it requires various cooking methods {{in order to be}} more suitable for consumption.

2500|$|In the United States, {{potatoes}} {{have become}} one of the most widely consumed crops and thus have a variety of preparation methods and condiments. French fries and often hash browns are commonly found in typical American fast-food burger joints and cafeterias. One popular favorite involves a baked potato with cheddar cheese (or sour cream and chives) on top, and in New England [...] "smashed potatoes" [...] (a chunkier variation on mashed potatoes, retaining the peel) have great popularity. Potato flakes are popular as an instant variety of mashed potatoes, which reconstitute into mashed potatoes by adding water, with butter or oil and salt to taste. A regional dish of Central New York, salt potatoes are bite-size new potatoes boiled in water saturated with salt then served with melted butter. At more formal dinners, a common practice includes taking small <b>red</b> <b>potatoes,</b> slicing them, and roasting them in an iron skillet. Among American Jews, the practice of eating latkes (fried potato pancakes) is common during the festival of Hanukkah.|$|E

60|$|We {{will now}} turn to the {{experiments}} made in Germany, {{since the publication of}} Prof. Hildebrand's paper. Herr Magnus relates (11/114. 'Sitzungsberichte der Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin' October 17, 1871.) the results of numerous trials made by Herren Reuter and Lindemuth, both attached to the Royal Gardens of Berlin. They inserted the eyes of <b>red</b> <b>potatoes</b> into white ones, and vice versa. Many different forms partaking of the characters of the inserted bud and of the stock were thus obtained; for instance, some of the tubers were white with red eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fitzpatrick {{followed}} a different plan (11/110. 'Gard. Chronicle' 1869 page 335.); he grafted together not the tubers {{but the young}} stems of varieties producing black, white, and <b>red</b> <b>potatoes.</b> The tubers borne by three of these twin or united plants were coloured in an extraordinary manner; one was almost exactly half black and half white, so that some persons on seeing it thought that two potatoes had been divided and rejoined; other tubers were half red and half white, or curiously mottled with red and white, or with red and black, according to the colours of the graft and stock.|$|E
60|$|Herr Magnus also {{exhibited}} {{in the following year}} before the same Society (November 19, 1872), the produce of grafts between black, white, and <b>red</b> <b>potatoes,</b> made by Dr. Neubert. These were made by uniting not the tubers but the young stems, as was done by Mr. Fitzpatrick. The result was remarkable, inasmuch as all the tubers thus produced were intermediate in character, though in a variable degree. Those between the black and the white or the red were the most striking in appearance. Some from between the white and red had one half of one colour and {{the other half of the}} other colour.|$|E
