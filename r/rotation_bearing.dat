Six failure modes and three load cases were taken into account. After carrying out an extensive parameter study it is apparently that bearing capacity, <b>rotation</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and sliding beneath the caissons bottom are the most important failure modes. It has been found out that wave crest is the most relevant load case. But wave through should not be neglected at all.

This trend {{has increased the}} attention of the academic community to optimization problems that arise from real-world logistic applications. However, the gap between problem models presented in literature and those that occur in the real-world situations is still large. With this thesis we aim to develop models and metaheuristic search methods to solve complex real-world problems in the domain of computational logistics. In particular our interest has been fo-cused to routing and loading problems, which have several practical applications in transportation, cutting, packing, and scheduling. As a first step, we present a rich vehicle routing problem which includes a heterogeneous fleet, a multi-day planning horizon, a complex carrier-dependent cost function for vehicles, and the possibility of leaving orders unscheduled.

40|$|Systems and {{components}} of selected Apollo A 7 L/A 7 LB flight-article spacesuits that were worn on {{the lunar surface}} have been studied to determine {{the degree to which}} they suffered contamination, abrasion and wear or loss of function due to effects from lunar soil particles. Filter materials from the lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters from the Apollo Command Module were also studied to determine the amount and type of any lunar dust particles they may have captured from the spacecraft atmosphere. The specific spacesuit study materials include the outermost soft fabric layers on Apollo 12 and 17 integrated thermal micrometeorite garment assemblies and outermost fabrics on Apollo 17 extravehicular pressure gloves. In addition, the degree of surface wear in the sealed wrist <b>rotation</b> <b>bearing</b> from Apollo 16 extravehicular and intravehicular pressure gloves was evaluated and compared. Scanning electron microscope examination of the Apollo 12 T- 164 woven TeflonO fabric confirms the presence of lunar soil particles and the ability of these particles to cause separation and fraying of the Teflon fibers. Optical imaging, chemical analysis and particle sampling applied to the outer fabric of the Apollo 17 spacesuit has identified Ti as a potentially useful chemical marker for comparing the amount of lunar soil retained on different areas of the spacesuit outer fabric. High-yield particle sampling from the Apollo 17 fabric surfaces using adhesive tape found 80 % of particles on the fabric are lunar soil particles averaging 10. 5 m in diameter, with the rest being intrinsic fabric materials or environmental contaminants. Analysis of the mineralogical composition of the lunar particles found that on a grain-count basis the particle population is dominated by plagioclase feldspar and various types of glassy particles derived mostly from soil agglutinates, with a subordinate amount of pyroxene. On a grain size basis, however, the pyroxene grains are generally a factor of 2 larger than glass and plagioclase, so conversion of the data to a modal (volume %) basis results in pyroxene becoming the modally dominant particle type with glass and plagioclase significantly less abundant. When comparisons are made to the modal composition of lunar soil at the Apollo 17 landing site, the results suggest that pyroxene particles have overall better retention on the spacesuit outer fabric compared to plagioclase and especially glass. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no measureable difference in the amount of wear and abrasion in the wrist <b>rotation</b> <b>bearing</b> of an Apollo 16 pressure glove worn only in the spacecraft and one worn only for extravehicular activity on the lunar surface.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} MQP was {{to design}} and develop a {{prosthetic}} wrist with {{two degrees of freedom}} to enable the user of the prosthetic device to better position his arm for gripping, grasping, and turning items. Current powered prosthetic wrists have one degree of freedom, which allows the user to pronate and supinate the arm, or turn the palm outward and inward, respectively. Though these two motions allow individuals using the prosthetic wrist to turn doorknobs and dials, there are still several daily activities such as combing one’s hair and operating keys that require another degree of freedom. Therefore, a powered prosthetic wrist capable of not only pronation and supination, but also flexion and extension of the wrist with the ability to position the hand to grasp and grip objects could be beneficial to individuals using an artificial wrist. The design team determined that the prosthetic wrist should be compatible with pre-existing prosthetic hands, allow for a realistic range of motion, be constructed to have realistic dimensions, and contain a mechanism to allow the user to know the position of the wrist and return it to the neutral position. The design team considered various types of gears and linkage systems to determine which would best meet the design specifications and be most efficient. The gear allowing for the two axes of motion at the wrist was selected. The final design consisted of gears and <b>rotation</b> <b>bearings</b> within an outer tube.
