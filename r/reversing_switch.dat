50|$|One way to {{envision}} {{what is happening}} in an AC-to-DC rotary converter is to imagine a rotary <b>reversing</b> <b>switch</b> that is being driven at a speed that is synchronous with the power line.

The rotary converter is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the <b>reversing</b> <b>switch,</b> but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the rotary converter avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical.|$|E

50|$|Minic Motorways was {{a system}} of HO-scale road {{vehicles}} that followed a slot in a plastic roadway. The system aimed {{as far as possible}} for realism, and therefore the slot was as narrow as possible (about 1/8 in) with brass conductors placed vertically at each side. The vehicles picked up power via a small wheel (called a Gimbal Wheel) on their underside, which was divided into two halves by an insulating flange. At some time in the 1960s this mechanism was replaced by a pair of vertically sprung sliding pickups. These differed from that of electric racing car systems such as the same company's Scalextric, in which the electrical conductors were spaced more widely apart {{on each side of the}} guide slot, and were hence more stable.There was a small removable peg at the back of the vehicles to stabilize it when in reverse.Vehicles were controlled by a hand-held controller, which had a thumb-operated speed control plus a rotating <b>reversing</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E

40|$|Four 10 MW, highly-stabilized {{power supply}} modules have been {{installed}} at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL, to energize water-cooled, resistive, high-field research magnets. The power supply modules achieve a long term current stability if 10 ppM over a 12 h period with a short term ripple and noise variation of < 10 ppM over a time period of one cycle. The power supply modules can operate independently, feeding four separate magnets, or two, three or four modules can operate in parallel. Each power supply module consists of a 12. 5 kV vacuum circuit breaker, two three-winding, step-down transformers, a 24 -pulse rectifier with interphase reactors, and a passive and an active filter. Two different transformer tap settings allow rated dc supply output voltages of 400 and 500 V. The rated current of a supply module is 17 kA and each supply module has a one-hour overload capability of 20 kA. The isolated output terminals of each power supply module are connected to a <b>reversing</b> <b>switch.</b> An extensive high-current bus system allows the modules {{to be connected to}} 16 magnet cells. This paper presents the detailed design of the power supply components.

The effects of the modules on the electrical supply system and the operational behavior of the power factor correction/harmonic filters are described.

40|$|Before we {{talk about}} {{brushless}} motors in detail, let’s clear up a few points about terminology. The term “brushless ” has become accepted as referring to a particular variety of servo motor. Clearly a step motor is a brushless device, as is an AC induction motor (in fact, the step motor can {{form the basis of}} a brushless servo motor, often called a hybrid servo, which is discussed later). However, the socalled “brushless ” motor has been designed to have a similar performance to the DC brush servo without the limitations imposed by a mechanical commutator. Within the brushless category are two basic motor types: trapezoidal and sine wave motors. The trapezoidal motor is really a brushless DC servo, whereas the sine wave motor bears a close resemblance to the AC synchronous motor. To fully explain the difference between these motors, we must review the evolution of the brushless motor. Fig. 1. 35 Conventional DC brush motor Brushless Motor Operation To turn this motor into a brushless design, we must start by eliminating the windings on the rotor. This can be achieved by turning the motor inside out. In other words, we make the permanent magnet the rotating part and put the windings on the stator poles. We still need some means of reversing the current automatically – a cam-operated <b>reversing</b> <b>switch</b> could be made to do this job (Fig. 1. 36). Obviously such an arrangement with a mechanical switch is not very satisfactory, but the switching capability of non-contacting devices tends to be very limited. However, in a servo application, we will use an electronic amplifier or drive which {{can also be used to}} do the commutation in response to low-level signals from an optical or hall-effect sensor (see Fig. 1. 37). This component is referred to as the commutation encoder. So unlike the DC brush motor, the brushless version cannot be driven by simply connecting it to a source of direct current. The current in the external circuit must be reversed at defined rotor positions. Hence, the motor is actually being driven by an alternating current...|$|E
