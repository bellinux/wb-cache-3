This implicates efficient scavenging of hydrothermal Nd by particulates, resulting in extremely short <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> (< 1 <b>year)</b> close to the hydrothermal vents. Therefore Nd isotopic studies of ancient seawater precipitates, particularly metalliferous sediments, cannot be used to delimit the magnitude of past hydrothermal circulation without independent constraints on local scavenging rates (or <b>residence</b> <b>times)</b> relative to those of modem oceans...|$|R

By building on the original measurements through ongoing sampling, a database of over 500 soil radiocarbon measurements spanning 50 years has now been compiled. The datasets, including an 11 -point time series, allow strong focus on the robust quantification of <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> ranging from <b>years</b> to decades. We describe key aspects of the dataset, including the ability to identify critical assumptions inherent in calculating soil C <b>residence</b> <b>times.</b> The 3 most critical assumptions relate to: (1) the proportion of old C ("fraction passive"), (2) the lag time between photosynthesis and C entering the modeled pool, and (3) changes in the rates of C input (i. e., steady state). We demonstrate the ability to compare <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> in contrasting sites, such Andisols and non-Andisols, {{and the ability to}} calculate <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> across a range of soil depths. We use ¹⁴C in a two-box model to quantify soil carbon turnover parameters in deforested dairy pastures under similar climate in the Tokomaru silt loam (non-Andisol) versus the Egmont black loam (Andisol), originally sampled in 1962, 1965 and 1969, and resampled again in 2008. The ¹⁴C-based <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> of the main soil C pool in surface soil (~ 8 cm) are ~ 9 years in the Tokomaru soils compared to ~ 17 years for the Egmont soils. This difference represents nearly a doubling of soil C <b>residence</b> <b>time,</b> and roughly explains the doubling of the soil C stock. Passive soil C comprises 15 % of the soil C pool in Tokomaru soils versus 27 % in Egmont soils. A similar difference in <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> is found in a second surface soil comparison between the Bruntwood soil (Andisol) and the Te Kowhai soil (non-Andisol) with <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> of 18 and 27 years, respectively. The comparisons support evidence that C dynamics do differ in Andisols versus non-Andisols, as a result of both the mineral allophane and Al complexation. Expanding our calculations beyond surface soil, we show that thickening the calculation depth by combining horizons allows robust <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> to be calculated at a range of depths. Overall, the large and systematically collected dataset demonstrate that soil C <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> of the main soil C pool can be routinely calculated using ¹⁴C wherever samples collected 10 or more years apart in New Zealand grassland soils are available, and presumably under similar circumstances in other soils worldwide...|$|R

However, polysaccharide-derived products were also major pyrolysis products in soils, N-containing or unspecific pyrolysis products were also detected.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to model the geochemical evolution of continuously replenished and tapped steady-state magma chambers. We use a sinusoidal function to model cyclic magma supply. The temporal evolution of a reservoir is described using differential equations, in which the amount of refilling magma does not depend {{on the size of the}} chamber. These equations can be used to calculate incompatible trace element concentrations and magma quantities. We examine the geochemical consequences of episodic injections, noises and wall-rock assimilation. We also explore possible variations in crystallization rate. To show its potential, the theoretical treatment has been applied to the EPR 17 – 19 °S, a site with a strong magma budget which has been the subject of several geological/geophysical studies. The practical application requires geological parameters to be constrained, as well as the extreme values of the lava concentration range. A first step specifies the incompatible trace element composition of the replenishing melt, which corresponds in the EPR case to a magnesian liquid (MgO = 9. 5 wt%).

Spring and tributary data are useful in locating areas containing anomalous concentrations of uranium.

The Rico-Argentine Mine in southwestern Colorado consists of complex multiple-level mine workings connected to a drainage tunnel discharging AMD to passive treatment ponds that discharge to the Dolores River. The mine workings are excavated into the hillslope on either side of a tributary stream with workings passing directly under the stream channel. There is a need to define hydrologic connections between surface water, groundwater, and mine workings to understand the source of both water and contaminants in the drainage tunnel discharge. Source identification will allow targeted remediation strategies to be developed. To identify hydrologic connections we employed a combination of natural and applied tracers including isotopes, ionic tracers, and fluorescent dyes. Stable water isotopes (δ 18 O/δD) show a well-mixed hydrological system, while tritium levels in mine waters indicate a fast flow-through system with mean <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> of <b>years</b> not decades or longer.

Overall, there was no significant effect of LWD on nitrate reduction rates in surrounding streambed sediments, but higher pore water nitrate concentrations and shorter <b>residence</b> <b>times,</b> close to LWD, indicated enhanced delivery of surface water into the streambed under high flow.

In these fields, not only the (mean) <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> is of interest, but also the whole <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> distribution. Nevertheless, the simple definition just introduced can be employed to quantify the <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> of specific compounds in a mixture only under the hypothesis that no chemical reaction takes place (otherwise continuity wouldn't be satisfied) and that the compounds concentrations are uniform.|$|R

30|$|The {{focus of}} the above {{technologies}} {{is to reduce the}} <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> of oil gas and catalysts {{at the end of the}} reactor. However, for the quick separation unit, limited by its work mechanism, the gas–solid separation time is not reduced dramatically (the oil gas <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> is around 1 – 2  s). In that case, separation technology, which can realize ultrashort <b>residence</b> <b>time,</b> is required to further decrease the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> of oil gas in the post-riser system.|$|R

Models are useful tools to reveal the relationship between the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> and the water quality. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the application of models to determine the importance of the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> for the water quality. It was found that manipulation of the <b>residence</b> <b>time,</b> i. e. ecohydrology, may be a very useful environmental management tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the aid of}} {{computer}} simulations, coat-hanger die was designed for more uniform <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> distribution. Analysis of velocity distribution and flow path line indicate that stagnation areas exist in the coat-hanger die, which {{is caused by the}} geometry abrupt change between the circular section manifold and the rectangular section slot gap. The stagnation areas affect the melt <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> directly. After changing the circular section manifolds to tear-drop section manifolds, the stagnation areas decrease from 8. 21 mm 2 to 5. 40 mm 2. Compared with the melt <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> in circular section manifolds, both the maximum <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> and the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> dispersion were decreased...|$|R
