Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe believed <b>Rafter</b> to be a [...] "one-slam wonder", {{since it was}} only his second career ATP title. Up to that point, Sampras was 5-1 against <b>Rafter,</b> and defeated <b>Rafter</b> three times in fall 1997 to solidify his No. 1 ATP ranking. [...] "We're not the best of mates," [...] <b>Rafter</b> said of Sampras after 1997 Davis Cup semifinals, [...] "I wouldn't {{go out for a}} beer with him, put it that way. I don't know what the story is. There's a bit of feeling." ...|$|R

Matt Bialecki, the {{architect}} who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as the contractor.

The temporary bleachers at the north end were removed and the North Stand and lower tier of seats constructed on the prepared excavation. The North Stand roof was completed by adding <b>rafters,</b> purlins and cladding.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as ideal for lake-fishing and duck-shooting, and being {{exhibited in the}} Great Exhibition of 1851, Halkett's boat designs were not commercially successful and never entered general use outside the specialised field of Canadian exploration. Later promoted to Captain, Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the manufacture of his boat designs was abandoned. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall, and it lay forgotten on the <b>rafters</b> of a Kirkwall woodyard. It was identified and recovered many years later, and is now displayed in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second surviving example is held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.|$|E

Sampras was displeased, and stood at the baseline for several seconds, making the victorious <b>Rafter</b> wait at the net, and then refused to shake the umpire's hand. Sampras, at the time winner of 11 Grand Slams, when asked about the difference between himself and <b>Rafter,</b> said [...] "Ten grand slams", that a controversial line-call cost him the match, and that a player had to come back and win another Grand Slam title in order to be considered great. <b>Rafter</b> {{went on to win the}} Canadian Masters as well, earning the third seed at the 1998 US Open.|$|R
