5|$|In 1958, Eastwood {{was cast}} as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series <b>Rawhide,</b> the {{breakthrough}} {{in his career}} he had long been searching for. However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part. Filming began in Arizona {{in the summer of}} 1958. It took just three weeks for <b>Rawhide</b> to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961. The <b>Rawhide</b> years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough. By late 1963 <b>Rawhide</b> was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script; it was canceled {{in the middle of the}} 1965–66 television season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of Rawhides cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.|$|E
5|$|However, Smith did court Daisy Dixon, an {{aspiring}} actress and chorus girl from Chicago, in 1896. The courtship turned sour after {{he caught her}} cavorting with his jockey and notorious ladies man Tod Sloan. Dixon later married fellow gambler, Riley Grannan, who eventually died broke in <b>Rawhide,</b> Nevada in 1908. According to McGill, Smith never {{had an interest in}} another woman after Dixon's betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and {{political}} figure. After achieving {{success in the}} Western TV series <b>Rawhide,</b> he rose to international fame with {{his role as the}} Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of Spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.|$|E

5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the planks glued, and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched <b>rawhide,</b> which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{has contributed}} to over 50films over his career as actor, director, producer, and composer. He has acted in several {{television}} series, including his starring role in <b>Rawhide.</b> He started directing in 1971, and made his debut as a producer in 1982, with Firefox, {{though he had been}} functioning as uncredited producer on all of his Malpaso Company films since Hang 'Em High in 1968. Eastwood also has contributed music to his films, either through performing, writing, or composing. He has mainly starred in western, action, and drama films. According to the box office–revenue tracking website Box Office Mojo, films featuring Eastwood have grossed a total of more than $1.68billion domestically, with an average of $37million per film.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rawhide</b> is the {{development}} tree for Fedora. This is {{a copy of a}} complete Fedora distribution where new software is added and tested, before inclusion in a later stable release. As such, <b>Rawhide</b> is often more feature rich than the current stable release. In many cases, the software is made of CVS, Subversion or Git source code snapshots which are often actively developed by programmers. Although <b>Rawhide</b> is targeted at advanced users, testers, and package maintainers, it is capable of being a primary operating system. Users interested in the <b>Rawhide</b> branch often update on a daily basis and help troubleshoot problems. <b>Rawhide</b> users don't have to upgrade between different versions as it follows a rolling release update model.|$|E

25|$|Perforated antler objects {{discovered}} at Dereivka and other sites contemporary with Suvorovo {{have been identified}} as cheekpieces or ‘’psalia’’ for horse bits. This identification is no longer widely accepted, as the objects in question have not been found associated with horse bones, and could have had a variety of other functions. However, through studies of microscopic wear, it has been established that many of the bone tools at Botai were used to smooth <b>rawhide</b> thongs, and <b>rawhide</b> thongs might have been used to manufacture of <b>rawhide</b> cords and ropes, useful for horse tack. Similar bone thong-smoothers are known from many other steppe settlements, but it cannot be known how the thongs were used. The oldest artifacts clearly identified as horse tack—bits, bridles, cheekpieces, or any other kind of horse gear—are the antler disk-shaped cheekpieces associated with the invention of the chariot, at the Sintashta-Petrovka sites.|$|E

50|$|Chuckles' only {{appearance}} in the Sunbow/Marvel canon was in the 1987 animated film G.I. Joe: The Movie, {{as a member of}} G.I. Joe's <b>Rawhides</b> (along with Jinx, Law & Order, Big Lob and Tunnel Rat). While his physical appearance was kept intact, his character otherwise differed completely from his filecard description, as he had no dialogue and his occupation as an undercover specialist was never alluded to at all. Instead, Chuckles was depicted as something of a mute strongman, as he performed feats of physical strength such as barehandedly ripping a missile off a H.A.V.O.C during a training exercise with Beach Head, then hurling it at an oncoming H.I.S.S. tank with enough velocity to blow up the vehicle. He assists Jinx in jumpstarting a hotwired Tomahawk by sitting atop the helicopter and manually spinning the rotors, and later takes out three Dreadnoks with a single punch as Flint and the <b>Rawhides</b> ambush them and steal their Swampfires in order to free the Joes imprisoned in Cobra-La.|$|R
2500|$|Hawk also {{appeared}} {{briefly in the}} 1987 animated film [...] After Serpentor is freed by the Dreadnoks, General Hawk scolds Lt. Falcon for abandoning his post, which led to Serpentor escaping and the Dreadnoks' new allies injuring three G.I. Joe members in the process. General Hawk ends up condemning Lt. Falcon to quarters until the court martial, and he orders Low-Light and Scarlett to get Lt. Falcon out of his sight. At the court martial, General Hawk brings up the charges against Lt. Falcon, which involved the incidents related to Serpentor's escape, and not being present with the other <b>Rawhides</b> in Beachhead's training exercise. Duke pleads to General Hawk to not inflict a harsh punishment on Lt. Falcon. Upon discussing this with the other four generals, General Hawk decides to have Lt. Falcon reassigned to the Slaughterhouse. After Duke is wounded while protecting Lt. Falcon from Serpentor's attack, General Hawk comforts Lt. Falcon and orders him and the other <b>Rawhides</b> to stay behind, {{while the rest of}} the Joes assault Cobra-La.|$|R

50|$|The Movie follows up on {{the events}} of Season 2, {{revealing}} that Cobra Commander is actually an agent of a secret civilization known as Cobra-La led by a half-serpent humanoid named Golobulus. The same organization is also revealed {{to have had a}} hand in the creation of Serpentor, as the dream that inspired Dr. Mindbender to create him was actually a subconscious suggestion implanted into him by one of Golobulus' bugs. In addition to Cobra-La, two new sub-teams were introduced within the Joe Team, the <b>Rawhides</b> and the Renegades, both composed of characters introduced during the toyline's 1987 lineup.|$|R

50|$|Even {{today it}} is not known who was {{responsible}} for the move or the date in which it occurred. The historians register the existence of a new settlement called Couros. It is believed that the name Arraial dos Couros comes from the improvised houses which were covered with the leather of the loads of the tradesmen. The first huts were set up in the old Street of the Crioulos which has been transformed into the present-day Alves de Castro Street. Another theory is that the name could have come from the existence in the site of an artisan who made saddlebags and <b>rawhides</b> for transporting small loads such as hard molasses, salt, rice and other food items.|$|R
2500|$|Jinx's only {{appearance}} in the Sunbow canon, was in the 1987 animated film , voiced by Shuko Akune. She is established {{as a member of}} the [...] "Rawhides", a group of new Joe recruits including Big Lob, Chuckles, Law & Order and Tunnel Rat, trained by Beach Head. The film plays off her code name in a literal sense, as she is often blamed for unlucky occurrences. She is also Lt. Falcon’s love interest, and features prominently in the climax, when she hotwires a Tomahawk so the <b>Rawhides</b> can aid the Joes in combat, and later squares off against Cobra-La villainess Pythona. Jinx is depicted as fighting best when blindfolded, as she was trained in this method by the Blind Master.|$|R

[...] "As soon as it {{was settled}} the post should be {{attacked}} there was some confusion, and the guard left the wigwam. I yanked and pulled with all my might and at last the stake came out of the ground. Then I rolled {{to the back of the}} wigwam and slipped under the skins to some bushes. As soon as I was that far, I got on my feet and legged it for all I knew how. I ran along the river for about a mile, because I didn't know how to get across with my hands tied. At last I got the <b>rawhides</b> loose and slipped 'em, and then I came over at a shallow spot where I didn't have to swim but a few yards. I ran as fast as I could, for I didn't know how soon the attack would start." ...|$|R

In Roman times, this developed into the gladiatorial cestus, with metal added to the gloves to inflict greater damage. The brutality of the sport caused the boxing to be banned in AD 393.|$|E
