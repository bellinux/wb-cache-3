50|$|Altruism {{in animals}} {{describes}} {{a range of}} behaviors performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others. The costs and benefits are {{measured in terms of}} reproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it is likely to produce itself, but boosts the likelihood that other organisms are to produce offspring. There are other forms of altruism in nature other than risk-taking behavior, such as reciprocal altruism. This biological notion of altruism is not identical to the everyday human concept. For humans, an action would only be called 'altruistic' if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. Yet in the biological sense there is no such requirement. Instead, until we can communicate directly with other species, an accurate theory to describe altruistic acts between species is Biological Market Theory.Humans and other animals exchange benefits in several ways, known technically as <b>reciprocity</b> <b>mechanism.</b> No matter what the mechanism, the common thread is that benefits find their way back to the original giver.|$|E

Here, we explore what happens if network reciprocity is dovetailed with indirect reciprocity. This is motivated by the idea that a player may utilize observed information to evaluate his neighbors. Simulations based on our minimal model reveal that adding indirect reciprocity does not always increase the level of cooperation beyond the level of model without indirect reciprocity. This implies that the combination of two different <b>reciprocity</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> each enhancing cooperation if applied independently, can lead negative interference effect on cooperation.

In this system, {{a large number}} of nodes cooperate to reject the network access requests from attackers during the punishment periods. If the punishment time is so long that the cost due to the loss of network services exceeds the illegal security gains of the attack, rational nodes do not have incentive to attack, and hence our system can reduce the attacking prob-ability in the network. We develop a social norm and reputation updating process to build such an indirect <b>reciprocity</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the network. We evaluate the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) in the game, and provide the optimal action strategy and its corresponding stationary reputation distribution.

In our paper, we try instead to demonstrate that sprawl, in the golden age of development, has been intentionally pursued, through specific technical mechanisms and widely accepted policy discourses.

40|$|Abstract — Although direct {{reciprocity}} (Tit-for-Tat) contribution {{systems have}} been successful in reducing freeloading in peerto-peer overlays, it has been shown that, unless the contribution network is dense, they tend to be slow (or may even fail) to converge [1]. On the other hand, current indirect <b>reciprocity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> based on reputation systems tend to be susceptible to sybil attacks, peer slander and whitewashing. In this paper we present PledgeRoute, an accounting mechanism for peer contributions that is based on social capital. This mechanism allows peers to contribute resources to one set of peers and use this contribution to obtain services from a different set of peers, at a different time. PledgeRoute is completely decentralised, can be implemented in both structured and unstructured peer-to-peer systems, and it is resistant to the three kinds of attacks mentioned above. To achieve this, we model contribution transitivity as a routing problem in the contribution network of the peer-to-peer overlay, and we present arguments for the routing behaviour and the sybilproofness of our contribution transfer procedures on this basis. Additionally, we present mechanisms for the seeding of the contribution network, and a combination of incentive mechanisms and reciprocation policies that motivate peers to adhere to the protocol and maximise their service contributions to the overlay.

40|$|Indirect reciprocity, a key {{concept in}} {{behavioral}} experiments and evolutionary game theory, provides a mechanism that allows reciprocal altruism {{to emerge in}} a population of self-regarding individuals even when repeated interactions between pairs of actors are unlikely. Recent empirical evidence show that humans typically follow complex assessment strategies involving both reciprocity and social imitation when making cooperative decisions. However, currently, we have no systematic understanding of how imitation, a mechanism that may also generate negative effects via a process of cumulative advantage, affects cooperation when repeated interactions are unlikely or information about a recipient’s reputation is unavailable. Here we extend existing evolutionary models, which use an image score for reputation to track how individuals cooperate by contributing resources, by introducing a new imitative-trust score, which tracks whether actors have been the recipients of cooperation in the past. We show that imitative trust can co-exist with indirect <b>reciprocity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> up to a threshold and then cooperation reverses-revealing the elusive nature of cooperation. Moreover, we find that when information about a recipient’s reputation is limited, trusting the action of third parties towards her (i. e. imitating) does favor a higher collective cooperation compared to random-trusting and share-alike mechanisms. We believe these results shed {{new light on the}} factors favoring social imitation as an adaptive mechanism in populations o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Little {{progress}} has been made to date in using the GATS framework to lock-in already implemented unilateral reforms, let alone in inducing new liberalization. A number of potential explanations for this limited performance are identified and assessed. These include limited feasibility of using the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>mechanism</b> to mobilize domestic export interests; difficulties of enforcing commitments; weaknesses in domestic (complementary) regulatory capacity; uncertainty regarding the magnitude and distribution of costs and benefits of policy reforms; and a preference for bilateral or regional cooperation. All these factors play a role in reducing the ability of the GATS to be an effective instrument to internalize terms of trade externalities and to act as a credible commitment device for policy reform. Changes in negotiating and enforcement modalities could help strengthen the relevance of the GATS as an instrument of multilateral cooperation...|$|E

40|$|Non-human {{primates}} {{are marked}} by well-developed prosocial and cooperative tendencies {{as reflected in the}} way they support each other in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression. The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is {{not to be confused with}} the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i) altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic impulse, which—as in humans—may be born from empathy with the recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of cooperation (i. e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies.

40|$|In {{the early}} modern period, trade became a truly global phenomenon. The logistics, {{financial}} and organizational complexity associated with it increased in order to connect distant geographies and merchants from different backgrounds. How did these merchants prevent their partners from dishonesty in a time where formal institutions and legislation did not traverse these different worlds? This book studies the mechanisms and criteria of cooperation in early modern trading networks. It uses an interdisciplinary approach, through the case study of a Castilian long-distance merchant of the sixteenth century, Simon Ruiz, who traded {{within the limits of}} the Portuguese and Spanish overseas empires. Early Modern Trading Networks in Europe discusses the importance of <b>reciprocity</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> trust and reputation in the context of early modern business relations, using network analysis methodology, combining quantitative data with qualitative information. It considers how cooperation and prevention could simultaneously create a business relationship, and describes the mechanisms of control, policing and punishment used to avoid opportunism and deception among a group of business partners. Using bills of exchange and correspondence from Simon Ruiz’s private archive, it charts the evolution of this business network through time, debating which criteria should be included or excluded from business networks, as well as the emergence of standards. This book intends to put forward a new approach to early modern trade which focuses on individuals interacting in self-organized structures, rather than on states or empires. It shows how indirect reciprocity was much more frequent than direct reciprocity among early modern merchants and how informal norms, like ostracism or signaling, helped to prevent defection and deception in an effective way.
