40|$|Sixteen {{acres of}} corn were grown {{on the grounds}} of the Iowa Experiment Station in 1889. The {{principal}} part of it was produced from the best ears of our last year’s crop of Learning corn, and the remainder consisted of Arleus and early Mastodon corn. It was grown on a black heavy soil, which was too wet formerly in wet seasons, to produce paying crops of anything, except grass; but last year it was tile-drained thoroughly. The greater part of the field had been used for many years as a pasture and the remainder, (perhaps five acres) was a part of an old field which had been used for different kinds of crops. It was well plowed early in September, 1888. Last spring, we ran over it twice with a disc harrow and once with a <b>reversible</b> <b>harrow</b> and then plowed it about eight inches deep. Then we ran over it again with a disc harrow and a <b>reversible</b> <b>harrow</b> and also with a heavy farm roller. It was planted May 2 d and 3 d, with a two horse planter in rows three feet and eight inches apart. From two to three grains were planted in each of the hills, which were thirty inches apart in the rows; but the entire field was thinned afterwards to two stalks in each hill. The field was harrowed twice with a Thomas smoothing harrow after the com came up; when it was divided into four lots, each of which was cultivated four times afterwards and hoed once. The south lot was cultivated each time with the Tower cultivator. The lot next to it was cultivated each time with the Eagle- Claw cultivator. The next or third lot, was cultivated with the riding Pearl cultivator, and the remainder of the field each time with the Albion Spring Tooth cultivator. The work of the Tower cultivator was excellent where oat stubble had been plowed under; but where old weeds or corn stalks were near the surface of the ground, it did not work well. The work of the Eagle-Claw cultivator was better than could be done by the walking or riding plows which are used in every neighborhood; because it pulverizes the surface of the ground better and leaves it level. But the Albion 248 Spring Tooth cultivator excels all other kinds which we have used, on all kinds of ground and in every respect. When our crop of corn was husked and measured during the latter part of October, the yield of the entire field proved to be eighty bushels per acre of sound shelled corn. I find from the reports of the Secretary of the Iowa Board -of Agriculture, that the average yield of corn in Iowa for the years 1883 - 8 inclusive, was 31 and 312 / 3 bushels per acre. The highest average yield per acre for a single year, was considered remarkable, being 411 / 4 bushels. When we compare such crops with our crop, we can not help asking, why are there such differences...|$|E
40|$|Wheat was a {{profitable}} crop in Iowa until about 1870, and averaged from 20 to 30 bushels per acre. Since then, {{on account of}} deterioration ol soils, changes of climate, rust, blight and chinch bugs, the acreage and average yield have grown less steadily. Last year the average yield of wheat in the state was nine bushels per acre, and in 1881 it ran as low as six bushels. At the present time we are depending on Minnesota and Dakota for {{a large share of}} our bread, but the constant falling off in the yield and quality of the wheat in the states just named indicates, that we will have to go farther for it before long or grow it ourselves. One of our tasks at the Iowa Experiment Station will be, to produce hardier and more productive kinds of wheat than those which we have now, and determine the best methods of preparing the ground for them. Last year we sowed twelve kinds of wheat broad-cast, at the rate of 75 ft 3 ̆es per acre on undrained ground which received only ordinary preparation; but all of them proved worthless on account of rust and blight. Last summer, we broke up an old pasture to the depth of four inches after tile draining it. Last March, 2. 30 acres of this plat were thoroughly pulverized with a disc and <b>reversible</b> <b>harrow</b> and sowed broad-cast at the rate of 7 oft»s per acre with the following kinds of wheat, viz: Black Sea, Fife, White Fife, Manitoba Fife, Golden Globe and Lost Nation. The ground was then thoroughly harrowed and rolled. Immediately afterwards, I applied top-dressings of Peruvian guano, land plaster and common salt to strips running across the different kinds of wheat, leaving other strips between them not fertilized. All of the varieties grew well and promised a good crop-until most of their blossoms had fallen, when— about one-fifth of the plat, including all of the varieties, was blown down by a rain storm. A few days alter the storm, the entire piece of wheat showed much rust and more or less blight. I was unable to discover that any of the different kinds of wheat had been affected by the guano or the land plaster; but I did see clearly, that the best wheat and the cleanest straw was on the strip to which I had applied salt. As I did not consider any of the varieties sufficiently rust-proof to warrant me in sowing them again, I threshed them together in tbe field on July 30 th and the yield of the mixture per acre, proved to be 19 bushels o f more or less shriveled wheat. On {{the south end of the}} Station grounds is a plat of i TV acres, three-fifths of which is old ground and the remainder was a low, wet slough, which was thoroughly drained and broken in June, 1888. Last fall this plat was plowed to the depth of eight inches, and last March it was well pulverized with a disc and <b>reversible</b> <b>harrow,</b> when it was sowed, (broad-cast) with one bushel of Velvet Chaff Blue Stem wheat and then harrowed and rolled thoroughly. It came up well, stooled well and made a large growth; but on the lowest ground about one-fifth of the wheat was blown down when it was in blossom and remained down. A few days afterwards, I noticed that the blades of the blue-stem wheat were slightly rusted, but at no time did any appear on its stalks. On July 30 th, the wheat on this plat was threshed in the field and yielded 48...|$|E
