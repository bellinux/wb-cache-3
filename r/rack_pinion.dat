5000|$|... ==How It Works == The {{steering}} wheel {{is connected to}} the hydraulic control unit, which contains a slide valve, the control gears and linkage, and the centring piston and cam. The steering <b>rack</b> <b>pinion</b> {{is connected to the}} hydraulic control unit through an adjuster, to allow setting of the centre point of the steering. This then drives one of the control gears, the other being driven by the {{steering wheel}}. The control linkage consists of two gears coupled with rods through ball-joints. When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack. This moves the rack, which in turn moves its pinion, turning the control gears back to their centre position. Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} two {{linear drive}} systems using roller gear mechanism(RGM), {{one is the}} RRP(roller <b>rack</b> <b>pinion)</b> system that consists of a roller rack and a cam pinion, {{the other is the}} CRP(cam <b>rack</b> <b>pinion)</b> system that consists of a cam rack and a roller pinion. Through the comparison of contact forces and load-stress factors between two linear drive systems, it reveals that the RRP system is superior to the CRP system in the aspect of the bending strength, while the CRP system has higher contact fatigue resistance than that of the RRP system.

A prototype of the parking assistance system based on the proposed architecture was constructed here.

40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion.</b> In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> of steering assay is reasonable.

5000|$|A <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> is {{commonly}} found in the steering mechanism of cars or other wheeled, steered vehicles. <b>Rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> provides a less efficient mechanical advantage than other mechanisms such as recirculating ball, but less backlash and greater feedback, or steering [...] "feel".

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimum synthesis of Ackermann, <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> and centre lever steering mechanisms using Hookes and Jeeves optimization. The objective {{function of the}} optimisation comprises of steering error. The length of the steering arm has been assumed as one-fifth of the wheel track for all cases. The steering error, transmission angle and mechanical advantages of these steering mechanisms have been compared. It {{has been found that}} the <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> steering mechanism produces the least steering error. The transmission angle and mechanical advantage of the centre lever steering mechanism are most favourable. A suggestion has been made to replace the existing Ackermann steering mechanism for long wheelbase vehicles by a central outrigger type leading <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> steering mechanism.
