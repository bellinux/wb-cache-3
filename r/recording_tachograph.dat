50|$|As well as {{automatically}} receiving speed data, the <b>tachograph</b> <b>records</b> the driver's activity {{selected from}} a choice of modes. The 'drive mode' is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion, and digital tachograph heads usually default to the 'other work' mode upon coming to rest. The 'rest' and 'availability' modes can be manually selected by the driver whilst stationary.|$|R
5000|$|A {{tachograph}} system comprises a {{sender unit}} mounted {{to the vehicle}} gearbox, the tachograph head and a <b>recording</b> medium. <b>Tachograph</b> heads are of either analogue or digital types. All relevant vehicles manufactured in the EU since 1 May 2006 must be fitted with digital <b>tachograph</b> heads. The <b>recording</b> medium for analogue heads are wax coated paper discs, and for digital heads there are two recording mediums: internal memory (which can be read out with one {{of a variety of}} download devices into a so-called [...]ddd file) and digital driver cards containing a microchip with flash memory. Digital driver cards store data in a format that can later also be read out as a [...]ddd file. These files - both those read from internal memory with a download device, and those read from the driver cards - can be imported into tachograph analysis/archival software.|$|R
40|$|At {{requests}} from several insurance companies, more than 100 advisory opinions and expert conclusions on commercial vehicle driver's infringements {{in the field}} of compliance with the rules for working and resting times as well as for application of <b>recording</b> equipment (<b>tachograph)</b> in the local and international road haulage operations have been developed from 2008 to 2013. The aim of the research is to investigate the most common infringements of social provisions committed by commercial vehicle drivers involved in road transport accidents (RTA). The data included in this paper refer particularly to infringements committed by the drivers involved in driving vehicles which were registered in the Latvian registry. The paper summarizes and evaluates most common infringements of social legislation requirements for drivers involved in RTA in accordance with the Directive 2009 / 5 /EC of the European Commission and the corresponding Latvian Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 411 entered into force in 2008. Offences on drivers' allowed work and rest time periods, shortcomings at record keeping and inappropriate use of <b>recording</b> equipment (<b>tachograph)</b> by drivers of commercial vehicles are characterized in this paper based on findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies, advisory opinions and expert conclusions. The paper provides evaluation of infringements of social legislation requirements by their importance in relation to road safety, by type of recording equipment fitted to vehicles, by the quantity and type of offences committed simultaneously, as well as by other minor aspects. It was found that drivers have committed up to 10 different types of infringements at a single case. Most of the infringements discovered should be defined as very serious ones. Even in those cases when only one violation was found, in half of the cases it was defined as very serious infringement. The results of this paper will be further used in the next stage of research comparing the results obtained here with the data from regular roadside vehicle checks on the quantity and type of infringements of social legislation requirements...|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{accidents}} {{caused by}} fatigue, truckers {{have to keep}} to strict rules for drivetime and required rest periods. In the United States and Canada, these regulations are known as hours of service, and in the European Union as drivers working hours. One such regulation is the Hours of Work and Rest Periods (Road Transport) Convention, 1979. <b>Tachographs</b> <b>record</b> the times the vehicle is in motion and stopped. Some companies use two drivers per truck to ensure uninterrupted transportation; with one driver resting or sleeping in a bunk {{in the back of}} the cab while the other is driving.|$|R
25|$|Provided {{that road}} safety is not jeopardised, and to enable a driver {{to reach a}} {{suitable}} stopping place, {{a departure from the}} EU rules may be permitted to the extent necessary {{to ensure the safety of}} persons, the vehicle or its load. Drivers must note all the reasons for doing so on the back of their <b>tachograph</b> <b>record</b> sheets (if using an analogue tachograph) or on a printout or temporary sheet (if using a digital tachograph) at the latest on reaching the suitable stopping place (see relevant sections covering manual entries). Repeated and regular occurrences, however, might indicate to enforcement officers that employers were not in fact scheduling work to enable compliance with the applicable rules.|$|R
50|$|Tachographs are {{mandatory}} for vehicles allowed {{to carry a}} total weight of over 3.5 tonnes and vehicles built to carry at least 9 passengers, if the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. They are used to review the driving and rest time of drivers during reviews by traffic standards organizations or accident investigation. A driver must carry the <b>tachograph</b> <b>records</b> with him for all days of the current week and {{the last day of}} the previous week that he drove. Companies must keep the records for 1 year. In Germany, § 16 of the work time regulations lengthens this time to 2 years if the records will be used as proof of work time.|$|R

40|$|Several test runs of newly-developed oversnow vehicle (Model KD 601) {{were carried}} out on the Antarctic {{continent}} near Syowa Station {{in the autumn of}} 1966. The travelling data <b>recorded</b> by a <b>tachograph</b> and a revograph were analyzed with other supplementary records. In total, 11 days were spent for the test, covering 295 km at an average speed of 10. 1 km/h, and the vehicle consumed 343 litres of fuel at an average rate of 0. 85 km/l or 1. 17 l/km. Total running time of engine was 3822 min, which were divided into two parts; 2062 min (54 %) for parking and 1760 min (46 %) for driving. There was 12 % increase or decrease in the fuel consumption depending on the running speed, even when the load was the same and the vehicle ran on the same terrain...|$|R
50|$|The bus was {{carrying}} 45 people, primarily teenagers aged between 15 and 18 from two schools in Kőszeg; they were {{returning to their}} lodgings at the castle in Limberg {{at the end of}} the first day of a weeklong skiing holiday. At about 4.45 p.m., on a steep downward slope, the driver found himself unable to brake the bus. He collided with barriers on the left side of the road. As recounted by the tour leader, he successfully negotiated two curves, overtaking other vehicles; however, on the third curve at a point between Deutschlandsberg and Trahütten, at a speed of about 100 kph mph as <b>recorded</b> on the <b>tachograph,</b> the bus left the road, went through an embankment, and after approximately 15 m collided with the opposite slope below a farmhouse, overturned once or twice, and came to rest upside down against a tree; its fall was observed by the house's owner through the kitchen window. 18 people were killed and 32 injured, 17 seriously.|$|R
