5000|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>Pursuit</b> is an American reality {{television}} series that aired on Court TV. It {{is produced by}} Bullseye Productions, with the producer being Phil Ward. The running time <b>of</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Pursuit</b> is 30 minutes. The series slogan is [...] "The Chase Is On".|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{some have}} {{proposed}} translating the maritime <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuit</b> into a comparable right to pursue criminals over land borders. Although {{it does not}} form a settled tenet of international law, the principle has been invoked by the United States regarding Taliban militants crossing into Pakistan, by Turkey regarding its attacks on Kurdistan Workers Party bases in northern Iraq, and by Colombia regarding its raid on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia camp in Ecuador, {{which led to the}} 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis.|$|E
5000|$|UNCLOS, Article 111 states that: [...] "The {{hot pursuit}} of a foreign ship may be {{undertaken}} when the competent authorities of the coastal State {{have good reason to}} believe that the ship has violated the law and regulations of that State. Such pursuit must be commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal waters, the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea, or the contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted.....The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuit</b> ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} law principle of hot pursuit {{is analogous to}} the common law principle, but was probably conceived independently. It began to coalesce into a general custom of international relations {{during the early years of}} the 20th century, although the general principle had been advanced before in national legislation such as the British Hovering Acts. The participating states at the League of Nations Codification Conference of 1930 broadly agreed on the validity of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuit,</b> but the proposed convention on territorial waters in which it was included was never ratified. It was finally codified as Article 23 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|A {{version of}} Barry Allen aka <b>Hot</b> <b>Pursuit</b> {{appeared}} in the lead into Flashpoint. Little {{is known about the}} exact origins <b>of</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Pursuit,</b> or how he came to be. The only thing known {{is the fact that he}} is a version of Barry Allen from the future, who goes back in time to warn himself about the upcoming events <b>of</b> Flashpoint. <b>Hot</b> <b>Pursuit's</b> history is assumed to be the same as Barry Allen's up until the single point in time, where a great anomaly altered the reality of the future all together. The unknown event that made Barry Allen don the role <b>of</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Pursuit</b> is the same event he travels back in time to warn himself about, as well as the event that causes Flashpoint. With Flashpoint's widespread time-altering effects, it is possible that Barry Allen lost his connection to the Speed Force, thus needing the cosmic motorcycle <b>Hot</b> <b>Pursuit</b> is seen riding to access the Speed Force and travel back in time. This motorcycle also needs to be charged constantly with mass amounts of electricity in order for it to continue to be able to access the Speed Force, thus it is unable to naturally access the Speed Force like Barry Allen or the rest of the Flash Family.|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to destroy ISIS, {{beginning}} in August 2014, the United States, assisted {{by a handful of}} other Western and Arab countries, carried out thousands of bombing sorties and cruise missile attacks against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Iraq had consented to the airstrikes in its territory, but Syria had not, and Russia blocked the UN Security Council from authorizing force against ISIS in Syria. The United States invoked several different legal arguments to justify its airstrikes, including the right of humanitarian intervention, the right to use force in a failed state, and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuit,</b> before finally settling on self-defense. Use of force in self-defense has traditionally not been viewed as lawful against non-state actors in a third state unless they are under the effective control of that state but the United States argued that {{in the aftermath of the}} 9 / 11 attacks by al Qaeda, such force can be justified where a government is unable or unwilling to suppress the threat posed by non-state actors operating within its borders. This view was not, however, initially accepted by Russia, China, or even the United Kingdom. But that changed in the aftermath of ISIS attacks against a Russian jetliner and a Paris stadium and concert hall in 2015, leading to the unanimous adoption of a UN Security Council resolution calling on States to use all necessary measures to fight ISIS in Syria without offering a legal basis for military action. This article examines the evolution of the right to use force in self-defense against non-state actors and makes the case that events in 2015 triggered a “Grotian Moment”: a fundamental paradigm shift that will have broad implications for international law...|$|E

40|$|The Arctic Sunrise {{arbitration}} {{highlighted the}} difficulties inherent in balancing the competing <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> coastal States and flag States in the {{exclusive economic zone}} and over the continental shelf. In a comprehensive decision, the Tribunal canvassed the area of law and provided much needed guidance on the enforcement <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> coastal States within these maritime zones. However, this paper argues that the Tribunal’s recognition <b>of</b> enforcement <b>rights</b> places significant limitations on a coastal State’s ability to protect its sovereign rights in the exclusive economic zone and over the continental shelf. First, this paper addresses the Tribunal’s pragmatic interpretation of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuit,</b> confirming that such an interpretation is consistent with academic commentary and State practice. The second part of this paper looks more critically at the Tribunal’s decision, concluding that the Tribunal’s recognition enforcement rights over the non-living resources in the continental shelf may be too harsh on coastal States...|$|R

50|$|These {{operations}} involved both {{special forces}} and infantry. Special forces were mostly reconnaissance patrols {{crossing the border}} from the Malaysian state of Sarawak or Sabah into Indonesian Kalimantan {{in order to find}} and monitor Indonesian forces who might attack Sarawak or Sabah. Conventional forces were tasked to act on this information and that from other sources to ambush or otherwise attack the Indonesians under a policy of 'aggressive defence'. Such operations were to be 'deniable' as they may have represented a violation of state sovereignty, however they were justified at the time as an instance <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuit.</b> Operation Claret was largely successful in gaining the initiative for the British Commonwealth forces, inflicting significant casualties on the Indonesians and keeping them on the defensive, before being suspended late in the war.|$|R

50|$|Application of this {{principle}} {{to the facts}} of the present case is relatively straightforward. The petitioner was arrested in the privacy of his own bedroom for a noncriminal, traffic offense. The State attempts to justify the arrest by relying on the hot-pursuit doctrine, on the threat to public safety, and on the need to preserve evidence of the petitioner's blood alcohol level. On the facts of this case, however, the claim <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pursuit</b> is unconvincing, because there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of the petitioner from the scene of a crime. Moreover, because the petitioner had already arrived home, and had abandoned his car {{at the scene of the}} accident, there was little remaining threat to the public safety. Hence, the only potential emergency claimed by the State was the need to ascertain the petitioner's blood alcohol level.|$|R

With no other choice, Glinn orders the ship to proceed south towards the Ice Limit, the border of Antarctic waters, where icebergs and even ice islands are common.|$|R
