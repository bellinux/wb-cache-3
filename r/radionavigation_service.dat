40|$|The Galileo E 5 a/E 5 b {{signals and}} the Global Positioning System (GPS) L 5 signal lie within the {{aeronautical}} <b>radionavigation</b> <b>services</b> (ARNS) band. They suffer interference from the {{services in this}} frequency band, in particular, pulsed signals from distance measuring equipment (DME) and tactical air navigation (TACAN) systems. To maintain system accuracy and integrity, interference mitigation is beneficial and necessary. We first present the real DME/TACAN environment at Stanford, CA as an example to illustrate the need for mitigating DME/TACAN interference. We then propose a time and frequency joint mitigation algorithm—Hybrid Blanking and its simplified version, frequency domain adaptive filtering (FDAF) for hardware implementation. Finally, a flight measurements campaign was performed over a European DME/TACAN hotspot near Frankfurt, Germany, to record a worst-case DME interference environment.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{starts with}} a brief {{discussion}} of the Galileo project status and {{with a description of}} the present Galileo architecture (space segment, ground segment, user segment). It focuses on explaining special features compared to the American GPS system. The presentation of the user segment comprises a discussion of the actual Galileo signal structure. The Galileo carrier frequency, modulation scheme and data rate of all 10 navigation signals are described as well as parameters of the search and rescue service. The navigation signals are used to realize three types of open services, the safety of life service, two types of commercial services and the public regulated service. The signal performance in terms of the pseudorange code error due to thermal noise and multipath is discussed as well as interference to and from other <b>radionavigation</b> <b>services</b> broadcasting in the E 5 and E 6 frequency band. The interoperability and compatibility of Galileo and GPS is realized by a properly chosen signal structures in E 5 a/L 5 and E 2 -L 1 -E 1 and compatible geodetic and time reference frames. Some new results on reciprocal GPS/Galileo signal degradation due to signal overlay are presented as well as basic requirements on the Galileo code sequences...|$|R

These low power devices, called Pseudolites (Pseudo-Satellites), will transmit signals equivalent to those which are transmitted by the in-orbit satellites. However, from the regulatory point of view they are not providing <b>Radionavigation</b> Satellite <b>Service</b> (RNSS) as defined in International Tele communication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations but "something else".

40|$|The European {{initiative}} for {{the provision of}} <b>Radionavigation</b> Satellite <b>Services</b> (RNSS) – GALILEO - will comprise all segments for an independent and fully operational infrastructure under civil control. Some of the signal transmissions will share carrier frequencies and some of the available spectrum with the USGPS system. Signals on common centre frequencies have been designed for functional inter- operability, making GPS and GALILEO two systems of the next generation infrastructure for Global Navigation Satellite Services. The GALILEO system architecture comprises a space segment, the associated ground segment for performance monitoring and satellite control and, last but not least, the User segment. This paper provides a general overview of the GALILEO architecture. The individual segments of the GALILEO architecture and their internal interaction are described.

40|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{artificial}} satellites, the concept of navigating in space {{and the desire to}} understand and validate the laws of planetary and satellite motion dates back centuries. At the initiation of orbital flight in 1957, space navigation was dominated by inertial and groundbased tracking methods, underpinned by the laws of planetary motion. It was early in the 1980 s that GPS was first explored as a system useful for refining the position, velocity, and timing (PVT) of other spacecraft equipped with GPS receivers. As a result, an entirely new GPS utility was developed beyond its original purpose of providing PVT services for land, maritime, and air applications. Spacecraft both above and below the GPS constellation now receive the GPS signals, including the signals that spill over the limb of the Earth. The use of <b>radionavigation</b> satellite <b>services</b> for space navigation in High Earth Orbits is in fact a capability unique to GPS. Support to GPS space applications is being studied and planned as an important improvement to GPS. This paper discusses the formalization of PVT services in space as part of an overall GPS improvement effort. It describes the GPS Space Service Volume (SSV) and compares it to the Terrestrial Service Volume (TSV). It also discusses SSV coverage with the current GPS constellation, coverage characteristics as a function of altitude, expected power levels, and coverage figures of merit...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{knowledge}} of a ship’s position and movement {{in relation to other}} traffic participants and obstacles is a fundamental requirement for navigation and avoiding collisions and groundings. Consequently, the onboard provision of resilient position, navigation and time data (PNT) is emphasized by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) e-navigation strategy, solution S 3 “Improved reliability, resilience and integrity of bridge equipment and navigation information” and by the assigned risk control option RCO 5 “Improved reliability and resilience of onboard PNT systems”. An initial step towards resilient PNT has been realized by the maritime community with the development of the performance standards for shipborne multi-system radionavigation receiver equipment (MRR). This MRR performance standard (PS) supports the full use of data coming from current and future <b>radionavigation</b> systems and <b>services.</b> Consequently, the combined use of several global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and the additional use of space based augmentation systems (SBAS) as well as optional terrestrial radionavigation systems (e. g. eLoran or R-Mode) will be supported to increase the performance of positioning and timing. As a second step, the development of guidelines for an onboard PNT (data processing) unit has been identified as supplementary and necessary. The starting point is the onboard use of a combination of GNSS receivers and autarkic systems (e. g. radar, gyro, echosounders with bathymetric data) for a comprehensive provision of required PNT data. Redundancy in the available data enables the application of integrity monitoring functions to evaluate the current usability of safety-critical data and components. The aim of the guidelines is the specification of data processing rules towards the resilient provision of standardized PNT data and integrity information. For this purpose, a modular architecture for an onboard PNT system is introduced and scaled to the need for data input as well as the performance of data output...|$|R

The L5 band provides additional robustness in the form of interference mitigation, the band being internationally protected, redundancy with existing bands, geostationary satellite augmentation, and ground based augmentation. The added robustness of this band also benefits terrestrial applications.|$|E
40|$|<b>Radionavigation</b> Satellite <b>Service</b> (RNSS) {{systems such}} as the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) are {{primarily}} being used today in the space-to-Earth direction (i. e., from GPS satellite to Earth user) for {{a broad range of}} applications such as geological surveying; aircraft, automobile, and maritime navigation; hiking and mountain climbing; and precision farming and mining. However, these navigation systems are being used increasingly in space. Beginning with the launch of the TOPEX/Poseidon remote-sensing mission in 1992, over 90 GPS receivers have flown onboard spacecraft for such applications as real-time spacecraft navigation, three-axis attitude control, precise time synchronization, precision orbit determination, and atmospheric profiling. In addition to use onboard many science spacecraft, GPS has been used or is planned to be used onboard the shuttles, the International Space Station, the International Space Station Emergency Crew Return Vehicle, and many commercial satellite {{systems such as}} Orbcomm, Globalstar, and Teledesic. From a frequency spectrum standpoint, however, one important difference between the space and terrestrial uses of GPS is that it is being used in space with no interference protection. This is because there is no frequency allocation for the space-to-space use of GPS (i. e., from GPS satellite to user spacecraft) in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulatory table of frequency allocations. If another space-based or groundbased radio system interferes with a spaceborne GPS user, the spaceborne user presently has no recourse other than to accept the interference. Consequently, for {{the past year and a}} half, the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field and other Government agencies have been working within ITU toward obtaining a GPS space-to-space allocation at the next World Radio Conference in the year 2000 (WRC 2000). Numerous interference studies have been conducted in support of a primary space-tospace allocation in the 1215 - to 1260 -MHz and 1559 - to 1610 -MHz RNSS bands. Most of these studies and analyses were performed by Glenn and submitted as U. S. input documents to the international Working Party 8 D meetings in Geneva, Switzerland. In the structure of the ITU, Working Party 8 D is responsible for frequency spectrum issues in the RNSS and the mobile satellite service (MSS). The full texts of the studies are available from the ITU web site under Working Party 8 D contributions. Note that because spaceborne RNSS receivers operate in a receive-only mode with navigation signals already being broadcast toward the Earth, the addition of a space-tospace allocation will not result in interference with other systems. A space-based RNSS receiver, however, could experience interference from systems of other services, including intraservice interference from other RNSS systems. The interference scenarios examined in the studies can be inferred from the following frequency allocation charts. In these charts, services labeled in all capital letters (e. g., "ARNS") have primary status, whereas those labeled with sentence-style capitalization (e. g., "Amateur radio") have secondary status (i. e., a service with secondary status cannot claim interference protection from or cause harmful interference to a service with primary status). Charts showing the ITU frequency allocations in the 960 to 1350 MHZ range and the 1525 - 1660 MHZ range are discussed and presented...|$|R

This frequency range limits the exchange of information to users within line-of-sight of one another, although with satellite capabilities and adhoc protocols, it is nowadays possible to pass Link 16 data over long-haul protocols such as TCP/IP using MIL-STD 3011 (JREAP) or STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE). It uses the transmission characteristics and protocols, conventions, and fixed-length or variable length message formats defined by MIL-STD 6016, STANAG 5516 (formerly the JTIDS technical interface design plan).

40|$|International audienceWith the {{increase}} of global satellite navigation systems (GNSS) in {{a limited number of}} frequency bands, the current spectrum dedicated to satellite navigation encounters congestion. A possible path to keep modernizing the different GNSS is to find new frequency bands where a satellite <b>radionavigation</b> <b>service</b> (RNSS) could be provided. This article takes a regulatory approach to identify potential candidate bands, which are then reviewed in detail to assess their usability for a new RNSS deployment. The results of this analysis are: (1) there exist spaces in the spectrum where a RNSS allocation exists or could be added. For example, the option consisting in adding another RNSS allocation into aeronautical radio-navigation service (ARNS) bands. However, such allocation change is not planned and would require important commitment from administrations and long negotiations with the civil aviation community; (2) the use of telecommunication signals of opportunity coming from an hybrid satellite-terrestrial network of emitters. Among these solutions, some would permit to combine navigation and telecommunication services, offering a huge opportunity for mass market application...|$|E
