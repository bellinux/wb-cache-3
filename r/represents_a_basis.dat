The interfaces that connect different wavelengths are significant in HDCNs. We construct a coherent {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) frequency bridge via difference frequency conversion in a nonlinear bulk crystal for HDCNs. Using a single resonant cavity, maximum quantum conversion efficiencies from visible to infrared are 36 %, 15 %, and 7. 8 % for topological charges of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The average fidelity obtained using quantum state tomography for the down-converted infrared OAM-state of topological charge 1 is 96. 51 %.

The economic research reflects these structural changes by increasing interest in integrating services into the traditional value chain.

The need for the concept of innovation patterns in services results firstly from the different character of the innovation process in services and in manufacturing and secondly from {{the high degree of}} heterogeneity inside the service sector. The concept presented in this study summarizes recent approaches to service innovation and creates four groups of services according the types of their innovation activities.

40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} field of reasearch in computer vision is the 3 D analysis and reconstruction {{of objects and}} scenes for e. g. position determination, online object recognition or collision prevention. Known techniques thereby mainly rely on measuring devices such as laser scanners, stereo camera systems, or comparable algorithms like structure from motion. The rather new Photonic Mixing Device (PMD) technique {{is based on the}} time-of-flight principle and measures full-range distance information in real-time. Unfortunately, PMD-based devices have still limited resolution (e. g. 160 × 120 px) and provide only graylevel information. This paper describes a fast algorithmic approach to combine high resolution RGB images with low resolution PMD distance data, acquired using a binocular camera setup. The approach relies completely on fast parallel Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) ressources. Additionally, we introduce a simple but efficient method to detect insufficient color assignments, which are due to the binocular setup. The resulting combined RGBZ-data not only enhances the visual result, but also <b>represents</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> for advanced data processing in e. g. object recognition. I...|$|E
