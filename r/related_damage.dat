25|$|In {{spite of}} a series of {{environmental}} laws and regulations passed in the 1970s, authentic environmental protection in the Soviet Union did not become a major concern until General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in March 1985. Without an established regulatory agency and an environmental protection infrastructure, enforcement of existing laws was largely ignored. Only occasional and isolated references appeared on such issues as air and water pollution, soil erosion, and wasteful use of natural resources in the 1970s. There were various reasons for not implementing environmental safeguards. In cases where land and industry were state owned and managed, when air and water were polluted, the state was most often the agent of this pollution. Second, and this was true especially under Joseph Stalin's leadership, the resource base of the country was viewed as limitless and free. Third, in the Cold War rush to modernize and to develop heavy industry, concern for damage to the environment and <b>related</b> <b>damage</b> to the health of Soviet citizens would have been viewed as detrimental to progress. Fourth, advanced means of pollution control and environmental protection can be an expensive, high-technology industry, and even in the mid-1980s many of the Soviet Union's systems to control harmful emissions were inoperable or of foreign manufacture.|$|E

500|$|Strong {{winds and}} gusts were {{reported}} across the Gulf Coast {{and in the}} Gulf of Mexico. [...] A ship reported a minimum central barometric pressure of [...] {{just prior to the}} storm's intensification into a hurricane. Grand Isle, Louisiana reported sustained winds of , and winds of at least [...] were reported as far east as Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. As a result, numerous trees were uprooted and power lines were downed. One death occurred New Orleans after being electrocuted by an electric wire that had been downed by the hurricane's strong winds. The downed power lines also caused a lack of communication from areas affected, hampering relief efforts. In New Orleans, at least 2,500telephones were without service, and homes were unroofed by the strong winds. Along the coast and further inland, rainfall was concentrated primarily on the eastern half of the cyclone, with most rain occurring from September21 to the 23rd. In Robertsdale, Alabama, [...] of rain was recorded, the most associated with the hurricane. A 24–hour September rainfall record was set when [...] of rain was measured in Kelly, Louisiana. However, due to the system's rapid dissipation over land, rainfall amounts remained generally less than [...] in interior regions of Louisiana. In Texas, rainfall peaked at [...] in Beaumont. The heavy rains caused washouts and damage to railroads across Louisiana. A train running from Louisville, Kentucky to Nashville, Tennessee was left stranded after being washed out near Chef Menteur Pass, and other rail operations were stopped between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama. Tides of [...] above average were reported in Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound as the hurricane moved over the coast, while tides of [...] above average were reported in Biloxi, Mississippi. The strong storm surge caused considerable damage to Grand Isle and Manilla Village, Louisiana. Due to the hurricane's landfall near low tide, however, major storm surge impacts were mitigated. Overall infrastructural damage caused by the hurricane totaled to $750,000, while crop <b>related</b> <b>damage,</b> particularly to rice and sugar cane, totaled to $700,000.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the land}} {{subsidence}} due to different phenomena such as excessive withdrawal of groundwater resources has lead to significant damages to farmlands, residential buildings, roads and transmission lines. Inattention {{to the land}} subsidence results in the ruining of buildings which in turn causes the migration of people and imposes financial and social costs on the government. In this paper a case study is performed for Marvdasht plain and rural regions of Fars province, Iran. All affecting parameters and their <b>related</b> <b>damages</b> are considered in the study. The variation of groundwater level and the conditions of rainfall and drought processes in recent years are investigated. The effects of faults and the seismic vulnerability of the regions are also studied by seismic methods. Such factor as groundwater level drop, thickness of clay layers, variation in the thickness of layers at the hillsides and the coincidence of the direction of created cracks and fissures with direction of available faults in the studied area have been investigated as the main factors affecting the soil settlement. At {{the end of the}} research, appropriate solutions for the land subsidence prevention and consequently the reduction of the <b>related</b> <b>damages</b> are presented...|$|R

40|$|Drought is {{a natural}} hazard {{triggered}} {{by a lack of}} precipitation that can last for several months or years. Droughts can affect a wide range of socio-economic sectors while the related direct and indirect impacts are often difficult to quantify. In this context, drought damage refers to the total or partial destruction of physical assets in the affected area. The main constraint in constructing a robust relationship between the severity of drought events and <b>related</b> <b>damages</b> is the lack of sufficient quantitative impact data. In this paper we propose the use of power-law damage functions to assess the relationship between drought severity and <b>related</b> <b>damages</b> in two economic sectors, namely cereal crop production and hydropower generation, across 21 European countries. The different shapes of the resulting damage functions {{can be explained by the}} specific drought vulnerability or adaptive capacity of each sector and country. Due to the scarcity of impact data linked to extreme climate events a bootstrap resampling was performed to assess the potential uncertainties associated with the sample size. This approach helps communicating potential drought impacts and related uncertainties to end users and policy makers in support to the development of drought management plans and long-term adaptation measures.
