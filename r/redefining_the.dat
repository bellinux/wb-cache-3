Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart, {{as the band}} established international following. Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction (1992) debuted at number two, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.|$|E
5|$|This {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when botanists Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subgenus Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus <b>redefining</b> <b>the</b> subgenus Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.acanthopoda is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man premiered in the Philippines on April 30, 2002 and had {{its general}} release in the United States on May 3, 2002. It became a {{critical}} and financial success; at the time, {{it was the}} only film to reach $100 million in its first weekend, had the largest opening weekend gross of all time, and was the most successful film based on a comic book. With $821.7 million worldwide, it was 2002's third-highest-grossing film and is the 56th-highest-grossing film of all time (seventh at the time of release). The film was nominated at the 75th Academy Awards ceremony for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. The film is credited for <b>redefining</b> <b>the</b> modern superhero genre, as well as the summer blockbuster, and due to its success it was followed by two sequels, Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007).|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s {{there was a}} series of {{conflicts}} between the Soka Gakkai administration and Nichiren Shoshu. The series of speeches Ikeda gave in 1977, <b>redefining</b> <b>the</b> relationship between laity and clergy, alarmed elements of the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood and was a factor in Ikeda's resignation on April 24, 1979. Ikeda retained only an honorary title but maintained the presidency of Soka Gakkai International. It seems likely the conflict with the Nichiren priesthood was behind Ikeda's departure, and {{it has been suggested that}} the Nichiren priesthood demanded Ikeda's resignation as a way to reassert its own authority and relevance.|$|E
25|$|With {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, there arose a more diffuse arena for {{political}} studies. The rise of monotheism and, particularly for the Western tradition, Christianity, brought to light a new space for politics and political action. During the Middle Ages, the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as Augustine of Hippo's The City of God synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of Christianity, <b>redefining</b> <b>the</b> borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between Church and State were clarified and contested in this period.|$|E

These women were <b>redefining</b> <b>the</b> role of women at the University: women had been forbidden to be faculty members or examine for the university, nor were they allowed to take the M.A. diploma (they were permitted to take a B.A.). Oxford published women's examination results in a separate class-list up until 1952.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the front}} form of {{dynamics}} aims at explaining hadrons as bound states of quarks and gluons, and the binding mechanism is not describable using perturbation theory, {{the definition of}} a theory needed in this case cannot be limited to perturbative expansions. For example, it is not sufficient to construct a theory using regularization of loop integrals order-by-order and correspondingly <b>redefining</b> <b>the</b> masses, coupling constants, and field normalization constants also order-by-order. In other words, one needs to design the Minkowski space-time formulation of a relativistic theory that is not based on any a priori perturbative scheme. The front form of Hamiltonian dynamics is perceived by many researchers as the most suitable framework for this purpose among the known options.|$|E
25|$|During the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} {{renumbering}} by the New Jersey State Highway Department, the alignment of current-day Route 63 was designated as State Highway Route S-1, a spur off of New Jersey Route 1. The route {{began at the}} Hudson County West Boulevard (now Kennedy Boulevard), heading northbound to Ridgefield, where it would meet NJ 1, NJ 6, U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 9 and U.S. Route 46. Both intersections are now the termini to Route 63. Two years later, a remade legislation was performed in the New Jersey State Legislature, <b>redefining</b> <b>the</b> alignment for State Highway Route S-1, with the southern terminus changing to Hudson County Boulevard, a rename to the original southern terminus. Also, the northern terminus was then defined as being in Fort Lee.|$|E
