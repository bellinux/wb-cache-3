In a Monte Carlo study, the new estimator provides smaller bias than the classical Least Squares log-Periodogram estimator. On the other hand the variability of estimation is increased.

Extensive simulations have been performed on both regular and irregular LDPC codes. Moreover, we derive the Jacobian of the system and calculate the corresponding eigenvalues. Results show that bifurcations, including fold, flip and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations, are exhibited by the LDPC decoder.

40|$|With {{approximately}} half of incoming undergraduates obtaining a degree within four to six years since enrollment, the proposed study examined whether {{it is possible to}} increase graduation rates with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The TPB states individuals are influenced to perform a behavior based on their attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived abilities. The greater these influences and individuals’ motivation to comply with each, the more likely the behavior will be performed. Moreover, three research questions were examined: (1) Can the TPB predict undergraduates’ graduation intention? (2) Does graduation intention differ by students’ year of enrollment? (3) Can the TPB predict transfer students’ graduation intention? Results indicated that although the TPB variables predict graduation intention, students’ year of enrollment does not significantly affect their attitudes, perceived norms, perceived control and intention to graduate.

40|$|Modeling {{human skin}} {{deformation}} has many {{applications in the}} areas of computer graphics and human biomechanics. Nevertheless, most of the existing deformation approaches are too simple to be applied in biomedical applications. Although anatomy-based approach can determine the skin deformation based on the change in geometry of underlying layers, it is usually time-consuming to determine the geometrical change of each anatomical layer. This article presents a physics-based approach to model human skin deformation using boundary element method (BEM). Given the magnitude of displacement between the skin layer and the underlying skeleton at the anatomical landmarks, the approach determines the displacement of each vertices of the human skin model by using the BEM. We demonstrated our results by modeling the skin deformation of human lower limb with jumping and walking motions. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can deform the skin layer at interactive frame <b>rates.</b> <b>Department</b> of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

With the external disturbances, the fracture strains of the BMG specimens become less dependence on the strain rates, and {{it is found that}} the confinement of the propagation of shear bands is the dominant deformation mechanism. This is different from previous findings in that multiplication of the shear bands also plays a critical role in accommodating the plastic deformation of BMGs with external disturbances. The present findings not only shed more light on the deformation mechanisms of BMGs under external disturbances, but also suggest that the use of external disturbances can reduce the dependence of the plastic deformation behavior of BMGs on the strain <b>rates.</b> <b>Department</b> of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

This paper proposes a time series model to determine the occurrence and duration of drainage demand, which are greater than some predefined flow rates due to a number of appliances that discharge randomly and intermittently with variable flow rates. While the duration is resolved using the time series data for simultaneous demands, the occurrence together with the time-dependent flow rate is quantified via Monte Carlo simulation based on occupant usage patterns and appliance discharge profiles derived from appliance flushes {{at the base of the}} main vertical stack. The applicability of this model is demonstrated with example discharges from a number of water closet (WC) cisterns with reduced flush volume.
