However, this matter is still under consideration of the <b>Spectrum</b> <b>Refarming</b> Committee which works under the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC).

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of <b>radio</b> communications, <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> has been {{increasingly}} getting crowded with different kinds of applications. Different radio communications systems {{have been developed for}} various purposes and multiple actors became interested in using these systems {{at the same time and}} space. Such situation inevitably led to the point when practically entire usable <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> became occupied by different actors. To alleviate this problem, Dynamic Spectrum (Re) Allocation (DSA) has been proposed, which is a branch of frequency spectrum management that aims to improve spectrum usage efficiency and end-user experience by introducing more flexibility to spectrum usage. This thesis aims to provide additional insight into DSA applicability and effectiveness in a typical realistic cellular network, in intra-operator scenario, taking into account 2 G and 4 G radio technologies, with the aim of improving 4 G performance without adverse impact to 2 G. We use realistic dynamic system level simulations to assess DSA performance in the selected cellular network areas that can be classified as urban, suburban and rural. Our simulation results show that DSA is capable of improving 4 G throughput without adverse impact to 2 G performance in all simulated areas. Among the simulated areas, urban area benefits from DSA most, as significant throughput gains for 4 G are achieved without adverse impact to 2 G performance, while simulations show that <b>spectrum</b> <b>refarming</b> is clearly not an option for this type of area. However, throughput gains for 4 G in urban area are limited during the busy-hours. Suburban and rural areas indicate benefits from DSA too, however the difference between DSA and <b>spectrum</b> <b>refarming</b> in these areas is diminishing. Hence, with reasonable half-rate timeslot tolerance for 2 G voice calls, <b>spectrum</b> <b>refarming</b> could be an option in the simulated suburban and rural areas.

40|$|This Report has {{aimed at}} {{providing}} deeper {{insight into the}} theory and practices of <b>spectrum</b> <b>refarming.</b> As such {{it could be used}} as a guide by Administrations on <b>spectrum</b> <b>refarming</b> and <b>spectrum</b> trading bearing in mind that the implementation of <b>refarming</b> and <b>spectrum</b> trading processes remains a strictly national issue. The Report has described the technical developments of the use of radio and has indicated how radiocommunications technology and use have changed during the recent decades. Furthermore the current regulatory regime including the EU package of Directives has been described. The main theme has been the introduction of refarming and secondary trading as a part of the overall spectrum management activities. In addition to the theoretical aspects of refarming the practical instruments of <b>refarming</b> and <b>spectrum</b> trading have been investigated and the current experiences and state of the art within CEPT countries and in non-CEPT countries provides an indication in which direction this issue will develop. It is expected that refarming of frequency bands involving some sort of forced withdrawal of frequency assignments might be a process that some countries may have to employ in the future, when frequencies have to be made available for the introduction of new radiocommunication services.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{solution}} called dynamic <b>spectrum</b> <b>refarming</b> (DSR) for deploying LTE small cells using the same spectrum as existing GSM networks. The basic idea of DSR is that LTE small cells are deployed in the GSM spectrum but suppress transmission of all signals including the reference signals in some specific physical resource blocks corresponding to a portion of the GSM carriers to ensure full GSM coverage. Our study shows that the proposed solution can provide LTE mobile terminals with high speed data services when they are in the coverage of the LTE small cells while minimally affecting the service provided to GSM terminals located within the LTE small cell coverage area. Thus, the proposal allows the normal operation of the existing GSM networks even with LTE small cells deployed in that spectrum. Though the focus of this paper is about GSM <b>spectrum</b> <b>refarming,</b> an analogous approach can be applied to reuse code division multiple access (CDMA) spectrum for LTE small cells.

40|$|<b>Spectrum</b> <b>refarming</b> (SR) {{refers to}} a radio {{resource}} management technique which allows different generations of cellular networks {{to operate in the}} same <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In this paper, an underlay SR model is proposed, in which an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system <b>refarms</b> the <b>spectrum</b> of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system through intelligently exploiting the interference margin provided by the CDMA system. We investigate the mutual effect of the two systems by evaluating the asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the users, based on which the interference margin tolerable by the CDMA system is determined. By using the interference margin together with the transmit power constraints, the uplink resource allocation problem of OFDMA system is formulated and solved through dual decomposition method. Simulation results have verified our theoretical analysis, and validated the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation algorithm and its capability to protect the legacy CDMA users. The proposed SR system requires the least information flow from the CDMA system to the OFDMA system, and importantly, no upgrading of legacy CDMA system is needed; thus it can be deployed by telecom operators to maximize the spectral efficiency of their cellular networks.

40|$|Abstract — Frequency-agile {{cognitive}} radio {{is a potential}} solu-tion {{to the problem of}} inefficient use of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> in the 30 – 300 MHz (VHF) range. This is especially attractive if networks based on this technology can operate in spectrum left unused by existing users, as opposed to being allocated new <b>spectrum</b> through <b>refarming.</b> This paper presents a preliminary survey of this band in a large U. S. city, with the goal of quantifying spectral occupancy and thereby gaining some insight into the feasibility of this approach. A comparable measurement of the 25 - 90 MHz band in a rural environment is also presented, for comparison. In the urban measurement, it is found that sufficient spectrum is probably available: for example, it is estimated that approximately 80 % of the 30 – 60 MHz band is essentially free of signals to within about 7 dB of the environmental noise limit at 30 kHz spectral resolution. However, these measurements are limited in duration, spatial sampling, temporal density, and spectral resolution. Requirements for a more comprehensive measurement campaign are proposed. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{unprecedented}} growth of mobile broadband services, <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> regulation is undergoing a substantial review in the European Union (EU). The <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> presents a three-level regulatory context. At international level, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulates the allocation of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> At regional level, the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) promotes cooperation and coordination between European countries. At national level, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are responsible for assigning the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In addition, the EU has also the power to regulate the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The EU regulatory framework for <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> has only recently been set up. Therefore, an exhaustive understanding {{of the role of the}} EU in the three-level regulatory context of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> is still lacking. Against this background, the purpose of this thesis is to shed light on the implications of the EU regulatory framework for <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In other words, this thesis aims to address the following research question: how does the EU influence the three-level regulatory context of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum?</b> In order to answer this research question, three academic papers are written, each focusing on the role of the EU in one regulatory level. Paper 1 focuses on the international level. Theories of international relations are employed to assess the effectiveness of the EU in influencing international negotiations on <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> regulation. Paper 2 explores the regional level. Theories of EU integration provide the tools to understand the issue of competence distribution between EU and EU member states in the policy field of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Paper 3 deals with the national level. Theories on the regulation-innovation relation guide the assessment of a specific national regulatory regime, which has been particularly promoted by the EU. Although <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> assignment is a national responsibility, the EU may indirectly impact on the national context by providing EU member states with ideas on innovative regulatory tools. A qualitative research strategy is adopted to conduct the research work described in this thesis. In particular, this research work is characterised by an iterative inductive-deductive process between theory and empirical data, whereby purpose, theoretical framework and data collected progressively and mutually shape one another. This thesis is mainly based on secondary data, retrieved from official documents, reports, news articles, academic papers and books. Backward and forward snowballing techniques are used to systematically find relevant secondary sources of data. This thesis concludes that the EU regulatory framework influences the three regulatory levels of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> to different extents. Firstly, the EU influences the international level thanks to the presence of the European Commission (EC) in international fora. The EC has the right to attend international negotiations on <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> regulation and can oversee the actions of EU member states. Secondly, the EU impacts on the regional level by promoting harmonised availability of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> across the EU. To this objective, the EU adopts policy instruments which are legally binding for all EU member states. Furthermore, the EC cooperates with the CEPT in order to build consensus across the EU. Thirdly, the EU’s influence on the national regulatory level is confined to general regulatory principles for <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> assignment. Nevertheless, the EU can still leverage on national regulation, by encouraging EU member states to adopt specific regulatory instruments. Although interesting implications of the EU regulatory framework for <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> are ascertained in this thesis, the influence of the EU on the three-level regulatory context of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> has not been captured thoroughly. Future research in the form of a more systematic evaluation of the EU’s actorness (Bretherton & Vogler, 2006) is necessary to capture the relevance of the EU’s influence on both the international and regional regulatory levels. In addition, a detailed analysis of the issue of competence distribution between EU and EU member states is critical for better evaluating the extent to which the EU influences <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> regulation at national level...|$|R

40|$|The new {{smartphone}} era {{is challenging}} the leading position the European Union (EU) has been occupying in the mobile economy, falling behind other economies {{such as the}} United States and some countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The EU acknowledges the fragmented structure of the electronic communications market as {{being one of the}} main obstacles to LTE deployment. The EC argues that a main source of fragmentation is lack of harmonised conditions governing the use of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> across the EU. The EU member states have developed different and sometimes conflicting <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> management practices through time. A consequent drawback is the impossibility of providing wireless broadband dervices across national borders and of deploying the necessary wireless networks and radio equipment. In consequence, on 11 September 2013, the European Commission put forward a new legislative package for a 'Connected Continent: Building a Telecoms Single Market' which contains several reforms directed to create a single telecommunications market. Some of the proposed reforms would partly modify the existing regulatory system of the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum,</b> introducing harmonised conditions governing national assignment procedures. Through a document analysis and selected experts interviews the paper attempts to assess whether the EU is moving towards a strategic development of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> policy by looking at the EU initiatives on <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> since the beginning in 1987. Then the focus is narrowed down to the Connected Continent legislative proposal, to value its contribution to the harmonisation of national assignment procedures. The historical overview of the EU <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> policy shows that the EU has gradually acknowledged the negative implications of national fragmented and inconsistent <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> governing rules. The EU has become aware of the need for a long-term strategy for the planning of the use of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> for the creation and functioning of the EU internal market. However, the paper also claims that in the arduous process of harmonisation of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> use much has still to be accomplished. Furthermore the paper draws the conclusions that the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> reforms contained the Connected Continent legislative proposal are probably not the means by which the harmonisation of <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> use for the completion of the internal market can be enhanced. The EU and the EU member states have remarkably diverging and conflicting views on the content of the EC proposed reforms. The EU member states are unwilling to give up on their prerogatives on the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> by accepting too intrusive harmonised measures...|$|R
50|$|The core {{focus of}} the Spectrum Policy Task Force is to ensure the {{efficient}} and effective use of the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> currently being used plays {{a vital role in}} a vast amount of government and commercial services. These services include radio and television broadcasts, satellite communications, wireless networks, public safety communications, weather forecasting, etc. The <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> is the section of the electromagnetic spectrum that spans from about 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz. Television broadcasts, radios, mobile phones, and military and government communication systems are best operated in the 100 MHZ to 3GHz <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The current use of the spectrum is mostly focused on the lower 1% of these frequencies. With the gradual increases in technological innovation and wireless communication, the usable part of the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> has also been greatly expanded. From here on, there will only be gradual increases in the technology and devices that depend on the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> for their functionality. The National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) deals with <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> policies on the international level as well as federal government use of the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The allocation of the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> differs around the globe, but since electromagnetic waves travel the same way through the air, spectrum management decisions are generally coordinated internationally. The Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) primary focus is on all the nonfederal, state, and local governments’ use of the spectrum. To manage the spectrum, both the NTIA and FCC used the “command-and-control” approach; they dictated how each segment of the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> is used and who is eligible to use it. The command-and-control approach worked in the initial days of wireless communication, but {{in order to meet the}} needs of new technology innovations and modern mobile devices using wireless communication, a policy was required that was more consumer-oriented. The FCC formed a task force—the Spectrum Policy Task Force—whose primary role was to evaluate changes in the spectrum policy, ensure the efficient and effective use of the spectrum, and derive public benefit from the use of the spectrum.|$|R

In our paper, we are concerned with the use of auctions by the European Union to assign <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> licenses. Without state involvement, firms use the <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> until its value is dissipated. Thus, it is preferable for the state to assign and enforce <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> rights. Further, because of the non-competitive structure in the telecommunications market, it is also preferable for the state to assign <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> rights in such a way so as to encourage new entrants. Of the available allocation mechanisms, auctions are the most efficient in assigning rights and encouraging a competitive market. Of the available auction designs, a combinatorial auction provides several key advantages over others in encouraging efficient allocations, permitting new entrants, and allowing bidders to optimize dynamically. Drawing on evidence from the European Third Generation auction and the Federal Communications Commission auctions, we conclude that the European Union could improve social welfare by centrally allocating <b>radio</b> <b>spectrum</b> licenses using a combinatorial auction. ...|$|R
