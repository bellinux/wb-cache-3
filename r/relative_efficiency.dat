25|$|While most {{cephalopods}} {{can move}} by jet propulsion, {{this is a}} very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. The efficiency of a propellor-driven waterjet (i.e. Froude efficiency) is a more efficient model than rocket efficiency. The <b>relative</b> <b>efficiency</b> of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases; paralarvae are far more efficient than juvenile and adult individuals. Since the Paleozoic era, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity.|$|E
25|$|Reducing {{the silicon}} wafer {{thickness}} at a minimized efficiency loss represents a mainstream trend in increasing the cost-effectiveness of wafer-based solar cells. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated that, using the advanced light trapping strategy with a properly designed nano-particle architecture, the wafer thickness can be dramatically reduced to only around 1/10 {{of the current}} thickness (180µm) without any solar cell efficiency loss at 18.2%. Nano-particle integrated ultra-thin solar cells with only 3% of the current wafer thickness can potentially achieve 15.3% efficiency combining the absorption enhancement {{with the benefit of}} thinner wafer induced open circuit voltage increase. This represents a 97% material saving with only 15% <b>relative</b> <b>efficiency</b> loss. These results demonstrate the feasibility and prospect of achieving high-efficiency ultra-thin silicon wafer cells with plasmonic light trapping.|$|E

The results of this work are in agreement with those of Volpe and Cordes at low pressures and with those of Casaletto at high pressures.

40|$|Depth {{functions}} {{are increasingly being}} used in building nonparametric outlier detectors and in constructing useful nonparametric statistics such as depth-weighted L-statistics. Robustness of a depth function is an essential property for such applications. Here, robustness of three key depth functions, the spatial, simplicial, and generalized Tukey, is explored via the influence function (IF) approach. For all three depths, the IFs are derived and found to be bounded, an important robustness property, and are applied to evaluate two other robustness features, gross error sensitivity and local shift sensitivity. These IFs are also used as components of the IFs of associated depth-weighted L-statistics, for which through a standard approach consistency and asymptotic normality are then derived. In turn, the asymptotic normality is applied to obtain asymptotic <b>relative</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> For spatial depth, two forms of weight function suggested in the recent literature are considered and asymptotic <b>relative</b> <b>efficiencies</b> {{in comparison with the}} mean obtained. For all three depths and one of these weight functions, finite sample <b>relative</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are obtained by simulation under normal, contaminated normal, and heavy-tailed t distributions.
