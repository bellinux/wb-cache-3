5|$|Ballistics is {{a futuristic}} racing {{computer}} game developed by Grin {{and published by}} Xicat Interactive in 2001. Grin developed an arcade version of the game, released in 2002 featuring a unique <b>reclined</b> seating position cabinet by Triotech. Players race across seven different tracks in various leagues against other competitors on high-speed hoverbikes.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often {{with a view of}} the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, <b>reclined,</b> and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique <b>reclined</b> seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player a more comfortable and immersive experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his feet up on the desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E

5|$|Firehawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. There are six cars with four seats in each row {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only two have been used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders <b>reclined</b> on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an upright position prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed to occur in the station due to problems that arose during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red. Previously at Geauga Lake, the X-Flight logo was colored lime green and dark blue.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is <b>reclined</b> at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was <b>reclined</b> and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E

5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have <b>reclined</b> on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E

25|$|A {{recliner}} is a reclining armchair. It has {{a backrest}} {{that can be}} tilted back, causing a footrest to extend from the front. Edward Knabusch and Edwin Shoemaker invented the first recliner in Monroe, Michigan in 1928 when they modified a wooden porch chair so that the seat moved forward as the back <b>reclined.</b> A padded model was later developed.|$|E
25|$|The Hatz Classic is a {{development}} of the Hatz CB-1. The major differences from the CB-1 are that the fuselage is more rounded, it mounts a larger engine, it uses push-pull tubes instead of control cables for the ailerons and elevators and it has aluminum ailerons. As well the seats are relocated in the fuselage and <b>reclined</b> to provide more leg room and comfort for the occupants.|$|E

25|$|Available {{only as a}} two-door hardtop, the {{interior}} came in standard gray charcoal vinyl upholstered reclining seats with a headliner embossed with small squares. The front seats <b>reclined,</b> and the newly safety mandated head restraints were upholstered in red, white, and blue stripes. The SC/Rambler included a standard 90-degree wide arc scale Sun tachometer. It {{was attached to the}} right side or top of the steering column with a stainless hose clamp. The only factory option was an AM radio.|$|E
25|$|California {{inventor}} Jack McCornack {{took the}} Fledge IIB wing and designed a tubular assembly that replaced the Fledge's hang glider seat with a <b>reclined</b> pilot seat, wheeled landing gear and engine mount for a pusher powerplant. The aircraft used a mouth-controlled throttle, as both hands were {{used on the}} tip rudder twist grips which were retained from the Fledge. The aircraft had no canard or tail and was a true flying wing. Power was supplied by a two-stroke Xenoah engine of 16 horsepower driving a 36-inch propeller. This new design, named the Pterodactyl Fledgling, was first flown in 1977. It is also referred to variously as the Pterodactyl Fledge and Pfledge.|$|E
50|$|Moore made {{a series}} of sculptures of draped human forms in the 1950s after he was {{commissioned}} to create a sculpture for the new UNESCO Headquarters building in Paris. He wanted to create a figure in an architectural context, and turned to the seated human form. His Draped <b>Reclining</b> Figure, 1952-53 was a precursor to these later draped figures. He completed the first major work in the series in 1955, with a maquette, Draped Seated Woman: Figure on Steps (LH 427), cast in a series of 10. This became the working model for the full-size sculpture that became his Draped Seated Woman 1957-58. The <b>reclining</b> figure is a dominant theme of Moore's work, with perhaps half of his sculptures in a <b>reclining</b> position. He made a similar work in a <b>reclining</b> position, Draped <b>Reclining</b> Woman 1957-58. Moore ultimately abandoned these ideas for the UNESCO commission, and his UNESCO <b>Reclining</b> Figure 1957-58 (LH 416) is a much more abstract <b>reclining</b> form in travertine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{work is a}} {{development}} of Moore's earlier stone sculptures <b>Reclining</b> Figure 1929, which was made in Brown Hornton limestone, and his <b>Reclining</b> Woman (Mountains) 1930; and his elmwood sculpture <b>Reclining</b> Figure 1935-6. It is less blocky and more rounded than the earlier works, and pierced with holes.|$|R
50|$|The Rectory has {{an early}} 18th-century facade. In 1966 the garden {{included}} two sculptures by Henry Moore: Draped <b>Reclining</b> Woman 1957-58 and <b>Reclining</b> Figure (1961-62).|$|R
