The activity of this kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16INK4a. This kinase was shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb).

Hypophosphorylates RB1 in early G1 phase. Cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenenic and antimitogenic signals.

It includes the retinoblastoma <b>protein</b> (<b>Rb)</b> and the related p 107 and p 130 proteins. The importance of the Rb pathway for homeostasis and tumor suppression is evident from the fact that inactivating mutations in Rb are frequently associated with many cancers. Retinoblastoma proteins regulate the cell cycle by controlling activity of the E 2 F family of transcription factors. The activity of <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins</b> themselves is modulated by their phosphorylation status at several Ser/Thr residues: phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) inactivates <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins</b> and positively influences the transcription of genes necessary for cell cycle progression. While the mechanisms of CDK-mediated inactivation of <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins</b> are understood in great detail, our knowledge of the process that counteracts Rb phosphorylation is still quite limited. This review focuses on the Ser/Thr phosphatases that are responsible for dephosphorylation and thus activation of <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins.</b> Two major scenarios are considered: 1) when pocket proteins are dephosphorylated during regular cell cycle progression and 2) when rapid dephosphorylation is dictated by external stress or growth inhibitory conditions, such as oxidative stress, UV radiation or other DNA-damaging stimuli, and cell differentiation factors.

[...] It is located near the genes for the tandem repeats INK4a and INK4b, which are 16 kDa (p16INK4a) and 15 kDa (p15INK4b) proteins, respectively. These INK4 proteins directly inhibit the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. There are other INK4 genes on other chromosomes, however these are not linked to cancer, and so their functions {{are not likely to}} be overlapping. An important cyclin-dependent substrate is the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which is phosphorylated in late gap 1 phase (G1 phase), allowing G1 exit. The <b>Rb</b> <b>protein</b> limits cell proliferation by blocking the activity of E2F transcription factors, which activate the transcription of genes needed for DNA replication. When Rb is phosphorylated by cyclin D and E-dependent kinases during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, Rb can not block E2F-dependent transcription, and the cell can progress to the DNA synthetic phase(S phase). Therefore, INK4a and INK4b serve as tumor suppressors by restricting proliferation though the inhibition of the CDKs responsible for Rb phosphorylation.|$|E

40|$|The {{simian virus}} 40 large T antigen {{contributes}} to neoplastic transformation, in part, by targeting the Rb family of tumor suppressors. There are three known <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins,</b> pRb, p 130, and p 107, {{all of which}} block the cell cycle by preventing the transcription of genes regulated by the E 2 F family of transcription factors. T antigen interacts directly with <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins</b> and disrupts Rb-E 2 F complexes both in vitro and in cultured cells. Consequently, T antigen is thought to inhibit transcriptional repression by the <b>Rb</b> family <b>proteins</b> by disrupting their interaction with E 2 F proteins, thus allowing E 2 F-dependent transcription and the expression of cellular genes needed for entry into S phase. This model predicts that active E 2 F-dependent transcription is required for T-antigen-induced transformation. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the status of Rb-E 2 F complexes in murine enterocytes. Previous {{studies have shown that}} T antigen drives enterocytes into S phase, resulting in intestinal hyperplasia, and that the induction of enterocyte proliferation requires T-antigen binding to <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins.</b> In this paper, we show that normal growth-arrested enterocytes contain p 130 -E 2 F 4 complexes and that T-antigen expression destroys these complexes, most likely by stimulating p 130 degradation.

Concomitantly, T-antigen-induced intestinal proliferation is reduced in mice lacking either E 2 F 2 alone or both E 2 F 2 and E 2 F 3 a, but not in mice lacking E 2 F 1.

Using a chondrocyte cell line, we found that FGF induced a rapid dephosphorylation of all three <b>proteins</b> of the <b>Rb</b> family (pRb, p 107, and p 130) and a blockade of the cells in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. This cell cycle block was reversed by inactivation of <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins</b> with viral oncoproteins such as polyoma large T (PyLT) antigen and Adenovirus E 1 A. Expression of a PyLT mutant that efficiently binds pRb, but not p 107 and p 130, allowed the cells to be growth inhibited by FGF, suggesting that pRb itself is not involved in the FGF response. To investigate more precisely the role of the individual <b>Rb</b> family <b>proteins</b> in FGF-mediated growth inhibition, we used chondrocyte micromass culture of limb bud cells isolated from mice lacking <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins</b> individually or in combination.

One of the food safety assessment {{needs to be done}} by determining allergenicity of RB proteinwhether it is potential as allergen. This research aims to translate the RB gene sequence into <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> sequence andinvestigate the potential <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> as an allergen through bioinformatic studies. This study was performed based on thealignment with available protein allergens from available database websites. The predicted <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> obtained from 2, 913 amino acids RB gene was a 971 amino acids length protein with ATG as a start codon and TAA as a stop codon. Bioinformaticsstudies of <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> were performed using www. allergenonline. com, consisted of three searches, i. e. full-length search byFASTA, 80 amino acids search by FASTA, and 8 amino acid exact matches. For full-length alignment search, there are threeallergen proteins similar with <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> sequence with the percentage identity of 50 % indicating possible cross reactivity with protein allergen...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the regulation of <b>Rb</b> <b>protein</b> expression in relation to increased differentiation and induction of apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells. In vivo, <b>Rb</b> <b>protein</b> expression was found to be down-regulated towards the top of the normal colonic crypt, coincident with the region of differentiation and apoptosis, but highly expressed in colonic carcinoma tissue. Using in vitro models to study the regulation of Rb expression in pre-malignant colonic epithelial cells, we have been able to show for the first time that <b>Rb</b> <b>protein</b> expression is transcriptionally down-regulated in differentiated pre-malignant cells (in post-confluent cultures) but not in malignant colorectal epithelial cells. Furthermore, suppression of <b>rb</b> <b>protein</b> function by the HPV-E 7 viral oncoprotein increased both spontaneous and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that Rb is able to act as a survival factor in colonic epithelial cells by suppressing apoptosis, and that over-expression of pRb in colorectal tumour cells can cause a loss of sensitivity to apoptotic signalling, resulting in aberrant cell survival and resistance to therapy. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice {{expressing the}} simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg) in enterocytes develop {{intestinal}} hyperplasia that progresses to dysplasia with age. This induction requires TAg {{action on the}} retinoblastoma (Rb) family of tumor suppressors and is independent of the p 53 pathway. In cell culture systems, the inactivation of <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins</b> requires both a J domain in TAg that interacts with hsc 70 and an LXCXE motif that directs association with <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins.</b> Together these elements are sufficient to release E 2 Fs from their association with Rb family members. We have generated transgenic mice that express a J domain mutant (D 44 N) in villus enterocytes. In contrast to wild-type TAg, the D 44 N mutant is unable to induce enterocyte proliferation. Histological and morphological examination revealed that mice expressing the J domain mutant have normal intestines without loss of growth control. Unlike mice expressing wild-type TAg, mice expressing D 44 N do not reduce the protein levels of p 130 and are also unable to dissociate p 130 -E 2 F DNA binding complexes. Furthermore, mice expressing D 44 N in a null p 130 background are still unable to develop hyperplasia. These studies demonstrate that the ectopic proliferation of enterocytes by TAg requires a functional J domain and suggest that the J domain is necessary to inactivate all three pRb family members...|$|R

The Drosophila melanogaster homologs RBF 1 and dCAP-D 3 co-localize on non-dividing polytene chromatin, suggesting {{the existence of a}} shared, non-mitotic role for these two proteins. Here, we show that the absence of RBF 1 and dCAP-D 3 alters the expression of many of the same genes in larvae and adult flies. Strikingly, most of the genes affected by the loss of RBF 1 and dCAP-D 3 are not classic cel...|$|R
40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} one of the most diffuse {{neoplastic}} pathologies in the world whose environmental and molecular causes, although deeply investigated, have not been completely clarified. Besides some well-established etiological factors, such as Helicobacter pylori and E-cadherin mutations, investigations on other possible causes gave contrasting results. <b>Rb</b> family <b>proteins</b> (including pRb/p 105, pRb 2 /p 130 and p 107) are involved in cell cycle regulation and their function and/or expression is often lost in various kinds of tumours such as lung, bladder, breast and brain cancer. The consequences of RB inactivation in tumours can be very different depending on the context and the type of cancer. Recent evidence indicates that Rb status correlates with a different therapeutic response according to the tumour type and the therapeutic agent. Studies performed on <b>Rb</b> family <b>proteins</b> in gastrointestinal tract tumours suggest that these proteins have an important role in these cancer types. However, owing to contrasting results, further investigation is required to assess whether the expression of <b>Rb</b> family <b>proteins</b> can potentially be used as a prognostic or predictive factor in gastric cancer...|$|R
40|$|The {{protein product}} of the {{retinoblastoma}} (RB) gene is thought to function in a pathway that restricts cell proliferation. Recently, transforming proteins from three different classes of DNA tumor viruses {{have been shown to}} form complexes with the <b>RB</b> <b>protein.</b> Genetic studies suggest that these interactions with the <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> are important steps in transformation by these viruses. In order to understand better the function of the RB-viral oncoprotein complexes, we have mapped the regions of the <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> that are necessary for these associations. Two non-contiguous regions of RB were found to be essential for complex formation with adenovirus E 1 A or SV 40 large T antigen. These two regions are found between amino acids 393 and 572 and 646 and 772. Interestingly, these binding sites on RB overlap with the positions of naturally occurring, inactivating mutations of the RB gene. These results strongly suggest that these viral oncoproteins are targeting a protein domain that is an important site in the normal function of the <b>RB</b> <b>protein...</b>|$|E
40|$|Retinoblastoma gene is the {{prototype}} of tumor suppressor gene which controls cell cycle at the G 1 phase. The expression of retinoblastoma gene product (<b>Rb</b> <b>protein)</b> was studied by immunohistochemical analysis of 101 cases of breast cancer over a retrospective period of 12 years. The prognostic force of expression of <b>Rb</b> <b>protein</b> was compared with established prognostic parameters (TNM-classification, lymph node status, steroid receptor status, histological grade). Monoclonal antibody (IgG 1, G 3 - 245, Biermann) in conjugation with the indirect Avidin-Biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used for immunolocalization of <b>Rb</b> <b>protein.</b> Specific immunoactivity was scored on the basic of the Remmele IRS (immunoreactive score). Each case was assessed independently by two observers. In the univariate survival analysis was first demonstrated the significant association of the patients survival time with histological staging (pTNM= 0. 0011, pT= 0. 0238, pN= 0. 0008, pM= 0. 0098) and the histological grade (p= 0. 0045). Studying {{the validity of the}} oestrogen and progesterone receptor status, only the progesterone receptor status showed a statistical significance (p= 0. 021), which is absolutely in agreement with the consent of St. Gallen 1998. There was no significant correlation between Rb gene expression and the survival. The percentage of positive cells (RbPP) showed a significant relationship to histological grade (p= 0. 0275). Correlation between <b>Rb</b> <b>protein</b> and the other clinical parameters was not found. In a following Cox multivariate analysis the established histological parameters like nodal status (p= 0. 0002), progesterone receptor status (p= 0. 0076) and tumor size (p= 0. 0110) were confirmed as independent predictor of patient outcome, unlike <b>Rb</b> <b>protein.</b> The results show that the expression of <b>Rb</b> <b>protein</b> had no prognostic value in univariate or multivariate analysis...|$|E
40|$|The subceliular {{localization}} of the retinoblastoma (<b>RB)</b> <b>protein</b> {{has been}} studied in primate cell lines by immunofluorescence staining using different monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The protein appeared as granules of heterogeneous size over the interphase nuclei. Computer assisted digital overlap analysis indicated that it was predominantly localized in euchromatic areas with low DNA density. The largest RB positive grains {{lined up on the}} heterochromatin/euchromatin boundary. During mitosis, the <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> dissociated from the condensing chromosomes. It was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm during metaphase and anaphase, and it reassociated with the decondensing chromatin during telophase. A new monoclonal antibody, designated aRB 1 C 1, was raised against a bacterial TrpE/human retinoblastoma protein. It specifically recognized the nonphosphorylated and differentially phosphorylated forms of the <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> in immunoprecipitation experiments. A collection of RB expressing cell lines gave a positive staining reaction with the antibody, whereas the RB negative Weri-RB- 27 retinoblastoma and OHS osteosarcoma cells failed to react. Wild-type RB complementary DNA was introduced into Weri-RB- 27 by retrovirus mediated gene transfer. Similar experiments were performed with the DU 145 prostatic carcinoma cell line that expresses a mutant <b>RB</b> <b>protein.</b> Reconstituted cells of both lines expressed the normal size <b>RB</b> <b>protein</b> and gave a positive immuno-fluorescence reaction with the aRB 1 C 1 and other anti-RB antibodies. The new monoclonal antibody, however, showed cell type dependent differences of the staining pattern compared to other anti-RB antibodies, suggesting differentiation dependent accessibility to its epitope...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe miR- 294 and miR- 302 microRNAs {{promote the}} {{abbreviated}} G 1 {{phase of the}} embryonic stem cell (ESC) cell cycle and suppress differentiation induced by let- 7. Here, we evaluated {{the role of the}} retinoblastoma (<b>Rb)</b> family <b>proteins</b> in these settings. Under normal growth conditions, miR- 294 promoted the rapid G 1 -S transition independent of the Rb family. In contrast, miR- 294 suppressed the further accumulation of cells in G 1 in response to nutrient deprivation and cell-cell contact in an Rb-dependent fashion. We uncovered five additional miRNAs (miR- 26 a, miR- 99 b, miR- 193, miR- 199 a- 5 p, and miR- 218) that silenced ESC self-renewal in the absence of other miRNAs, all of which were antagonized by miR- 294 and miR- 302. Four of the six differentiation-inducing miRNAs induced an Rb-dependent G 1 accumulation. However, all six still silenced self-renewal {{in the absence of the}} <b>Rb</b> <b>proteins.</b> These results show that the miR- 294 /miR- 302 family acts through Rb-dependent and -independent pathways to regulate the G 1 restriction point and the silencing of self-renewal, respectively...|$|R
40|$|RB {{family members}} are post-transductionally {{regulated}} proteins and phosphorylation at Ser/Thr residues leads to their gradual inactivation. Cyclin/cdk complexes are mainly responsible for the regulation of these pocket proteins, which is crucial for release of E 2 F factor. Despite the fact that E 2 F release is a phosphorylation-dependent process, {{it is still not}} evident how phosphorylation physically determines the shift from the active to the inactive feature of RB molecules. We would like to put forward the hypothesis that Pin 1 is involved in <b>RB</b> <b>proteins</b> phosphorylation and E 2 F release, suggesting an additional post-translational level of control on this family of molecules...|$|R
