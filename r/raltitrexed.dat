50|$|During the 1980s ICR {{scientists}} including Professors Hilary Calvert, and Ken Harrap and Ann Jackman developed <b>raltitrexed</b> (Tomudex) at the ICR, a drug {{active for}} the treatment of colon and other cancers. In 1983 research teams at the Chester Beatty Laboratory of the ICR led by Professors Chris Marshall FRS and Alan Hall FRS discovered N-RAS, one of the first human cancer transforming genes (oncogenes). Professor Alan Hall went on in 1992 to discover that the molecular mechanism for the motility behaviour of animal cells (cell to cell attachment and cell movement) is through control of cytoskeletal assembly by specific GTPase-proteins, known as Rho and Rac. The discovery is of fundamental significance in cancer research since cell motility is a key feature of cancer cell behaviour during metastasis (the spread of tumours around the human body).|$|E
40|$|<b>Raltitrexed</b> ('Tomudex') {{monotherapy}} is a conveniently administered {{alternative to}} 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), and has single-agent activity {{in a variety}} of advanced solid tumours. Although both <b>raltitrexed</b> and 5 -FU are thymidylate synthase inhibitors, <b>raltitrexed</b> has a specific mode of action and a toxicity profile distinct from 5 -FU. The mechanism of action of <b>raltitrexed</b> is also completely different from that of oxaliplatin, irinotecan and other drugs with which it has been combined. These properties, together with preclinical data, suggested that combinations of <b>raltitrexed</b> with 5 -FU, other chemotherapeutic agents, or radiotherapy could result in improved therapies for a variety of advanced solid tumours, including advanced CRC. This review outlines the appropriate management of patients treated with <b>raltitrexed,</b> whether as monotherapy or in combination, and discusses the preliminary results of combination studies with <b>raltitrexed</b> in a range of tumour types including advanced CRC, malignant mesothelioma, gastric, pancreatic, head and neck, and non-small-cell lung cancers.

40|$|Summary Since the {{publication}} of the results of phase I dose-finding studies, an extensive phase 11 and III clinical study programme has been undertaken to study the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the quinazoline folate analogue <b>raltitrexed</b> ('Tomudex'), a novel direct and specific inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. Two international phase III trials, studies 3 and 12, have compared <b>raltitrexed</b> 3 mg m- 2 with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) plus low-dose leucovorin (LV) (Mayo regimen) or high-dose LV (Machover regimen) respectively. A North American study (study 10) was originally set up to compare two <b>raltitrexed</b> dosage arms (3. 0 and 4. 0 mg m- 2) with 5 -FU and low-dose LV, but the 4. 0 mg m- 2 arm was discontinued prematurely because of excessive toxicity. Minimum follow-up times for studies 3, 10 and 12 were 15. 5, 12 and 9 months, respectively (for data other than survival), with corresponding survival follow-up times of 26, 12 and 17 months. Objective response rates were similar for <b>raltitrexed</b> and 5 -FU + LV, and palliative improvements were seen to a similar extent with both treatments in all phase III studies. Survival was statistically similar for <b>raltitrexed</b> and 5 -FU + LV in both studies 3 and 12. <b>Raltitrexed</b> was, however, associated with inferior survival to 5 -FU + low-dose LV in study 10, but there appears to be evidence that this was linked to an unconscious effect on investigator behaviour of early toxicity problems in this trial, in that patients appeared to be withdrawn from <b>raltitrexed</b> treatment without progression or protocolled toxicity. Moreover, it appeared that 5 -FU + LV patients were continued on treatment after disease progression. 5 -FU-based therapy was associated with a higher incidence of mucositis than <b>raltitrexed</b> in all studies, with the attainment of statistical significance in studies 3 and 12.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: PETACC- 1 {{assessed}} if <b>raltitrexed</b> is non-inferior to 5 -fluorouracil and leucovorin for relapse-free survival (RFS) {{and overall}} survival (OS) in adjuvant stage III colon cancer. METHODS: Non-inferiority required both HR for RFS and OS< 1. 25 at 1 -sided alpha= 0. 05.

40|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} {{an uncommon}} but serious side-effect of some fluoropyrimides. Cardiac toxicity from <b>raltitrexed</b> is rarely reported. With this background, we initiated {{this study to}} investigate the incidence of cardiac events in patients who had switched to <b>raltitrexed</b> following cardiac toxicity from fluoropyrimidines (5 -fluorouracil or capecitabine). Pharmacy records were used to identify patients receiving <b>raltitrexed</b> from January 2004 till March 2012. Medical records were then reviewed to confirm the use of <b>raltitrexed</b> after cardiac toxicity from 5 -fluorouracil or capecitabine. The primary end point was the rate of further cardiac events after commencing <b>raltitrexed.</b> Forty-two patients were identified and the majority had colorectal cancer. Prior regimens included 5 -fluorouracil ± leucovorin, capecitabine alone, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, epirubicin/cisplatin/ 5 -fluorouracil, and capecitabine/oxaliplatin. Seven patients (17 %) had bolus 5 -fluorouracil regimens, 26 patients (62 %) had infusion 5 -fluorouracil regimens, and 9 patients (21 %) had capecitabine alone or in combination. Angina {{was the most common}} cardiac toxicity from 5 -fluorouracil or capecitabine and usually occurred in the first or the second cycle. Four patients after their first cardiac event continued with the same 5 -fluorouracil or capecitabine regimen with the addition of nitrates and calcium antagonists but still had further cardiac events. After changing to <b>raltitrexed,</b> either as a single agent or a continuing combination regimen, no patients experienced further cardiac toxicity. <b>Raltitrexed</b> is associated with no significant cardiac toxicity in patients who have experienced prior cardiac toxicity from 5 -fluorouracil or capecitabine. <b>Raltitrexed,</b> alone or in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan, provides a safe option in terms of cardiac toxicity for such patients.

For the majority of patients, treatment with <b>raltitrexed</b> was well tolerated even at doses higher than that recommended or in the elderly. As with other cytotoxic agents, serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects can occur; nevertheless, adherence to simple patient guidelines should minimise the incidence of serious side-effects with raltitrexed; these include the assessment of renal function before each and every treatment, dosage adjustment in the presence of renal impairment and close monitoring with prompt treatment of toxicities, particularly diarrhoea and neutropenia...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{randomised}} trial compared three chemotherapy regimens in the first-line {{treatment of}} advanced colorectal cancer, {{in terms of}} their effect on overall and progression-free survival; other endpoints included toxicity, symptom palliation, and quality of life. METHODS: 905 patients were randomly assigned the de Gramont regimen (n= 303; folinic acid 200 mg/m(2), fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2), and infusion 600 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2, repeated every 14 days), the Lokich regimen (n= 301; protracted venous infusion of fluorouracil 300 mg/m(2) daily), or <b>raltitrexed</b> (n= 301; 3 mg/m(2) intravenously every 21 days). Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Median follow-up of survivors was 67 weeks. For the de Gramont, Lokich, and <b>raltitrexed</b> groups, respectively, median survival was 294, 302, and 266 days. The hazard ratios for overall survival were 0. 88 (95 % CI 0. 70 - 1. 12, p= 0. 17) for de Gramont versus Lokich, and 0. 99 (0. 79 - 1. 25, p= 0. 94) for de Gramont versus <b>raltitrexed.</b> An increase in treatment-related deaths was seen on <b>raltitrexed</b> (de Gramont one, Lokich two, <b>raltitrexed</b> 18) due to combined gastrointestinal and haematological toxicity. Patients' assessment of quality of life showed that <b>raltitrexed</b> was inferior to the fluorouracil-based regimens, especially in terms of palliation and functioning. INTERPRETATION: The deGramont and Lokich regimens were similar in terms of survival, quality of life, and response rates. The Lokich regimen was associated with more central line complications and hand-foot syndrome. <b>Raltitrexed</b> showed similar response rates and overall survival to the de Gramont regimen and was easier to administer, but resulted in greater toxicity and inferior quality of life...|$|E
40|$|<b>Raltitrexed</b> (Tomudex) {{is a new}} specific, mixed non-competitive {{inhibitor}} of thymidylate synthase indicated for use in {{the therapy}} of advanced colorectal cancer. Phase I and II studies defined a maximum tolerated dose of 3. 0 mg/m(2) administered as a 15 -min i. v. infusion every 3 weeks: this dose proved active in a range of malignancies, but most significantly in advanced colorectal cancer. Phase III studies in patients with advanced colorectal cancer indicate similar efficacy with <b>raltitrexed</b> monotherapy and combination therapy with 5 -fluorouracil + low or high dose leucovorin (5 -FU + LV) (Mayo or Machover regimens, respectively). Major toxicity in the various studies of <b>raltitrexed</b> included gastrointestinal effects, haematological suppression, asthenia and reversible asymptomatic increases in hepatic transaminases. However, patients receiving 5 -FU + LV experienced more severe leucopaenia and mucositis than patients receiving raltitrexed: this translated into fewer toxicity-related dosage reductions. <b>Raltitrexed</b> is therefore as effective as but better tolerated and accepted than 5 -FU + LV. Thus, <b>raltitrexed</b> offers the first alternative to 5 -FU-based therapy in advanced colorectal cancer; furthermore, the mode of action of the drug offers the potential for synergy with agents that act via other molecular mechanisms. status: publishe...|$|E

For the first five dose levels patients received irinotecan 175 – 350 mg m– 2 followed by <b>raltitrexed</b> 2. 6 mg m– 2. Level VI was irinotecan 350 mg m– 2 plus <b>raltitrexed</b> 3. 0 mg m– 2, level VII was irinotecan 400 mg m– 2 plus <b>raltitrexed</b> 2. 6 mg m– 2; 261 courses were administered. Only one patient at dose levels I–V experienced DLT. At level VI, 5 / 12 patients experienced DLT: one had grade 3 diarrhoea and lethargy, one had grade 4 diarrhoea and one had lethargy alone. Two others had lethargy caused by disease progression. There was no first-cycle neutropenia. At level VII, 3 / 6 patients experienced dose-limiting lethargy, one also had grade 3 diarrhoea. Dose intensity fell from over 90 % for both drugs at level VI to 83 % for irinotecan and 66 % for <b>raltitrexed</b> at level VII. Lethargy was therefore the DLT, and level VII the MTD.

40|$|AbstractZD 9331 is an antifolate {{drug that}} {{potently}} and specifically inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS). In contrast with TS inhibitors such as <b>raltitrexed,</b> it cannot be polyglutamated, leading to antitumour activity independent of folylpolyglutamyl synthetase (FPGS) activity. The growth inhibition IC 50 values for ZD 9331 and <b>raltitrexed</b> were determined for {{a panel of}} 18 human tumour cell lines, that included six colon and six ovarian. The colon lines largely displayed overlapping sensitivities to both drugs with {{only one of the}} six lines being drug resistant. In contrast, the ovarian cell lines displayed non-overlapping sensitivities with four being highly resistant to <b>raltitrexed</b> and only one was cross-resistant to ZD 9331. Studies were undertaken to explain these results. The colon and ovarian cell lines were characterised for TS activity, and TS and FPGS mRNA expression. TS activity correlated with sensitivity to ZD 9331 (r= 0. 50; p= 0. 097) and <b>raltitrexed</b> (r= 0. 74; p= 0. 0063). Provided the data from the highly drug-resistant cell lines (BE and 41 M) were omitted, TS mRNA expression levels also correlated with ZD 9331 (r= 0. 77; p= 0. 013) and <b>raltitrexed</b> IC 50 (r= 0. 84; p= 0. 0031). FPGS mRNA expression correlated with higher sensitivity to <b>raltitrexed</b> relative to ZD 9331 (higher ZD 9331 /raltitrexed IC 50 ratios) (r= 0. 62; p= 0. 048). Similarly, cell lines with IC 50 ratios>median expressed a 1. 8 -fold higher median level of FPGS mRNA (p= 0. 0087) compared with those with ratios≤median. The four ovarian and one colon cell line that were relatively more sensitive to ZD 9331 expressed FPGS mRNA≤median (p= 0. 061). Thus, ZD 9331 overcomes resistance to <b>raltitrexed</b> in ovarian tumour cell lines expressing low levels of FPGS. These data, and others demonstrating a lack of cross-resistance between cisplatin and ZD 9331, support the clinical evaluation of ZD 9331 in platinum-refractory ovarian cancer...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the maximal and safely dose of preoperative radiotherapy and concurrently intensified chemotherapy regimen (<b>raltitrexed</b> plus oxaliplatin) in locally advanced rectal cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with cT 3 -T 4 and/or cN≥ 1 or locally recurrent rectal cancer were sequentially assigned to 4 treatment schedules of chemoradiation: standard radiotherapy (50. 4 Gy/ 5. 5 wk) plus <b>raltitrexed</b> (cohort A), accelerated radiotherapy (55 Gy/ 5 wk) plus <b>raltitrexed</b> (cohort B), standard radiotherapy plus <b>raltitrexed</b> and oxaliplatin (cohort C), accelerated radiotherapy plus <b>raltitrexed</b> and oxaliplatin (cohort D). Patients were treated in cohorts of 6 to 12 per group. The maximal tolerated dose was exceeded {{if more than}} one-third of patients in a given cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was defined as any grade ≥ 3 toxicity according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. RESULTS: Forty-six consecutive patients were enrolled. In cohort A, 6 patients received the planned treatment with no DLT. In cohort B, 1 of 8 patients experienced a DLT. In cohort C, a DLT occurred in 2 of 6 patients and therefore, a cohort expansion was required. Three of 16 patients treated at this dose level experienced a DLT. In addition, cohort D was expanded and DLT was found in 4 of 16 patients. Therefore, the maximal tolerated dose was not exceeded at any treatment level. CONCLUSIONS: An intensified regimen of chemoradiotherapy delivering <b>raltitrexed</b> and oxaliplatin concurrently with concomitant boost radiotherapy (55 Gy/ 5 wk) can be safely administered in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. On the basis of these results, this intensified regimen could be tested in a phase II study...|$|E

Preliminary reports indicate good tolerability and acceptability of the combinations being investigated, with no dose-limiting toxicity being reported to date, and some early indications of efficacy...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the activity and toxicity of <b>raltitrexed</b> (Tomudex) {{as a single}} agent treatment in patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) in a multicentre phase II European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study. This study enrolled chemonaíve patients with histologically-confirmed measurable MPM. <b>Raltitrexed</b> was administered at the dose of 3 mg/m(2) intravenous (i. v.) bolus on an outpatient basis every 3 weeks. A maximum of eight cycles was planned in cases with an absence of progression or unacceptable toxicity. 24 patients received a total of 104 courses. 5 patients (20. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 7. 1 - 42. 2 %) had a partial response (PR), which was confirmed by an independent radiology committee. Toxicity was mild, with diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and neutropenia as the major side-effects, but not exceeding grade 3 toxicity. We conclude that <b>raltitrexed</b> has activity as a single agent {{in the treatment of}} MPM, and that further studies with this drug in MPM are warrante...|$|E
40|$|Summary <b>Raltitrexed,</b> a {{thymidylate}} synthase inhibitor, {{was given}} to 21 patients with advanced small-cell lung cancer, at a dose of 3 mg m- 2 as a 1 5 -min intravenous infusion at 21 -day intervals. All of the patients had extensive disease and 17 had received prior therapy. Patients with disease refractory to primary chemotherapy were excluded. Forty-one treatment cycles were given (median two, range one to four). The drug was well tolerated. No objective tumour response was documented. The patients had chemoresistant disease, as shown by a response in only one of ten patients {{who went on to}} receive alternative cytotoxic regimens. We conclude that <b>raltitrexed</b> given in this schedule is inactive as second line therapy for small-cell lung cancer.

40|$|Background: Age-related {{physiological}} {{changes may}} lead to an increased toxicity of chemotherapy in the elderly, thus making tumor treatment difficult in this increasing subset of patients. Objective: Since many trials claimed a favorable therapeutic index with <b>raltitrexed,</b> the aim of our preliminary study was to evaluate the anticancer activity and the toxic profile of this drug in the elderly. Methods: Thirteen elderly patients with colorectal cancer, aged 75 - 90 years, were enrolled in a monochemotherapy treatment with <b>raltitrexed.</b> Due to their advanced age, the drug was administered with a 33 % reduction of the dose. Results: One partial response, four disease stabilizations, and two disease progressions were observed in 7 patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The patients with response or disease stabilisation had a satisfactory time to progression. Four out of 6 patients treated in the adjuvant setting for Dukes' C colorectal cancer remain disease free at observation periods of 15 + to 29 + months. Toxicity was virtually absent in all patients. Conclusions: The activity of monochemotherapy with <b>raltitrexed</b> appears to be appealing, above all because it is observed {{in the absence of}} toxicity. Though recent reports suggest some concern about severe complications of treatment with <b>raltitrexed,</b> administration of reduced doses of this drug seems to be a putative therapy for those patients who, because of their age, are highly susceptible to the adverse effects of chemotherapy.

40|$|There is no {{established}} second-line {{treatment for}} advanced pancreatic cancer after gemcitabine failure. In {{view of the}} urgent need for such therapy, and since preclinical and phase I clinical data suggest an encouraging, potentially synergistic activity between <b>raltitrexed</b> and irinotecan, the present randomised phase II study was initiated. A total of 38 patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who progressed while receiving or within 6 months after discontinuation of palliative first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine, were enrolled in this study. They were randomised to 3 -weekly courses of <b>raltitrexed</b> 3 [*]mg[*]m− 2 on day 1 (arm A) or irinotecan 200 [*]mg[*]m− 2 on day 1 plus <b>raltitrexed</b> 3 [*]mg[*]m− 2 on day 2 (arm B). The primary study end point was objective response, secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), as well as clinical benefit response in symptomatic patients (n= 28). In the combination arm, the IRC-confirmed objective response rate was 16 % (three out of 19 patients had a partial remission; 95 % CI, 3 – 40 %), which was clearly superior to that in the comparator/control arm with <b>raltitrexed</b> alone, in which no response was obtained. Therefore, the trial was already stopped at the first stage of accrual. Also, the secondary study end points, median PFS (2. 5 vs 4. 0 months), OS (4. 3 vs 6. 5 months), and clinical benefit response (8 vs 29 %) were superior in the combination arm. The objective and subjective benefits of raltitrexed+irinotecan were not negated by severe, clinically relevant treatment-related toxicities: gastrointestinal symptoms (42 vs 68 %), partial alopecia (0 vs 42 %), and cholinergic syndrome (0 vs 21 %) were more commonly noted in arm B; however, grade 3 adverse events occurred in only three patients in both treatment groups. Our data indicate that combined raltitrexed+irinotecan seems to be an effective salvage regimen in patients with gemcitabine-pretreated pancreatic cancer. The superior response activity, PFS and OS (when compared to <b>raltitrexed),</b> as well as its tolerability and ease of administration suggest that future trials with this combination are warranted...|$|E
40|$|This open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group trial {{investigated}} the pharmacokinetics of <b>raltitrexed</b> (Tomudex, formerly ZD 1694) after a single intravenous dose of 3. 0 mg m(- 2), comparing eight cancer patients with {{mild to moderate}} renal impairment (creatinine clearance 25 - 65 ml min(- 1)) with eight cancer patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 65 ml min(- 1)). The primary end points were area under the plasma <b>raltitrexed</b> concentration-time curve {{from the start of}} the infusion to the last determined concentration (AUC(0 -tldc)) and AUC to infinity (AUC(0 -infinity)); secondary end points were peak concentrations of <b>raltitrexed</b> (Cmax) and elimination half-life (t(1 / 2 gamma)). The groups were compared statistically using analysis of covariance. The AUCs were greater for patients with renal impairment than for patients with normal renal function (2452. 2 compared with 1247. 3 ng h ml(- 1) for AUC(0 -tldc) (ratio 1. 97; 95 % CI 1. 36 - 2. 84); 2961. 5 compared with 1457. 0 ng h ml(- 1) for AUC(0 -infinity) (ratio 2. 03; 1. 25 - 3. 29). These differences were statistically significant (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 008 for AUC(0 -tldc) and AUC(0 -infinity) respectively. Terminal half-life was longer for the renally impaired patients (271. 2 compared with 143. 3; P = 0. 030). There was no significant statistical difference between the groups for Cmax (652. 9 compared with 564. 7 ng ml(- 1) for patients with impaired and normal renal function respectively: ratio 1. 16; 0. 91 - 1. 46; P = 0. 204). There was a clear relationship between <b>raltitrexed</b> clearance and creatinine clearance.

40|$|Purpose: Elements in the endocytic {{process that}} are {{determinants}} {{of the activities}} of antifolates delivered by folate-receptor alpha (FRα) were explored. Methods: Antifolate growth inhibition was assessed with a 1 - or 5 -day exposure in reduced folate carrier-null HeLa cell lines that express {{a high level of}} FRα in {{the presence or absence of}} the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT). pH-dependent rates of dissociation from FRα were also determined. Results: With a 1 -day drug exposure which is relevant to the pulse clinical administration of these drugs, FRα expression enhanced <b>raltitrexed</b> activity and modestly enhanced ZD 9331 activity, but did not significantly augment the activity of pemetrexed or lomotrexol. With a 5 -day drug exposure, FRα-mediated growth inhibition was increased for <b>raltitrexed</b> and ZD 9331 and emerged for lomotrexol. While the FRα-augmented activity of lomotrexol and <b>raltitrexed</b> did not require PCFT, augmentation of ZD 9331 activity required the co-expression of PCFT with both 1 - and 5 -day exposures. In contrast, there was no augmentation of pemetrexed activity by FRα under any condition. The activities of these agents correlated with their rate of dissociation from the receptor at acidic pH: <b>raltitrexed</b> > ZD 9331 > lomotrexol > pemetrexed consistent with insufficient pemetrexed release from FRα for export from the endosomes. Conclusions: FRα is unlikely to contribute to the pharmacological activity of antifolates, such as pemetrexed, that bind tightly to, and dissociate slowly from, the receptor particularly when the exposure time is brief. While PCFT was required for FRα-mediated ZD 9931 activity, the activities of the other antifolates was independent of PCFT...|$|E
