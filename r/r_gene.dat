5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E

R genes are highly polymorphic, and many plants produce several different types of <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> products, enabling them to recognize virulence products produced by many different pathogens.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the initial}} {{definition}} of the plant resistance (<b>R)</b> <b>genes</b> by Flor (1942), many <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> have been identified. The {{vast majority of the}} known <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> is composed of proteins carrying nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeat motifs (NBS-LRR; Jones and Dangl 2006). Most <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> recognize pathogen effectors developed by pathogens to inhibit defense, although there are a few exceptions (e.g., Lee et al. 2009). Some of these effectors thus correspond to the initial definition by Flor of the avirulence gene. Depending on the presence/absence of these <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> and of the matching avirulence product, the interaction will be incompatible (plant is resistant) or compatible (plant is susceptible).|$|R

40|$|A major {{class of}} disease {{resistance}} (<b>R)</b> <b>genes</b> which encode nucleotide binding and leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins {{have been used}} in traditional breeding programs for crop protection. However, it has been difficult to functionally transfer NB-LRR-type <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> in taxonomically distinct families. Here we demonstrate that a pair of Arabidopsis (Brassicaceae) NB-LRR-type <b>R</b> <b>genes,</b> RPS 4 and RRS 1, properly function in two other Brassicaceae, Brassica rapa and Brassica napus, but also in two Solanaceae, Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The solanaceous plants transformed with RPS 4 /RRS 1 confer bacterial effector-specific immunity responses. Furthermore, RPS 4 and RRS 1, which confer resistance to a fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum in Brassicaceae, also protect against Colletotrichum orbiculare in cucumber (Cucurbitaceae). Importantly, RPS 4 /RRS 1 transgenic plants show no autoimmune phenotypes, indicating that the NB-LRR proteins are tightly regulated. The successful transfer of two <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> at the family level implies that the downstream components of <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> are highly conserved.

5000|$|The second tier, {{primarily}} {{governed by}} <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> products, is often termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI).

50|$|Studied R genes usually confer {{specificity}} {{for particular}} strains of a pathogen species (those that express the recognized effector).

Avirulence genes are now known to encode effectors. The pathogen Avr gene must have matched specificity with the <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> for that <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> to confer resistance, suggesting a receptor/ligand interaction for Avr and R genes. Alternatively, an effector can modify its host cellular target (or a molecular decoy of that target), and the <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> product (NLR protein) activates defenses when it detects the modified form of the host target or decoy.|$|E

By using five effective Xo isolates, pyramided backcross inbred lines (BIL) with {{the combination of}} xa 5, Xa 21, xa 33 (t), Xa 34 (t), and qBB 11 on an indica variety were more effective than BIL with single <b>R</b> <b>genes.</b> Among single <b>R</b> <b>genes,</b> xa 5 showed the broadest resistance followed by Xa 34 (t)[*]>[*]xa 33 (t), > Xa 21 (Korinsak 2009).

Fourteen of those genes {{are located in}} five “hotspots ” for resistance in the potato genome. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to late blight caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, to tuber rot caused by the bacterium Erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica, and to root cyst nematodes have been identified on all 12 potato chromosomes. Some QTL for resistance to different pathogens are linked to each other and/or to resistance hotspots. Based on the genetic clustering with <b>R</b> <b>genes,</b> we propose that some QTL for resistance have a molecular basis similar to single <b>R</b> <b>genes.</b> Mapping potato genes with sequence similarity to cloned <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> of other plants and other defense-related genes reveals linkage between candidate <b>genes,</b> <b>R</b> <b>genes,</b> and resistance QTL.

50|$|Plants {{have evolved}} R genes (resistance genes) whose {{products}} mediate resistance to specific virus, bacteria, oomycete, fungus, nematode or insect strains. <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> products are proteins that allow recognition of specific pathogen effectors, either through direct binding or by {{recognition of the}} effector's alteration of a host protein. Many R genes encode NB-LRR proteins (proteins with nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domains, also known as NLR proteins or STAND proteins, among other names). Most plant immune systems carry a repertoire of 100-600 different <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> homologs. Individual R genes have been demonstrated to mediate resistance to specific virus, bacteria, oomycete, fungus, nematode or insect strains. <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> products control a broad set of disease resistance responses whose induction is often sufficient to stop further pathogen growth/spread.|$|E
5000|$|The gene-for-gene {{relationship}} {{was discovered by}} the late Harold Henry Flor who was working with rust (Melampsora lini) of flax (Linum usitatissimum).

40|$|ABSTRACT Land plants possess innate {{immune systems}} that can control {{resistance}} against pathogen infection. Concep-tually, {{there are two}} branches of the plant innate immune system. One branch recognizes conserved features of microbial pathogens, while a second branch specifically detects the presence of pathogen effector proteins by plant resistance (<b>R)</b> <b>genes.</b> Innate immunity controlled by plant <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> is called effector-triggered immunity. Although <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> can recognize all classes of plant pathogens, the majority can be grouped into one large family, encoding proteins with a nucleotide binding site and C-terminal leucine rich repeat domains. Despite the importance and number of <b>R</b> <b>genes</b> present in plants, we {{are just beginning to}} decipher the signaling events required to initiate defense responses. Recent exciting discoveries have implicated dynamic nuclear trafficking of plant R proteins to achieve effector-triggered immunity. Furthermore, there are several additional lines of evidence implicating nucleo-cyctoplasmic trafficking in plant disease resistance, as mutations in nucleoporins and importins can compromise resistance signaling. Taken together, these data illustrate the importance of nuclear trafficking in the manifestation of disease resistance mediated by <b>R</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Example: AvrPto {{is a small}} triple-helix protein that, like {{several other}} effectors, is {{targeted}} to the plasma membrane by N-myristoylation. [...] AvrPto is an inhibitor of PRR kinase domains. PRRs signal plants to induce immunity when PAMPs are detected. The ability to target receptor kinases {{is required for the}} virulence function of AvrPto in plants. However, Pto is a resistant gene that can detect AvrPto and induce immunity as well. [...] AvrPto is an ancient effector that is conserved in many P. syringae strains, whereas Pto <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> is only found in a few wild tomato species. [...] This suggests recent evolution of the Pto <b>R</b> <b>gene</b> and the pressure to evolve to target AvrPto, turning a virulence effector to an avirulence effector.|$|E
50|$|Once the R protein has {{detected}} {{the presence of}} a pathogen, the plant can mount a defence against the pathogen.

50|$|<b>R</b> <b>gene</b> {{specificity}} (recognising certain Avr gene products) {{is believed}} to be conferred by the leucine rich repeats.

40|$|In most animals, taste {{has evolved}} to avoid all things bitter {{to prevent from}} eating {{something}} typically poisonous. The taste sensation is mediated by the binding of taste receptors, known as Tas 2 rs, with bitter compounds. Because plant tis-sues contain more toxins than animal tissues do, one may hypothesize that herbivores need more Tas 2 <b>r</b> <b>genes</b> than car-nivores {{to deal with the}} diverse toxins they encounter. Evolutionary geneticist Zhang and Li tested this hypothesis (Li and Zhang 2013). They identified Tas 2 <b>r</b> <b>genes</b> from the genome sequences of more than 50 vertebrate species including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes. They then constructed evolutionary trees and estimated the loss and birth of Tas 2 <b>r</b> <b>genes</b> in vertebrate evolution. Finally, they classified all species into herbivores, omnivores, or carnivores and correlated the number of Tas 2 <b>r</b> <b>genes</b> in a species with its diet. Their anal-yses supported the hypothesis, showing that herbivores gen-erally have more Tas 2 <b>r</b> <b>genes</b> than do omnivores and carnivores.
