40|$|ABSTRACT: Satellite {{rainfall}} measurements, nowadays commonly available, {{provide valuable}} {{information about the}} spatial structure of rainfall. In areas with low-density <b>rain</b> <b>gage</b> networks, or where these networks are nonexistent, satellite rainfall measurements can also provide useful estimates {{to be used as}} virtual rain gages. However, satellite and <b>rain</b> <b>gage</b> measurements are statistically different in nature and cannot be directly compared to one another. In the present paper, we develop a methodology to downscale satellite rainfall measurements to generate rain-gage-equivalent statistics. We apply the methodology to four locations along a strong rainfall gradient in the Kalahari transect, southern Africa, to validate the methodology. We show that the method allows the estimation of point rainfall statistics where only satellite measurements exist. Point rainfall statistics are key descriptors for ecohydrologic studies linking the response of vegetation to rainfall dynamics...|$|E

40|$|The {{design values}} of the areal {{precipitation}} are needed for engineer to manage vital elements of our infrastructure. The areal precipitation can be generated by different interpolation methods. The problem involves choosing the interpolation method that we should use to estimate the extreme event. This work aimed at analyzing the effects of different interpolation methods on the estimate of extreme events of daily areal precipitations at catchment scale. The extreme rainfalls were estimated using areal daily rainfall interpolated by several interpolation methods (Thiessen polygon, Inverse Distance Weighting, Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging, Kriging with an External Drift and Ordinary Cokriging). We used thirty-years-long daily time series and different density of <b>rain</b> <b>gages</b> (from 4 to 70 <b>rain</b> <b>gages).</b> Our study {{is located in the}} Ourthe and Ambleve catchment area (2908 km²) {{in the southern part of}} Belgium). Spatial interpolation with the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting algorithms outperformed considerably interpolation with the Thiessen polygon. Kriging with an External Drift and Ordinary Cokriging presented the highest Root Mean Square Error between the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting methods. Ordinary Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting were considered to be the best methods, as they provided smallest Root Mean Square Error for nearly all cases. However, it’s not really the case of extreme estimates for particular return period. The extreme daily rainfall, corresponding to return periods of 25, 50 and 100 years, were computed by fitting of a statistical model to the series of maximum annual precipitation. These estimates were conducted using HYFRAN which allows us to fit 16 different statistical models, in 2 or 3 parameters. The most known are the models of Gumbel, Gamma, Weibull, exponential, Pareto, lognormale, Pearson III and GEV. Our results showed that the behaviour of extreme daily areal rainfall in this area was best described via the Gumbel and lognormal distributions. Using 70 <b>rain</b> <b>gages,</b> little differences in extreme rainfall were observed between the interpolation methods. The estimates from these methods were in the area of 95 % confidence intervals of the estimates using the Thiessen polygon. However, when the number of <b>rain</b> <b>gages</b> diminishes, the Universal Kriging and Kriging with External drift methods produced extreme estimates outside the area of 95 % confidence intervals of the estimates using the Thiessen polygon with all available stations. The analysis described here provides a means to choose the interpolation method in view to calculate extreme events. It shows to engineers or hydrologists the need for a particular care when working in the regions of sparse data. Peer reviewe...|$|R

This dissertation describes research addressing two of the challenges: (1) accuracy of satellite rainfall data and (2) quantifying factors influencing the rainfall-runoff process in global hydrologic models.
