25|$|Cavalry {{weapons and}} armor. Among the Fulani-Hausa armies of Sokoto, both horse and rider were shielded. The horse was {{generally}} covered by quilted cotton, stuffed with kapok fiber, and its rider generally rode into battle with finely wrought chain mail, or heavy quilted armor. The chain mail armor showed similarities to Mameluke design, but the quilting combined local invention with religious inspiration. Local armorers sew tightly rolled wads of paper inscribed with Quranic verses into {{the layers of}} cotton, and kapok. Whatever their spiritual powers, they could often blunt sword cuts, but were less effective against arrows. Body armor was supplemented by <b>reinforced</b> <b>leather</b> helmets, and tough shields of elephant or hippo hide. Horse stirrups often made effective weapons in a close fought melee, disemboweling enemy mounts and wounding enemy infantry.|$|E
50|$|Characters had 12 {{different}} equipment slots (head, shoulders, {{left and}} right arms, gloves, chest, shirt, belt, pants, {{left and right}} thighs, and boots) in addition to two weapon slots, allowing for one ranged weapon, one or two melee weapons, or a shield. Armour was divided into 6 types: robe, cloth, leather, <b>reinforced</b> <b>leather,</b> chain mail, and plate.|$|E
5000|$|Cliathairi {{were the}} {{professional}} [...] "guards" [...] who formed {{the backbone of}} a Gaelic army, having chosen military service as a career. They were reasonably seasoned fighters overall, with good morale and some degree of discipline and organisation, and could fight in both offensive and defensive styles. They were generally armoured {{in a mixture of}} padded clothing and <b>reinforced</b> <b>leather,</b> and carried large round or oval embossed leather shields. Instead of javelins they had a smaller number of heavy throwing spears which have a shorter range but do much more damage. When fighting defensively they favoured long spears, and were often described as fighting in a [...] "phalanx" [...] and other words for a deep, close formation probably similar to the Pictish schiltron. In the Viking Age they also adapted the classic Germanic shield-wall.|$|E

50|$|Soon {{before the}} {{implementation}} of the sphairai, the oxys were introduced to boxing. They consisted of several thick leather bands encircling the hand, wrist, and forearm. A band of fleece was placed on the forearm to wipe away sweat. Leather braces extended up the forearm to give greater support when punching and the knuckles were <b>reinforced</b> with <b>leather</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|This was {{a concept}} vehicle commemorating 75th anniversary of BMW 328. It {{included}} {{exterior and interior}} parts made of carbon fibre <b>reinforced</b> plastic (CFRP); <b>leather,</b> matt and high-gloss black polished aluminium {{as well as the}} CFRP interior; asymmetrically designed windscreen with a recess in the middle, four wide leather straps run across the bonnet, two-part light alloy wheels with black aluminium rim and black chrome butterfly nut bearing the BMW emblem.|$|R

5000|$|According to NFPA 1971 {{and similar}} {{standards}} in other countries, all turnout clothing must have three components: an outer shell, a moisture barrier, and a thermal barrier. In between these layers are pockets of air {{referred to as}} [...] "dead zones". These layers of air, along with the three protective layers, help to further insulate the wearer from the extreme environments of fires. Usually turnout pants are outfitted with <b>reinforced</b> knees and <b>leather</b> cuffs.|$|R
50|$|In December 1915, the Assault Detachment started {{training}} men {{of other}} German {{units in the}} new assault tactics. Around this time the Assault Detachment also changed some of its equipment to better fit its new requirements. Lighter footwear was issued, and uniforms were <b>reinforced</b> with <b>leather</b> patches on knees and elbows to protect them when crawling. Special bags designed to carry grenades replaced the old belts and ammunition pouches, and the standard Gewehr 98 rifle was replaced with the lighter Karabiner 98a previously used by cavalrymen. The long and impractical épée-style Seitengewehr 98 bayonet was replaced by shorter models, and supplemented with trench knives, clubs, and other melee weapons. While continuing to train other units, the Assault Detachment also participated in many small trench raids and attacks with limited objectives.|$|R
5000|$|The trebuchet is a {{compound}} machine that {{makes use of}} the mechanical advantage of a lever to throw a projectile. They are typically large constructions (up to 100 feet meters in height or more) made primarily of wood, usually <b>reinforced</b> with metal, <b>leather,</b> rope, and other materials. They are usually immobile and must be assembled on-site, possibly making use of local lumber with only key parts brought with the army {{to the site of}} the siege or battle.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally the {{scabbard}} {{is made of}} <b>leather</b> <b>reinforced</b> {{with wood}} and fitted with mounts of silver or some other metal which may be cast or engraved with designs ranging from Scottish thistles, Celtic knotwork, or heraldic elements such as a crest. While this makes for more popular and expensive knives, the sheath is hidden from view in the stocking while the [...] is worn. The sheaths of many modern sgian-dubhs are made of plastic mounted with less expensive metal fittings.|$|R
25|$|The hand {{weapons of}} the Sudanic cavalry were the sword, lance, battle-axe and broad-bladed spear. Throwing javelins, a weapon {{used by the}} Numidian {{horsemen}} of Hannibal in antiquity, also saw service, particularly in the Senegal and Niger valleys. Quivers holding 10–20 of these weapons were used with such speed and skill {{that at least one}} 17th-century account compares them favorably to firearms. Among the Mossi, horseman wore as many clothes as possible to protect against enemy arrows. Four or five tunics, <b>reinforced</b> by <b>leather</b> and various magical or religious charms made up his armor. Horses were protected with large pieces of leather, with a large front piece of copper for the horse's head. Traditional village groups- commoners – were perennial prey for the Mossi, and they often defended themselves by strengthening village fortifications. Blacksmiths made arrows, spears and other weapons from iron mined and smelted in Mossi country. The Mossi sometimes tipped their cavalry lances with the same poison used by archers.|$|R
50|$|Typical in {{the early}} European Middle Ages were round shields with light, non-splitting wood like linden, fir, alder or poplar, usually <b>reinforced</b> with <b>leather</b> cover on one or both sides and {{occasionally}} metal rims, encircling a metal shield boss. These light shields suited a fighting style where each incoming blow is intercepted with the boss in order to deflect it.The Normans introduced the kite shield around the 10th century, which was rounded {{at the top and}} tapered at the bottom. This gave some protection to the user's legs, without adding too much to the total weight of the shield. The kite shield predominantly features enarmes, leather straps used to grip the shield tight to the arm. Used by foot and mounted troops alike, it gradually came to replace the round shield as the common choice {{until the end of the}} 12th century, when more efficient limb armour allowed the shields to grow shorter, and be entirely replaced by the 14th century.|$|R
5000|$|Francisco's suit design differs {{significantly}} {{from that of}} his grandfather's, which was more typical for the Lucha Libre traditions. His entire suit is made of a breatheable material described as [...] "similar to biker's shorts", the nose and cat-like ears of his mask being <b>reinforced</b> with synthetic <b>leather.</b> The ears of the headpiece also serve to amplify the slightest sound {{and are able to}} retain their cup-shape despite being folded or bent. Inside each one of the ears is a battery compartment that powers the mask's lenses, modified from night vision goggles. The suit was designed by Francisco and his friend Antonio Trujillo.|$|R
5000|$|Taurus wore {{a costume}} that he designed, of {{synthetic}} stretch fabric and <b>leather,</b> <b>reinforced</b> with kevlar. The costume came with an armored helmet with horns constructed {{of an unknown}} hard material, making them formidable weapons. His personal fighting style involved bull-like charges at opponents with his lowered horns. He also controls the Zodiac's [...] "Star-Blazer" [...] energy weapons invented by Darren Bentley; these included the Star-Blazer handgun which fired intense blasts of stellar energy, and the Star-Blazer cannon which was a larger, more powerful version of the handgun. Cornelius van Lunt was a normal human with no superhuman powers. He had a {{degree in business administration}} and was a skilled businessman, organizer, and strategist. He was also an amateur astrologer with extensive knowledge of astrology.|$|R
500|$|During this time, {{there were}} two popular kinds of armour: the ō-yoroi (lit. [...] "great armour") with a boxlike appearance, mainly worn by {{high-ranking}} samurai on horseback, and the lighter and more flexible dō-maru that wrapped around the body and was initially worn by lower-ranking foot soldiers. The ō-yoroi was made of leather and iron lames bound together in horizontal layers, ornamented and <b>reinforced</b> with <b>leather,</b> silk and gilt metal. It originated around the 10th century but was only commonly used starting with the Genpei War {{at the end of}} the 12th century. Being the most complete and elaborate Japanese armour, it was also worn for ceremonies. The tighter fitting dō-maru, developed in the 11th century, was generally made of a combination of leather and metal and did not include a solid breastplate or sleeves. In many cases its armour plates were replaced with scales of metal, leather or whalebone laced together with silk or leather cords. Even though it was a plainer armour compared to the ō-yoroi, upper class samurai started to adopt it around 1300, as battles began to be fought on foot favouring a more comfortable suit. Three dō-maru, fifteen ō-yoroi armours and one pair of gauntlets have been designated as National Treasures. Most of the items include a helmet and large sleeve protectors.|$|R
5000|$|Size {{and weight}} varied greatly. Lightly armored warriors relying on speed and {{surprise}} would generally carry light shields (pelte) that were either small or thin. Heavy troops might {{be equipped with}} robust shields that could cover most of the body. Many had a strap called a guige {{that allowed them to}} be slung over the user's back when not in use or on horseback. During the 14th-13th century BC, the Sards or Shardana, working as mercenaries for the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II, utilized either large or small round shields against the Hittites. The Mycenaean Greeks used two types of shields: the [...] "figure-of-eight" [...] shield and a rectangular [...] "tower" [...] shield. These shields were made primarily from a wicker frame and then <b>reinforced</b> with <b>leather.</b> Covering the body from head to foot, the figure-of-eight and tower shield offered most of the warrior's body a good deal of protection in head-to-head combat. The Ancient Greek hoplites used a round, bowl-shaped wooden shield that was reinforced with bronze and called an aspis. Another name for this type of shield is a hoplon. The hoplon shield inspired the name for hoplite soldiers. The hoplon was also the longest-lasting and most famous and influential of all of the ancient Greek shields. The Spartans used the aspis to create the Greek phalanx formation. Their shields offered protection not only for themselves but for their comrades to their left. Examples of Germanic wooden shields circa 350 BC - 500 AD survive from weapons sacrifices in Danish bogs.|$|R
5000|$|Grommets {{are used}} to <b>reinforce</b> holes in <b>leather,</b> cloth, shoes, canvas and other fabrics. They can be made of metal, rubber, or plastic, and are easily used in common projects, {{requiring}} only the grommet itself and a means of setting it with a punch, a metal rod with a [...] tip. A simple punch, often sold with the grommets, can be struck with a hammer to set the grommet. It can also be set with an electronic, pneumatic, or gas-powered machine. There are also dedicated grommet presses with punch and anvil, {{as shown in the}} picture, ranging from inexpensive to better-quality tools, which are somewhat faster to use. They {{are used to}} strengthen holes; in footwear for boot and shoe laces, in laced clothing such as corsets, and in curtains and other household items that require hanging from hooks, as when they are used in conjunction with tensioner rods for shower curtains. The grommet prevents the cord from tearing through the hole, thereby providing structural integrity. Small grommets are also called eyelets, especially when used in clothing or crafting. Eyelets may be used purely decoratively for crafting. When used in sailing and various other applications they are called cringles. Sometimes field workers may refer to them as grunyons.|$|R
