2500|$|Singer-songwriter and {{acoustic}} guitarist Dennis Fallon, bass guitarist Frank Yarnal, guitarist William Love, {{and drummer}} Ralph Jones formed the band Forty Pound Test in State College in 1999. The band {{was named after}} Jones' late uncle, an avid fisherman. When Jones left the band in 2001, the remaining members reformed as Katsu and added Eric [...] "Z" [...] Rozzi as replacement drummer. The band's new name derived from a quote in Phillip Toshio Sudo's book Zen Guitar: [...] "KATSU: A shout that emanates from the soul. Martial artists call this kind of shout katsu. Katsu is the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person who knows {{what it means to}} be alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The San Joaquin River and its {{marshes and}} {{wetlands}} provide a critical resting and breeding stop for migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway. Once, the seasonal bird {{populations in the}} San Joaquin basin were immense, especially in the now-dry Tulare Lake region: [...] "It took something different, though, to capture {{the sound of the}} blue sky as it turned dark and deafening from the wings and cries of millions of native and migratory birds – Canadian geese, mallards, swans, pelicans, cranes, teal, and curlews. How to mimic the sudden flight of flocks so immense they extinguished the sun? One of the first white men to camp along the lake could think of only one noise, the <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> freight train, that compared with the takeoff of the birds." [...] Historically, the grasslands and the fringes of the great marshes and lakes provided habitat for large grazing animals including pronghorn, mule deer and the endemic tule elk, as well as predators such as the San Joaquin kit fox; all of these species have seen dramatic population declines as their native habitat has fallen under the plow.|$|E

5000|$|Dolph {{said that}} the {{production}} team coined new words {{for some of the}} Moog textures, for instance they decided the word [...] "gwiping" [...] would describe [...] "the act <b>of</b> sweeping <b>a</b> filter with a high regeneration setting... from top to bottom." [...] Accordingly, a basic Moog organ sound which was [...] "gwiped" [...] became a [...] "gworgan".

All together, they {{are more than a}} collection. They are a choral hymn forced to question, to hold, to push on, exploring the terrible distance to an always-missed centre. Harnessing the relentless <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> army <b>of</b> looks, bones, mouths, changeable embroideries, poisons, animal indifferences and atmospheric elements, "They persevere in the bewilderment dictated by depth" is a tumultuous explosion. It arrives like a deaf murmur, from far away. Daniela Zangrando"...|$|R

40|$|Artist Statement I am {{fascinated with}} colors {{in nature and}} how it affects our moods.

In addition to the natural environment, animals are <b>an</b> integral part <b>of</b> nature that I incorporate in my work. Pets are the unspoken blessings that bring joy and laughter to my life. Pets, especially dogs, are proven to relieve stress, to brighten emotions, to contribute to healing, to be forgiving, and to be loyal. Finally, my family features prominently in my work. The best {{times in my life}} have all been <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> relationships and special moments with them...|$|R
50|$|Breeding males {{may also}} {{advertise}} honestly to warn rival males <b>of</b> their strength, <b>a</b> classic example being the red deer, where the <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rutting stag reliably signals its size. The honest advertisement benefits both sender and receiver, as neither need {{become involved in}} a costly fight to assess their relative strength. In the breeding season, frogs congregate at suitable breeding sites and call to advertise their presence, particularly at night. Females can distinguish between the fitness of males based {{on the characteristics of}} their voices. Desert toads emerge from their underground burrows in response to heavy rain. Males emerge first and when one finds a suitable ephemeral pool, its call attracts others and they all congregate there. Males may call in unison in noisy choruses, and breeding is explosive, <b>a</b> mass <b>of</b> males competing for the smaller number of females.|$|R
