Additionally Inker says that bonds have negative skew, (small probability of large losses and large probability of small gains) which makes them a dangerous investment to leverage. Proponents have countered by saying that their approach calls for reduced exposure to bonds as volatility increases and provides less skew than conventional portfolios.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{aimed to}} test the {{performance}} of <b>risk</b> parity <b>portfolios</b> against classically optimized Markowitz portfolios and conclude which technique leads to better performing portfolios in well developed, informationally efficient markets. We constructed 5 <b>risk</b> parity <b>portfolios,</b> the Inverse Volatility portfolio, the Maximum Diversification <b>portfolio,</b> the Equal <b>Risk</b> Contribution <b>portfolio,</b> the Alpha <b>Risk</b> Parity <b>portfolio</b> and the Beta <b>Risk</b> Parity <b>portfolio</b> and 2 benchmark classical portfolios, the Equally Weighted (1 /N) and the Minimum Variance portfolio to measure performance against.

50|$|In Chapter 2, {{he argues}} (Figure 2.1) that given a {{sufficiently}} {{long period of}} time, stocks are less risky than bonds, where risk {{is defined as the}} standard deviation of annual return. During 1802-2001, the worst 1-year returns for stocks and bonds were -38.6% and -21.9% respectively. However, for a holding period of 10-years, the worst performance for stocks and bonds were -4.1% and -5.4%; and for a holding period of 20 years, stocks have always been profitable. Figure 2.6 shows that the optimally lowest <b>risk</b> <b>portfolio</b> even for a one-year holding, will include some stocks.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{security}} risks {{have become more}} complex, too. Many of the threats, such as terrorism, organised crime and information security, are asymmetric and networked, making them more difficult to manage. There is also greater appreciation of the interdependence between a company’s <b>risk</b> <b>portfolio</b> {{and the way it}} does business: certain types of behavior can enhance or undermine an organization’s ‘licence to operate’, and in some cases this can generate risks that would not otherwise exist. As a result, security has a higher profile in the corporate world today than it did five years ago. Companies are looking for new ways to manage these risks and the portfolio of the security department has widened to include shared responsibility for things such as reputation, corporate governance and regulation, corporate social responsibility and information assurance.|$|E

50|$|In {{investment}} portfolio construction, an investor or analyst {{is faced with}} determining which asset classes, such as domestic fixed income, domestic equity, foreign fixed income, and foreign equity, to invest in and what proportion of the total portfolio should be of each asset class. Harry Markowitz (1959) first described a method for constructing a portfolio with optimal risk/return characteristics. His portfolio optimization method finds the minimum <b>risk</b> <b>portfolio</b> with a given expected return. Because the Markowitz or Mean-Variance Efficient Portfolio is calculated from the sample mean and covariance, which are likely different from the population mean and covariance, the resulting {{investment portfolio}} may allocate too much weight to assets with better estimated than true risk/return characteristics. To account for {{the uncertainty of the}} sample estimates, a financial analyst can create many alternative efficient frontiers based on resampled versions of the data. Each resampled dataset will result in a different set of Markowitz efficient portfolios. These efficient frontiers of portfolios can then averaged to create a resampled efficient frontier. The appropriate compromise between the investor's Risk aversion and desired return will then guide the financial analyst to choose a portfolio from the set of resampled efficient frontier portfolios. Since such a portfolio is different from the Markowitz efficient portfolio it will have suboptimal risk/return characteristics with respect to the sample mean and covariance, but optimal characteristics when averaged over the many possible values of the unknown true mean and covariance.

The mean–downside risk formulations require that the mean and semi-variance of interval data be calculated as bounds.

Using proxies for the risk of venture capital assets that are derived from VCs' risk management strategies [...] investment staging and deal syndication [...] we find reversals in relative performance are explained by the coexistence of persistent and non-persistent attitudes towards risk along two complementary dimensions. First, while syndication strategy is persistent, attitudes towards <b>portfolio</b> <b>risk</b> reverse between the short- and long-run periods, such that syndication is associated with high <b>risk</b> <b>portfolios</b> in the short-run, and low <b>risk</b> <b>portfolios</b> in the long-run.
