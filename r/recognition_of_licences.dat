40|$|We {{address the}} problem <b>of</b> {{optimising}} the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> ve-hicle <b>licence</b> plates with multiple segmentation methods. Two different licence plate search algorithms and seven symbol seg-mentation techniques are compared. The two search algorithms are: a region-growing algorithm (RGA) and an algorithm based on vertical edge detection (VEDA). The two search algorithms identify a licence plate region in the image, from which the sym-bol segmentation techniques extract the licence plate symbols. Once the region in which the licence plate is located is iden-tified, seven algorithms are used to segment the licence plate symbols. These algorithms comprise different combinations of simple segmentation, thresholding on the vertical projection, single and double frame Viterbi searches and filtering the data. Once the symbols have been identified, a multilayer perceptron neural network is used to estimate symbol probabilities of all the possible symbols. Legal licence plate sequences are used to construct a Markov model containing all allowed symbol order-ings. By adapting the Viterbi algorithm with sequencing con-straints, the most likely licence plate symbol sequences are cal-culated, along {{with a measure of}} their likelihoods. Each tech-nique generates a recognition confidence score, which allows for combining and weighing the different methods to achieve the best segmentation results. Our results presented in this pa-per show that by combining the pre-segmentation techniques, the average score and the recognition rate improves. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a system for detection and <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> license plates. The work {{is divided into three}} basic parts: licence plates detection, finding of character positions and optical character recognition. To fullfill the goal of this work, a new dataset was taken. It contains 2814 license plates used for training classifiers and 2620 plates to evaluate the success rate of the system. Cascade Classifier was used to train detector <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plates, which has success rate up to 97. 8 %. After that, pozitions of individual characters were searched in detected pozitions <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plates. If there was no character found, detected pozition was not the licence plate. Success rate <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plates detection with all the characters found is up to 88. 5 %. Character recognition is performed by SVM classifier. The system detects successfully with no errors up to 97. 7 % <b>of</b> all <b>licence</b> plates. ...|$|R
40|$|License plate {{recognition}} in vehicles {{is a major}} problem due to the acquisition of images because vehicles are generally in motion, and weather conditions like sunlight, fog. The images <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plate may also contain black borders or some stickers. License plate recognition not only involves <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> characters but also preprocessing <b>of</b> <b>licence</b> plate. In this paper, the images <b>of</b> the vehicle’s <b>licence</b> plate are collected from the car parking areas and from the web. First, the any noise, black border or any unwanted region other than character present on the image is removed. Then each individual character is segmented horizontal processing histogram. The features of each character are calculated using zonal based approach. These features are used as input to the neural networks for character recognition. The neural network used is back propagation neural network. The <b>recognition</b> rate <b>of</b> neural network is 95. 4 %...|$|R
