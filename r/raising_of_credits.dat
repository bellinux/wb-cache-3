Using a panel of firms from 20 European countries covering the period 2001 – 2011, we consider a broad set of measures of bank competition, including two structural measures (Herfindahl-Hirschman index and CR 5), and two non-structural indicators (Lerner index and H-statistic).

30|$|Using an {{alternative}} approach and a sample of banks in New England over the period 1989 :Q 2 to 1994 :Q 4, Peek and Rosengreen (1995) found that capital growth was the main determinant of lending growth for a sample of banks with low regulatory ratings (and hence presumably constrained), whereas {{it did not have}} a significant effect for the a priori unconstrained banks. Given the large number of banks with low regulatory ratings in New England in the early 1990 s, these authors argue that capital constraints may have {{played an important role in}} the sluggish lending growth and weak economic activity at that time.

40|$|In Morocco, as elsewhere, banking is the {{principal}} financial sector {{it has the potential}} to contribute the most or to most severely retard economic development. But the banking industry’s potential performance is constrained by the monetary policies of the central bank. This paper reviews some major factors favoring a strong banking industry that boosts development, as well as the major obstacles that have or continue to face the industry and the economy. The Moroccan central bank, Bank al’Magrib, has been very successful in providing a strong financial environment for the nation. Within this environment, indeed, perhaps because of it, the nation’s banking sector is performing very well. One of the main recent achievements has been the near elimination of so-called “specialized banks,” government institutions set up to provide directed credit to key sectors of the economy. These banks were a major drag on the private financial sector, boosting risk and raising costs, lowering returns to private banks and reducing the their supply <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and <b>raising</b> the cost <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for the private sector. These institutions have largely been merged into private firms and their special status eliminated. Fiscal policy continues to remain a major barrier to private capital formation and bank lending. Unfortunately government policy continues to favor running large budget deficits, continuing the waste of scarce national resources. In addition, very high marginal tax rates kick in at very low levels of income, penalizing saving and investment and risk-taking activity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} reduced transaction costs in the international trading of assets {{on the ability of}} governments to issue debt. We examine a model in which governments care about the welfare of their citizens, and thus are more inclined to default if a large proportion of their debt is held by foreigners. Reductions in transaction costs make it easier for domestic citizens to share risk by selling debt to foreigners. This may increase tendencies for governments to default, and thus <b>raise</b> their cost <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and reduce welfare. We find that {{even in the absence of}} transaction costs, home bias in placement of government debt may persist, because in the presence of default risk the return on government debt is correlated with the tax burden required to pay the debt. Asset inequality may reduce this home bias, and by increasing foreign ownership, increase incentives for default. Finally, if foreign creditors are less risk averse than domestic creditors, there may be one equilibrium in which domestic creditors hold the asset and default risk is low, and another in which foreign creditors hold the asset and default risk is high. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} reduced transaction costs in the trading of assets {{on the ability of}} governments to issue debt. We examine a model with two types of creditors, favored and disfavored. Governments are more inclined to default if a large proportion of their debt is held by the disfavored group. For example, the fledgling U. S. government paid soldiers in the U. S. with Pierce's notes, many of which were later bought by US Revolutionary War speculators at steep discounts. In an international context, governments may care more about the welfare of domestic creditors than foreign creditors. We show that reductions in transaction costs, for example due to greater international openness, that make it easier to sell debt to the disfavored creditors can increase the likelihood <b>of</b> default, <b>raising</b> the cost <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and reducing welfare. Multiple equilibria may exist if disfavored creditors are less risk averse than favored ones. Even without transaction costs, home bias in placement of government debt may persist, because with default risk the return on government debt is correlated with the tax burden required to pay the debt. Asset inequality may reduce this home bias, and by increasing foreign ownership, increase incentives for default...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} <b>of</b> international lending <b>raises</b> {{the issue}} <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> worthiness <b>of</b> sovereign debtors. From a lender perspective, {{it is important}} to have some prior warnings about potential debt repudiation. We analyze how the fiscal evolution ofa country might contain information about its creditworthiness. In a two good, small open economy theoretical framework, we find that budget deficits and current account developments hold critical information regarding structural imbalances and creditworthiness. The model is also able to account for a number of features which often characterize countries with chronic debt problems including the phenomenon of capital flight and the usefulness of debt relief for stabilizing explosive debt situations. Estimation of a model of debt arrears with cross country data provides general support to the theoretical structure. A major finding of the paper is that it is the efficiency of investment and not the level of investment that is important for creditworthiness purposes. In general, wefind that exports, imports, income inequality, inflation and the efficiency of investment are able to explain about three-fourths ofthe cross-country variation in debt servicing performance. We find that the results are robust to both different specifications as well as alternative measures of country risk such as credit ratings assigned by international creditors. ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a dynamic}} economy where credit {{is limited by}} {{insufficient}} collateral and, as a result, investment and output are too low. In this environment, changes in investor sentiment or market expectations can give rise to credit bubbles, that is, expansions in credit that are backed not by expectations of future profits (i. e., fundamental collateral), but instead by expectations <b>of</b> future <b>credit</b> (i. e., bubbly collateral). Credit bubbles <b>raise</b> the availability <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for entrepreneurs: this is the crowding-in effect. However, entrepreneurs must also use some <b>of</b> this <b>credit</b> to cancel past credit: this is the crowding-out effect. There is an “optimal” bubble size that trades off these two effects and maximizes long-run output and consumption. The equilibrium bubble size depends on investor sentiment, however, and it typically does not coincide with the “optimal” bubble size. This provides a new rationale for macroprudential policy. A credit management agency (CMA) can replicate the “optimal” bubble by taxing credit when the equilibrium bubble is too high and subsidizing credit when the equilibrium bubble is too low. This leaning-against-the-wind policy maximizes output and consumption. Moreover, the same conditions that make this policy desirable guarantee that a CMA has the resources to implement it.

The paper focuses specifically {{on the impact of}} non-standard monetary policy measures by the European Central Bank and on the effects of bank bailout policies by national governments. Testing specific hypotheses formulated in the literature, we find that bank bailout policies have reduced solvency risk in the banking sector mostly at the expense <b>of</b> <b>raising</b> the <b>credit</b> risk <b>of</b> sovereigns. By contrast, monetary policy was in most, but not all cases effective in lowering credit risk among both sovereigns and banks.
