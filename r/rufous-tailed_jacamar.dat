50|$|The <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>jacamar</b> (Galbula ruficauda) is a near-passerine bird which breeds in the {{tropical}} New World in southern Mexico, Central America and South America {{as far south as}} southern Brazil and Ecuador.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{observed}} in the park include the <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>jacamar</b> (Galbula ruficauda), squirrel cuckoo (Piaya cayana), southern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum), purple-throated euphonia (Euphonia chlorotica), grey-headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), barred antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus), pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus), sepia-capped flycatcher (Leptopogon amaurocephalus), silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), planalto tyrannulet (Phyllomyias fasciatus), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus).|$|E
50|$|The jacamars are elegant brightly {{coloured}} {{birds with}} long bills and tails. The <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>jacamar</b> is typically 25 cm long with a 5 cm long black bill. The subspecies G. r. brevirostris has, {{as its name}} implies, a shorter bill. This bird is metallic green above, and the underparts are mainly orange, including the undertail, {{but there is a}} green breast band. Sexes differ in that the male has a white throat, and the female a buff throat; she also tends to have paler underparts. The race G. r. pallens has a copper-coloured back in both sexes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>jacamar's</b> call is a sharp pee-op, and {{the song}} a high thin peeo-pee-peeo-pee-pe-pe, ending in a trill.|$|R
50|$|Since cracker {{butterflies}} have camouflage, {{they are}} not poisonous {{and do not have}} a chemical defense. They are actually fed upon by <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>jacamars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{systems of}} jacamars {{have not been}} studied in depth. They are thought to generally be monogamous, although a few species are thought to engage in cooperative breeding sometimes, with several adults sharing duties. The family nests in holes either in the soil or in arboreal termite mounds. Ground-nesting species usually nest in the banks of rivers (or, more recently, roads), although if these are not available they will nest in the soil held by the roots of fallen trees. Bank-nesting jacamars can sometimes be loosely colonial. Clutch sizes are between one and four eggs, and usually more than one. Both parents participate in incubation. Little {{is known about the}} incubation times of most species, but it lasts for between 19-26 days in the <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>jacamar.</b> Chicks are born with down feathers, unique among the piciformes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rufous-tailed</b> <b>Jacamar</b> Galbula ruficauda {{is known}} from few records in Paraguay, {{all during the}} last 20 years. The species has been {{recorded}} in the northern Chaco and Paraguayan Pantanal, with all confirmed records from Alto Paraguay department. Here we summarise all reports and localities of the species in Paraguay to date. The species is categorized as Data Deficient at the national level, but may be more widely distributed than is currently recognised...|$|E
