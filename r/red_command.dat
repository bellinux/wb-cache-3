The Red Command's influence was best shown in 1990, when William Santos de Souza and Duda, the [...] "Kings of Rio rap" [...] at the time, released a track entitled, [...] "Rap do Borel" [...] shouting out to a gang-controlled favela in Rio.

The factions Comando Vermelho (<b>Red</b> <b>Command),</b> Amigos dos Amigos (Friends of the Friends) and Terceiro Comando (Third Command) are now ruled by PCC, whose order has been to stop fights between the factions, and increase the crack market, as that drug's selling was not well seen by Rio's gangs.|$|E
50|$|The gang {{does not}} allow mugging, rape, extortion, {{or the use of}} the PCC to resolve {{personal}} conflicts. It maintains a strict hierarchy, led by Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho. All members inside and outside are required to pay taxes. Members can be soldiers, towers (gang leaders in particular prisons), or pilots (who specialize in communications). The PCC has strong ties with the <b>Red</b> <b>Command,</b> Rio's most powerful drug-trafficking organization which is rumored to supply them with cocaine.|$|E
5000|$|Brizola also {{adopted a}} radical new policy for police {{action in the}} poor suburbs and favelas in the Rio de Janeiro {{metropolitan}} area. Alleging old relations and modus operandi were founded on repression, conflict and disrespect, he ordered the state police to refrain from random raids in favelas and repressed the activities of vigilante death squads that included policemen on leave. The right opposed these policies, saying they made slums an open territory for organized crime represented by huge gangs like Comando Vermelho (<b>Red</b> <b>Command),</b> {{by means of a}} conflation between common criminality and leftism. It was alleged that gangs had originated through the association of convicted petty criminals and leftist political prisoners in the 1970s. Other scholars argue that this [...] "politicization" [...] of common crime had been the work of the military dictatorship, which, by incarcerating together common criminals and political prisoners, offered the former the opportunity to mimic the organization strategies of underground resistance groups.|$|E

40|$|The Red Army 2 ̆ 7 s {{defeat in}} the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920 was a {{significant}} moment in {{the early history of}} the Soviet state. Any hopes Soviet leaders might have entertained of exporting their revolution beyond the borders of the former Russian Empire were dashed at Warsaw. Western observers were as amazed as they were relieved at the remarkable reversal of fortunes that took place In the Soviet-Polish War in mid-August 1920. Up to that point it seemed certain that Poland would be overrun by its larger Soviet neighbour, leaving eastern and central Europe vulnerable to the armies of Communist Russia. Those who have studied the Battle of Warsaw are in agreement that the <b>Red</b> <b>command</b> badly mishandled the final stages of the march on Warsaw.

40|$|Armed {{violence}} in Paraguay {{is not a}} recent phenomenon. During {{the second half of}} the XX Century, Paraguay saw the rise of a larger number of underground, revolutionary movements that sought the overthrow of the Alfredo Stroessner’s (1954 - 1989) government. From among those movements emerged the Partido Patria Libre (or, Free Fatherland, also known for its acronym PPL), made up of a two branches: one legal and the other one, operational. The latter was based on people’s power, as represented by “Ejército del Pueblo Paraguayo” (or, the Paraguayan People’s Army, with acronym EPP). After EPP broke with PPL in March 2008, this Marxist-oriented revolutionary project, which was apparently oriented to put an end to the social, political and economic inequalities in Paraguay, began to carry out markedly criminal activities, which included bank robberies, kidnappings, assassinations, terrorist attacks and armed confrontations. Its strategies and modus operandi utilized by the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC). Paraguay features a farm sector in a state of crisis, in which cattle-ranchers, peasants and agro-exporting companies live in a constant strife. The Paraguayan Departments that are the most affected by this situation are Concepciόn, San Pedro, Canindeyú y Caazapá, which also suffer from a weak government presence. This deficiency has made these departments ripe for drug-trafficking activity by Brazilian groups such as Primer Comando Capital (i. e., First Capital command), also PCC and Comando Vermelho, (i. e., The <b>Red</b> <b>Command).</b> That is why many peasants, now recruited by EPP, have joined the drug-trafficking business and that, not only as marihuana growers but as “campanas” (i. e., early warning sentinels) for the organization. This helps shape their attitudes for their future involvement in all areas of drug-trafficking. Paraguayan society is the result of social inequity and inequality, such as those resulting from a lack of opportunity. Although Paraguay has successfully recovered from the last world economic crisis, economic growth, by itself, does not ensure an improvement in the quality of life. As long as such economic and social gaps persist and the government fails to enact the policies that would result in a more just society and toward EPP neutralization or containment, the latter is bound to grow stronger. In this context, the situation in Paraguay calls for more research into the EPP phenomenon. It would also seem necessary for Paraguay to promote an open national debate that includes all sectors of society in order to raise consciousness and to induce society to take actual steps to eliminate the EPP, as well as any other group that might arise in the immediate future. EPP has strong connections with the Frente Patriόtico Manuel Rodríguez in Chile and other armed groups and peasant movements in other countries of this region. Although most governments in the region are aware that the armed struggle is not a solution to current problems, it might be worth it to hold a regional debate about armed or insurgent groups in Latin American to seek common strategies and cooperation on dealing with them since the expansion of these armed groups is a problem for all...|$|E
5000|$|The Starfleet {{officers}} and crewmembers seen in The Next Generation wear a jumpsuit with a Starfleet communicator badge (or 'combadge' {{as it was}} sometimes called) on the left chest and rank insignia {{on the right side}} of the collar.

The war and revolts against Napoleon's occupation led to the adoption of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, later a cornerstone of European liberalism, by the Cádiz Cortes. Málaga elected representatives to send to the national legislative assembly and a new constitutional Town Council which immediately implemented reconstruction plans. The French were decisively defeated at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813, and the following year, Ferdinand VII was restored as King of Spain. The burden of war had destroyed the social and economic fabric of Spain and ushered in an era of social turbulence, political instability and economic stagnation.|$|R

For enemy command posts, enemy units can continue to spawn in the area until the post is denergized and turns white. When all command posts belong to a given team, a twenty-second timer begins in which the opposing team must deenergize a command post or they lose.

5000|$|Two {{bodies of}} {{irregular}} Sikh cavalry {{are attached to}} the main army; one is distinguished by wearing <b>red</b> turbans, is <b>commanded</b> by Captain Hodson of the Indian Army, and is known as Hodson's Horse; the other wears blue turbans, is commanded by Lieutenant Probyn of the Indian Army, and is known as Probyn's Horse. Their dress consists of the whitey-brown 'kharki', each man is armed with a tulwa and brace of pistols, and one or two troops with lances. To command a regiment of these semi-barbarous troopers requires no small ability, tact, and personal courage, as well as knowledge of the native character, and both Probyn and Hodson are beloved by their wild horsemen. They are generally splendidly mounted, and each horse is the private property of his rider.|$|R

Three arched openings in this facade, about four metres wide, have been variously in-filled; two with concrete and a central strip of steel containing single steel doors and the last with steel partitioning and a central steel door. Above the archways are small circular openings that have been in-filled.

The larger two rooms were for storage and measured about 8.5 x 5.5 metres (28 x 18 feet) in plan and 3 metres high (10 feet). The telephone room measures about 3.65 x 3 metres (12 x 10 feet) and almost 2.8 metres (9 feet) at the highest line of the vault.
