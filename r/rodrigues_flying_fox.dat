40|$|Recent serologic {{studies have}} {{identified}} <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus spp.) as carriers of leptospirosis; however, {{little is known}} about the role of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> as carriers of pathogenic Leptospira. spp. To determine if Australian Pteropus spp. are carriers of pathogenic Leptospira spp., TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect leptospiral DNA in kidney and urine specimens from four species of <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> including the spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus conspicillatus), black <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus alecto), grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus), and little red flying 6 (Pteropus scapulatus). Of the 173 kidney samples tested, 19 (11 %) were positive for leptospiral DNA. Positive individuals were detected in all four species; significant differences in prevalence were not detected between species, between species within the same geographic area, or between geographically separated samples from the same species. Of the 46 urine samples tested, 18 (39 %) tested positive by PCR, confirming that <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> shed leptospires into the environment. The detection of leptospiral DNA in the kidneys and urine of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> suggests that <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are carriers of pathogenic Leptospira. spp. No evidence collected in the present study, however, suggests that <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> pose a significant risk of leptospirosis to the wider community or, that humans who are in regular, close contact with <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are at risk for leptospirosis...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Rodrigues</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through storm damage and human intervention, and by local hunting for food.

The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust has undertaken a successful captive breeding program, and there are now colonies in several zoos. Likewise, the Organization for Bat Conservation is funding an international conservation project. Due to its imperiled status, it is identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction as a species in danger of imminent extinction.

40|$|Throughout {{their world}} distribution, fruit bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) play an {{extremely}} important role in forest ecology through seed dispersal and pollination. However, the recognition of their role in maintaining forest ecological diversity has been largely overshadowed {{by the fact that}} fruit bats are known to cause damage {{to a wide variety of}} cultivated fruits and, as a result, significant effort is undertaken to control fruit bat numbers in areas where crop damage frequently occurs. In Australia, fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (or <b>flying</b> <b>foxes)</b> are well known for their role in destroying valuable fruit crops, particularly along the east coast from Cairns to Sydney. Historical evidence suggests that <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> have been culled as an orchard pest in large numbers for the past 80 years. Uncontrolled culling both on-farm and in roosts coupled with extensive habitat destruction in the past century, has resulted in noticeable declines both in <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> distribution and local population numbers. In New South Wales, <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> have been 'protected' under the National Parks and Wildlife Act (1974) since 1986. From that time, fruitgrowers have been required to obtain a licence (referred to as an occupier's licence) from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) to cull <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> causing damage to fruit crops. However, despite the 'protected' status of the species, <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> continue to be culled in large numbers as an orchard pest. An examination of the management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in NSW, has shown that, between 1986 - 1992, fifteen NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service Districts issued a combined total of 616 occupier's licences to shoot <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> with an total allocation of over 240, 000 animals. In addition, most <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are culled when the female is carrying her young under wing or when the young remain in the camp but continue to be dependent on her return for survival. Further evidence on the extent of culling includes a widely distributed fruitgrower survey with responses indicating that as few as 50 % of the fruitgrowers shooting <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in NSW obtain the required licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. While the NPWS has undertaken research into the role of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in seed dispersal and pollination, management effort largely continues to focus on resolving conflicts between fruitgrowers and <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> primarily by issuing culling permits to fruitgrowers. At present, there is no NPWS policy on the management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in NSW to guide the administration of the permit system. As a result, the process of issuing permits for <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> is largely inconsistent between NPWS Districts. The absence of comprehensive goals and objectives for the management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> has resulted in the current situation where large numbers of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are being culled both legally and illegally in the absence of any data on the impacts of unknown culling levels on local <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> populations. The NPWS has a statutory obligation to manage <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> consistent with the 'protected' status of the species in NSW and several well known principles of wildlife management. However, current management of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in indicates that the Service may be in violation of the requirement to 'protect' and 'conserve' <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> as required under the National Parks and Wildlife Act (1974). This study recommends that licences issued to fruitgrowers to cull <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> be discontinued immediately and that adequate enforcement be engaged to reduce illegal shooting. This action should continue until such time that research on <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> populations is able to demonstrate that the culling of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> will not lead populations into decline. Furthermore, management effort should focus on the development of alternative strategies to reduce crop damage by <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> and provide incentives for growers to utilize existing control strategies such as netting...|$|R
