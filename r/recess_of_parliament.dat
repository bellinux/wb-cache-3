60|$|During {{this short}} <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> and upon {{the fifth day}} of January, Prince Eugene, of Savoy, landed in England. Before he left his ship he asked a person who came to meet him, whether the new lords were made, and what was their number? He was {{attended}} through the streets with a mighty rabble of people to St. James's, where Mr. Secretary St. John {{introduced him to the}} Queen, who received him with great civility. His arrival had been long expected, and the project of his journey had as long been formed here by the party leaders, in concert with Monsieur Buys, and Monsieur Bothmar, the Dutch and Hanover envoys. This prince brought over credentials from the Emperor, with offers to continue the war upon a new foot, very advantageous to Britain; part of which, by Her Majesty's commands, Mr. St. John soon after produced to the House of Commons; where they were rejected, not without some indignation, by a great majority. The Emperor's proposals, as far as they related to Spain, were communicated to the House in the words following.|$|E
60|$|When the {{rejection}} of the first propositions and the acceptance of the last had jointly, as it was natural, raised a very strong discontent in Ireland, Lord Rockingham, who frequently said that there never seemed a more opportune time for the relief of Ireland than that moment when Lord North had rejected all rational propositions for its relief, without consulting, I believe, any one living, did what he is not often very willing to do; but he thought this an occasion of magnitude enough to justify an extraordinary step. He went into the closet, and made a strong representation on the matter to the king, which was not ill received, and I believe produced good effects. He then made the motion in the House of Lords which you may recollect; but he was content to withdraw all of censure which it contained, on the solemn promise of ministry, that they would in the <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> prepare a plan for the benefit of Ireland, and have it in readiness to produce at the next meeting. You may recollect that Lord Gower became in a particular manner bound for the fulfilling this engagement. Even this did not satisfy, and most of the minority were very unwilling that Parliament should be prorogued until something effectual on the subject should be done,--particularly as we saw that the distresses, discontents, and armaments of Ireland were increasing every day, and that we are not so much lost to common sense as not to know the wisdom and efficacy of early concession in circumstances such as ours.|$|E

It is actually not very time-consuming once the small initial learning curve has been overcome. It can assess bursae and larger joints and entheses. However, the more areas investigated the more time-consuming it becomes. Naredo et al. [26] have shown that for routine diagnostic and treatment response purposes it suffices to assess the anterior and posterior <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the elbow, the dorsal carpal <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, {{the second and third}} MCPJ dorsally and palmar, the suprapatellar recess and the lateral parapatellar <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the knee, the anterior tibiotalar <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the ankle and the medial and lateral tendon sheaths in the ankle area.
