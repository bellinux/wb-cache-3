25|$|Automation is an {{important}} element in HTS's usefulness. Typically, an integrated <b>robot</b> <b>system</b> consisting of one or more robots transports assay-microplates from station to station for sample and reagent addition, mixing, incubation, and finally readout or detection. An HTS system can usually prepare, incubate, and analyze many plates simultaneously, further speeding the data-collection process. HTS robots that can test up to 100,000 compounds per day currently exist. Automatic colony pickers pick thousands of microbial colonies for high throughput genetic screening. The term uHTS or ultra-high-throughput screening refers (circa 2008) to screening in excess of 100,000 compounds per day.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{essential}} robot peripheral {{is the end}} effector, or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic). Another common means of picking up an object is by vacuum. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time. [...] They may utilize various sensors to aid the <b>robot</b> <b>system</b> in locating, handling, and positioning products.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{recruitment}} of new workforce {{for the field}} of care taking is difficult in highly industrialized countries and the gap between demand and availability of care takers will further increase with the expected increase in aged populations in the future. In particular, service <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> are able to enhance the capabilities of assisted environments significantly as they add critical capabilities and thus allow environments to actively support care givers and care takers with the full bandwidth of necessary processes, tasks and services. Service <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> add to assisted environments besides the aspect of hard physical assistance capabilities with flexibility, increased intelligence and situational awareness and provide new ways of intuitive man-machine-interaction. However, the integration of service <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> into real world assisted environments has been difficult due to the usually separate development of environment and stand-alone <b>robot</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, the authors present a conceptual approach for a robotic care environment in which care environment (including room layouts, furniture and distributed sensors), service <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> and care processes are fully synchronized and co-adapted...|$|R

40|$|Like {{computer}} architects, robot designers {{must address}} multiple, possibly competing, requirements by balancing trade-offs {{in terms of}} processing, memory, communication, and energy to satisfy design objectives. However, robot architects currently lack the design guidelines, organizing principles, rules of thumb, and tools that computer architects rely upon. This thesis takes a step in this direction, by analyzing the roles of heterogeneity and distribution in <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> architecture. This thesis takes a systems architecture approach {{to the design of}} <b>robot</b> <b>systems,</b> and in particular, investigates the use of distributed, heterogeneous platforms to exploit locality in <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> design. We show how multiple, distributed heterogeneous platforms can serve as general purpose <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> for three distinct domains with different design objectives: increasing availability in a search and rescue mission, increasing flexibility and ease-of-use for a personal educational robot, and decreasing the computation and sensing resources necessary for navigation and foraging tasks.

40|$|Robots must {{complete}} their tasks {{in spite of}} unreliable actuators and limited, noisy sensing. In this paper, we consider the information requirements of such tasks. What sensing and actuation abilities are needed to complete a given task? Are some <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> provably ``more powerful,'' {{in terms of the}} tasks they can complete, than others? Can we find meaningful equivalence classes of <b>robot</b> <b>systems?</b> This line of research is inspired by the theory of computation, which has produced similar results for abstract computing machines. The basic idea is a dominance relation over <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> that formalizes the idea that some robots are stronger than others. This comparison, which is based on the how the robots progress through their information spaces, induces a partial order over the set of <b>robot</b> <b>systems.</b> We prove some basic properties of this partial order and show that it {{is directly related to the}} robots' ability to complete tasks. We give examples to demonstrate the theory, including a detailed analysis of a limited-sensing global localization problem...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{cooperating}} <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> may {{be required}} to take up a closely coupled configuration in order to perform a task. An example is extended baseline stereo (EBS), requiring that two robots must establish and maintain for {{a certain period of time}} a constrained kinematic relationship to each other. In this paper we report on the development of a networked robotics framework for modular, distributed <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> that supports the creation of such configurations. The framework incorporates a query mechanism to locate modules distributed across the two <b>robot</b> <b>systems.</b> The work presented in this paper introduces special mechanisms to model the kinematic constraint and its instantiation. The EBS configuration is used as a case study and experimental implementation to demonstrate the approach...|$|R
30|$|Before {{the concept}} of <b>robot</b> {{operating}} <b>system</b> was introduced, system software with the same functionalities {{was referred to as}} robotics middleware, robot software framework, or robotics development environment. They gained more and more attentions and research efforts since late 1990 s, with typical initiatives gradually emerging, such as Miro [3], Orca [4], RT-Middleware [5], Player/Stage [6], MARIE [7], RSCA [8] and Orocos [9]. Microsoft also released Robotics Developer Studio [10] in 2006. In 2007, the release of <b>Robot</b> Operating <b>System</b> (ROS) version 1.0 [11] introduced {{the concept of}} operating system into robotics for the first time. In recent years, this concept was gradually accepted by both academia and industry. An increasing number of experimental and commercial <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> base their research and development entirely or partially upon <b>robot</b> operating <b>systems,</b> even including examples like the Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) [12] and Robonaut 2 [13], which requires very high real-time performance and reliability. However, most of the aforementioned <b>robot</b> operating <b>systems</b> mainly focused on development of applications on individual robotic platform, {{despite the fact that the}} vast majority of them support networking. It still remains an open issue for existing <b>robot</b> operating <b>systems</b> how to manage the heterogeneous resources and complex behaviors of collective <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> to achieve collective intelligence.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design of}} a feedback control law for control systems described by a class of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations so that certain desired outputs track given reference inputs. The nonlinear differential-algebraic control system being considered is not in state variable form. Assumptions are introduced and a procedure is developed such that an equivalent state realization of the control system described by nonlinear differential-algebraic equations is expressed in a familiar normal form. A nonlinear feedback control law is then proposed which ensures, under appropriate assumptions, that the tracking error in the closed loop differential-algebraic system approaches zero exponentially. Applications to simultaneous contact force and position tracking in constrained <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> with rigid joints, constrained <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> with joint flexibility, and constrained <b>robot</b> <b>systems</b> with significant actuator dynamics are discussed...|$|R
