50|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{estimates}} that direct spending {{stemming from the}} programs authorized by the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> would total $956 billion over the 2014-2023 period, of which $756 billion would be for nutrition programs. Relative to spending and revenues projected under the CBO’s May 2013 baseline, the CBO {{estimates that}} enacting the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> would lower budget deficits by $16.6 billion over that 10-year period. The CBO reported that original House version, Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (H.R. 1947; 113th Congress), would have reduced direct spending by $51.8 billion and increased revenues by $60 million. The original Senate version, Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (S. 954; 113th Congress), would have decreased direct spending by $17.7 billion and increased revenues by $50 million.|$|R

However, an enrolling error resulted in one {{title of the}} bill (Title III, Trade) being omitted from the version that {{was sent to the}} White House, and the newly enacted law contains 14 of 15 farm bill titles. To resolve this issue, both the House and Senate passed a version of the 2008 farm bill with all 15 original bill titles (H. R. 6124). The President vetoed this bill version on June 18. That same day both the House (80 - 14) and the Senate (317 - 109) voted to override the veto and the bill became law (P. L. 110 - 246), replacing P. L. 110 - 234. The <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> contains 15 titles covering support for commodity crops, horticulture and livestock production, conservation, nutrition, trade and food aid, agricultural research, farm credit, rural development, energy, forestry, and other related programs. It also includes tax-related provisions that would make certain changes to tax laws, in order to offset new spending initiatives in the respective bills. The bill is intended to replace the most recent 2002 farm bill (P. L. 107 - 171) and to guide most federal farm and food policies through FY 2012.
