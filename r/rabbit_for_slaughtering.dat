40|$|The {{experiment}} was carried for 12 {{months in the}} Rabbit Unit of Departamento de Zootecnia at the Universidade Federal do Ceará. The aim of this work was to evaluate the rabbit reproductive parameters and ponderable performance of the races New Zealand (NZ) and Califórnia(CA), in Ceará, Northeast Brazil. Animals were fed with a commercial feed of 2500 kcal DE/kg for rabbit in reproduction. Thirty does (50 % of each race) were distributed at random in experimental cages, such that each ¿treatment¿ (race) had 15 replications. Data were analyzed in a complete randomized design. Does were selected by weight and age, being included in the expeiment with 3, 0 kg and 4, 5 months of age, approximately. The male/female ratio was 1 : 10. Pregnancy check was done by palpation 15 days after mating. Reproductive management adopted was mating 10 days after delivery and weaning at 30 days of age (semi-intensive). Productivity in maternity was similar between races. Numeric productivity for both races was 31. 3 rabbits weaned/cage/year. Does CA showed greatest maternal ability as compared with NZ does, with heavier offspring at birth, at 21 days, and at weaning. Finally, {{it is suggested that}} to produce a <b>rabbit</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughtering,</b> it should use females CA with males NZ, in single or industrial mating...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to estimate the genetic group effects and the crossbreeding genetic parameters of slaughter and carcass traits using data on the rabbits that were progeny of does coming from a full diallel cross between 4 maternal lines (A, V, H and LP) mated to bucks of the paternal line R. The rabbits of the 16 genetic groups, corresponding {{to the type of}} does of the diallel cross, were distributed in  4 Spanish farms and 1 genetic group (V line) was present in all farms in order to connect records among them and to be used as reference group. Crossbreeding parameters were estimated according to Dickerson’s model. 1896 <b>rabbits</b> were measured <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> traits and 950 for carcass traits. The A and LP lines had the lowest values for dressing percentage (– 1. 71 and – 1. 98 compared with H line and – 1. 49 and – 1. 75 with the V line, respectively). The A line was the heaviest for commercial carcass weight. No relevant differences were observed between the crossbred groups for all traits. Regarding the reciprocal effects, there were significant differences in favour of A line as sire line in the crossbred AV. Regarding the combination of direct and maternal effects, the A line showed significantly higher values for cold carcass weight (133 g., 71 g.  and 142 g. compared to the H, LP and V lines). For the same parameter the H line showed significantly higher averages on dressing percentages than A and LP lines, 1. 44 and 2. 13 %, respectively. Line A also showed, in general, better direct- maternal effects than the V line. Grand-maternal effects were less important than direct-maternal ones. The estimates of maternal heterosis were, in general, negative, which could be a consequence of the positive heterosis for litter size. However, despite this relationship between growth and litter traits, it has not been common to find negative maternal heterosis in growth traits. A diminution of dressing percentage was detected in some crossbreds (AL and LV) and care must be taken if these types are used...|$|R
