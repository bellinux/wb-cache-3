Although all three types adhered well to epithelial cells, adhering numbers of the <b>rough</b> <b>type</b> were significantly lower than those of the smooth and the smooth variant of the <b>rough</b> <b>type.</b> Protease treatment increased the adherence of the <b>rough</b> <b>type</b> of the level of the two other types. The adherence of all three types was reduced more than 85 % by treatment with 10 mM sodium periodate. Furthermore, the adherence was pH independent and could not be blocked by incubation with antisera to the bacteria. In addition, we determined the capacity to invade epithelial cells by P. micros. In an acridine orange assay such invasion could not be detected. Our results suggest that the adherence of P. micros to epithelial cells is mediated by periodate-sensitive extracellular polysaccharides and that the protruding fibril-like protein surface structures of the <b>rough</b> <b>type</b> have an obstructive effect on the adherence. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Two alloys grades {{for work}} rolls {{used in the}} <b>roughing</b> <b>stand</b> of Hot Strip Mill (HSM) are compared. The first grade known as High Chromium Steel (HCS) is {{presently}} {{the most widely used}} alloy for such an application, while the second one known as semi-High Speed Steel (semi-HSS) is the new grade developed to improve the overall performance of the work roll in the <b>roughing</b> <b>stands</b> of the HSM. In the present paper, the new semi-HSS grade is studied starting from three chemical compositions closed one to another, the variation in the alloying elements is intended to assess, on one hand the effect of a small increase of the carbon content, {{and on the other hand}} the influence of the addition of a strong MC carbide forming element. The comparison of HCS and semi-HSS grades involves many fields. Regarding the metallurgical aspect, such a comparison led to the enhancement of the solidification range, the crystallization behavior and the microstructure in the as-cast condition for both grades. Furthermore, corrosion behavior and performances of the work rolls in service are compared. Various techniques are used in order to characterize both grades, such as Differential Thermal Analysis (to determine phase transformations temperatures, the crystallization behavior and the interval of solidification), hardness measurements, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy associated with energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy (to determine the nature and the composition of phases, especially matrix and carbides). Finally micro-macro relations between the nature of the microstructure and the properties of HCS and semi-HSS rolls grades in service conditions could be established. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The slab {{edge rolling}} {{has been widely}} used in the <b>roughing</b> <b>stand</b> of hot strip mill to control {{the width of the}} slab. However, the slab edge rolling and {{consequent}} horizontal rolling will cause a significant width change in the head part and tail part of the slab, which have to be trimmed before the finishing stands. The short stroke control (SSC) technology has been developed to overcome this problem. In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) has been used to simulate the unsteady edge rolling process. Three SSC control curves have been compared in order to obtain the best width control result. The optimized SSC control curve has been applied to the industrial rolling mill...|$|R

In non-isothermal disks, recent work has shown that a negative entropy gradient {{can lead to a}} strong positive corotation torque which can slow down or <b>reverse</b> <b>Type</b> I migration in laminar viscous disk models. We examine the impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a protoplanet {{embedded in}} a non-isothermal protoplanetary disk. We performed 2 D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in which turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing. We find that the running timeaveraged torque experienced by a protoplanet embedded in a non-isothermal turbulent disk is in good agreement with laminar disk models with appropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients. In disks with turbulence driven by stochastic forcing, the corotation torque therefore behaves as in laminar viscous disks and can be responsible for significantly slowing down or <b>reversing</b> <b>Type</b> I migration...|$|R
