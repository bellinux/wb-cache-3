40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a beamforming-based dynamic {{spectrum}} leasing (DSL) technique {{to improve the}} spectral utility of bi-directional communication of the legacy/primary spectrum users through the help of colocated secondary users. The secondary users help for a time interval to relay the data between two primary terminals using physical layer network coding and beamforming to attain bi-directional communication with high spectral utility. As a reimbursement, the secondary users, cognitive radios (CRs) in our case, get exclusive access to the primary spectrum for a certain duration. We use Nash bargaining to determine the optimal division of temporal resources between relaying and reimbursement. Moreover, we consider that a fraction of secondary nodes can act selfishly by not helping the primary, yet enjoy the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>time.</b> We measure {{the utility of the}} DSL scheme in terms of a metric called time-bandwidth product (TBP) ratio quantifying the number of bits transmitted in direct communication versus DSL. We show that if all secondary nodes act honestly, more than 17 -fold increase in the TBP ratio is observed for a sparse CR network. However, in such a network, selfish behavior of CR nodes can reduce the gain by more than a factor of 2...|$|E

Methods:We identified 447 practices with all levels of National Committee for Quality Assurance PCMH recognition as of March 1, 2010. We selected the largest practice from multisite groups, and 238 practices were contacted. We received 123 responses, for a 52 % response rate. A 40 -item web-based survey was collected. Results: Of PCMH practices, 42 % have a behavioral health clinician on site; social workers were the most frequent category of provider delivering behavioral services. There are also were care managers—distinct from behavioral health clinician—at 62 % of practices. Surveyed practices were less likely to have procedures for referrals, communication, and patient scheduling for responding to mental health and substance use ser-vices than for other medical subspecialties (50 % compared with 73 % for cardiology and 69 % for endocrinol-ogy). More than half of practices (62 %) reported using electronic, standardized depression screening and monitoring; practices were less likely to screen for substance use than mental health.

The regulations that implement this provision are in subpart I of 42 CFR part 412 (§412.150 through §412.154). Starting in October, an estimated total of 2,217 hospitals {{across the nation}} will be penalized; however, only 307 of these hospitals will receive this year's maximum penalty, i.e., 1 percent off their base Medicare reimbursements. The penalty will be deducted from <b>reimbursements</b> each <b>time</b> a hospital submits a claim starting Oct. 1. The maximum penalty will increase after this year, to 2 percent of regular payments starting in October 2013 and then to 3 percent the following year.

5000|$|Constraints of {{time and}} money. Many health care {{providers}} feel there is little time for screening during busy well visits. Generally this complaint reflects lack of awareness of screening measures that can be completed in waiting rooms (e.g., paper-pencil tools that families can self-administer independently, thus saving providers substantive <b>time).</b> <b>Reimbursement</b> for early detection has been notoriously poor. However, in 2005 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services enabled providers to add the -25 modifier to their preventive service code and to bill separately from the well-visit for 96110 (the developmental-behavioral screening code). Nationally, reimbursement now averages about $10. Some states have handled this mandate differently (e.g., North Carolina providers higher reimbursement for well care but does not allow screening to be unbundled from the well-visit for separate billing). Typically private payers honor Medicaid mandates and follow suit with billing and coding although this has not always occurred. The American Academy of Pediatrics has a Coding Hotline and advocates with private payers to provide reimbursement for screening.|$|R

DESIGN: Questionnaire survey; the protocol included an advance notification letter and 3 follow-up mailings. SETTING: Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: All active nonspecialist physicians who reported seeing elderly patients in their practices were eligible for inclusion. Fifty health service organization (HSO) physicians {{were randomly selected from}} among those listed with the HSO Mental Health Program, and 200 fee-for-service physicians were randomly selected from the Canadian Medical Directory.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Physicians' ratings of the importance of potential barriers in assisting older people experiencing abuse and of the usefulness of strategies for dealing with elder abuse. RESULTS: Physicians identified the following barriers as fairly or very important: denial of abuse, resistance to intervention, not knowing where to call for help, lack of protocols to assess and respond to abuse, lack of guidelines about confidentiality, fear of reprisal, and lack of knowledge of the prevalence and definition of elder abuse. Strategies deemed to be helpful included a single agency to call, a directory of services, a list of resource people, an educational package, guidelines for detection and management, <b>reimbursement</b> for <b>time</b> spent on legal matters, continuing education, revision of fee structure and a central library of resources on elder abuse.

40|$|Nursing home {{expenditures}} {{have become}} a public policy concern primarily because the Medicaid program payes for approximately 50 percent. Medicaid makes health care available to individuals who otherwise could not afford it, by directly reimbursing nursing homes for Medicaid patient care. Typically, Medicaid reimbursement rates are set by a cost plus method, where the reimbursement per patient is equal to average cost plus some return {{referred to as the}} Medicaid "plus" factor. This paper estimates the elasticity of Medicaid expenditures with respect to a change in the Medicaid "plus" factor,and decomposes that elasticity into price, quality, and quantity components. The decomposition is derived from a model of nursing home behavior, which shows that an increase in the Medicaid "plus" factor causes nursing homes to admit more Medicaid patients and reduce quality. Total expenditures are the Medicaid <b>reimbursement</b> rate <b>times</b> the number of Medicaid patients receiving care. An increase in the Medicaid "plus" factor affects the Medicaid reimbursement by directly raising the Medicaid "plus" factor, and by indirectly decreasing average cost through a reduction in quality. These are the price and quality effects, respectively. The quantity effect is change in the number of Medicaid patients. The elasticities are estimated separately for proprietary and "not for profit" nursing homes using a 1980 sample of New York nursing homes. Uniformly, the proprietary elasticities are approximately twice as large as the "not for profit" elasticities. As expected the price and quantity effects are positive, and the quality effects are negative. In the decomposition, the quality effect is quite important. In fact, ignoring it would lead to a fifty-three percent overestimate of the Medicaid expenditure elasticity. ...|$|R

The teaching and learning are mainly left up to the student and the clinical educators. By setting up a system that encourages online discussion among students undergoing the same clinical rotation specialty, meaningful critical thinking processes backed by scientific evidence can be easily captured. PURPOSE: To encourage student open discussion and use of evidence-based medicine principles, students are required to post discussions and perform assignments that stimulate critical thinking skills. METHODOLOGY: Students perform a combination of activities including, but not limited to patient case discussions, treatment interventions, and evidence-based article reviews during the clinical rotation experience. All students are required to post each week for the first 3 weeks of a core or a selective rotation. Postings to the discussion board are written to reflect thoughtful reflections on the topics and issues.

In this paper, {{we present a}} prototype expense reimbursement system that dramatically reduces the elapsed time and costs involved, by eliminating paper from the process life cycle. Our complete solution involves (1) an electronic submission infrastructure that provides multi-channel image capture, secure transport and centralized storage of paper documents; (2) an unconstrained data mining approach to extracting relevant named entities from un-structured document images; (3) automation of auditing procedures that enables automatic expense validation with minimum human interaction. Extracting relevant named entities robustly from document images with unconstrained layouts and diverse formatting is a fundamental technical challenge to image-based data mining, question answering, and other information retrieval tasks. In many applications that require such capability, applying traditional language modeling techniques to the stream of OCR text does not give satisfactory result due {{to the absence of}} linguistic context.

To date, {{research has focused on}} the concordance between the two most commonly used technologies, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, inter-test concordance reflects only one, albeit important, aspect of the diagnostic process; laboratories, hospitals, and payors must understand the cost and workflow of ALK rearrangement detection strategies. Through literature review combined with interviews of pathologists and laboratory directors in the U.

Interviews were focused on costs of reagents, consumables, equipment, and personnel. The resulting model showed that testing by IHC alone cost less ($ 90. 07 in the U. S., $ 68. 69 in Europe) than either independent or parallel testing by both FISH and IHC ($ 441. 85 in the U. S. and $ 279. 46 in Europe).

40|$|A {{shortage}} {{of primary care}} physicians (PCP) is present nationally and within Kentucky. The shortage is expected to worsen, unless a dramatic increase occurs in the generation of additional primary care clinicians. Geographical maldistributions of PCP also exist. Whereas 20 % of the US population resides in rural areas, only 10 % of physicians practice in these areas. This study explores factors that influence medical students’ decisions to select primary care residency training programs, and to practice in rural areas. Specifically, the levels of debt among 1391 graduates from University of Louisville School of Medicine (ULSOM) during 2001 - 2010 were examined in association with their selection of categories of residency training programs. Similarly, levels of debt among 1180 ULSOM graduates during 2001 - 2008 were examined in association with rural practice locations. Statistical methods included evaluations of receiver-operating curves (ROC) and multiple logistic regression analyses. The ROC analyses showed no association was present for any level of debt with either selection of primary care residency programs or rural practice sites. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed a statistically significant, positive association was present between the two extreme quintiles of medical students’ debt, whereby medical students in the lower quintile of debt were more likely select a primary care residency, compared to those students within the highest quintile. No statistically significant association was found for students’ debt with rural practice location. Multiple policy options to increase the primary care workforce were examined, including raising physicians’ <b>reimbursements,</b> shortening <b>time</b> for medical training, and altering how medical schools finance medical education. Policy makers may also consider the affinity model, whereby increasing medical school admissions among applicants from rural areas may result in greater numbers of PCP that {{are more likely to}} return to practice in rural areas. Similarly, programs to better support rural pipeline programs may be considered. Other policy solutions may include allowing nurse practitioners and other clinical personnel to work at the full scope of their training as well as a fuller utilization of health information technology.

40|$|Abstract Background Home visits are {{claimed to}} be a central element of primary care. However, the {{frequency}} with which home visits are made is declining both internationally and in Germany despite {{the increase in the number}} of chronically ill elderly patients. Given this, the question arises as to how to ensure sufficient primary health care for this vulnerable patient group. The aim of this study was to explore German general practitioners' (GPs) attitudes with regard to the feasibility, burden and outlook of continued home visits in German primary care. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out with 24 GPs from the city of Hannover, Germany, and its rural surroundings. Data was analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results The GPs indicated that they frequently conduct home visits, but not all of them were convinced of their benefit. Most were not really motivated to undertake home visits but some felt obliged to. The basic conditions covering home visits were described as unsatisfactory, in particular with respect to <b>reimbursement</b> and <b>time</b> constraints. House calls for vulnerable, elderly people remained undisputed, whereas visits of a social nature were mostly deleted. Urgent house calls were increasingly delegated to the emergency services. Visits to nursing homes were portrayed as being emotionally distressing. GPs considered good cooperation with nursing staff the key factor to ensure a successful nursing home visit. The GPs wanted to ease their work load while still ensuring quality home care but were unable to suggest how this might be achieved. Better financial compensation was proposed most often. The involvement of specially trained nurses was considered possible, but viewed with resentment. Conclusions Home visits are still an integral aspect of primary care in Germany and impose a considerable workload on many practices. Though the existing situation was generally perceived as unsatisfactory, German GPs could not envisage alternatives if asked to consider whether the current arrangements were sustainable in the future. To guarantee an unaltered quality of primary home care, German GPs and health care policy makers should actively initiate a debate on the need for and nature of home visits in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Adolescent Mental {{health is}} a growing topic of concern for {{pediatric}} nurse practitioners. Adolescents are known for risky behaviors {{that can lead to}} poor health habits, unintentional and intentional injuries. There are recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the National Prevention Council (NPC) to screen adolescents for mental health concerns including depression and suicide. There are established guidelines and evidenced based screening tools to assist practitioners in screening for at risk adolescents. Yet many practitioners are unaware of these screening tools or do not feel comfortable discussing these difficult topics with adolescent. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess Arizona’s Pediatric Nurse Practitioners' attitude, knowledge, and practice behaviors towards adolescent mental health screenings. The Theory of Planned Behavior was used to address the relationship between the practitioner’s perceived predictive behaviors and actual behaviors. By assessing practitioners’ experience with adolescence mental health screening, barriers were identified for planned future implementation studies. Methods: From this DNP project, a survey was created and electronically distributed to members of the Arizona Chapter of NAPNAP. There were 23 participants who completed the survey. A Likert-scale was used to allow the participants to express their experiences and concerns. Results: The survey showed that most pediatric nurse practitioners strongly agreed about the importance of screening adolescent for mental health concerns such as depression and suicide. The survey also found that although the PNPs felt willing to discuss the topics, their lack of knowledge about the recommendations resulted in them not screening every adolescent every time. Conclusion: The survey showed that PNPs identified adolescent with mental health concerns including depression and suicide in their practice. The results of the survey showed the PNPs are willing to discuss these topics, but need more knowledge and training regarding screening tools. In addition, the survey identified the barriers in screening of adolescents' mental health which include financial <b>reimbursement</b> and <b>time</b> management. Future studies should focus on improving mental health education for pediatric practitioners and resources to assist them in screening their adolescent patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} attitudes toward, the {{experience}} with and the knowledge of advance directives of family physicians in Ontario. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: A questionnaire was mailed to 1000 family physicians, representing {{a random sample of}} one-third of the active members of the Ontario College of Family Physicians; 643 (64 %) responded. RESULTS: In all, 86 % of the physicians favoured the use of advance directives, but only 19 % had ever discussed them with more than 10 patients. Most of the physicians agreed with statements supporting the use of advance directives and disagreed with statements opposing their use. Of the respondents 80 % reported that they had never used a directive in managing an incompetent patient. Of the physicians who responded that they had such experience, over half said that they had not always followed the directions contained in the directive. The proportions of physicians who responded that certain patient groups should be offered the opportunity to complete an advance directive were 96 % for terminally ill patients, 95 % for chronically ill patients, 85 % for people with human immunodeficiency virus infection, 77 % for people over 65 years of age, 43 % for all adults, 40 % for people admitted to hospital on an elective basis and 33 % for people admitted on an emergency basis. The proportions of physicians who felt that the following strategies would encourage them to offer advance directives to their patients were 92 % for public education, 90 % for professional education, 89 % for legislation protecting physicians against liability when following a directive, 80 % for legislation supporting the use of directives, 79 % for hospital policy supporting the use of directives, 73 % for <b>reimbursement</b> for <b>time</b> spent discussing directives with patients and 64 % for hospital policy requiring that all patients be routinely offered the opportunity to complete a directive at the time of admission. CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians favour advance directives but use them infrequently. Most physicians support offering them to terminally or chronically ill patients but not to all patients at the time of admission to hospital. Although governments emphasize legislation, most physicians believe that public and professional education programs would be at least as likely as legislation to encourage them to offer advance directives to their patients...|$|R
40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} objectives: Recent health care {{reforms in the}} Netherlands {{have led to the}} {{introduction}} of intermediate health care. Intermediate health care combines features of primary care and secondary (hospital) care. It is characterized by a task shift from hospital care to primary care. The initial experiences of medical specialists and general practitioners with intermediate health care are positive. However, the patients' perspectives regarding this reform are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the level of support from patients with back and/or neck pain for intermediate health care services and to provide insight into their preferences how this care should be organized. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in which members of the patient association for spinal pain in the Netherlands completed electronic questionnaires to measure the level of support and preferred organization of intermediate health care services. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 367 patients (response rate: 51 %). Respondents supported the concept of intermediate health care (numeric rating scale: 7 / 10). Aspects considered important for intermediate health care included knowledge and expertise of staff, multidisciplinary cooperation, patient contact <b>time,</b> <b>reimbursement</b> via health insurance, quality control of care, evidence-based treatments and electronic medical records. Although intermediate care is a health care reform, patients continued to think according to traditional primary and secondary care constitutions. Conclusions: Patients with neck and/or back pain support the introduction of intermediate health care services and have explicit preferences regarding its organization, but may need to be better informed when intermediate care is introduced.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{a leading}} cause of cancer-related deaths around the world. The {{identification}} and description of many modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors to CRC has spurred the development of prevention and early detection protocols and recommendations to help reduce CRC incidence and mortality. Measures to manage CRC include diagnostic screenings and lifestyle changes. As rates of screening increase, prevention counseling rates among primary care providers (PCPs) remain low. Barriers to nutrition prevention reported by PCPs are inconsistent across the literature which has led to confusion about the reason for poor nutrition prevention efforts among PCPs. This practice inquiry (PI) addressed the identified practice gap using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) quality improvement (QI) model. In the "Plan" phase (Chapter 2), a systematic review of the research literature determined existing nutrition recommendations for CRCs and barriers to implementation by PCPs. Development of several nutrition recommendations for fiber, vitamin D, alcohol, red and processed meats intakes, and dietary patterns were outlined for PCP use in practice. Barriers to nutrition prevention implementation were identified as <b>time,</b> <b>reimbursement,</b> knowledge, and health literacy. To augment findings from the literature, a provider survey was completed (Chapters 3 - 4). Barriers identified by the participants (n= 47) include lack of time, education materials, nutrition knowledge, low health literacy, and lack of patient interest. These findings indicate that several changes are needed to improve the use of CRC prevention guidelines, including additional education and education materials, changes in office policy and additional research to create and analyze the interventions recommended to improve existing nutrition prevention counseling for CRC...|$|R
40|$|QUALITY PROBLEM: Undiagnosed chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{contributes}} to a high cost and care burden in secondary care. Uptake of evidence-based guidelines in primary care is inconsistent, resulting in variation in the detection and management of CKD. INITIAL ASSESSMENT: Routinely collected general practice data in one UK region suggested a CKD prevalence of 4. 1 %, compared with an estimated national prevalence of 8. 5 %. Of patients on CKD registers, ∼ 30 % were estimated to have suboptimal management according to Public Health Observatory analyses. CHOICE OF SOLUTION: An evidence-based framework for implementation was developed. This informed the design of an improvement collaborative {{to work with a}} sample of 30 general practices. IMPLEMENTATION: A two-phase collaborative was implemented between September 2009 and March 2012. Key elements of the intervention included learning events, improvement targets, Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, benchmarking of audit data, facilitator support and staff <b>time</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> EVALUATION: Outcomes were evaluated against two indicators: number of patients with CKD on practice registers; percentage of patients achieving evidence-based blood pressure (BP) targets, as a marker for CKD care. In Phase 1, recorded prevalence of CKD in collaborative practices increased ∼ 2 -fold more than that in comparator local practices; in Phase 2, this increased to 4 -fold, indicating improved case identification. Management of BP according to guideline recommendations also improved. LESSONS LEARNED: An improvement collaborative with tailored facilitation support appears to promote the uptake of evidence-based guidance on the identification and management of CKD in primary care. A controlled evaluation study is needed to rigorously evaluate the impact of this promising improvement intervention.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{and budget}} impact of introducing sacral nerve modulation (SNM) {{as a treatment}} for fecal incontinence in Italy were evaluated in a simulation model. METHODS: A decision-analysis model with a Markov submodel was used to represent clinical pathways for treatment of patients with fecal incontinence in a scenario with SNM and a scenario without SNM. Data were obtained from published studies and from an expert panel. Evaluation of resource consumption was conducted {{from the perspective of the}} Italian National Health Service, and costs were retrieved from the Italian NHS procedures <b>reimbursement</b> list. The <b>time</b> horizon was 5 years, and a 3 % discount rate was applied to costs and outcomes. Effectiveness was measured in symptom-free years and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Fecal incontinence prevalence data and SNM usage forecasts were used to estimate budget impact over the next 5 years. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for introducing SNM was (sic) 28, 285 per QALY gained for patients with a structurally deficient anal sphincter and (sic) 38, 662 per QALY gained for patients with intact anal sphincters. If a threshold of (sic) 40, 000 per QALY gained is set as the level that a decision-maker would regard as cost-effective, the probability that the introduction of SNM will be cost-effective would be 99 % for patients with a structurally deficient sphincter and 53 % for patients with an intact sphincter. Budget impact analysis showed that introducing SNM would have an estimated budget impact of 0. 56 % over 5 years on the budget allocated for fecal incontinence treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data show SNM to be an efficient investment with an acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and a limited impact on the total allocated budget for fecal incontinence...|$|R
40|$|PurposeIn 1992, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services instituted the Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) {{system to}} {{determine}} physician reimbursement. Relative value units (RVU) {{were assigned to}} each Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) code and intended to reflect the time and intensity of work. Little data exist correlating actual procedural and clinical time with respect to reimbursement within the RVU value system. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how well this system distributes payments per hour for hospital-based procedures in a single vascular practice in the state of Maryland between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009. MethodsAs part of an ongoing prospective outcomes program, procedural times for all vascular procedures (time into until time out of room) were recorded. Fifteen minutes were added for administrative functions on procedural day, each hospital day, and office visits during the global period. The combination of all times was reflected in the total care time (TCT) for each procedure. We recorded all physician fees collected for each procedure. This total fee collected for each procedure was then divided by the TCT to determine the procedure-specific payment per unit time. All similar procedures were grouped together and the average reimbursement per procedure was reported. ResultsData was collected on all 1103 procedures performed during this period. Insurance carrier distribution was 75 % Medicare and 25 % private insurance. The average reimbursement was $ 316 /hour for open procedures and $ 556 /hour for endovascular. Higher reimbursing procedures included visceral endovascular procedures ($ 701 /hour) and caval filters ($ 751 /hour). Lower reimbursing procedures included lower extremity bypass ($ 292 /hour), dialysis access ($ 268 /hour) and lower extremity amputations ($ 223 /hour). Striking was the difference between payment based on approach for similar conditions. Reimbursement for carotid stent vs carotid endarterectomy was $ 643 /hour vs $ 383 /hour, endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair vs open $ 593 /hour vs $ 359 /hour. ConclusionThis unique study demonstrates a “real world” experience of <b>reimbursement</b> per unit <b>time</b> and raises questions as to the validity of the RBRVS process. The disparity between payments for open and endovascular repair of similar conditions are typical of this inequality. These data do not reflect the intangible time of operative planning, administrative matters, or overhead, and these factors must be considered when interpreting this data. Regardless, this study suggests that capturing detailed financial data is possible and is a more accurate source for future discussions on reimbursement...|$|R
