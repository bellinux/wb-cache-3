40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for processing}} multidimensional data with strong spatial characteristics, such as raw image data, {{characterized by a}} large number of parallel data streams in an ordered array is described. It comprises a large number (e. g., 16, 384 in a 128 x 128 array) of parallel processing elements operating simultaneously and independently on single bit slices of a corresponding array of incoming data streams under control of a single set of instructions. Each of the processing elements comprises a bidirectional data bus in communication with a register for storing single bit slices together with a random access memory unit and associated circuitry, including a binary counter/shift <b>register</b> <b>device,</b> for performing logical and arithmetical computations on the bit slices, and an I/O unit for interfacing the bidirectional data bus with the data stream source.
