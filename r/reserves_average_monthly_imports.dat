50|$|Foreign {{exchange}} reserves {{have increased}} to nearly US$67 billion (as of September 2012) {{due to a}} rise in oil revenues, indicating the improved ability since 2003 {{to deal with the}} repayment of foreign debt, the currency stabilization, and the coverage of <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>imports.</b>|$|R
50|$|Import ratio, in {{economics}} and government finance, is {{the ratio of}} total imports of a country to that country’s total foreign exchange (FX) reserves. The ratio can be inverted and {{is referred to as}} the reserves to imports ratio.

40|$|Petroleum {{prices have}} {{continued}} to rise sharply in 2008, at one time reaching more than $ 140 per barrel of crude oil. At {{the same time the}} <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> volume of <b>imports</b> of energy-related petroleum products has fallen slightly. The combination of sharply rising prices and a slightly lower level of imports of energy-related petroleum products translates into an escalating cost for those imports. The prices of energy imports have been on a steady rise since summer of 2007, defying the pattern of declining energy import prices in the fall. This report provides an estimate of the initial impact of the rising oil prices on the nation's merchandise trade deficit...|$|R

40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) is a subclinical cognitive {{decline in the}} elderly that {{increases the risk of}} conversion to Dementia. Delaying the onset of conversion from normal cognition to MCI has public health relevance by potentially reducing the magnitude of cognitive dysfunction related disability. It has been suggested that cognitive reserve, comprised of IQ and behaviors associated with memory facilitation and problem solving, may delay onset of MCI. Time to onset of MCI may also be associated with the risk factor of the APOE- 4 allele. MCI classification criteria is inconsistent across studies, suggesting additional public health need to standardize an accurate method of screening. This study examined the association between cognitive reserve, APOE- 4, and time to onset of MCI. Data from the 8 year Gingko Evaluation of Memory Study (GEM) clinical trial were used to examine these aims in a sample of n= 2, 284 cognitively normal individuals. The GEM MCI classification algorithm was extended over 8 years to examine normal cognition survival. Indicators of cognitive <b>reserve</b> were IQ, <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> frequency of cognitive reserve behaviors, and number of different cognitive reserve behaviors engaged in each month. APOE- 4 presence was defined as having at least one copy of the APOE- 4 allele. N= 1, 226 (53. 68...|$|R

For those with double peaks there was no correlation with either <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> temperature or precipitation.
