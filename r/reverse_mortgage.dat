40|$|Most elderly hold a {{significant}} portion of their non-pension wealth in housing equity. Although they might prefer to use this housing equity to finance current consumption, to pay for an emergency, or to help out a relative in need, utilizing this wealth, would force the sale of their home. Traditional home equity lines of credit require that principal and interest be paid back over a fixed time interval, yet many elderly want to avoid mortgage payments because they live on a limited income. <b>Reverse</b> <b>mortgages</b> hold the promise of helping elderly homeowners out of this bind by allowing them to borrow against their housing equity and receive monthly payments, while still living in their home until they die or choose to move.; Although <b>reverse</b> <b>mortgages</b> have been offered for more tl~an a decade, the market has never gained significant size.

5000|$|Interest {{compounds}} {{over the}} life of a <b>reverse</b> <b>mortgage,</b> which means that [...] "the mortgage can quickly balloon". [...] Since no monthly payments are made by the borrower on a <b>reverse</b> <b>mortgage,</b> the interest that accrues is treated as a loan advance. Each month, interest is calculated not only on the principal amount received by the borrower but on the interest previously assessed to the loan. Because of this compound interest, as a reverse mortgage's length grows, it becomes more likely to deplete the entire equity of the property. However, with an FHA-insured HECM <b>reverse</b> <b>mortgage</b> obtained in the US or any <b>reverse</b> <b>mortgage</b> obtained in Canada, the borrower can never owe more than the value of the property and cannot pass on any debt from the <b>reverse</b> <b>mortgage</b> to any heirs.
