5|$|Several formats for citing <b>radiocarbon</b> {{results have}} been used since the first samples were dated. As of 2014, the {{standard}} format required by the journal <b>Radiocarbon</b> is as follows.|$|E
5|$|The Aegean prehistorians felt so {{confident}} about their calculations that they rejected early <b>radiocarbon</b> dates in the 1970s for LMI/LCI Thera, as <b>radiocarbon</b> suggested a date about {{a century earlier}} than the traditional dates.|$|E
5|$|Ancient DNA and <b>radiocarbon</b> data {{indicates}} that local genetic populations {{were replaced by}} others within the same species or by others within the same genus. Both the dire wolf and the Beringian wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive, which may have outcompeted the dire wolf. Dire wolf remains having the youngest geological ages are dated at 9,440YBP at Brynjulfson Cave, Boone County, Missouri, 9,860YBP at Rancho La Brea, California, and 10,690YBP at La Mirada, California. Dire wolf remains have been <b>radiocarbon</b> dated to 8,200YBP from Whitewater Draw in Arizona, However, one author has stated that <b>radiocarbon</b> dating of bone carbonate {{is known to be}} unreliable, and that while many dire wolf remains are found in fossil assemblages dated to the terminal Pleistocene, there are no confirmed Holocene finds.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the {{development}} of <b>radiocarbon</b> dating was recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark for its contributions to chemistry and society by the American Chemical Society.|$|E

5|$|<b>Radiocarbon</b> dated {{samples from}} the cromlech show the tomb was {{accessed}} by many generations {{over a period of}} 300–800years, and that the human bones are the disarticulated remains (i.e., not complete skeletons) of at least 40individuals: male and female adults, adolescents, children, and infants. One of the red deer bones has been <b>radiocarbon</b> dated to between 2750BP and 2150BP, showing {{that at least some of}} the bones entered long after the site had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} given above produce {{dates in}} <b>radiocarbon</b> years: i.e. dates {{that represent the}} age the sample {{would be if the}} / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to <b>radiocarbon</b> ages to obtain calendar dates.|$|E
5|$|The dating of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on <b>radiocarbon</b> dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 {{using a combination of}} <b>radiocarbon</b> dating and ceramic evidence.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{dates for}} his reign (1194 to 1170 BC) were {{suggested}} by David Rohl, {{but these were}} rejected {{by the majority of}} Egyptologists even before the <b>radiocarbon</b> date was published in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Dry {{valleys and}} {{sheltered}} areas feature grasses. A permanent spring {{is found in}} Quebrada de las Zorritas. Deposits in this valley indicate that between 2,436.8 ± 49 and 1,593.1 ± 36 <b>radiocarbon</b> years ago runoff was more intense.|$|E
5|$|Errors in {{procedure}} {{can also}} lead to errors in the results. If 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates, scintillation counting will give a <b>radiocarbon</b> age that is too young by about 80 years.|$|E
5|$|Hilde Levi (9 May 1909– 26 July 2003) was a German-Danish physicist. She was {{a pioneer}} {{of the use of}} {{radioactive}} isotopes in biology and medicine, notably the techniques of <b>radiocarbon</b> dating and autoradiography. In later life she became a scientific historian, and published a biography of George de Hevesy.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} {{is a key}} {{marker for}} the Bronze Age chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean world. It provides a fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the second millennium BCE in the Aegean, {{as evidence of the}} eruption is found throughout the region. Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE. <b>Radiocarbon</b> dates, including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the <b>radiocarbon</b> dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculation}} uses Libby's half-life of 5,568 years, not {{the more}} accurate modern value of 5,730 years. Libby’s {{value for the}} half-life is used to maintain consistency with early <b>radiocarbon</b> testing results; calibration curves include a correction for this, so the accuracy of final reported calendar ages is assured.|$|E
5|$|The <b>radiocarbon</b> dating of {{the human}} remains {{does not provide a}} date for the {{construction}} of Coldrum Long Barrow itself; {{it is possible that the}} individuals died either some time before or after the monument's construction.|$|E
5|$|This {{extinction}} {{date for}} Babakotia radofilai {{is based on}} a single <b>radiocarbon</b> date from one specimen. For this reason, it is hard to tell when this species became extinct or how it is related to other lemur species.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the wooden}} beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Cedar of Lebanon and cypress. <b>Radiocarbon</b> dating {{indicates}} a large range of ages, some as old as 9th-century BCE, showing {{that some of the}} wood had previously been used in older buildings.C Dating of Carved Panels and Beams from the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Journal of Archaeological Science, (1997) 24, 1045–1050.|$|E
5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. <b>Radiocarbon</b> dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence {{has been found to}} suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{died out}} {{relatively}} recently {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. Babakotia radofilai lived during the Holocene epoch and is thought to have disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, possibly within the last 1000 years. However, the only <b>radiocarbon</b> date that has been reported for it dates back to about 31002800BCE.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was <b>radiocarbon</b> dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E
5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly above the water line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using <b>Radiocarbon</b> dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. <b>Radiocarbon</b> dating on postholes and pits {{in the area}} show activity from 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and barley grains {{have been found in}} these excavations. Tests show that most of the barley was dehulled, but that absence of such debris may mean that the cereal was brought in from other areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, {{the young}} Danish {{archaeologist}} J. J. A. Worsaae disagreed the Haraldskær Woman was Gunnhild. A pioneer in archaeological stratigraphy, Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldskær Woman dated from the Iron Age. Later <b>radiocarbon</b> dating confirmed {{the body was}} not Gunnhild, but rather {{a woman of the}} early Iron Age who lived about 490 BC. Though no one proved the Haraldskær Woman has any royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north transept of Saint Nicolai Church.|$|E
5|$|It {{was assumed}} {{at first that}} the lake existed in a single long {{interval}} between 1000-1500; however, later a succession of wet and dry phases was determined from <b>radiocarbon</b> dating. Each phase was stable for prolonged times. About three or four highstands were identified in the lake, one theory assumes four highstands between 695-1580. One chronology assumes these highstands occurred 100 BC - 600 AD, 900-1250 and 1300-1500. Six or five different cycles are documented in Coachella. At Superstition Mountain five lake cycles from 817-964, 1290-1330, 1440-1640, 1480-1660, 1638-1689 and 1675-1687 are documented; the 1440-1640 cycle may have consisted of four sub-cycles that occurred within short time distances from each other. An older highstand was observed at East Mesa and dated to 3,850 years before present. At least 12 different cycles of lake growth and lake shrinkage occurred over the last 2,000 - 3,000 years. <b>Radiocarbon</b> dates of the highstands range 300 ± 100 to 1,580 ± 200 before present. The basin was probably not entirely dry between the last three highstands. The Colorado River Delta shows evidence of reduced sedimentation while the river drained into Lake Cahuilla.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, <b>radiocarbon</b> dating {{techniques}} date {{an object}} of popular interest, for example the Shroud of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to Denmark, {{she worked with}} the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen to develop <b>radiocarbon</b> dating equipment. This was {{put to the test}} in 1951, dating the Grauballe Man. Autoradiography was then used by the Finsen Institute to investigate the effects of the radiocontrast agent thorotrast. Levi was a consultant at the Danish National Board of Health from 1952 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radiocarbon</b> {{dates are}} {{generally}} {{presented with a}} range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of the}} mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum <b>radiocarbon</b> laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radiocarbon</b> dating {{determined}} that the papyrus is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas. The fragment's provenance and similarity to another fragment from the same anonymous owner widely believed to be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that the text is a modern forgery written on a scrap of medieval papyrus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radiocarbon</b> dating has {{established}} {{the dates of}} three of Mount Tambora's eruptions before the 1815 eruption, although their magnitudes are unknown. The estimated dates are sometime between 4110 and 3700 BC, around 3050 BC, and sometime between 590 and 890 AD. Each of them were explosive, central vent eruptions with similar characteristics, but the 590-890 AD eruption caused no pyroclastic flows.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radiocarbon</b> dating of {{the human}} remains {{suggested}} that some {{were brought to the}} site between either 3980–3800 calibrated BCE (95% probability) or 3960–3880 cal BCE (68% probability). It further suggested that after an interval of either 60–350 years (95% probability) or 140–290 years (68% probability), additional depositions of human remains were made inside the tomb. This second phase probably began in 3730–3540 cal BCE (95% probability) or 3670–3560 cal BCE (68% probability).|$|E
5|$|<b>Radiocarbon</b> dating tests {{conducted}} on 1QpHab and 4QpPsa at the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility gave a {{one standard deviation}} confidence interval of 104-43 BCE and a two sigma confidence interval of 120-5 BCE (97%); for 4QpPsa (4Q171) the one standard deviation confidence interval was 22-78 CE and the two sigma confidence interval was 5-111 CE. Earlier paleographic dating of 1QpHab indicated a date range of 30-1 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, {{it is very difficult to}} get satisfactory <b>radiocarbon</b> dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.|$|E
5|$|Some anomalously old <b>radiocarbon</b> {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla {{deposits}} {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake. In addition, discrepancies between shell and other organic material ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E
5|$|The K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally {{that has}} been {{calculated}} as during the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts. <b>Radiocarbon</b> dating has pushed back the calculations of the K'iche' conquests by three centuries, and researchers now say their conquest of the Mam kingdoms may have taken place {{as early as the}} 12th century. The city was dominated by the K'iche' until the Spanish Conquest of the early 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The Yorkshire Wolds {{became a}} major focus for human {{settlement}} during the Neolithic period as they had {{a wide range of}} natural resources. The oldest monuments found on the Wolds are the Neolithic long barrows and round barrows. Two earthen long barrows in the region are found at Fordon, on Willerby Wold, and at Kilham, both of which have <b>radiocarbon</b> dates of around 3700BC.|$|E
5|$|The age of most dire wolf localities is {{determined}} solely by biostratigraphy, but biostratigraphy is an unreliable indicator within asphalt deposits. Some sites have been <b>radiocarbon</b> dated, with C.dirus specimens from LaBrea pits dated in calendar years as follows: 82 specimens dated 13,000–14,000YBP; 40 specimens dated 14,000–16,000YBP; 77 specimens dated 14,000–18,000YBP; 37 specimens dated 17,000–18,000YBP; 26 specimens dated 21,000–30,000YBP; 40 specimens dated 25,000–28,000YBP; and 6specimens dated 32,000–37,000YBP. A specimen from Powder Mill Creek Cave, Missouri, was dated at 13,170YBP.|$|E
