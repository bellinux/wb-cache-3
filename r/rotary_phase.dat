40|$|In this work, an {{improved}} hybrid MoM/FDTD algorithm for modeling low to ultra high field MRI RF coil/sample interactions has been proposed. In our previous hybrid MoM/FDTD method, {{the accuracy of}} modeling MRI RF coils is generally hindered by two major issues, staircasing errors and rough approximation of the coil current distortions by electromagnetic reflections from sample. In view of this, a Huygen 2 ̆ 7 s equivalent surface method has been proposed to effectively bridge MoM and FDTD. In the improved hybrid MoM/FDTD algorithm, staircasing errors are eliminated, and most importantly the complex coil/tissue interactions are explicitly accounted for.

40|$|Radiofrequency (RF) coils {{for use in}} MRI {{can have}} a {{significant}} effect on both the signal-to-noise-ratio of MR images and the specific absorption rate inside the biological sample. In the past, prototypes were constructed and tested to investigate the performance of the RF coils and often required several iterations to achieve an acceptable result. However, with the advancement in computational electromagnetic techniques, RF coil modelling has now become the modus operandi of coil design because it can produce accurate numerical results, thus reducing the time and effort spent in designing and prototyping RF coils. Two hybrid methods -method of moments (MoM) /finite difference time domain (FDTD) and MoM/finite element method (FEM) - for RF coil modelling are presented herein. The paper provides a brief overview of FDTD, FEM and MoM. It discusses the hybridisation of these methods and how they are integrated to form versatile techniques. The numerical results obtained from these hybrid methods are compared with experimental results from prototype coils over a range of operating frequencies. The methods are then applied to the design of a new type of phased-array coil - the <b>rotary</b> <b>phased</b> array. From these comparisons, it can be seen that the numerical methods provide a useful aid for the design and optimisation of RF coils for use in MRI. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

This {{is the second}} report {{of a series of}} three planned deliverables and it details the rotary-wing 6 -DOF analytical development and the technical preparation activities performed to carry out, in the subsequent phases of the program, experimental research work in the RMIT industrial wind tunnel and in flight. A suitable form of the aircraft 6 DOF model is presented that will be used as a basis {{for the development of a}} complete rotary wing 6 DOF model for the StopRotor aircraft. The derivatives and coefficients are to be acquired using various engineering methods including: analytical tools, wind tunnel experiments (utilizing the RMIT industrial Wind Tunnel) and experimental flight test. In addition to the 6 DOF model for fixed-wing configuration presented in report 1, this report presents preliminary analysis of the main performance parameters relevant to the <b>rotary</b> wing flight <b>phase.</b> Due to the complexity of the full experimental aerodynamic analysis of the StopRotor in its rotary wing configuration, some derivatives will be approximated using the engineering methodologies presented in this report and others will be taken from the wind tunnel experiments. Wind tunnel experiments are more complex than those of the fixed wing configuration. This is mainly due to the rotary wing aerodynamics and the fluids interaction to the surrounding environment. In this case the StopRotor is situated inside a closed wind tunnel. The floor and walls surrounding the StopRotor will significantly influence the flow. As this is a common problem with wind tunnel testing of rotary wing aircraft, suitable correction factors can be applied to account for the influence of these items as described in the report...|$|R

50|$|In 1894, Hungarian {{engineer}} Kálmán Kandó {{developed a}} new type 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Cephalosporium stripe, {{caused by}} the soil-borne ascomycete Cephalosporium gramineum, is {{becoming}} an increasingly important disease of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) in several areas of the world, especially where stubble mulch is practiced to maintain soil moisture and prevent erosion. As cultural control of the disease is infeasible and no fungicides are registered, the development of resistant cultivars offers {{the best hope for}} disease control. Selection of resistant genotypes remains problematic due to the requirements of evaluating adult plants in variable field environments. The symptoms of cephalosporium stripe suggest the involvement of pathogen-produced toxins, and the toxin called graminin A has previously been isolated from C. gramineum. The goals of this thesis were to determine if insensitivity of wheat genotypes to a toxic fraction produced by C. gramineum is associated with resistance to cephalosporium stripe, and to evaluate the potential use of this toxic fraction to screen wheat genotypes for disease resistance. A method was developed to mass-produce a toxic fraction of C. gramineum by modifying the method of K. Kobayashi (Kobayashi and Ui 1977). Large volumes (9 L) of broth medium were inoculated with C. gramineum and incubated for 35 days. The culture filtrate was then extracted four times with ethyl acetate, which eliminated need for the most time-consuming step of <b>rotary</b> evaporation. Reversed <b>phase</b> fractionation of the crude extract was used to isolate the toxic fraction. Leaves from fourteen-day-old wheat plants were excised and placed in scintillation vials containing the toxic fraction. Exposure to a concentration of(60 μl/ml) of the toxic fraction for 72 hours produced distinct wilting symptoms that allowed us to distinguish wheat genotypes in a repeatable manner. Degree of wilting was measured on a continuous 1 - 5 scale, where 1 = no wilting and 5 = a fully wilted leaf. Twenty wheat genotypes, belonging to four distinct germplasm groups (common, club, durum, and synthetic) were included in three runs of the toxin assay. Wilting reactions for the 20 genotypes were very consistent among runs. Sensitivity of the individual genotypes to the toxic fraction did not differ significantly within germplasm groups, but all differences among the means of the four germplasm groups were highly significant (P< 0. 001) based on linear contrasts. Seventeen winter wheat genotypes representing the common, club, and durum germplasm groups were planted in infested fields at two locations. The percentage of tillers showing whitehead symptoms (early maturity and reduced grainfill) was significantly correlated with wilting symptoms measured by the toxin assay. The common and durum genotypes varied more for disease susceptibility than for toxin insensitivity. However, all pairwise linear contrasts between means of the whitehead percentages for the three germplasm groups were highly significant (P< 0. 001). Failure of the toxin assay to identify some of the moderately resistant common wheat genotypes suggests that additional mechanisms of resistance are operative. As no toxin-insensitive genotype showed susceptibility to cephalosporium stripe in the field experiments, however, the toxin assay can be used as an initial screening procedure {{to reduce the number of}} genotypes to be tested in the field...|$|R

Most main lines' cargo and passenger trains were hauled by the MÁV Class 424 steam locomotive, which became the MÁV's workhorse in the late steam era. From 1928 onwards 4- and 6-wheeled gasoline (and later diesel) railcars were purchased (Class BCmot) and by 1935 57% of branch lines were served by railcars.

In 1894, Kálmán Kandó developed high-voltage three-phase AC motors and generators for electric locomotives. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system.

5000|$|In 1973 (per {{the table}} below), DC {{traction}} at 3,000 volts, lost about 3 {{times as much}} energy (percentage-wise) in the catenary as AC at 25,000 volts. Paradoxically, {{it turned out that}} DC locomotives were somewhat more efficient overall than AC locomotives. [...] "Auxiliary Electric Motors" [...] are mainly used for air cooling electric machinery such as traction motors. Electric locomotives concentrate high power electric machinery in a relatively small space and thus require a lot of cooling. [...] Per the table below, a sizeable amount of energy (11-17%) is used for this, but when operating at nominal power only 2-4% is used. [...] The fact that the cooling motors run at full speed (and power) all the time makes their power consumption constant, so when the locomotive motors are operating at low power (far below the nominal regime) the percent of this power used for cooling blowers becomes much higher. The result is that under actual operating conditions, the percent energy used for cooling is a few times higher than [...] "nominal". Per the table below, AC locomotives used about 50% more energy for this purpose since in addition to cooling the motors, the blowers must cool the transformer, rectifiers and the smoothing reactor (inductors), which are mostly absent on DC locomotives. [...] The 3-phase AC power for these blower motors is supplied from a <b>rotary</b> <b>phase</b> converter which converts single phase (from the catenary via the main transformer) to 3-phase (and this also takes energy). It's proposed to reduce blower speeds when less cooling is needed.|$|E
