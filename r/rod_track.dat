The horn must be sounded when departing a station, at one point where the track parallels the currently unused PeopleMover/Rocket <b>Rod</b> <b>track,</b> and when approaching the Matterhorn. They are also sounded when a bird lands on the track, and as a greeting to passing Disneyland Railroad trains near the switch to the barn. The original monorails were equipped with horns that sounded more like real ground-level trains.|$|E

Analysis the inverse kinematics of the 5 R mechanism, we can {{concluded that the}} 5 R is given two original moving parts, you can uniquely identify the pose of the rod end of the implementation of parts, but in seeking the position and orientation inverse solution, the only connecting <b>rod</b> <b>track</b> can not determine the only two original moving parts. We can solve this problem with the minimum principle that {{the square of the}} residuals between the prime mover rotation angle of adjacent track points. Finally, we show the program diagram of teaching and playback. The system has such advantages as simple structure, movement speed, large workspace, motor casing fixed, load drive capability and light weight...|$|E

40|$|Tie <b>rods</b> or <b>Track</b> <b>rods</b> are an {{integral}} part of vehicle’s steering system. Just as its name suggests a Tie rod ties vehicle’s steering rack to the steering arm. Tie rod may get fail due to varying forces and bumping of vehicle during steering. The forces from the steering are also considered during the static condition of car. Vibration and buckling of Tie rod has been continuously a concern which may lead to structural failure if the resulting vibration and stresses are undesirable and excessive. So research work is aimed to assess buckling strength and compare buckling performance of Tie rod for different materials. Finite element models of the Tie rod also analyzed to obtain stiffness and stress distributions in each component. Based on the experimental test results, theoretical calculation results and finite element analysis with NASTRAN results, stiffness values are validated. The mode shape and natural frequency results for different materials obtained in the normal modal analysis are compared. In buckling analysis, the load factor obtained for different materials were compared and critical buckling load is calculated and is validated by theoretical calculations...|$|R

50|$|The {{shaft of}} the {{steering}} control was connected directly to the <b>track</b> <b>rods</b> controlling the front wheels, resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme ("lock to lock"). The handlebar-shaped steering control would be operated with small, controlled inputs by swivelling the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than the}} {{preceding}} [...] "turntable" [...] steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, {{close to its}} own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied {{to the end of}} a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of the steered wheels. A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the steering arms of the hubs appeared to [...] "toe out". As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same [...] "toe out".|$|R
