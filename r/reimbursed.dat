5|$|A {{number of}} African nations {{did not show}} up in time, for various reasons such as {{difficulties}} flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get <b>reimbursed</b> later). Former Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image. On 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel. Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though. He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be <b>reimbursed</b> upon arrival. Finally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018. In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).|$|E

5|$|In September 2007, it was {{reported}} that the U.S. Justice Department has launched a formal investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Hsu and his associates.

The provision was not included in ACA.|$|E

In July 2013, a design-build contract for the highway was awarded to Jr. Davis Construction Company, based in Kissimmee. The total contract amount was $69,013,443.76, representing $68,788,000.00 for the original contract and $225,443.76 for changes to the project after bidding.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House.

It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully <b>reimbursed</b> Keating's company.|$|E

5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were <b>reimbursed</b> when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that they seem to have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{developed}} the Southwest, the Colorado River {{was seen as}} a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley. Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea, the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be <b>reimbursed</b> by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be <b>reimbursed</b> for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E

5|$|C. b. graptogyne, (Endangered) {{known as}} the {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo, is found in southwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia in an area bordered by Mount Gambier to the west, Portland to the south, Horsham to the northeast and Bordertown to the north. The smallest of the five subspecies, it was only recognised as distinct in the 1980s. It is predominantly dependent on stands of Eucalyptus baxteri (brown stringybark), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river redgum) and Allocasuarina luehmannii (buloke) for feeding and nesting. These tree species have been all threatened by land clearing and most remaining are on private land; possibly only 500–1000 individuals remain. The subspecies and its habitat {{are the subject of}} a national recovery plan. In 2007 local landowners are being <b>reimbursed</b> for assisting in regenerating suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|Clark's major {{military}} achievements occurred before his thirtieth birthday. Afterwards, he led militia {{in the opening}} engagements of the Northwest Indian War but was accused of being drunk on duty. He was disgraced and forced to resign, despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations. He left Kentucky {{to live on the}} Indiana frontier but was never fully <b>reimbursed</b> by Virginia for his wartime expenditures. He spent the final decades of his life evading creditors and living in increasing poverty and obscurity. He was involved in two failed attempts to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic. He became an invalid after suffering a stroke and the amputation of his right leg. He was aided in his final years by family members, including his younger brother William, {{one of the leaders of}} the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He died of a stroke on February 13, 1818.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 {{the band}} {{returned}} to BOSS Studios to record enough material for two full-length albums. Both were originally offered to Alternative Tentacles, {{with the first}} being Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac. Before either album could be released, though, Alternative Tentacles had to acquire the master tapes from Bob O'Neill, BOSS Studios' namesake and owner. He refused to release them until he'd been <b>reimbursed</b> for the sessions, and Alternative Tentacles couldn't immediately afford to pay. After months of waiting, the band issued the concert recording Live PCPPEP on Alternative Tentacles out of financial desperation in September 1984. Mostly made up of live performances of songs from their debut, it prompted some critics and fans to joke that they had released the same album twice. Meanwhile, Bob O'Neill was preparing to release Psychic... on his own Ward 9 label to recoup his expenses.|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Energy (DOE) contracts with not-for-profit universities and private companies to operate its facilities. As {{part of the cost}} of operating these facilities, DOE can <b>reimburse</b> its contractors for the litigation costs associated with cases brought against them. Each year the department spends millions of dollars in such reimbursements. For the most part, litigation expenses involve the costs of outside counsel and resulting judgments and settlements for a variety of types of cases, such as equal employment opportunity, radiation and/or toxic exposure, personal injury, wrongful termination of employment, and whistleblower protections. Rep. Edward J. Markey asked GAO to study the extent to which DOE <b>reimburses</b> its contractors' litigation costs and the process for doing so. GAO obtained information on (1) how much DOE spends to <b>reimburse</b> litigation costs for its contractors, (2) what major criteria DOE uses to <b>reimburse</b> its contractors for litigation costs and how it implements these criteria, (3) what major criteria the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration use to <b>reimburse</b> their contractors for litigation costs, (4) {{the extent to which a}} state university that is a DOE contractor has a valid immunity defense to a lawsuit, and (5) the extent to which state universities that are DOE contractors have invoked immunity as a defense. ...|$|R
