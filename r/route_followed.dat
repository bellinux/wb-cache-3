5|$|King's Highway 90, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 90, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The route connected Barrie with the town of Angus and CFB Borden. The highway was designated in 1937. During the early 1960s, the highway was realigned within Barrie in order to have it interchange with Highway400; originally the <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> Tiffin Street. At the beginning of 1998, the entire highway was transferred to the City of Barrie and Simcoe County; it is now known as Simcoe County Road 90.|$|E

5|$|Past Escondido {{the route}} passed through Fallbrook using {{portions}} {{of what is}} now SR 78 and SR 76 before returning to I-15 near Temecula. This portion was straightened to the route of modern I-15, by 1960. Past Temecula, the <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> SR 79, SR 74, I-215 and I-15 until reaching the modern terminus in Hesperia. This part would also be straightened with the construction {{of what is now}} I-215. In 1969, the portion south of Hesperia was removed and assigned to other routes.|$|E
5|$|When the New England {{road marking}} system was adopted in 1922, Route 2 was {{assigned}} to a route from New Haven north via Hartford and Springfield towards Sherbrooke, Quebec. This <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> the older blue-banded route from New Haven north to Hartford. At Hartford, Route 2 crossed the Connecticut River on the Bulkeley Bridge and ran north from East Hartford to Springfield {{on the east side}} of the river.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Langham and Dalmeny {{were both}} {{a part of}} the {{historical}} Provincial Highway 5 they are not located directly upon the Yellowhead Highway (Saskatchewan Highway 16) presently. This survey crossed the North Saskatchewan River twice before reaching North Battleford.

5|$|NY21 {{originally}} {{extended from}} the Pennsylvania state line {{in the south to}} Lake Ontario in the north when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. South of Hornell, the <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> modern NY36. NY21 was rerouted to follow its current alignment south of Hornell in the 1950s and truncated on its northern end to Williamson in 1980. Other changes of local importance, mostly realignments to bypass communities along the route, have also occurred at various points in the route's history. NY21 originally had an alternate route around Canandaigua Lake; however, that highway—designated NY21A—was eliminated in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|NY63 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The initial routing of NY63 was significantly different from its modern alignment; in fact, the only portion of modern NY63 that still follows its original alignment is the section between Hampton Corners and Pavilion. South of Mount Morris, the <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> what is now NY408 to Dalton and continued south on Old State Road and west on Allegany County's CR16 to NY19 west of the village of Angelica. NY63 overlapped NY19 south to Belvidere, where NY63 turned onto modern CR20. It continued west on CR20 and NY446 through Cuba to a junction with NY16 in Hinsdale, where it ended. North of Pavilion, NY63 followed modern NY19 to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Hamlin.|$|E
5|$|NY9M {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY8 (now CR53) {{north of the}} hamlet of Starbuckville {{in the town of}} Horicon. The <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> Valentine Pond Road north for a negligible distance, then progressed westward along the eastern bank of the Schroon River on East Schroon River Road. Across the river, Carl Turner Road, a locally maintained highway, followed a routing parallel to that of NY9M on the other shore. Both roads gradually curved northward, mirroring a similar turn in the river's course. Carl Turner Road came to an end here; however, NY9M continued on. Near a junction with modern-day Short Street, NY9M began to deviate from the river.|$|E

5|$|The roadway {{which became}} Alt US40 in Garrett and Allegany {{counties}} is, with some realignments, the <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> by the National Road through western Maryland. Various historic sites {{associated with the}} National Road can be found along Alt US40, including a toll-gate house (La Vale Tollgate House) and mile-marker in LaVale. The toll-gate house in LaVale is the last remaining toll-gate house on the National Road in Maryland. Several historic bridges from the National Road, since bypassed by newer bridges, are still present along the route of Alt US40, including the Casselman Bridge over the Casselman River in Grantsville and a bridge in Clarysville.|$|E
5|$|When Maryland {{assigned}} state route {{numbers in}} 1927, MD 2 was designated between Solomons and Baltimore. The <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> Solomons Island Road from Solomons to west of Annapolis, where it ran concurrent with US 50 {{into the city}} on West Street. MD 2 passed through downtown Annapolis on College Avenue and King George Street before it left {{the city on the}} Severn River Bridge and continued north along BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard to Glen Burnie. From Glen Burnie, MD 3 continued along BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard while MD 2 headed north to Baltimore and connected to Potee Street. MD 2 was designated in Baltimore in 1939 to follow Hanover Street north to US 1.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. Highway System was {{established}} in 1926, the routing of US 1 in New Jersey was to follow the Lincoln Highway from the Lower Trenton Bridge in Trenton to Newark, which was Route 13 between Trenton and New Brunswick and Route 1 north of there. From Newark, the <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> present-day US 1/9 Truck east toward Jersey City, where it was {{to head to the}} Holland Tunnel. The Lincoln Highway the first transcontinental highway in the United States created in 1913 to link New York City to San Francisco. Route 13 had been legislated along the Trenton to New Brunswick portion in 1917.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{iron ore}} {{is high in}} {{phosphorus}} {{and needs to be}} mixed with purer ores, such as those on the west coast in Cumberland and Lancashire. In the early 1850s this ore was travelling the long way round over the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway to the Barrow-in-Furness area, and Durham coke was returning. Both the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway (SD) and the Eden Valley Railway (EVR) companies were formed on 20 September 1856. Taking advantage of the new railway at Barnard Castle, the SD crossed the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to meet the West Coast Main Line (WCML) at Tebay, on the section then controlled by the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway, and also linked Barnard Castle with West Auckland. The EVR was a branch from Kirkby Stephen to the WCML near Penrith via Appleby. The routes were surveyed by Thomas Bouch and SD received permission on 13 July 1857. The EVR <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> the east bank of the River Eden, a mile longer than a more expensive route on the west bank, and its Act received royal assent on 21 May 1858.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{designated}} the primary northsouth roadway {{along the west}} bank of the Hudson River from the New Jersey state line near New York City to Albany, now largely US9W, as Route3, an unsigned legislative route. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route3 became part of the new NY10, which initially began at the New Jersey state line and ended in Saranac Lake. North of Albany, the <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> modern NY5, NY50, and NY9N through Schenectady and Saratoga Springs to reach the North Country at Lake George. Past this point, NY10 continued north on what is now US9, NY8, NY28, NY28N, and NY30 to Tupper Lake via Chestertown, Wevertown, North Creek, and Long Lake. At Tupper Lake, the route headed east on current NY3 to Wawbeek before taking a more circuitous route to Saranac Lake by way of modern NY30, NY186, and NY86.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Route 17S was legislated {{along the}} current <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> by Route 44 today, running between Penns Grove and Westville. The only portion of Route 17S ever built ran from Penns Grove to Salem. Route 44 was {{designated}} in 1927 to replace Route 17S between Penns Grove and Westville. By the 1940s, Route 44 was extended south to Salem and US 130 was designated concurrent with the route north of Penns Grove. Several spurs of Route 44 had existed or were planned prior to 1953, including Route S44, which ran concurrent with US 322 to the ferry between Bridgeport and Chester, Pennsylvania; Route S44A, a never-built bypass of Camden; and Route 44T, {{which was to}} run from a tunnel under the Delaware River in Paulsboro east to Route 42. In 1953, Route 44 was replaced by US 130 north of Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. After two bypasses were built for US 130 around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville, Route 44 was redesignated along the former US 130. After I-295 was completed in the 1960s, US 130 returned to its original alignment in Carneys Point and replaced that portion of Route 44.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{promoters}} for a canal was Richard Prat, who was {{a lawyer}} in Glastonbury, had been the town clerk since 1813, and held several important offices in the town. He saw the canal {{as a way to}} halt the economic downturn in the town and its drainage problems, and called a meeting in August 1825, at which a firm plan was formulated. Richard Hammett, a local man from Street, was commissioned to conduct a survey of the route in 1826. Hammett had experience of building a manure canal through peat heathland. He considered two main routes; the first followed the course of the River Brue, but was rejected on the grounds of engineering costs, and the interference with its drainage function. The second <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> the South Drain, which had been newly constructed following floods in 1794, to connect with the River Brue near Cripps Bridge, and to re-use the old course of that River at Highbridge to create a basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of Route 18 through Middlesex County from Middlesex to Highland Park was first designated in the 1926 designing {{of a new}} highway system as State Highway Route S-29, a prefixed spur of New Jersey Route 29 (U.S. Route 22) through Middlesex County. The <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> Washington Avenue in Middlesex and the River Road in Piscataway until terminating at State Highway Route 27 near the Albany Street Bridge in Highland Park. By {{the time of the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the route was re-designated as State Highway Route S-28. This route was a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 28 in Middlesex, following Raritan Avenue and River Road through Piscataway and Highland Park, joining State Highway Route 27 on a concurrency into New Brunswick, and onto George Street in New Brunswick southward. After New Brunswick, Route S-28 continued southward through East Brunswick, Old Bridge and Browntown before terminating at State Highway Route 4 (U.S. Route 9) in Matawan.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} {{originally}} become DE 404 was an unimproved county road, with the section east of Bridgeville under contract {{as a state}} highway. The entire route of what would become DE 404 was completed as a state highway to a point northwest of Bridgeville by 1924. By 1931, the road was built as a state highway northwest to the Maryland border. DE 404 was designated to run from the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 404, southeast to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville by 1936. The <b>route</b> <b>followed</b> its current alignment to Bridgeville, where it passed through the town on Market Street and South Main Street before picking up its current alignment east of US 13. At this time, what is now DE 404 past its then-eastern terminus was designated as part of DE 18. By 1987, DE 404 was extended east to DE 1 in Five Points, following DE 18 to Georgetown and US 9 (which had replaced a portion of DE 18) from Georgetown to Five Points. DE 404 Alt. was created to bypass Bridgeville {{to the north and}} east by 1990, following Newton Road and US 13. The alternate route became a part of mainline DE 404 by 1999, with the former DE 404 through Bridgeville becoming DE 404 Bus.|$|E
