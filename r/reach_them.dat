5|$|During the War of 1812, Presque Isle {{played a}} part in the victory over the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. Oliver Hazard Perry, {{commander}} of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay as a place to construct six of the nine ships in his fleet. Using this location protected the men by creating an obstacle, forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields. These airfields may also be used for other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding may be difficult to accommodate. This can limit the number of available airfields and so it can require longer drives to <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like many seabirds storm petrels will {{associate}} with {{other species of}} seabird and marine mammal species {{in order to help}} obtain food. It is theorised that they benefit from the actions of diving predators such as seals and penguins which push prey up towards the surface while hunting, allowing the surface feeding storm petrels to <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|Stenson's voice <b>reached</b> <b>them</b> {{from the}} other side of the ridge.|$|R

5|$|When Blackbird {{learned of}} this, he ordered {{an attack on}} the Kitkehahkis. The Omahas descended upon the band's village, burned and plundered many of the lodges, and killed about one hundred Pawnees at the cost of about fifteen of their own men. The {{remaining}} Kitkehahkis had withdrawn into four lodges, occupying a position too strong for the Omahas to <b>reach</b> <b>them</b> and massacre them without unacceptable losses.|$|E
5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could <b>reach</b> <b>them</b> and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to <b>reach</b> <b>them</b> and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee on April 9, 1865, White and the remaining part of his company traveled to North Carolina to join Confederate Army forces {{under the command of}} General Joseph E. Johnston, but Johnston and his forces had already surrendered before White and his troops could <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b> White and the remnants of his company disbanded without surrendering or being paroled, and White returned to Romney around June 1, 1865.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Kelli is {{depicted}} {{as a member of}} the Delta Alpha Kappa sorority. Due to being an only child and not having a large family, she decides to spend Christmas with her sorority sisters. Unfortunately, their sorority house was once the childhood home of notorious murderer Billy Lenz. During Christmas, Kelli and her sisters begin getting obscene phone calls. Realizing that Billy has returned home, the girls attempt to survive the night as, due to a snowstorm, help is unable to <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} a hard-hat diver, sent down {{to recover the}} gold and other valuables, found the bodies of two women {{at the foot of}} the saloon staircase, one with her arm around the other. The diver tried to <b>reach</b> <b>them</b> to take a lock of hair or some other {{personal}} item that could be identified by their loved ones, but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's cabin was recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.|$|E
50|$|The Duff Islands {{were named}} after missionary ship Duff, captained by James Wilson, which <b>reached</b> <b>them</b> in 1797.|$|R
60|$|A sound {{familiar}} to the nautical ears of Lord Felixstowe <b>reached</b> <b>them</b> from the bows of the ship.|$|R
60|$|He {{rolled up}} the map resolutely and laid it aside, and soon {{afterward}} Mrs. Graham's voice <b>reached</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{second wave}} set off from Singapore at 16:15, {{consisting}} of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b> Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this wave. Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons {{who participated in}} the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured. The returning pilots were congratulated by Air Vice-Marshal Paul Maltby, who promised them that further daylight attacks were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{remembers that}} an {{anti-virus}} {{is in the}} lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he stole and released the virus. He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to <b>reach</b> <b>them,</b> a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.|$|E
5|$|As rations {{and water}} dwindled, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made}} on 10 June to rescue {{the men in the}} stranded barge with support from artillery and aircraft. While Corsairs flew close support missions, Beaufort and Mitchell bombers dropped life rafts but the survivors were unable to <b>reach</b> <b>them</b> due to machine-gun fire. Further casualties occurred when, in the early morning of 11 June, a Japanese soldier managed to reach the vessel and fired upon the occupants with a machine-gun, killing two and wounding others before he was killed himself. Shortly after this a Japanese anti-tank gun fired two shells at the landing craft, destroying its stern. Further shots were prevented when Australian artillery ranged in on the gun, having been directed by Captain John Whitelaw, an artillery observer on one of two landing craft that had been despatched with canvas assault boats, crewed by engineers from the 16th Field Company.|$|E
60|$|They rose {{to their}} feet. The sound of Sir Timothy's voice <b>reached</b> <b>them</b> as they ascended the stairs.|$|R
60|$|Not a {{sound from}} the other {{buildings}} had <b>reached</b> <b>them,</b> nor did any one {{appear to be in}} sight.|$|R
60|$|They {{were still}} wrangling {{there in a}} most unseemly fashion when a trumpet-blast <b>reached</b> <b>them</b> from beyond the walls.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b> Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.|$|E
5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her. This was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to <b>reach</b> <b>them,</b> with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
5|$|In March 1695, captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, and native muleteers; four Dominican friars led by Criollo friar Agustín Cano accompanied the expedition. Theoretically the Spanish soldiers were provided solely as an escort for the Dominicans. The Guatemalan expedition, under orders of President Jacinto de Barrios Leal, were secretly trying to reach the Itzas before Martín de Ursúa could <b>reach</b> <b>them</b> from Yucatán; the existence of the expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between Guatemala and the governor of Yucatán. It formed a part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Petén and neighbouring Chiapas; the other two expeditions were launched against the Lakandon.|$|E

60|$|Belllounds <b>reached</b> <b>them.</b> He was {{frothing}} at the mouth. He cocked {{the rifle}} and thrust it toward Wade, holding low down.|$|R

5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b> It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E
5|$|The Belgo-Congolese {{situation}} remained difficult {{until early}} June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to <b>reach</b> <b>them.</b> They {{then decided to}} try and sever the Italian supply line between Saïo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack. It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Saïo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered {{by the arrival of}} a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Saïo was being supplied.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{fighting}} around Oosterbeek, {{there had been}} short localised truces around the aid posts to allow the wounded to <b>reach</b> <b>them,</b> but by Sunday the situation needed a more serious arrangement. Colonel Graeme Warrack—the senior medical officer—asked permission to arrange a truce; it was a request that Urquhart agreed to. Warrack was taken to see Bittrich who similarly agreed and offered Warrack as many supplies as he could carry. Between 15:00 and 17:00, a general ceasefire went into effect around the perimeter and about 450 stretcher cases and walking wounded were evacuated from the perimeter, the Germans using jeeps and ambulances to take serious cases straight to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Arnhem where British, German and Dutch medical staff worked side by side.|$|E
