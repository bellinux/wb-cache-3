In this process, the sheets are bent into desired shapes by repeating local deformation due to the hammering. The forming process is divided into roughing and finishing operations. In the roughing operation, the sheet is hammered in accordance with a sequence stored in a database. On the other hand, the roughly formed shape is corrected by hammering at points of large differences of shape in the finishing operation.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{remarkable}} demands on electronic and other portable compact devices, the need to produce various miniaturized parts, particularly those made from metallic sheet is growing. In other words, in order for manufacturing companies to stay in competition, they are required to develop new and innovative fabricating processes to produce micro components with more complex features and a high standard of quality and functionality. Microforming is a micro fabrication process that can be employed efficiently for mass production with the advantages of greatly minimizing material waste and producing highly accurate product geometry. However, since the clearance between the rigid tools, i. e. punch and die, utilized in microforming techniques is relatively very small, there is a high risk of damaging the tools during the forming operations. Therefore, the use of forming tools made of flexible materials in sheet metal forming processes at micro scale has powerful potential advantages. The main advantages include a reduction in the production cost, eliminating the alignment and mismatch difficulties, and also the creation of parts with different geometrical shapes using the same flexible tool. As the workpiece is in contact with a flexible surface, this process can significantly improve the quality of the obtained products. Despite these clear advantages, micro flexible forming techniques are currently only utilized in very limited industrial applications. One {{reason for this is that}} the deformation behaviour and failure mode of sheet metals formed at micro scale are not yet well understood. Additionally, the experience-based knowledge of the micro-forming process parameters is not sufficient, particularly when flexible tools are used. Hence, to advance this technology and to improve the production quality of formed micro parts, more investigation of the key process parameters related to the material deformation are needed. The main contribution of this work is the development of a novel technique for achieving micro deep drawing of stainless steel 304 sheets using a flexible die and where an initial gap (positive or negative) is adopted between the blank holder plate and an adjustment ring utilized in the size-scaled forming systems developed for this purpose. The interesting point here is that this study presents the first attempt of employing flexible material as a forming die tool in the micro deep drawing technology to produce micro metallic cups at different scaling levels. Polyurethane rubber materials are employed in this study for the forming flexible die with various Shore A hardness. Also, the stainless steel 304 sheets utilized for the workpieces have different initial thicknesses. Various parameters that have a significant influence on the sheet formability at micro scale are carefully considered, these include initial gap value, rubber material properties, initial blank thickness, initial blank diameter, friction coefficients at various contact interfaces, diameter and height of the <b>rubber</b> <b>die</b> and process scaling factor. The size effect category of process dimension was also taken into account using similarity theory. Three size-scaled micro deep drawing systems were developed correspondingly to three different scaling factors. In each case, finite element simulations for the intended micro drawing systems are performed with the aim of identifying optimum conditions for the novel forming methodology presented in this thesis. The numerical models are built using the known commercial code Abaqus/Standard. To verify the microforming methodology adopted for the proposal technique as well as to validate the predictions obtained from simulations, an appropriate number of micro deep drawing experiments are conducted. This is achieved using a special experimental set up, designed and manufactured to fulfil the various requirements of the micro-forming process design procedure. The new knowledge provided by this work provides, for the first time, a predictive capability for micro deep drawing using flexible tools that in turn could lead to a commercially viable production scale process. ...|$|E

This fact can sometimes justify the call for simpler, qualitative engineering approximations. By adding in the flow equations the dependence of the viscosity function on the third invariant of the rate of deformation tensor, it becomes possible to consider some effects of extensional viscosity in axisymmetric and 3 D flows. We observe an increase in the pressure drop and the onset of recirculation patterns.

50|$|Thailand {{ranks as}} the world's largest rubber {{producer}} and exporter, producing around 4.3 million tonnes per year, while consuming only 519,000 tons. It provides about 40 percent of the world's natural rubber, mostly used in aircraft and automobile tires. But the rubber industry has faced a series of challenges. Alongside drought in 2015-2016, Thailand was hit hard by an oversupply in international rubber markets. Following a record harvest in 2011, Thailand increased rubber acreage by 45 percent. Other top producers in the region followed suit. Concomitantly, China's demand for rubber decreased by 10 percent. China is the world's largest natural rubber consumer, using 4,150,000 tons in 2013. At one point {{the price of the}} world's benchmark smoked rubber sheet dropped as low as US$1.27 per kilogram, or 80 percent below the record high of US$6.40 per kg in February 2011. Similarly, rubber futures in Shanghai have dropped by 22 percent and the export price of Thai rubber by 23 percent. Then, as prices began to rebound, the southern provinces of Thailand, where two-thirds of the Thai rubber plantations are located, were hit by torrential rains and flooding {{at the peak of the}} rubber-tapping season. The Rubber Authority of Thailand forecasts that output will drop 7.6 percent in 2017. Farmers, unable to harvest rubber sap due to high water, are unable to take advantage of the highest rubber prices in four years. Largely due to the flooding, prices for unsmoked USS3 rubber sheets in Nakhon Si Thammarat have increased steadily and reached 84.32 baht (US$2.38) per kilogram in January 2017 and will likely go higher.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Irrigation {{scheduling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important cultural practices in irrigated vineyards. Water holding capacity of soil is arguably therefore one of the most important characteristics of a soil as it determines how much water can be made available to the plant. The measurement of water holding capacity of soils is time consuming and costly. In situ determinations are often impractical to determine. For routine determinations, water holding capacity is therefore determined on disturbed samples. Such a method for example is the rubber ring method. A great deal of criticism surrounds this rubber ring method and results are often questioned. The objectives of this study were therefore to determine what the relationship was between undisturbed and disturbed samples and to determine whether compacted samples could give a more accurate representation of the water holding capacity of soil. Soil textural factors influencing the volumetric water content of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples at 5, 10 and 100 kPa were investigated. In addition, soil textural properties influencing water holding capacity of the respective samples between 5 and 100 kPa and 10 and 100 kPa were investigated. The final objective of the study was to develop simple models to predict the volumetric water content and water holding capacity of soil. Undisturbed and disturbed soil samples were taken at various localities to ensure a wide range of textures. Water holding capacity of undisturbed and disturbed samples was determined at ARC Infruitec-Nietvoorbij using the standard air pressure and ceramic plate technique and the routine rubber ring method respectively. Soil samples were also compacted to a bulk density of approximately 1. 5 g. cm- 3 as a further treatment for determination of water holding capacity using the air pressure and ceramic plate technique. To investigate aspects of soil texture that could possibly influence volumetric water content of the soil, correlations were done between different texture components and volumetric water content of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples at 5, 10 and 100 kPa. In order to determine the effect of texture on water holding capacity of the soil, correlations were drawn between texture components and water holding capacity of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples between matric potential ranges 5 and 100 kPa and 10 and 100 kPa. The results from this study were used to develop models to predict volumetric soil water content and water holding capacity of soils for a range of soils. Volumetric water content of rubber ring samples at 5 kPa was more than the volumetric water content of undisturbed samples at 5 kPa. The volumetric water content of rubber ring samples at 5 kPa and the volumetric water content of undisturbed samples at 5 kPa was correlated by 87 %. Volumetric water content of compacted samples at 5 kPa had a 85 % degree of correlation with the volumetric water content of undisturbed samples. At 10 kPa, the correlation between volumetric water content determined using rubber ring samples and undisturbed samples was 77 %. This was identical to the correlation between volumetric water content of compacted samples at 10 kPa and undisturbed samples. At 100 kPa, most of the rubber ring samples' volumetric water content fell below the 1 : 1 line of volumetric water content of undisturbed samples. The volumetric water content of all the compacted samples was higher than that of the undisturbed samples. Water holding capacity of all the rubber ring samples between 5 and 100 kPa was greater than the water holding capacity of the undisturbed samples between 5 and 100 kPa. Rubber ring samples therefore generally overestimated the water holding capacity of the soil. The water holding capacity of most of the rubber ring samples between 10 and 100 kPa was greater than the water holding capacity of the undisturbed samples. In contrast, the water holding capacity of compacted samples between 5 and 100 kPa was less than the water holding capacity of undisturbed samples between 5 and 100 kPa. Water holding capacity of compacted samples was therefore underestimated. The results from this study confirmed that the influence of clay and silt content on volumetric water content of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples increased as the suction on the respective samples is increased. The influence of fine sand content on volumetric water content of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples decreased with an increase in matric potential to 100 kPa. Medium sand content of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples had the greatest influence of all the textural components on the volumetric water content of the respective samples at 5 kPa and 10 kPa. Water holding capacity of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples between 5 and 100 kPa was greatly influenced by the fine sand content of the samples. Medium sand content of the samples also had an influence on the water holding capacity thereof. To predict the volumetric water content of undisturbed samples at 5, 10 and 100 kPa, the independent variables were fine sand content, square root of medium sand content and In of medium sand content. In the case of models to predict the volumetric water content of rubber ring samples at 5, 10 and 100 kPa, the same variables were used as independent variables. Additional variables such as silt content, the In of silt content, square root of clay plus silt content and the medium sand content. To predict the volumetric water content of compacted samples at 5, 10 and 100 kPa the terms used were silt content, clay plus silt content, the e-clay plus silt content. medium sand content and the square root of medium sand content. The models to predict volumetric water content of rubber ring samples gave the best correlation with the actual volumetric water content of rubber ring samples. The final models to predict the water holding capacity of all the samples between 5 and 100 kPa and 10 and 100 kPa used only fine and medium sand parameters as independent variables. Soil textural components do play an important role in determining the volumetric water content of undisturbed, rubber ring and compacted samples at 5, 10 and 100 kPa. The magnitude of the water holding capacity between 5 and 100 kPa and 10 and 100 kPa is also influenced by soil texture. The models developed to predict the volumetric water content of samples at 5, 10 and 100 kPa and the magnitude of the water holding capacity between 5 and 100 kPa and 10 and 100 kPa could be very useful. Both time and money can potentially be saved. Models that can be highly recommended are the models generated for the undisturbed samples. These are: At 5 kPa, VWCu = 0. 47259 - 0. 04712 medium sando. s At 10 kPa, VWCu = 0. 41292 - 0. 04221 medium sandos At 100 kPa, VWCu = 0. 48080 - 0. 00254 fine sand - 0. 0865 In medium sand Between 5 and 100 kPa, WHCu = - 29. 523 + 3. 394 fine sand Between 10 and 100 kPa, WHCu = - 891. 794 + 232. 326 In fine sand + 38. 006 In medium sandAFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Besproeiingskedulering is een van die belangrikste wingerdverbouingspraktyke. Waterhouvermoë bepaal hoeveel water beskikbaar gestel kan word aan die plant en daarom is dit een van die belangrikste eienskappe van 'n grond. Die meting van waterhouvermoë van grond is tydsaam en duur. Boonop is in situ bepalings dikwels onprakties om te bepaal. Waterhouvermoë word dus bepaal op versteurde monsters vir roetine ontledings.

Die doel van hierdie studie was dus om te bepaal wat die verwantskap is tussen onversteurde monsters en rubberring monsters asook om te bepaal of gekompakteerde monsters 'n meer akkurate aanduiding sou gee as onversteurde monsters van die waterhouvermoë van die grond. Grondtekstuur faktore wat die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters by 5, 10 and 100 kPa beïnvloed, was ondersoek. Grondtekstuur faktore wat waterhouvermoë van die onderskeie monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa en tussen 10 en 100 kPa beïnvloed, was ook ondersoek. Die finale doelwit van die studie was om eenvoudige modelle te ontwikkel vir die voorspelling van volumetriese waterinhoud en waterhouvermoë van grond. Onversteurde grond monsters en grond vir versteurde monsters is by verskeie lokaliteite geneem om 'n wye reeks teksture te verkry.

Om aspekte van grondtekstuur, wat moontlik die volumetriese waterinhoud van grond kan beïnvloed te ondersoek, is korrelasies tussen verskeie tekstuur komponente en die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters by 5, 10 en 100 kPa bepaal. Om te bepaal watter tekstuur komponente waterhouvermoë van die grond kan bepaal, is korrelasies getrek tussen tekstuur komponente en waterhouvermoë van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa en tussen 10 en 100 kPa. Die data is verwerk met die SAS uitgawe 6. 12 (SAS, 1990) om modelle vir die voorspelling van volumetriese waterinhoud en waterhouvermoë van grond met behulp van maklik kwantifiseerbare grondtekstuur veranderlikes te ontwikkel. Die volumetriese waterinhoud van rubberring monsters by 5 kPa was meer as die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters by 5 kPa. Die volumetriese waterinhoud van rubberring monsters by 5 kPa en die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters by 5 kPa is gekorreleerd met 87 %. Die volumetriese waterinhoud van gekompakteerde monsters by 5 kPa het 'n korrelasie van 85 % met volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters getoon. By 10 kPa, was die graad van korrelasie tussen volumetriese waterinhoud bepaal met rubberring monsters en onversteurde monsters, 77 %. Dit was omtrent dieselfde as die graad van korrelasie tussen volumetriese waterinhoud van gekompakteerde monsters en onversteurde monsters by 10 kPa. By 100 kPa het die meeste van <b>die</b> <b>rubberring</b> monsters se volumetriese waterinhoud onderkant die 1 : 1 lyn van die volumetriese waterinhoud by 100 kPa van al die onversteurde monsters. Die volumetriese waterinhoud van al die gekompakteerde monsters was hoër as die van die onversteurde monsters. Die waterhouvermoë van al <b>die</b> <b>rubberring</b> monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa was groter as die van die onversteurde monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa. <b>Die</b> <b>rubberring</b> monsters het dus oor die algemeen die grootte van die waterhouvermoë oorskry. Die waterhouvermoë van die meeste van <b>die</b> <b>rubberring</b> monsters tussen 10 en 100 kPa was groter as die waterhouvermoë van die onversteurde monsters. Die waterhouvermoë van gekompakteerde monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa was minder as die waterhouvermoë van die onversteurde monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa. Die waterhouvermoë van gekompakteerde grondmonsters is dus onderskat. Die resultate van hierdie studie het die invloed van klei- en slik- inhoud op die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters bevestig. Die invloed van klei en sand op die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters het toegeneem soos die matriks potensiaal op die onderskeie monsters toegeneem het. Die invloed van fynsand op die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters was die grootste by 5 kPa en het afgeneem tot by 100 kPa. Die mediumsand inhoud van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters het van al die tekstuur komponente die grootste invloed op die volumetriese waterinhoud van al die monsters by 5 kPa en 10 kPa gehad. Die waterhouvermoë van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa is grootliks beinvloed deur die fynsand inhoud van die monsters. Die mediumsand inhoud van die monsters het ook 'n invloed gehad op die waterhouvermoë daarvan. Om die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters by 5, 10 en 100 kPa te voorspel, is onafhanklike veranderlikes soos fynsand inhoud, vierkantswortel van mediumsand inhoud en In van mediumsand inhoud bepaal. In die geval van modelle om die volumetriese waterinhoud van rubberring monsters by 5, 10 en 100 kPa te voorspel, is dieselfde veranderlikes gebruik as onafhanklike veranderlikes. Addisionele veranderlikes soos slik inhoud, In van slik inhoud, die vierkantswortel van die klei plus slik inhoud en die mediumsand inhoud is ook gebruik. Om die volumetriese waterinhoud van gekompakteerde monsters by 5, 10 en 100 kPa te voorspel, is die terme slik inhoud, klei plus slik inhoud, e-klei plus slik inhoud, mediumsand inhoud en vierkantswortel van mediumsand inhoud gebruik. Die modelle om volumetriese waterinhoud van rubberring samples te voorspel het die akkuraatste voorspellings gegee. Die finale modelle, om waterhouvermoë van alle monsters tussen 5 en 100 kPa en tussen 10 en 100 kPa te bepaal, het slegs fyn en mediumsand as onafhanklike veranderlikes gebruik. Grondtekstuur komponente speel dus 'n belangrike rol in die volumetriese waterinhoud van onversteurde monsters, rubberring monsters en gekompakteerde monsters by 5, 10 en 100 kPa. Die grootte van die waterhouvermoë tussen 5 en 100 kPa en tussen 10 en 100 kPa is ook beinvloed deur die grondtekstuur. Die modelle wat ontwikkel is om die volumetriese waterinhoud van monsters by 5, 10 en 100 kPa en die grootte van die waterhouvermoë tussen 5 en 100 kPa en tussen 10 and 100 kPa te voorspel, kan baie waardevol wees. Tyd en geld kan potensieel bespaar word. Die modelle wat hoogs aanbevole is, is die modelle vir onversteurde monsters. Die modele is: By 5 kPa, VWlo = 0. 47259 - 0. 04712 rnedlumsand?" By 10 kPa, VWlo = 0. 41292 - 0. 04221 mediumsando. s By 100 kPa, VWlo = 0. 48080 - 0. 00254 fynsand - 0. 0865 In mediumsand Tussen 5 en 100 kPa, WHVo = - 29. 523 + 3. 394 fynsand Tussen 10 en 100 kPa, WHVo = - 891. 794 + 232. 326 In fynsand + 38. 006 In mediumsan...|$|R
