30|$|In the {{previous}} section, we omitted {{the analysis of}} availability (A). When not considering rejuvenations, A can be deduced by integrating the reliability (R) across time and normalizing the result to the MT (see (19) in the Appendix). Both R and A increase with rejuvenations, because it becomes more difficult for an attack to succeed in surpassing the intrusion tolerance thresholdf. However, with rejuvenations A has the extra benefit of accounting also the moments of correctness obtained after a first global failure. Thus, A is positive even for an infinite mission time (MT). This is pertinent whenever global failure is not considered as a catastrophic event and the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> is considered worthy. The focus of A {{is not on the}} first global failure (probability of never failing), but instead on the accumulated delivery of service (probability of not being failed at a random instant).|$|E

5000|$|... The 17 km Onuma Koen - Shikabe line {{opened in}} 1929, {{and had the}} misfortune to be {{affected}} by a volcanic eruption just six months later, which closed it for two months. It closed in 1945 when the Shikabe station on the Sawara line opened, but as the new station was some distance from the township, locals agitated for <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> to the original station. This occurred in 1948 when the last 11 km of the line from Choshiguchi was reopened by the local government, but competition from bus services resulted in the line being permanently closed in 1952.|$|R

50|$|The {{district}} was further opened {{up when the}} domestic telegraph line reached Burketown in October, 1886. The Queensland Government had originally hoped that Burketown would be the terminus for an international telegraph line from Java to Australia. Inter colonial rivalry saw the contract for the overseas line go to South Australia in November, 1872. Although the Queensland Government was disappointed, the line was completed to Normanton. However, the link to Burketown was not completed until 1886 after the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> government <b>services</b> to the district.|$|R
50|$|In March 2004, {{following}} {{the resignation of}} President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a transition government was created. This government, together with the donor community, prepared the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF), which set a strategy for increasing political and social stability and promoting economic growth. This framework was to guide investments {{of the international community}} until September 2007. One of the top priorities laid out was the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> continuous electricity <b>service.</b> The progress assessment conducted by the ICF in the end of 2005, showed that only 25% of the objectives for the electricity sector had been met.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 {{proposals}} were submitted to Cheshire West & Chester Council, {{the owners of}} the southern section of the Wirral Country Park, for the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> rail <b>services</b> on the Wirral Way as a heritage steam railway. The proposals initially envisaged the running of steam trains from Hadlow Road to Hooton railway station where the disused platforms are still extant. It was then envisaged that the line would be extended northwards to a new station on the outskirts of Neston, giving a total running length of four miles. The diverted cycle and walking track would run alongside the railway line, in a similar way to that seen at the Avon Valley Railway. The proposal would see a direct main line connection to Merseyrail services at Hooton as well as a walking-distance connection with the Borderlands line at Neston railway station.|$|R

40|$|Conservation and {{environmental}} management are principal countermeasures to {{the degradation of}} marine ecosystems and their services. However, in many cases, current practices are insufficient to reverse ecosystem declines. We suggest that restoration ecology, the science underlying the concepts and tools needed to restore ecosystems, must be recognized as an integral element for marine conservation {{and environmental}} management. Marine restoration ecology is a young scientific discipline, often with gaps between its application and the supporting science. Bridging these gaps is essential to using restoration as an effective management tool and reversing the decline of marine ecosystems and their services. Ecological restoration should address objectives that include improved ecosystem services, and it therefore should encompass social-ecological elements rather than focusing solely on ecological parameters. We recommend using existing management frameworks to identify clear restoration targets, to apply quantitative tools for assessment, {{and to make the}} <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> a criterion for success. </p...|$|R
50|$|Sturdee {{retired in}} April 1950 and Rowell {{became the first}} Duntroon {{graduate}} to become Chief of the General Staff, the post of Vice Chief disappearing for a generation. Within months, Australian troops would be committed to the Korean War. Rowell paid visits to Korea in 1952 and 1953. He presided over the Korean War expansion of the Regular Army, the National Service Scheme, and the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> the women's <b>services.</b> Rowell, as Chief of the General Staff, was Army's chief mourner at Blamey's funeral in 1951, also serving {{as one of the}} pallbearers along with Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, John Northcott, Stanley Savige, Vernon Sturdee, and Henry Wells. For his <b>services</b> as Chief <b>of</b> the General Staff, Rowell was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 1953.|$|R
50|$|With {{the line}} {{presently}} physically {{disconnected from the}} main Shepparton Line north of Nagambie Station, the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> a passenger and freight service will only be realised upon physical reconnection of the line to the Shepparton Line. With {{the entirety of the}} Cobram Line in place, the re-connection and <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> points and appropriate junction signalling, repair to crossings, lights, bella and station platforms will allow the resumption <b>of</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carolina Southern stopped {{railroad}} {{service to}} the county in 2012, and efforts to restore service have proven difficult. However, as of July 2014, positive developments were reported to return railroad {{service to the}} area, a move considered necessary for spurring economic development in the area. Carolina Southern agreed, in July 2014, {{to begin the process}} allowing the counties of Horry County, South Carolina, Marion, South Carolina and Columbus County, NC to assume control of the area rail lines with the hopes repairing the railroad tracks and bridges and then finding a buyer to re-establish service to the area. A public hearing on the matter was held on October 6, 2014. During the October 6th meeting, the Columbus County Commissioners voted to support the initiative to restart rail service with a 10-year grant for the program. Some of the commissioners may not have revealed that they will benefit from the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> rail <b>service.</b> The Horry County Council, in a vote on October 7, 2014 also voted to provide funding to reestablish railroad service to the area. Although originally it was thought service could be restored as early as spring 2015, however, the sale of the railroad was not completed until August, 2015 to R.J. Coleman Railroad.. A new target date of February 2016 was announced, as millions of dollars are expected to be spent repairing the rail lines that have been idle since 2011.|$|R
