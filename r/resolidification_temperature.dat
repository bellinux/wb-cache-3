30|$|A 5.00 g coal sample, {{ground to}} pass a 425 μm sieve, was {{compacted}} around the rabble arm of a stirrer in a metal crucible {{with the help of}} the preparatory facility. The arm was linked to a motor that provides torque that rotates the stirrer in the compacted coal mass. At the onset, the torque was so small that the stirrer could not rotate when the coal mass was in the solid state. At a point, when the coal mass softened as a result of heat transfer from the lead bath and carbonization temperature increase, fluid was produced as recorded by the rotation of the stirrer which was conveyed via a sensor to the digital output unit, indicating the softening temperature (°C), <b>resolidification</b> <b>temperature</b> (°C), maximum fluidity temperature (°C) and maximum fluidity in dial division per minute (DDPM).|$|E
40|$|Hydrochars were {{obtained}} after hydrous pyrolysis of a pine Kraft lignin using different reaction conditions (temperature, water content and residence time) and the residues were characterized through {{a wide range}} of analytical techniques including high-temperature rheometry, solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The results indicated that an increase in reaction temperature, an increase in residence time or a decrease in water content reduces the amount of fluid material in the residue. The hydrous pyrolysis conditions studied were not able to increase the maturation of lignin, which would result in an increase in the <b>resolidification</b> <b>temperature,</b> but reduced the amount of mineral matter in the hydrochar produced. On the other hand, the hydrochars obtained from pristine lignin, torrefied lignin (300 °C, 1 h) and their 50 : 50 wt. %/wt. % blend at temperatures of 350 °C after 6 h using 30 ml of water had lower ash contents (45 %) is excessively high compared to that of the good coking coal (10 %) and the micro-strength of the biocokes (R 1 39 %) and high microporous surface areas (> 400 m 2 /g) of the biocokes and high alkalinity index of the lignins (> 27 %) compared to those of the coke (27 % and 145 m 2 /g) and coal (0. 6 %), respectively. Furthermore, the biocoke derived from the hydrous pyrolysed torrefied lignin did not agglomerate, which could not be explained by changes in the chemical properties of the material and requires further investigation...|$|E
