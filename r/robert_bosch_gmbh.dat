50|$|The first video {{standards}} converters were analog. That is, {{a special}} professional video camera that used {{a video camera}} tube would be pointed at a Cathode ray tube video monitor.

These were the high end converters of the 1960s and 1970s. Image Transform in Universal City, California, used the Fernseh converter and in the 1980s made their own custom digital converter.

25|$|In September 1914, at {{the start}} of World War I, Ferdinand von Zeppelin visualised the concept of a Riesenflugzeug (R) bomber, to be larger than the then-nascent Friedel-Ursinus twin-engined {{military}} aircraft. Using engineers from the <b>Robert</b> <b>Bosch</b> <b>GmbH,</b> he created the Versuchsbau Gotha-Ost (VGO) consortium in a rented hangar at the Gotha factory. Alexander Baumann became his chief engineer, although later the team included other noted engineers including Zeppelin's associate Claudius Dornier, the 1915 pioneer of all-metal aircraft construction in Hugo Junkers and Baumann's protogé Adolph Rohrbach. Almost all of these Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug designs used some variation of either pusher configuration and/or push-pull configuration in their engine layout, orientation and placement of their powerplants.|$|E

This interview addressed {{the prevalence of}} the Internet of Things in manufacturing and the consequent technology-driven changes which promise to trigger a new industrial revolution. At Bosch, and generally in Germany, this phenomenon {{is referred to as}} Industry 4.0. The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, businesses are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other autonomously.|$|R

2500|$|Traction is {{assisted}} {{by way of}} Audi's [...] "Electronic Differential Lock" [...] (EDL), which is a specific function of the <b>Robert</b> <b>Bosch</b> <b>GmbH</b> ESP8.0 Electronic Stability Programme system. [...] EDL monitors the rotational speeds of {{the left and right}} wheels across an individual axle, and if one wheel should rotate faster than the other (exceeding the pre-defined parameters), indicating loss of traction, or [...] "wheel spin" [...] on one wheel, the EDL applies the brakes to that individual spinning wheel, and thus results in transferring torque across the open differential to the wheel on the other side deemed to have grip, hence traction. [...] Also included in the ESP8.0 is [...] "Anti Slip Regulation" [...] (ASR)—Audi's name for Traction Control System.|$|E
2500|$|E100 {{imposes a}} {{limitation}} on normal vehicle operation, as ethanol's lower evaporative pressure (as compared to gasoline) causes problems when cold {{starting the engine}} at temperatures below [...] For this reason, both pure ethanol and E100 flex-fuel vehicles are built with an additional small gasoline reservoir inside the engine compartment to help in starting the engine when cold by initially injecting gasoline. [...] Once started, the engine is then switched back to ethanol. An improved flex-fuel engine generation was developed to {{eliminate the need for}} the secondary gas tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing them to start at temperatures as low as , the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. The Polo E-Flex, launched in March 2009, was the first flex-fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The warming system, called Flex Start, was developed by <b>Robert</b> <b>Bosch</b> <b>GmbH.</b>|$|E
