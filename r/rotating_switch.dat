50|$|A {{coil of wire}} {{rotating}} in {{a magnetic}} field produces a current which changes direction with each 180° rotation, an alternating current (AC). However many early uses of electricity required direct current (DC). In the first practical electric generators, called dynamos, the AC was converted into DC with a commutator, a set of <b>rotating</b> <b>switch</b> contacts on the armature shaft. The commutator reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180° rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process. It {{was used by the}} firm of Elkingtons for commercial electroplating.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} between an alternator and a generator is that the alternator delivers AC (alternating current) to the external circuit, while the generator delivers DC (direct current). In both machines alternating current is induced in the armature, but the type of current delivered to the external circuit depends {{on the way in}} which the induced current is collected. In an alternator, the current is collected brushes bearing against slip-rings; in a generator, a form of <b>rotating</b> <b>switch</b> called the commutator is placed between the armature and the external circuit. The commutator is designed to reverse the connections with the external circuit at the instant of each reversal of induced current in the armature, producing rectified current or direct current. This rectified current is not pure like the current of a voltaic cell but is instead a pulsating current that is constant in direction and varying in intensity.|$|E
50|$|Selective-fire weapons, by definition, have a {{semi-automatic}} mode, {{where the}} weapon automatically reloads the chamber after each fired round, but requires the trigger be released and pulled again before firing the next round. This allows for rapid and (in theory) aimed fire. In some weapons, the selection is between different rates of automatic fire and/or varying burst limiters. The selection is often {{by a small}} <b>rotating</b> <b>switch</b> often integrated with the safety catch or a switch separate from the safety, as in the British SA80 family. Another method is a weighted trigger, such as the Steyr AUG, which will fire a single shot when 8.8 - 15.4 pounds of weight is exerted on the trigger, and then become fully automatic when over 15.4 pounds of weight is applied. This is useful for emergency situations where a rapid volley of rounds is more effective for suppressing a close enemy rather than a single-round burst.|$|E

Instead of an analytical derivation, an automatic generation of cubic splines is introduced to model the magnetic flux. The flux linkage functions obtained from the improved flux tube method indicate that the method offers good accuracy compared to finite element based analysis, but with significantly improved computational efficiency. The approach is applicable to translating and <b>rotating</b> <b>switched</b> reluctance machines of various topologies and therefore enables rapid design search and optimization of novel topologies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{chaperonin}} GroEL drives its protein-folding cycle by cooperatively binding ATP {{to one of}} its two rings, priming {{that ring}} to become folding-active upon GroES binding, while simultaneously discharging the previous folding chamber from the opposite ring. The GroEL-ATP structure, determined by cryo-EM and atomic structure fitting, shows that the intermediate domains <b>rotate</b> downward, <b>switching</b> their intersubunit salt bridge contacts from substrate binding to ATP binding domains. These observations, together {{with the effects of}} ATP binding to a GroEL-GroES-ADP complex, suggest structural models for the ATP-induced reduction in affinity for polypeptide and for cooperativity.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems {{have become the}} {{cornerstone}} of the future of Wireless communications. The performance of these systems in terms of channel capacity has meant that transmission rates that were impossible some years ago can be real nowadays. Unfortunately, MIMO systems have a characteristic that can mean a problem in the Wireless and mobile market, in where the eagerness to minimize the size of the devices is one of the mainly objectives. This non-desirable characteristic is the difficulty when compacting multiple active antennas (and, hence, their corresponding radiofrequency chains) in a handset terminal. Therefore, the idea of finding other alternatives that could emulate the behaviour of having multiple antennas represents a quite attractive and wide research area. The use of parasitic elements seems to be the most effective alternative when designing compact antennas for MIMO systems. In fact, the inclusion of these elements around an active antenna allows us to orient the beam towards different directions, what can be a quite interesting approach to have multiple antennas. Therefore, the idea is simple: just having one active element and a set of parasitics surrounding it, we can orient the beam towards different directions in order to maximize the channel capacity with a small impact on the features and with clear advantages in terms of compacting and cost. In this sense, parasitic elements can be used in order to implement different kinds of antennas. Two of the most common are Adaptive Antennas and <b>rotating</b> <b>Switched</b> Parasitic Antennas. In this thesis, we will explore both possibilities, and two different antenna technologies will be researched: monopoles antennas and patch antennas. A complete study of both of them will be carried out and the research will be oriented to two mainly aspects: antenna performance and achieved channel capacity. Ingeniería de Telecomunicació...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{introduces}} an algorithm {{for blind}} adaptation of decision feedback equalizers (DFE), which is applied for equalization in the passband domain. The transmission scheme, which {{is assumed to}} be unknown at the receiver side, can either be carrierless amplitude/phase (CAP) modulation or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). As the input signal of the passband equalizer is real-valued, the tap weights of the complexvalued feedback filter cannot be identified by a standard whitening approach. We propose therefore an algorithm, which determines a starting coefficient set by means of an infinite impulse response (IIR) equalizer updated by constant modulus algorithm (CMA). For stability reasons, the equalizer’s feedback filter is implemented in lattice structure during acquisition. In case of QAM transmission, its tap weights have to be <b>rotated</b> before <b>switching</b> to the DFE. The feedback filter is then fed by the soft decision in order to minimize the probability of wrong solutions...|$|R

50|$|Antennas are {{generally}} sensitive to signals {{only when they}} have a length that is {{a significant portion of the}} wavelength, or larger. Most antennas are at least ¼ of the wavelength, more commonly ½ - the half-wave dipole is a very common design.

This paper {{is dedicated to the}} high speed video camera at 100, 000 frames per second and electrical signal analyses of arcs behavior in a 3 -phase AC arc plasma torch. First, a reference case at 150 A, in nitrogen as working gas, has been deeply analyzed. Afterwards, a parametric study based on current and inter-electrode gap has been carried out. Results show that only one arc can exist at a given time and arcs <b>rotate</b> by <b>switching</b> from a pair of electrodes to another one, following the maximal electrical gap potential. However, a particular "abnormal" arc behavior was sometimes observed. Indeed, the arc motion within the inter-electrode gap increases the heat exchange and stabilizes the 3 -phase discharge whereas the system is unbalanced when the arc is in the periphery. The analysis highlights that the arc motion is strongly influenced by the electrode jet velocity and repulsive Lorentz forces. The parametric study shows that the current increases both jet velocity and arc discharge stability. Elsewhere, the increase of the inter-electrode gap can also stabilizes the electrical 3 -phase arc discharge. Furthermore, the correlation between arc motion and current waveform is highlighted. This work is likely to open the way toward a better understanding of 3 -phase discharges in the perspective of their further optimization...|$|R
