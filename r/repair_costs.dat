To avoid this disadvantage, paper [2] proposes the total <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> limit replacement policy: The system is replaced as soon as its total <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> reaches or exceeds a given level. In that paper, the <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> development is modeled by functions of the Wiener process.

Roofs were damaged all over the island, and the island's main communications tower was knocked over. A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in <b>repair</b> <b>costs.</b> This disrupted fixed-line telephone service and as the island has no cellular telephone service, it caused a total cessation of communication with the mainland. Beta's arrival on the island {{was accompanied by a}} seven-foot storm surge, which damaged beaches, coastal houses and roads, and washed out a tourist footbridge. Coral reefs around the island were, for the most part, untouched, as only 1percent of the coral sustained minor damage. Minor effects were also found around areas of sea grass. Beaches all around the island lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage over the island.|$|E

5|$|Alongside the fatalities, {{the floods}} left several {{blocks of the}} town without power. Water lines, bridges, and other {{infrastructure}} sustained varying degrees of damage. Several homes sustained water and mud damage. Total losses in Washington County reached $750,000. Flooding continued downstream into Arizona, rendering multiple roads impassible and damaging bridges around Colorado City; losses in the city amounted to $500,000. Around 150federal personnel and 500community volunteers, including 70â€“80percent of Hildale's residents, conducted search and rescue in the immediate aftermath. Twenty-four members of Utah Task Force One and twenty-six personnel from the Utah National Guard were dispatched to Hildale to assist in search and rescue along Short Creek. Dangerous conditions along the creek slowed the operation. By September17, 300personnel were searching for a 6-year-old boy who was still missing. Ultimately, thousands of people from more than 60agencies {{took part in the}} search for the final victim; efforts were called off by September29 and the missing boy was presumed dead. Local residents continued periodic searches for the boy through December. The Utah Department of Public Safety granted the Public Safety Award to Washington County Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, Hildale Mayor Philip Barlow and, Hildale Marshallâ€™s Office Chief Jeremiah Darger for their response coordination. Following the floods, the Washington County allocated $1.6million through the Natural Resources Conservation Service for <b>repair</b> <b>costs</b> and mitigation efforts for future floods.

He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927â€“1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general <b>repair</b> <b>costs</b> were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the company may have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.|$|E

The system experiences two kinds of shocks: a type I shock causes a random amount of damage to the system leading to a serious failure when the total damage exceeds a failure level; or a type II shock causes the system into minor failure which can be corrected by minimal repair. When a minor failure occurs, the <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> will be evaluated and minimal repair is executed if the accumulated <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> is less than a predetermined limit L. The system is replaced anticipatively at n-th minor failure, or at the j-th minor failure (j < n) at which the accumulated <b>repair</b> <b>cost</b> exceeds a predeter-mined limit L, or any serious failure. In order to assess the performance of the proposed maintenance policy and to minimize the long-term expected cost per unit time, a mathematical model for the maintained system cost is derived. By minimizing that cost, the optimal number n * is also verified finite and unique under certain conditions.
