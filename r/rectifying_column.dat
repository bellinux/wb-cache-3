The structure of still-head deposits of furnace coils and <b>rectifying</b> <b>columns</b> has been studied by the example of small technological plant (STP) of JSC Kondensat (Aksay, the Republic of Kazakhstan). It was determined that key components of these deposits are sulfides of iron and copper as well as elementary sulfur. It is shown that the surface of contact devices of STP – grids made of stainless steel of brand 12 X 18 H 10 T, is substantially subject to corrosion. These samples are the structures which are still keeping geometry of initial grids, but lost their functional properties and characteristics. When mechanical influence is applied such samples easily transform into gray high-disperse powder. During operation period of STP various corrosion inhibitors and deemulgators (for example, TAL- 25 - 13 -R) have been tested. At the same time practically all tested brands of corrosion inhibitors couldn't decrease corrosion of stainless steel and formation of firm deposits in still-head pipes of technological devices. The existing corrosion inhibitors create protection on the boundary of phases metallic surface – liquid, but they aren't efficient on the boundary of phases metallic surface – liquid – steam-gas phase (at the temperature of 150 – 250 оC). The authors propose the mechanism of formation of these compounds based on result of corrosion of metal gauzes made of stainless steels brand X 6 CrNiTi 18 - 10 {{in the presence of}} sulphurous compounds. An active method of corrosion prevention is recommended to apply. The method is based on creation of nanodimensional anticorrosion coatings from binary compounds (such as titanium nitride) or pure metals (Ni, Cr, Ti, Cd, Zn, etc.). These metals don’t reduce initial high parameters of grids by heat conductivity and heat capacity, that makes possible to increase significantly life cycle of contact devices and, as a result, to improve considerably operational and economic indicators of operating technological plants used to process oil raw material...|$|R

(1993) showed that this column has several advantages over the rectifying and stripping batch columns including faster processing times and increased separation flexibility. We show that one can identify the feasible product and possible column profile regions for the batch rectifier, stripper and middle vessel columns using methods developed for continuous distillation.

In Level 1 A, the reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced and annotated with ancillary information (including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters) are computed and appended, but not applied to Level 0 data (i.e., Level 0 can be fully recovered from Level 1 A).

Level 3 maps the variables on uniform space-time grids usually with some completeness and consistency, and finally, Level 4 gives the results from the analysis of the previous levels data. For many applications, Level 1 data are the most fundamental data records with significant scientific utility, and it is the foundation upon which all subsequent data sets are produced.

As example, the EU {{reference method}} provides a classical distillation apparatus consisting of a 20 -cm Vigreux <b>rectifying</b> <b>column,</b> a 10 -cm straight-rimmed West condenser (a variant of a Liebig condenser), and a 40 -cm cooling coil (European Commission 2000). However, other suitable distillation devices may be applied, e.g. such as specified by IUPAC (1968). The only method performance requirement for the distillation apparatus is that the distillation of 200  mL of a water-alcohol solution with known concentration close to 50  % vol must not cause a loss of alcohol of more than 0.1  % vol (European Commission 2000). The classical distillation is comparably time-consuming, difficult to automate and problematic for some samples (such as liqueurs) that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For these reasons, our group has introduced the use of automatic steam distillation for the purpose in 2003 (Lachenmeier et al. 2003) [English summary version published in 2004 (Lachenmeier 2004)]. Using optimised settings of the steam-distillation device, the method had a wide application range for alcoholic beverages between 2 and 80  % vol with identical results to classical distillation. In follow-up studies, we have shown the applicability for complex matrices such as egg liqueurs (Lachenmeier et al. 2005), alcohol powders (Bauer-Christoph and Lachenmeier 2005) or cherry-spirit containing cakes (Lachenmeier et al. 2007).|$|E

In this study, the composition of isoamyl alcohol and n-amyl alcohol in the residue in the distillation process as a function of distillation time in a packing column was evaluated.

Unlike to well-known heteroazeotropic distillation process, the saddle binary heteroazeotrope chloroform – water can be drawn as a top condensed vapour thanks to the feeding of water at the first tray of the column. Therefore, the splitting of two liquid phases occurs into the top decanter and the chloroform-rich phase can be drawn as distillate product. The zeotropic mixture methanol – water left in the still can be separated in a further conventional batch distillation step. First, the process performance was determined by using rigorous simulation with the batch process simulator ProSim Batch taking into the technical features of the real bench batch distillation column. Experimental validation of the computed operating conditions for the extractive distillation step (reflux ratio and entrainer flowrate) was performed in the bench rectifying distillation column. One litre of the organic waste mainly composed by chloroform and methanol was separated adding continuously 20 mol/h of water at 25 °C in the column top. Two constant reflux ratios, R= 1. 4 and R= 10, was kept in the extractive distillation step during 1 h and 20 minutes, respectively. Good agreement was obtained between simulation and experimental results. More than 85 % of recovery yield can be obtained of each original component with a molar purity higher than 0. 99 by using the proposed heterogeneous extractive distillation processes.

30|$|The {{determination}} of the alcoholic strength in spirits and liqueurs is required to control the labelling of alcoholic beverages. The reference methodology prescribes a distillation step followed by densimetric measurement. The classic distillation using a Vigreux <b>rectifying</b> <b>column</b> and a West condenser is time consuming and error-prone, especially for liqueurs that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For this reason, this methodology suggests {{the use of an}} automated steam distillation device as alternative. The novel instrument comprises an increased steam power, a redesigned geometry of the condenser and a larger cooling coil with controllable flow, compared to previously available devices. Method optimization applying D-optimal and central composite designs showed significant influence of sample volume, distillation time and coolant flow, while other investigated parameters such as steam power, receiver volume, or the use of pipettes or flasks for sample measurement did not significantly influence the results. The method validation was conducted using the following settings: steam power 70  %, sample volume 25  mL transferred using pipettes, receiver volume 50  mL, coolant flow 7 L/min, and distillation time as long as possible just below the calibration mark. For four different liqueurs covering the typical range of these products between 15 and 35  % vol, the method showed an adequate precision, with relative standard deviations below 0.4  % (intraday) and below 0.6  % (interday). The absolute standard deviations were between 0.06  % vol and 0.08  % vol (intraday) and between 0.07  % vol and 0.10  % vol (interday). The improved automatic steam distillation devices offer an excellent alternative for sample cleanup of volatiles from complex matrices. A major advantage are the low costs for consumables per analysis (only distilled water is needed). For alcoholic strength determination, the method has become more rugged than before, and there are only few influences that would lead to incomplete distillation.

The reference methodology prescribes a distillation step followed by densimetric measurement. The classic distillation using a Vigreux <b>rectifying</b> <b>column</b> and a West condenser is time consuming and error-prone, especially for liqueurs that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For this reason, this methodology suggests {{the use of an}} automated steam distillation device as alternative. The novel instrument comprises an increased steam power, a redesigned geometry of the condenser and a larger cooling coil with controllable flow, compared to previously available devices. Method optimization applying D-optimal and central composite designs showed significant influence of sample volume, distillation time and coolant flow, while other investigated parameters such as steam power, receiver volume, or the use of pipettes or flasks for sample measurement did not significantly influence the results. The method validation was conducted using the following settings: steam power 70 %, sample volume 25 mL transferred using pipettes, receiver volume 50 mL, coolant flow 7 L/min, and distillation time as long as possible just below the calibration mark. For four different liqueurs covering the typical range of these products between 15 and 35 % vol, the method showed an adequate precision, with relative standard deviations below 0. 4 % (intraday) and below 0. 6 % (interday). The absolute standard deviations were between 0. 06 % vol and 0. 08 % vol (intraday) and between 0. 07 % vol and 0. 10 % vol (interday). The improved automatic steam distillation devices offer an excellent alternative for sample cleanup of volatiles from complex matrices. A major advantage are the low costs for consumables per analysis (only distilled water is needed). For alcoholic strength determination, the method has become more rugged than before, and there are only few influences that would lead to incomplete distillation.
