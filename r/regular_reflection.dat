50|$|Specular {{reflection}}, {{also known}} as <b>regular</b> <b>reflection,</b> is the mirror-like reflection of waves, such as light, from a surface. In this process, each incident ray is reflected, with the reflected ray having the same angle to the surface normal as the incident ray. The result is that an image reflected by the surface is reproduced in mirror-like (specular) fashion. The law of reflection states that for each incident ray the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the incident, normal, and reflected directions are coplanar. This behavior was first described by Hero of Alexandria (AD c. 10-70).|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{reflection}} of acoustic shock waves grazing at a small angle over a rigid surface. Depending on the incidence angle and the Mach number, the reflection patterns are mainly categorized into two types, namely <b>regular</b> <b>reflection</b> and irregular reflection. In the present work, using the nonlinear KZ equation, this reflection problem is investigated for extremely weak shocks as encountered in acoustics. A critical parameter, defined as {{the ratio of the}} sine of the incidence angle and the square root of the acoustic Mach number, is introduced in a natural way. For step shocks, we recover the self-similar (pseudo-steady) nature of the reflection, which is well known from von Neumann's work. Four types of reflection {{as a function of the}} critical parameter can be categorized. Thus, we describe the continuous but nonlinear and non-monotonic transition from linear reflection (according to the Snell-Descartes laws) to the weak von-Neumann-type reflection observed for almost perfectly grazing incidence. This last regime is a new, one-shock regime, in contrast with the other, already known, two-shock (<b>regular</b> <b>reflection)</b> or three-shock (von Neumann-type reflection) regimes. Hence, the transition also resolves another paradox on acoustic shock waves addressed by von Neumann in his classical paper. However, step shocks are quite unrealistic in acoustics. Therefore, we investigate the generalization of this transition for N-waves or periodic sawtooth waves, which are more appropriate for acoustics. Our results show an unsteady reflection effect necessarily associated with the energy decay of the incident wave. This effect is the counterpart of step-shock propagation over a concave surface. For a given value of the critical parameter, all the patterns categorized for the step shock may successively appear when the shock is propagating along the surface, starting from weak von-Neumann-type reflection, then gradually turning to von Neumann reflection and finally evolving into nonlinear <b>regular</b> <b>reflection.</b> This last one will asymptotically result in linear <b>regular</b> <b>reflection</b> (Snell-Descartes). The transition back to <b>regular</b> <b>reflection</b> is one of two types, depending on whether a secondary reflected shock is observed. The latter case, here described for the first time, appears to be related to the non-constant state behind the incident shock, which prevents secondary reflection...|$|E

The new model compares fairly well with numerical results. Results from numerical simulations of the regular to Mach transition-eventually occurring further downstream along the obstacle-point to the perceived wedge angle as the most significant parameter to identify regular to Mach transitions. Indeed, at the transition point, the value of the perceived wedge angle is between 39 Ã‚Â° and 42 Ã‚Â° for all investigated configurations, whereas, e. g., the absolute local wedge angle varies in between 10 Ã‚Â° and 45 Ã‚Â° in the same conditions...|$|R

Computational {{results indicate that the}} disturbance shock created {{as a result of the}} impact of dense particles on one of the shock-generating wedges can cause transition from <b>regular</b> to Mach <b>reflection.</b> The disturbance shock may also be generated by direct energy deposition on the wedge. Estimates of the lower bound of the required energy for transition to occur are presented and compared to values obtained computationally. Experiments were performed at Mach 4. 0 in a Ludwieg tube that has a test duration of 100 ms. Proper starting of the flow necessitated operation with an upstream diaphragm and modifications in the dump tank. The reflection state was changed by rapid rotation of one of the shock-generating wedges. The flow in the facility is sufficiently quiet to permit entering the dual-solution domain to approximately its midpoint before spontaneous transition to the Mach reflection occurs.
