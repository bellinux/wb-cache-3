40|$|<b>Roughing</b> <b>and</b> {{cementing}} {{are very}} {{essential to the}} process of bonding shoe uppers and the corresponding soles; however, for shoes with complicated design, such as sport shoes, <b>roughing</b> <b>and</b> cementing greatly relied on manual operation. Recently, shoe industry is progressing to 3 D design, thus 3 D model of the shoe upper and sole will be created before launching into mass production. Taking advantage of the 3 D model, this study developed a plug-in program on Rhino 3 D CAD platform, which realized the complicated <b>roughing</b> <b>and</b> cementing route planning to be performed by the plug-in program, integrated with real-time 3 D scanning information to compensate the planned route, and then converted to working trajectory of robot arm to implement <b>roughing</b> <b>and</b> cementing. The proposed 3 D CAD-based intelligent robot arm system integrated with 3 D scanning for shoe <b>roughing</b> <b>and</b> cementing is realized and proved to be feasible...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E

5|$|Kalapuya brunnea is {{a species}} of truffle in the {{monotypic}} fungal genus Kalapuya. The truffle occurs only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in western Oregon and northern California. Known locally as the Oregon brown truffle, it was formerly thought to be an undescribed species of Leucangium until molecular analysis demonstrated that it was distinct from that genus. The truffle is reddish brown with a <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> warty outer skin, while the interior spore-producing gleba is initially whitish before developing greyish-brown mottling as it matures. Mature truffles have an odor resembling garlicky cheese, similar to mature Camembert. The species has been harvested for culinary purposes in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Plants are {{classified}} as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E

5|$|There {{were four}} {{probable}} {{reasons for the}} deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank {{if they were not}} dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Law's Brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, Gen. Law, was unaware that he was now in command of the division, so he could not exercise control.|$|E
5|$|Though Parry {{had a great}} {{interest}} in music, he had no opportunity to study it until there was a temporary closure of the <b>Rough</b> <b>and</b> Ready Iron Works. Some of his co-workers were also musicians, and they offered music lessons while the iron works was closed. Parry joined a music sight-reading class taught by one of the men. He continued to study harmony with another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the Naktong delta to the south, and the valley between Taegu and P'ohang-dong, the terrain is extremely <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> mountainous. Northeast of P'ohang-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the south and east, the Naktong River to the west, and extremely mountainous terrain to the north, using the terrain as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces in the P'ohang-dong area.|$|E

40|$|Rough set, GIS, Spatial uncertainty, Rough spatiRough set {{is a new}} {{approach}} to uncertainties in spatial decision-making and analysis in GIS context. In this paper, rough set symbols are simplified and standardized, which are composed of <b>rough</b> interpretation <b>and</b> specialized indication. <b>Rough</b> spatial entities <b>and</b> their topological relationships are also proposed in rough space. Further, a universal intersected equation is developed, <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> membership function is extended with the grey degree of a pixel in a case study. First, rough set is simply reviewed, and a set of simplified rough symbols is advanced on the basis of different kinds of existed rough symbols. It includes both <b>rough</b> interpretation <b>and</b> specialized indication. Second, rough spatial entity is put forward in rough vector space, <b>rough</b> raster space <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> threedimensional space. It is argued that GIS studies the real world as it is, without forcing uncertainties to change into crisp set. Third, rough topological relationships that are disjoint, touch, overlap, equal, cover, covered by, contain and contained by, are studied via rough matrix with their figures. They are divided into three types, CC (crisp entity and crisp entity), RC (<b>rough</b> entity <b>and</b> crisp entity) <b>and</b> RR (<b>rough</b> entity <b>and</b> <b>rough</b> entity). <b>And</b> a universal intersected equation is further proposed. Finally, a case is studied on river thematic map.

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the valley between Taegu and P'ohong-dong, the terrain along the line was extremely <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> mountainous thanks to the Taebaek Mountains which ran from north to south down Korea's east coast. Northeast of P'ohong-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the northern line of the Pusan Perimeter using the terrain as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces.|$|E
5|$|After Bab el Wad, {{the road}} wound to Jerusalem through deep, narrow valleys, over steep spurs, {{and around the}} {{shoulders}} of rocky hills. There were other ways through the hills, but they were a tangle of unmapped, <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> rocky hill tracks and pathways—often little more than donkey tracks—which made movement by infantry, dismounted cavalry, and artillery very difficult. The rough tracks meandered through narrow valleys and over distorted piles of razor-backed ridges, which were broken by groups of cone-shaped hills and successive shelves of rock jutting out from every hillside at intervals of a few yards. It was virtually impossible for advances to the north or south of the main road to be supported by artillery. In heavy rain and cold, wet and muddy conditions, it {{was found to be}} impossible to deploy the 75th Division's guns off the road. These guns had been brought forward by teams of up to eight horses to a gun the day before.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, a {{passable}} {{dirt and}} gravel road connected Ukiah and Nevada City via the south side of Clear Lake and Marysville. The portion between Lower Lake and Wilbur Springs was impassable in wet weather, at which times the Bartlett Springs and Bear Valley Toll-road via Upper Lake and Bartlett Springs was available for $1.50 each way or $2.50 round trip. This route generally followed the present SR 20, except around Clear Lake and between Marysville and <b>Rough</b> <b>and</b> Ready (where it used Spenceville Road). Beyond Nevada City to Emigrant Gap, the old turnpike was not passable; instead the present SR 174 was available for eastward drivers. Between Williams and Colusa, the road was paved in concrete, as it had been added to the state highway system as part of the first (1910) bond issue, specifically as Route 15, connecting the west Sacramento Valley trunk (Route 7, now I-5) with the county seat of Colusa.|$|E
