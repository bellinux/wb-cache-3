5|$|A {{catchment}} {{board for}} the Avon {{was created by the}} Land Drainage Act 1930 and became the Bristol Avon River Board under the River Boards Act 1948; the Board was in turn replaced by the Bristol Avon <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> under the Water Resources Act 1963. Twenty-five minor watercourses were added to the Authority's jurisdiction in 1973. Reorganisation in 1974 under the Water Act 1973 brought the Avon catchment into a new regional body, the Wessex Water Authority.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> was {{established}} in the 1960s, and later became part of Wessex Water. Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements to the river, and the likelihood of adverse consequences, i.e. flooding and subsequent silting. Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a potable water supply in the groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s and early 1850s, the {{communities}} of Selma, Sutherland Springs, Boerne, La Vernia, and Bulverde were established along the creek. Later on, Cibolo Schertz, and Universal City were founded. These settlements dealt with torrential floods that cost many their homes and lives in later years. The destruction was prominently witnessed during the October 1998 Central Texas floods, and four years later during the flood of July 2002. The San Antonio <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> authorized $114,599 to help clean debris from the creek in 2003, hoping to improve water quality. Above-average levels of bacteria {{have been found in}} certain areas of the creek, leading to such initiatives as the Upper Cibolo Watershed Protection plan, which began in 2010. Another plan to create a Cibolo Reservoir near Stockdale aimed to control flooding and provide fresh water met fierce opposition from local citizens concerned about the destruction of historic sites along the creek, and the loss of taxable land.|$|E

5|$|Navigation {{was further}} {{affected}} by {{the passing of the}} Somersetshire Drainage Act on 1 July 1878, which resulted in the River Parrett being taken over by the Drainage Commissioners, and abandoned as a navigation. Limited traffic continued to use the lower reaches of the Tone, with the last barge using the Burrowbridge to Ham Mills section in 1929. In 1967 the Somerset <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> applied to the Ministry of Agriculture for permission to remove the navigation rights, and the original acts of parliament were repealed under section 41 of the Land Drainage Act (1930). This allowed the river through Taunton to be straightened, and a weir to be constructed at Firepool, to improve the flood defences for Taunton. Above the weir, the river is still navigable as far as French Weir.|$|E

50|$|The Act {{consisted}} of 137 sections organised into ten parts. Part 1 outlined {{the functions of}} Ministers in relation to water resources. Part 2 dealt with the setting up of <b>River</b> <b>Authorities</b> and the Water Resources Board. Part 3 covered the assessment of water resources. Part 4 dealt with the abstraction and impounding of water, while part 5 dealt with charges for abstraction and impounding of water. the The powers of <b>River</b> <b>Authorities</b> in relation to land were covered by part 6, while part 7 outlined additional functions of <b>River</b> <b>Authorities.</b> Part 8 dealt with financial considerations, part 9 detailed the transfer of undertakings of River Boards, and part 10 covered miscellaneous and supplementary provisions.

25|$|In the gubernatorial {{primaries}} held between December 1959 and January 1960, the Kirkpatricks worked {{actively in}} southwest Louisiana for former Governor Jimmie Davis, who defeated {{the mayor of}} New Orleans, deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr., in a hotly contested party runoff election. Davis asked Kirkpatrick to serve as his Director of Public Works to succeed Lorris M. Wimberly of Arcadia, the seat of Bienville Parish in north Louisiana, {{who had once been}} Speaker of the Louisiana House. As head of DPW, Kirkpatrick was also chairman of the Red <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> and the Sabine <b>River</b> <b>Authority.</b> He worked with the State of Texas and without federal funds to establish the popular Toledo Bend Reservoir, a popular destination for fishing and boating on the Louisiana-Texas boundary. The project, which emphasizes conservation and stewardship of natural resources, was completed in 1966, two years after Kirkpatrick had left DPW. State Representative Cliff Ammons of Many, the seat of Sabine Parish, pushed to passage the bill to create Toledo Bend and the constitutional amendment to provide for its funding.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} crossed by the Colorado River with several {{man-made}} lakes, {{known as the}} Highland Lakes, along its length. Because the hills to the west are primarily limestone rock with a thin covering of topsoil, the western portions of the area are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms. To help control this runoff and to generate hydroelectric power, the Lower Colorado <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> operates a series of dams that form the lakes.|$|E

Subsequent lab tests, however, found no traces of the substance in the sick athletes.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1920s and 1930s, Austin {{launched}} {{a series of}} civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city's infrastructure and parks. In addition the state legislature established the Lower Colorado <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> that, along with the City of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River that formed the Highland Lakes. These projects were enabled {{in large part by}} the fact that Austin received more Depression era relief funds than any other Texas city.|$|E

In addition, the state legislature established the Lower Colorado <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> (LCRA) that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the Highland Lakes. These projects were enabled in large part because the Public Works Administration provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities.|$|E
50|$|The {{provisions}} of this Act were short-lived, since River Boards, which were its primary focus, were {{swept away by}} the Water Resources Act 1963, which replaced the thirty two River Boards with twenty seven <b>River</b> <b>Authorities.</b> The anomaly of the Conservators of the River Thames and the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board was resolved by effectively making them into <b>River</b> <b>Authorities.</b> Although it became law on 31 July 1963, the change from boards to authorities did not actually occur until 1 April 1965.|$|R

25|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} changed again {{with the passing of}} the Water Resources Act 1963: the River Board was {{replaced}} by the Lincolnshire <b>River</b> <b>Authority,</b> although the geographical area which it managed was similar. This in turn became part of Anglian Water following the passing of the Water Act 1973. When the regional water authorities were privatised {{under the terms of the}} Water Act 1989, management of rivers, including the Ancholme, passed to the National Rivers Authority (NRA). Finally, the NRA was subsumed into the Environment Agency in 1996.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s onwards, {{there were}} gradual but steady {{improvements}} to the inadequate sewage works and sewers built during the Victorian era in the urban areas, but this was expensive, and took time to complete. The changes were helped {{by the introduction of}} more stringent pollution control legislation, which required industrial waste to be discharged to sewers, and the formation of the Trent <b>River</b> <b>Authority,</b> which had new duties relating to managing water quality issues. Other changes, such as the replacement of town gas with natural gas, saw the end of the polluting and toxic coal tar emissions to rivers in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Boats {{navigating}} to Bawtry were shallow-drafted, {{and were}} approximately , {{capable of carrying}} between 12 and 24 tons. Trade in 1767 amounted to 4,415 tons, of which some 25 per cent was lead, but {{the opening of the}} Chesterfield Canal in 1777 provided a more convenient outlet for most goods, and by 1828 commercial traffic had ceased to use the river. There was a wharf at Bawtry, but a large bend just above it was in the way when the Great Northern Railway was constructed. The Railway Company constructed a new cut for the river, but the channel to the wharf soon silted up. Navigation rights on the river ceased with the passing of the Trent <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> (General Powers) Act of 1972, although boats can still use it.|$|E

25|$|The Land Drainage Act 1930 {{changed the}} {{administrative}} bodies responsible for drainage, and the Corporation effectively became an Internal Drainage Board. In 1941, the Corporation ceased to be, and its powers and responsibilities were {{split between the}} Trent River Catchment Board and the River Ouse (Yorkshire) Catchment Board. Despite this change, {{the management of the}} area continued much as before, with official records stating that the Catchment Board acted as the Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase, even though it no longer existed legally. This continued with the renaming of the Trent River Catchment Board to the Trent River Board, and then the Trent <b>River</b> <b>Authority,</b> which finally became part of the Severn Trent Water Authority in 1974. In an unusual move, the Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase was re-constituted in 1987, by an order of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The order cited the powers of the 1813 and 1862 Acts, and transferred the property and responsibilities for drainage of the area from Severn Trent to the Corporation.|$|E
500|$|In 1939, the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was {{superseded}} by the Lancashire Rivers Board, but wartime conditions brought about further {{deterioration of the}} river. In 1951, the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act was passed and this board disappeared {{to be replaced by}} the Mersey River Board, which was replaced in turn by the Mersey and Weaver <b>River</b> <b>Authority</b> in 1965. During a 1950s television documentary entitled River of Irwell, the watercourse was described as [...] "The hardest worked river in the world".|$|E
