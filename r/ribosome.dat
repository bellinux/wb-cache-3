5|$|Cucurmosin is a <b>ribosome</b> inactivating protein {{found in}} the flesh and seed of Cucurbita, notably Cucurbita moschata. Cucurmosin is more toxic to cancer cells than healthy cells.|$|E
5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a <b>ribosome.</b> The <b>ribosome</b> binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) {{is found}} in many {{bacteria}} and plastids. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the <b>ribosome</b> from stalling.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ribosomes</b> of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic, flagellated {{protozoan}} (order Kinetoplastida), {{were identified}} on sucrose density gradients by their radioactively labeled nascent peptides. Ultraviolet absorption revealed only cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> {{which served as}} internal sedimentation markers. Synthesis on cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> was completely inhibited by cycloheximide. In {{the presence of this}} antibiotic, nascent peptides were associated with <b>ribosomes</b> of lower sedimentation coefficient than the cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes.</b> Chloramphenicol blocked synthesis on these <b>ribosomes</b> which are probably the mitochondrial <b>ribosomes.</b> These <b>ribosomes</b> differed from the cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> in several ways. Their sedimentation coefficient was about 72 S rather than 84 S. The stability of the 72 S <b>ribosomes</b> was less sensitive to pancreatic ribonuclease and low Mg-++ concentrations, dissociating below 0. 1 mM Mg++. The 72 S <b>ribosomes</b> were more sensitive to elevated KCl concentrations, dissociation above 0. 25 M. Protein synthetic activity associated with the 72 S class of <b>ribosomes</b> was found in trypanosomes grown in rats. Under these conditions no cytochromes or fully active Krebs cycle is present in these cells and respiration is insensitive to cyanide...|$|R
40|$|Binding of [35 S]thiostrepton to <b>ribosomes</b> from thiostrepton-sensitive and -resistant {{strains of}} Bacillus subtilis was studied. <b>Ribosomes</b> from thiostrepton-resistant strains bound {{relatively}} little thiostrepton compared with <b>ribosomes</b> from thiostrepton-sensitive B. subtilis. In addition, <b>ribosomes</b> from revertant strains that were obtained as thiostrepton-sensitive revertants from thiostrepton-resistant strains bound [35 S]thiostrepton similarly to <b>ribosomes</b> from the sensitive parental strain...|$|R
25|$|Chloroplasts {{have their}} own <b>ribosomes,</b> which they use to {{synthesize}} {{a small fraction of}} their proteins. Chloroplast <b>ribosomes</b> are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> (around 17 nm vs 25 nm). They take mRNAs transcribed from the chloroplast DNA and translate them into protein. While similar to bacterial <b>ribosomes,</b> chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria, so chloroplast <b>ribosomes</b> include some chloroplast-unique features.|$|R
5|$|A {{small number}} of RNA-based {{biological}} catalysts called ribozymes exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. The most common {{of these is the}} <b>ribosome</b> which is a complex of protein and catalytic RNA components.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's <b>ribosome,</b> a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the <b>ribosome</b> was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of linezolid {{bound to the}} 50S subunit of a <b>ribosome</b> from the archaean Haloarcula marismortui was elucidated {{by a team of}} scientists from Yale University and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the <b>ribosome.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{preparation}} of mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> from yeast is presented. Mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> differ from their cytoplasmic counterpart in nucleotide composition, electrophoretic mobility {{of a number of}} their respective ribosomal proteins, and thermal denaturation profiles. The mitochondrial and cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> have identical sedimentation coefficients (80 S) and dissociate into 60 S and 40 S subunits. These findings demonstrate that, in yeast, mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> are distinct from cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Ribosomes</b> {{programmed}} {{by different}} synonymous codons also differ in discriminating among near-cognate aminoacylated tRNAs. In the initial {{step of the}} recognition reaction <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by UUC discriminate less well than <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by UUU against ternary complexes containing three types of Leu-tRNA, and <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by CUC discriminate less well than <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by CUU against ternary complexes containing Phe-tRNA. Furthermore, in the proofreading step <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by UUC discriminate less well than <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by UUU against two of three near-cognate Leu-tRNAs, and <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by CUC discriminate less well than <b>ribosomes</b> programmed by CUU against near-cognate Phe-tRNA. The codon-induced change in reaction rate with near-cognate ternary complexes is greater than that with cognate ternary complexes: the most efficient codon is, therefore, the least accurate. Because the efficient, but inaccurate, codon UUC is used preferentially in highly expressed mRNAs of Escherichia coli, maximization of translational accuracy apparently has not been significant {{in the evolution of}} this particular biased codon choice in E. coli...|$|R
40|$|Ribosomal {{fractions}} {{isolated from}} Streptococcus pyogenes by physical and enzymatic {{disruption of the}} cell wall were found to provide protection in mice against challenge with the homologous M type. Although ribosomal fractions isolated by physical disruption of the cells also provided protection against challenge with several heterologous M types, ribosomal fractions from enzymatically lysed cells did not provide protection against any of the heterologous M types. <b>Ribosomes</b> isolated by either method {{were found to be}} contaminated with cell surface proteins. Chemical analysis of the <b>ribosomes</b> showed a greater protein:ribonucleic acid ratio in <b>ribosomes</b> from physically disrupted cells than in <b>ribosomes</b> from enzymatically disrupted cells (2 : 1 versus 1 : 1). Antisera to <b>ribosomes</b> isolated from physically disrupted cells detected many more antigenic determinants on <b>ribosomes</b> isolated from enzymatically disrupted cells than did the corresponding homologous antisera. Immunodiffusion analysis suggested that <b>ribosomes</b> isolated from physically disrupted cells may contain cell wall antigenic determinants which are present on <b>ribosomes</b> isolated from enzymatically disrupted cells in a partially degraded form. Washing of <b>ribosomes</b> in high-molarity salt solutions suggested that some of the contaminating cell wall proteins are tightly bound to the <b>ribosomes...</b>|$|R
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the <b>ribosome</b> binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the <b>ribosome.</b> In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E
5|$|The ribosomes coded {{for by the}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{are similar}} to those from bacteria in size and structure. They closely resemble the bacterial 70S <b>ribosome</b> and not the 80S cytoplasmic ribosomes, which are coded for by nuclear DNA.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial <b>ribosome,</b> but not the structurally different eukaryotic <b>ribosome.</b> Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} in dark-grown Euglena gracilis Klebs, Z strain Pringsheim, {{results in the}} disappearance of cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes.</b> In contrast, <b>ribosomes</b> in zinc-sufficient Euglena are conserved, do not undergo turnover, and can be demonstrated at any stage of growth. The zinc content of <b>ribosomes</b> from zinc-deficient Euglena just prior to ribosomal disappearance is 300 to 380 micrograms of zinc per gram rRNA as compared to 650 to 1280 micrograms of zinc per gram rRNA in <b>ribosomes</b> from zinc-sufficient cells. Ribosomal disappearance is believed to involve a generalized disintegration process related to the lower content of zinc in the <b>ribosomes.</b> Reappearance of <b>ribosomes</b> requires the addition of zinc. It is proposed that adequate zinc may be essential for normal tertiary and quaternary structure of the cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> of Euglena...|$|R
40|$|Bishop, Helen L. (Syracuse University, Syracuse, N. Y.), and Roy H. Doi. Isolation and {{characterization}} of <b>ribosomes</b> from Bacillus subtilis spores. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 695 – 701. 1966. —The isolation of <b>ribosomes</b> from Bacillus subtilis spores {{was accomplished by}} freezing the spores in liquid nitrogen and grinding the spore pellet with an equal weight of levigated alumina. The <b>ribosomes,</b> which were adsorbed to the alumina, were freed {{by the addition of}} vegetative-cell <b>ribosomes</b> or bulk ribonucleic acid (RNA) to the crude alumina-ground extract. The spore <b>ribosomes</b> had sedimentation properties and RNA and protein compositions similar to those of vegetative-cell <b>ribosomes.</b> The difficulty encountered in obtaining spore <b>ribosomes</b> by ordinary extraction methods {{may be the result of}} nuclease and protease activities which were demonstrated in spore extracts...|$|R
40|$|Purified {{mitochondrial}} <b>ribosomes</b> (60 S) {{have been}} isolated from locust flight muscle. Purification {{could be achieved}} after lysis of mitochondria in 0. 055 M MgCl 2. Mitochondrial 60 S and cytoplasmic 80 S <b>ribosomes</b> were investigated by electron microscopy in tissue sections, in sections of pellets of isolated <b>ribosomes,</b> and by negative staining of ribosomal suspensions. In negatively stained preparations, mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> show dimensions of ∼ 270 x 210 x 215 Å; cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> measure ∼ 295 x 245 x 255 Å. From these values a volume ratio of mitochondrial to cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> of 1 : 1. 5 was estimated. Despite their different sedimentation constants, mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> after negative staining show a morphology {{similar to that of}} cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes.</b> Both types of particles show bipartite profiles which are interpreted as "frontal views" and "lateral views. " In contrast to measurements on negatively stained particles, the diameter of mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> in tissue sections is ∼ 130 Å, while the diameter of cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> is ∼ 180 – 200 Å. These data suggest a volume ratio of mitochondrial to cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> of 1 : 3. Subunits of mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> (40 S and 25 S) were obtained by incubation under dissociating conditions before fixation in glutaraldehyde. After negative staining, mitochondrial large (40 S) subunits show rounded profiles with a shallow groove on a flattened side of the profile. Mitochondrial small subunits (25 S) display elongated, triangular profiles...|$|R
5|$|Clindamycin has a {{primarily}} bacteriostatic effect. It is {{a bacterial}} protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, {{in a similar}} way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial <b>ribosome</b> subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the <b>ribosome</b> usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the <b>ribosome</b> attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the <b>ribosome,</b> tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of virus protein inside the living cell {{is not completely}} understood. From studies in cellular metabolism {{during the last decade}} it is known that protein biosynthesis, in which amino acids are united in a specific order, occurs at the <b>ribosomes</b> in the cytoplasm. Many workers have theorized that the virus protein is also synthesized around the cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes.</b> If this is the case, the <b>ribosomes</b> in virus infected cells should be different from those in healthy cells. In fact, if the cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes</b> act as centers for the {{synthesis of}} virus protein, more <b>ribosomes</b> and possibly different <b>ribosomes</b> or polyribosomes should be found in infected cells. These experiments have been designed to investigate {{the quality and quantity of}} <b>ribosomes</b> in healthy bean leaves and compare them to the <b>ribosomes</b> in infected leaves. <b>Ribosomes</b> were extracted from healthy and infected leaves of Bountiful and Great Northern bean varieties. The pathogen, southern bean mosaic virus, produces a systemic infection on Bountiful bean and a local infection on Great Northern bean. Advisor: M. K. Brakk...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel chromatography for the rapid isolation of active <b>ribosomes</b> from bacteria {{without the use of}} harsh conditions or lengthy procedures that damage <b>ribosomes.</b> <b>Ribosomes</b> interact with an alkyl linker attached to the resin, apparently through their RNA component. Examples are given with <b>ribosomes</b> from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and with clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The <b>ribosomes</b> obtained by this method are unusually intact, so that highly active <b>ribosomes</b> can now be isolated from the clinical isolates, enabling significantly improved in vitro functional assays that will greatly assist the discovery and development of new ribosomally targeted antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|The RNA of E. coli <b>ribosomes</b> {{has been}} {{extracted}} by the phenol method. The 70 S <b>ribosomes</b> contain RNA molecules of 28 and 18 S almost exclusively. When the 70 S <b>ribosomes</b> are dissociated to 30 and 50 S <b>ribosomes</b> the former contain only the 18 S RNA {{and the latter}} a mixture of 28 and 18 S RNA. There are also present, however, small quantities of ribosomal RNA having sedimentation coefficients of between 4 and 8 S. These small molecules are particularly abundant in the smaller <b>ribosomes</b> present in the cell extract and account {{for most of the}} RNA of 20 S <b>ribosomes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA {{that carries}} {{information}} from DNA to the <b>ribosome,</b> {{the sites of}} protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes).|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of {{the genetic}} code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the <b>ribosome,</b> such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Some RNA {{molecules}} play {{an active}} role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the <b>ribosome,</b> where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins.|$|E
50|$|For {{bacterial}} <b>ribosomes,</b> ultracentrifugation yields intact <b>ribosomes</b> (70S) {{as well as}} separated ribosomal subunits, {{the large}} subunit (50S) and the small subunit (30S). Within cells, <b>ribosomes</b> normally exist as a mixture of joined and separate subunits. The largest particles (whole <b>ribosomes)</b> sediment {{near the bottom of}} the tube, whereas the smaller particles (separate 50S and 30S subunits) appear in upper fractions.|$|R
40|$|Isolation of biologically {{active cell}} {{components}} from multicellular eukaryotic organisms often poses difficult challenges such as low yields and inability {{to retain the}} integrity and functionality of the purified compound. We previously identified a cap-independent translation enhancer (3 ’CITE) in the 3 ’UTR of Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) that structurally mimics a tRNA and binds to yeast 80 S <b>ribosomes</b> and 60 S subunits in the P-site. Yeast <b>ribosomes</b> were used for these studies {{due to the lack}} of methods for isolation of plant <b>ribosomes</b> with high yields and integrity. To carry out studies with more natural components, a simple and efficient procedure has been developed for the isolation of large quantities of high quality <b>ribosomes</b> and ribosomal subunits from Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts prepared from seed-derived callus tissue. Attempts to isolate high quality <b>ribosomes</b> from wheat germ, bean sprouts and evacuolated protoplasts were unsuccessful. Addition of purified Arabidopsis 80 S plant <b>ribosomes</b> to ribosome-depleted wheat germ lysates resulted in a greater than 1200 -fold enhancement in in vitro translation of a luciferase reporter construct. The TCV 3 ’CITE bound to <b>ribosomes</b> with a 3 to 7 -fold higher efficiency when using plant 80 S <b>ribosomes</b> compared with yeast <b>ribosomes,</b> indicating that this viral translational enhancer is adapted to interact more efficiently with host plant <b>ribosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Ribosomes</b> can be {{released}} from highly purified preparations of the cell walls of barley shoots by passing the suspension of cell walls through a French press. The sedimentation coefficients and base composition of the cell-wall <b>ribosomes</b> are identical with those of cytoplasmic <b>ribosomes.</b> It is suggested that the <b>ribosomes</b> isolated from the walls were originally incorporated into the wall structure during formation of the primary wall...|$|R
5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: they stop {{the growth and}} reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in the <b>ribosome.</b> Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, linezolid appears {{to work on the}} first step of {{protein synthesis}}, initiation, unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit elongation.|$|E
5|$|The {{transcribed}} pre-mRNA contains untranslated regions at {{both ends}} which contain a <b>ribosome</b> binding site, terminator and start and stop codons. In addition, most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated. The sequences {{at the ends of}} the introns, dictate the splice sites to generate the final mature mRNA which encodes the protein or RNA product.|$|E
5|$|Type I toxin-antitoxin systems {{rely on the}} base-pairing of {{complementary}} antitoxin RNA {{with the}} toxin's mRNA. Translation of the mRNA is then inhibited either by degradation via RNase III or by occluding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or <b>ribosome</b> binding site. Often the toxin and antitoxin are encoded on opposite strands of DNA. The 5' or 3' overlapping region between the two genes is the area involved in complementary base-pairing, usually with between 19–23 contiguous base pairs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ribosomes</b> from higher-plant {{mitochondria}} contain 5 S rRNA, {{in contrast}} with the mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> of animals and fungi, in which such a component has not been detected. In common with the <b>ribosomes</b> of prokaryotes and chloroplasts, higher-plant mitochondrial <b>ribosomes</b> do not appear to contain an RNA equivalent to the 5. 8 S rRNA that is found in eukaryoytes hydrogen-bonded to the largest of the cytoplasmic rRNA species...|$|R
50|$|Similarly to {{orthogonal}} tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), orthogonal <b>ribosomes</b> {{have been}} engineered {{to work in}} parallel to the natural <b>ribosomes.</b> Orthogonal <b>ribosomes</b> ideally use different mRNA transcripts than their natural counterparts and ultimately should draw on a separate pool of tRNA as well. This should alleviate some {{of the loss of}} fitness which currently still arises from techniques such as Amber codon suppression. Additionally, orthogonal <b>ribosomes</b> can be mutated and optimized for particular tasks, like the recognition of quadruplet codons. Such an optimization is not possible, or highly disadvantageous for natural <b>ribosomes.</b>|$|R

The dissociability of the free <b>ribosomes</b> from all the stages we studied is identical. 4. 3. Differences of behaviour between <b>ribosomes</b> extracted from full grown oocytes, unfertilized eggs and developing embryos can only be observed at very critical values of the K+/Mg 2 + ratio. <b>Ribosomes</b> resistant to dissociation, even {{after the release of}} the nascent peptide, can be detected at stages where protein synthesis is high.
