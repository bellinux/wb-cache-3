500|$|In the nineties, a {{reactive}} armour package, named BRENUS or Brennus, {{was developed}} for the AMX-30B2, but was issued only to two tank regiments, which in peacetime were combined into the 1er/ 2e Chasseurs, {{that were part of}} France's rapid reaction force; the other two regiments using the AMX-30, the 2e/5e Dragons, only had their tanks adapted for a possible relatively quick upgrade, in case of an emergency. The BRENUS system used 112 GIAT BS (Brique de Surblindage) G2 explosive reactive boxes with a total weight of , offering a protection equivalent to [...] of steel at 60°. Recently, the AMX-30 has also been used as a testbed for several stealth technologies, including air cooling of hull surfaces and the use of visual camouflage.

5000|$|The {{ships were}} {{originally}} known as [...] "stealth frigates" [...] {{due to their}} unique stealth design at the time. Their reduced radar cross section is achieved by a clean superstructure compared to conventional designs, angled sides and <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>material,</b> a composite material of wood and glass fibre as hard as steel, light, and resistant to fire.

50|$|The P-18 {{has served}} in several {{conflicts}} in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. One unusual feature of the P-18 is its counter-stealth capability. Since the radar uses metre-length wave VHF, the shaping features and <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> used on stealth aircraft are less efficient, allowing VHF based radars to detect targets at a greater range than centimeter or millimeter wave radar which stealth aircraft are optimized against. The presence of a P-18 radar in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War {{is believed to have}} contributed to the loss of an US F-117 Nighthawk during the conflict.|$|R
50|$|To ensure stealth capabilities, {{anechoic}} coatings of <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> (RAM) {{have been}} used in the load-bearing structures over large areas of the ship. This strategy leads to significant weight saving compared to the conventional construction technique of applying RAM cladding to the external surfaces. The ship's profile has a faceted appearance with no right angle structures and few orientations of reflective panels. Doors and hatches are flush with the surfaces and the windows are flush without visible coaming (edge of window aperture) and are fitted with radar reflective screens. The vessels are additionally protected by the Rheinmetall MASS sensor / decoy system.|$|R
5000|$|Conventionally, the RCS {{has been}} reduced either by <b>Radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> (RAM) or by purpose shaping of the targets such that the {{scattered}} energy can be redirected away from the source. While RAMs have narrow frequency band functionality, purpose shaping limits the aerodynamic performance of the target. More recently, metamaterials or metasurfaces are synthesized that can redirect the scattered energy away from the source using either array theory or generalized Snell's law [...] This has led to aerodynamically favorable shapes for the targets with the reduced RCS.|$|E

5000|$|The Salisbury screen, {{invented by}} American {{engineer}} Winfield Salisbury {{in the early}} 1940s (see patent filing date). The patent was delayed because of wartime security, {{was a way of}} reducing the reflection of radio waves from a surface. It {{was one of the first}} concepts in <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>material,</b> later known as [...] "stealth technology", used to prevent enemy radar detection of military vehicles. It was first applied to ship radar cross section (RCS) reduction. There have been many design refinements to the concept since that time, motivated by the increasing interest in stealth technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a {{computational}} method {{that can be used}} in modern stealth technology. In particular, the computational method should be capable to simulate scattering of ultra-wideband radar signals for military aircraft constructed with ferromagnetic <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials.</b> A full-wave boundary element method has been chosen because of its efficiency for electromagnetic scattering of electrically large structures. A time-domain method has been chosen because wideband signals can be simulated with a single run. Moreover, the future use of nonlinear constitutive equations for ferromagnetic materials requires simulation in time domain. To this end, the Time Domain Integral Equation (TDIE) method is used as computational method. More specifically, the numerical discretization of the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) is given by the Marching-on-in-Time (MoT) scheme, which has been chosen because of its efficiency and accuracy. Instabilities prevent its industrial application to stealth technology, even for smallband and linear constitutive equations. In this thesis, a thorough numerical analysis on stability, accuracy, and robustness has been derived, resulting in clear guidelines for the choice of numerical parameters. Consequently, stable computer simulations have been achieved. Delft Institute of Applied MathematicsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
50|$|Total {{production}} was around 8100000 MT in 2006. Global consumption of Carbon Black, estimated at 13.2 {{million metric tons}} valued at US$13.7 billion in 2015, {{is expected to reach}} 13.9 million metric tons equated to US$14.4 billion in 2016 and further forecast to maintain a CAGR of 5.6% between 2016 and 2022 to reach 19.2 million metric tons equalent of US$20.4 billion by 2022. The most common use (70%) of carbon black is as a pigment and reinforcing phase in automobile tires. Carbon black also helps conduct heat away from the tread and belt area of the tire, reducing thermal damage and increasing tire life. Carbon black particles are also employed in some <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> used in the reduction of the radar cross-section of aircraft and in photocopier and laser printer toner, and other inks and paints. The high tinting strength and stability of carbon black has also provided use in coloring of resins and films. About 20% of world production goes into belts, hoses, and other non-tire rubber goods. The balance is mainly used as a pigment in inks, coatings and plastics. For example, it is added to polypropylene because it absorbs ultraviolet radiation, which otherwise causes the material to degrade.|$|R

50|$|The work {{function}} homogeneity {{of the tube}} can be controlled by a Kelvin probe. The magnetic field can be measured by a fluxgate compass. High frequencies are passively shielded and damped by <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>material.</b> To generate arbitrary low frequencies field the screen is parted into plates (overlapping and connected by capacitors) with bias voltage on each plate and a bias current on coil behind plate whose flux is closed by an outer core.

Changing the field the angle of the field of view can be changed and a deflecting bias can be superimposed to scan through all angles.|$|E

5000|$|In 1958, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency {{requested}} {{funding for}} a reconnaissance aircraft to replace the existing U-2 spy planes, and Lockheed secured contractual rights to produce it. [...] "Kelly" [...] Johnson and his team at Lockheed's Skunk Works were assigned to produce the A-12 (or OXCART), {{the first of the}} previously top secret Blackbird series, which operated at high altitude of 70,000 to 80,000 ft and speed of Mach 3.2 to avoid radar detection. <b>Radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> was used on U-2 spy planes, and various plane shapes designed to reduce radar detection were developed in earlier prototypes, named A1 to A11. In 1964, an optimal plane shape taking into account compactness was developed for another [...] "Blackbird", the Lockheed SR-71. This aircraft surpassed prior models in both altitude (90,000 ft) and speed (Mach 3.3). The SR-71 included a number of stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall finish in radar absorbing paint.|$|E
5000|$|Assigned to the [...] carrier battle group, Merrill again {{deployed}} to the Middle East in 1991. On {{the way to}} Persian Gulf Merrill took part in Operation Fiery Vigil in June 1991. Arriving in the region after the ceasefire of the Gulf War, Merrill became the flagship for the coalition minesweeping forces in the Persian Gulf and was the second warship to visit the liberated port of Kuwait City after the Iraqi invasion. 1992 found Merrill underway on a counter-narcotics deployment in the Central America area of operations. In September 1992 Merrill was sent to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul which lasted into late 1993. This overhaul consisted of upgrades to the control panels of the radar systems, an entire level added to the ship to contain previously installed CIWS control computers, and most importantly, RAM (<b>Radar</b> <b>Absorbent</b> <b>Material)</b> {{was added to the}} entire ship, a first for a destroyer. Upon receiving notice of the planned closure of Long Beach, The USS Merrill relocated to San Diego Naval Base in 1994 and spent the next few months as a test platform in deployment for the RAM material, which was designed to make the ship appear as small as a tug boat on radars.|$|E
5000|$|As Coastal Command predicted, the Germans {{captured}} the damaged H2S, {{which would have}} been next to impossible from a Coastal Command aircraft downed at sea, rather than over land, and Telefunken produced the Rotterdam Gerät (Rotterdam Device, named for where it was captured). Coastal Command's first ASV.III-equipped patrol took place over the Bay of Biscay 1 March. ASV.III made its first U-boat contact on the night of 17 March, but unfortunately the carrier Wellington suffered a malfunction of its Leigh Light and was unable to press home the attack. The first attack using the system occurred the next night. When ASV.III did enter service, German submariners, right up to Dönitz, began to mistakenly believe British aircraft were homing on emissions from the Metox receiver, which no longer gave warning. Meantime, German scientists were perfecting the Rotterdam Gerät to create a submersible version for U-boat defense, of the aviation-utilized FuG 350 Naxos radar detector for night fighters, the submersible version getting the FuMB7 Naxos U designation. [...] While fragile, Naxos worked. However, it entered service the same day as the 10 GHz-emissions H2X (which Naxos could not detect) became operational in Coastal Command. Naxos was replaced by FuMB36 Tunis in May 1944, and was supplemented by Stumpf, what today would be called <b>radar</b> <b>absorbent</b> <b>material,</b> under the codename Schornsteinfeger ("Chimneysweep").|$|E
