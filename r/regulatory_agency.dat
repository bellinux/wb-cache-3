5|$|The {{building}} was not fully rebuilt until 1911. A house was constructed {{at the site}} of the Springtown depot the year before it was rebuilt. The New York Public Service Commission, a <b>regulatory</b> <b>agency</b> founded in 1907, ruled in May 1911 that the new Springtown station was adequate. The Springtown station had no station agent or freight house. In 1925, sparks shooting off a passing train caused a fire in Springtown that burned down six buildings, causing $7,000 in damage. The prominence of the New Paltz station, as well as the growth of SUNY New Paltz in the village, caused the decline of Springtown as a community.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{summarize}} the approaches used and to research the challenges for <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> consolidation in order to reduce administrative burdens for business. This article analyses the activity of Lithuanian and EU <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> which are supervising business with regard to identify potential and arising challenges of optimising the performance of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies.</b> Methods: review of academic and legal literature, comparison, synthesis, statistical data analysis. Scientific aim: The aim of this article is to analyse the activities of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> of Lithuania and European Commission and evaluate the actions in order to reduce administrative burdens as well as to identify the consolidation problem areas of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies.</b> Findings: The results of the analysis shows, that a unified list of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> is not in use and the research and other reform action taken by supervising authorities is being done using different sets of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies,</b> what leads to increasing of administrative burdens and ineffective <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> consolidation. Conclusion: The results of research shows that it is necessary to compile a clear, united and unified list of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies.</b> Also it is important to carry on consolidation of controlling institutions and merging <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> to achieve a clear responsibility for the controlled areas and new ways to implement information technologies should be provided...|$|R
50|$|At {{least four}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> {{including}} the Federal Reserve Board oversee {{the activities of}} banks, their holding companies, and other related depository institutions. While each type of depository institution has a “primary regulator”, the nation’s “dual banking” system allows concurrent jurisdiction among the different <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies.</b> With respect to the anti-tying provision, the Fed takes the preeminent role {{in relation to the}} other financial institution <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies,</b> which reflects that it was considered the least biased (in favor of banks) of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> when section 106 was enacted.|$|R
40|$|This article tests two {{competing}} hypotheses {{in the study}} of the institutional design of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies.</b> Political explanations consider the degree of institutional design of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> as a function of political factors, such as the degree of policy conflict and political uncertainty. By contrast, historical-cultural explanations of institutional design claim that the design of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> is a function of path dependency and national administrative traditions. In this article, we test these hypotheses on a data set of 293 <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> that were created between 1945 and 2000 in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark. We find strong support for historical-cultural explanations, while our findings suggest that political factors play almost no role in the institutional design of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> within parliamentary regimes...|$|R
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental <b>regulatory</b> <b>agency</b> tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear <b>regulatory</b> <b>agency,</b> was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be {{the root cause of}} the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Agency</b> recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E
40|$|This book {{develops}} and applies an inventive {{theoretical approach}} to the comparative study of the neglected aspect of the real (or "de facto") independence of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies.</b> The book begins with {{an examination of the}} organisational and institutional factors shaping the de facto independence of <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> in Western Europe. There follows an analysis of the role of independent <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> in the policy-making process, using de facto independence as an explanatory variable. The final section is devoted to the relationship between <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> and the news media.

40|$|Independent <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> are the {{institutional}} {{foundations of the}} regulatory state that, during the past 15 years, has gained prominence throughout Europe. This article studies the rise of independent authorities in European countries by comparing <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> and central banks. Delegation to independent central banks and to independent <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> is similar in many respects. In both cases, agents are deliberately made independent from political principals through a specific institutional design. Moreover, {{it has been argued}} that delegation to both central banks and <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> is linked to the need for policy-makers to improve the credibility of policy commitments, to the wish of incumbent politicians to tie the hands of future majorities, and to the extent to which {{the institutional}} contexts safeguard policy stability. Through an analysis of the formal independence of central banks and <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies</b> in Western Europe, this article identifies an empirical puzzle that casts doubts on the accuracy of current explanations. Veto players and the uncertainty of incumbent policy-makers in respect to their re-election prospects matter for delegation to both central banks and <b>regulatory</b> <b>agencies,</b> but in opposite ways. Making sense of these anomalies is necessary to achieve a better understanding of delegation to independent authorities...|$|R
