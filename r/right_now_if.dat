I am begging you <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> <b>If</b> you don't {{disperse}} right now, they're {{going to move}} in, and {{it can only be}} a slaughter. Would you please listen to me?

2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with Raissman, Russo {{did not rule}} out a reunion with Francesa. Russo said, [...] "You never want to say never. You know how the radio business is. So, you never say never, but I haven’t thought about it in my crystal ball, let's put it that way... But I’ll tell you <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> Mike and I did shows together we would have no trouble picking right up where we left off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the album's release T.I. {{decided to}} release a mixtape titled Fuck a Mixtape; the move was {{somewhat}} controversial due to its title, with many feeling he was insulting the Mixtape format. T.I. has addressed the issue by stating {{that it was a}} response to all the people who told him to just focus on an album and not on a mixtape. T.I. further defended his decision {{to release a}} mixtape by saying: [...] "I already have 60, 70 songs. A lot of these songs are period pieces that speak volumes to what's going on <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> <b>If</b> I hold onto them next year or the year after, they'll be dated, because my life will be in another direction. If I'm not gonna put it on the album — and they all can't make the album — then they might as well have another platform to present it to the world".|$|E

6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] sneered Dick. [...] "You're sca'red {{into the}} middle of next week <b>right</b> <b>now....</b> Besides, <b>if</b> you do ketch Ken it won't do you any good-now!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On September 26, 2014, Smith stated on the Hollywood Babble-On No. 183 episode, why he’s {{glad that}} he made Tusk, Smith added, [...] "Everything in my life would suck <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>if</b> I hadn't made that movie. I'm back in movies now. I've got three lined up, {{and this is the}} fucking grand news. Tusk was the {{absolute}} bridge to Clerks III. Because of Tusk, I got my financing for Clerks III." [...] Smith continued, [...] "A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get Clerks III made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was Tusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?' And I was like, Clerks III, done. So everybody that's like, 'He failed, he failed,' thank you I failed into Clerks III. So, never trust anybody when they tell you how your story goes, man. You know your story. You write your own story.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Another artist, Brian Welch, whose solo debut was {{released}} to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for [...] "Flush" [...] {{was released}}. The video is {{an interpretation of}} the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: [...] "The video for 'Flush' is about crystal meth addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>if</b> I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2013 {{he again}} {{suggested}} that African Americans possess a [...] "slick" [...] style of boxing which {{is superior to}} other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). [...] "The great Sugar Ray Leonard, <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> he was boxing, {{the way that they}} want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson – the great Robinson – would be boring today…Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it. If they're slick, and they beat [...] nine out of the 12 rounds, and the guy just can't hit him because they were slick and smart enough to hit and not get hit, 'He's not crowd-pleasing, he don't sell tickets.' Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [...] to the customers. The customers will drink anything that you give them if it's promoted right…But when you take away the skill and you take away the slick, and you take away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it", said Hopkins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{situation}} <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is, <b>if</b> your majesty {{is determined}} to appoint Yaozuo, then expel this advisor; if your majesty is {{to listen to this}} advisor, then (your majesty) must remove Yaozuo.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was stated}} on several {{occasions}} during their 2009 tour of Australia and Japan that {{they were unable to}} play the song, with Townshend stating, [...] "We can't play Magic Bus <b>right</b> <b>now....</b> But <b>if</b> you shout loud enough... We definitely won't play it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We had to {{give him}} a little rope to go through with his act," [...] he whispered confidentially. [...] "But he'll sign it all <b>right.</b> And <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> you'll excuse me, Mr. Paret, I'll lay a few mines. See you at the hotel, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My husband's cheque is ready," [...] {{the lady}} {{at his side}} {{answered}} quickly. [...] "I guess the Prince can have it <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> he chooses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you {{are after}} my mine!" [...] cried Roger, sharply. [...] "Well, I'll tell you <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> you locate it, it won't do you any good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The wind {{is making}} all the time," [...] he announced. [...] "The old girl's doing nearer twelve than eleven <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> <b>If</b> this keeps up, we'll be {{shortening}} down tonight." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 The Guardian {{described}} Litbits {{as one of}} {{the best}} three literary podcasts on the internet, alongside Bookworm and The New Yorker Fiction Podcast. Ola Wihlke of Bear Books said that 'Lit Bits is probably the funniest podcast on literature <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> even <b>if</b> it raises serious literary issues.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he {{said very}} slowly, [...] "is what I don't quite know. One of them bones is a rocker, and she swings on the other. That one's cut, but I don't think it's smashed <b>right</b> through. <b>Now</b> <b>if</b> it goes {{as well as}} the other, it's quite {{possible}} Harry will limp ever after." ...|$|R
6000|$|Smoke laughed. [...] "I'm {{too scared}} of the {{percentage}} against me. But I'll tell you what, Shorty. I'll throw a dollar on the 'high card' <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and see <b>if</b> it will buy us a drink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's plain! I'd {{stop the}} thing <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>if</b> {{you were a}} {{different}} girl, {{but you know what}} you want and how to keep it when it's got. It looks as if you had made up your mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would depend}} upon how the thing went. When I do {{talk to her}} it always seems that nothing I say can be <b>right.</b> <b>Now,</b> <b>if</b> you will give it her {{you can put in}} all manner of pretty things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly. But {{she was too}} cool, too friendly. Poor Alfred {{looked as}} if he hadn't slept. He was nervous and scared to death. When Betty ran up stairs I put a bug in Alfred's ear. He'll be all <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> he follows my advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, all right," [...] said Mrs. Harmon, with eager satisfaction. [...] "I have to {{be pretty}} {{particular}} who I have in the house. The boarders are all high-class, and I have {{to have all the}} departments accordingly. I'll see Mr. Sewell about you as soon as I get time, and I guess you can take <b>right</b> hold <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> you want to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{beginning}} to understand." [...] Andrew {{looked at her}} gravely. [...] "If anybody else had hinted as much, I'd have felt it was exacting and I was being driven too hard. With you it's different. Once or twice already you have given me the impetus I needed, and you're <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> But <b>if</b> I'm not required by Allinson's why shouldn't I attend to the claims?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's so. But {{the trouble}} is the manner of enforcement," [...] insisted Howard Littlefield. [...] "Congress didn't {{understand}} the <b>right</b> system. <b>Now,</b> <b>if</b> I'd been running the thing, I'd have arranged {{it so that the}} drinker himself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless workman--kept him from drinking--and yet not 've interfered with the rights--with the personal liberty--of fellows like ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They can't bluff me, they'll have {{to guess}} again. It's that damned Holster--he hasn't any guts--he'd {{give in to}} 'em <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>if</b> I'd let him. It's the limit the way he turned the Clarendon over to them. I'll show him how to put a crimp in 'em if they don't turn up here to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am. I don't often act this way, but, oh, gee! {{hearing you}} all talking like that {{about going to}} America, just {{as if it was}} the easiest thing in the world, only you couldn't be bothered to do it, kind of got me going. And to think I could be there <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>if</b> I wasn't a bonehead!" ...|$|E
60|$|When he had gone, an {{attendant}} volunteered {{the information that}} the old gentleman was perhaps a little excited at times. He was a wonderful man; {{he had seen a}} great deal; he talked much of California and the early days; he was very interesting. Ah, it would be all <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>if</b> the doctor found him well enough, for the lady was already going--that was she, coming through the hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. There {{are three}} boys and two girls, all younger than I, {{to be looked}} out for, and he has all he can carry. Besides, she needs me right here and <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> and <b>if</b> I can do {{anything}} to make life easier for her I'm going t' do it. Besides," [...] he ended, in a peculiar tone, [...] "we don't feel as if we could live apart much longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas!--for {{three of}} them at least," [...] ejaculated Mrs. Aleshine; [...] "they have left us, but they are all <b>right.</b> And <b>now,</b> sir, <b>if</b> you could tell us what {{relation}} you are to Emily, and what Lucille--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Senor," [...] said Jack, [...] "the {{best way}} to punish oneself for doing ill, {{seems to me to}} go and do good; and the {{best way to}} find out whether God means you well, is to find out whether He will help you to do well. If you have wronged Indians in time past, see whether you cannot <b>right</b> them <b>now.</b> <b>If</b> you can, you are safe. For the Lord will not send the devil's {{servants}} to do His work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Lise," [...] she said, {{shifting}} the saucepan {{to another part}} of the stove, [...] "I guess if your father and I had put both you girls in the mills and crowded into one room and cooked in a corner, and lived on onions and macaroni, and put four boarders each in the other rooms, I guess we could have had a house, too. We can start in <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> you're willing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now jump up upon my back, Wilfrid," [...] Mr. Atherton said; [...] "your weight {{will not}} make much {{difference}} to me {{one way or the}} other. That is right; lend him a hand, Sampson, and get him on to my shoulders. It will be easier for both of us, for I have got no hips for his knees to catch hold of. That is <b>right.</b> <b>Now</b> <b>if</b> you will take my gun we shall get along merrily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a bounder," [...] she snapped. She {{softened}} {{her voice}} as she continued: [...] "He {{was in the}} art school in California when I was there, and he presumes on that.... It was {{good of you to}} stay and help me get rid of him.... I'm getting--I'm sorry I'm so dull to-night. I suppose I'll get sent off to bed <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> I can't be more entertaining. It was sweet of you to come in, Mouse.... You don't mind my calling you `Mouse,' do you? I won't, if you do mind." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{man says}} to the camera that he feels global warming is [...] "a bunch of New Age hooey garbage". He goes on to exclaim: [...] "It's snowing <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> who cares <b>if</b> I'm in Southern California!" [...] He {{explains}} his thinking behind ignoring scientists, stating: [...] "I'm not a scientist. Who listens to those nerds anyway?" ...|$|R
5000|$|President Johnson: Unclear [...] [...] [...] Goddammit, I don't {{know how}} we handle these things. But I know one thing: that we've got to handle them with muscle and with toughness. And we put troops in every place they asked me to, and we came after it in {{reasonably}} good shape. Daley: But the thing is, is there's just {{so much of this}} destruction takes place before we're able to--that was my observation. We have all these things destroyed before we ever-- President Johnson: Well, that's <b>right.</b> <b>Now,</b> Mayor, <b>if</b> you want my judgment what's wrong, it's wrong with your not asking for it.|$|R
5000|$|... "This town {{is being}} forced {{to look at things}} they never wanted to look at before," [...] stated Cherry in an excerpt from Newsweek. Cherry, along with Lone Star Legal Aid, a local nonprofit law firm, {{compiled}} statistics showing that the Paris Independent School District punished black kids eight times more often than white ones, even though blacks make up a minority of the population. The U.S. Department of Education ruled that there wasn't enough evidence to attribute the discrepancy to racism. The New York Times quoted Cherry, [...] "I think we are probably stuck in 1930 <b>right</b> about <b>now.</b> <b>If</b> you complain about anything, {{you are going to be}} punished." ...|$|R
