5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E

When Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) tells Tracy that he <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> magazine that Bill Cosby hates him, Tracy realizes that The Black Crusaders, a cabal of powerful African Americans (a {{reference to the}} 2006 conspiracy theory hoax regarding a similar group called the Dark Crusaders driving Dave Chappelle off his Comedy Central show), are out to destroy his career. The Black Crusaders have managed {{to put a stop}} to all productions featuring Tracy. Fearing for his life, Tracy goes on the run to Cleveland and, from there, into Needmore, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume {{had been designed}} by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode is}} <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, {{the whole story}} assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E
5|$|Yarim-Lim {{spent the}} next years of his reign {{expanding}} the kingdom, which reached Mamma in the north. The Syrian city-states were subdued through alliances or force; Mamma, Ebla and Ugarit became vassals of Yamhad, while Qatna remained independent but came to peace with Yamhad {{following the death of}} its ally, the late Shamshi-Adad I. A sample of Yarim-Lim policy of diplomacy and war can be <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tablet discovered at Mari, that was sent to the king of Dēr in southern Mesopotamia, which included a declaration of war against Der and its neighbor Diniktum, the tablet mentions the stationing of 500 Yamhadite warships for twelve years in Diniktum, and the Yamhadite military support of Der for 15 years. Yarim-Lim's accomplishments elevated Yamhad into the status of a Great Kingdom and the Yamhadite king title became the Great King.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{initially}} titled {{this new}} work Tintin et les Faussaires ("Tintin and the Forgers") before changing this working title to Tintin et L'Alph-Art. The story's main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, {{was based on}} a real-life art forger, Fernand Legros, whom Hergé had learned about through reading a biography of him. The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru Rajneesh which Hergé had <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> December 1982 edition of the Paris Match. In Hergé's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Hergé completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopolous from the story in 1980. Hergé's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{fundamental}} problems many English language teachers face with is enhancing L 2 learners’ reading ability and maintaining their interest <b>in</b> <b>reading.</b> Most L 2 learners have certain difficulties while <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English since they {{are not aware of}} the effective ways of reading and understanding a text, which might cause resistance and affect their attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> English. Thus, research emphasizes the importance of instruction on graphic organizers (GOs) to promote <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second (L 2) or foreign (FL) language (Fly, Jean & Hunter, 1988; Ellis, 2004; Amin, 2004). The present study investigates the possible effects of instruction on four concrete graphic organizers (GOs) on students’ application of those visual displays <b>in</b> <b>a</b> text, and examines their attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> EFL classroom. Data coming from pre and post questionnaires, focus group interviews and think alouds revealed congruence between instruction on graphic organizers and learners’ attitudes towards <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> EFL classroom...|$|R

25|$|In Kabbalah, every Shmita {{corresponds}} to individual emotional sephirot (the lower seven sephirot from Chessed to Malchut, named middot). 13th-century scholar Nahmanides {{asserted that the}} Torah could be read differently through different pronunciation and word divisions. Building on this idea, the author of Sefer HaTemunah asserted that the Torah is <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different way during each Shmita. The author further stated that one Hebrew letter is missing altogether from the Torah, and will be revealed only when the world moves to the next sephira.|$|E
25|$|Rings {{large enough}} to carry numbers are usually {{restricted}} to larger birds, although if necessary small extensions to the rings (leg flags) bearing the identification code allow their use on slightly smaller species.

25|$|A codon {{is a set}} {{of three}} nucleotides, a triplet that code for a certain amino acid. The first codon {{establishes}} the reading frame, whereby a new codon begins. A protein′s amino acid backbone sequence is defined by contiguous triplets. Codons are key to translation of genetic information for the synthesis of proteins. The reading frame is set when translating the mRNA begins and is maintained as it reads one triplet to the next. The reading of the genetic code is subject to three rules the monitor codons in mRNA. First, codons are <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 5' to 3' direction. Second, codons are nonoverlapping and the message has no gaps. The last rule, as stated above, that the message is translated in a fixed reading frame.|$|E

After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at {{the suffering of the}} horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.|$|E
25|$|Evidence in debates is {{organized}} into units called cards (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice {{has long been}} out of favor). Cards are designed to condense an author's argument so that debaters have {{an easy way to}} access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the tag, the cite, and the body. The tag is the debater's summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually only one or two sentences. The cite contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The body is a fragment of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly—cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the cite and the body.|$|E
