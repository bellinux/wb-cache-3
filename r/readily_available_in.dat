5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was so great that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still <b>readily</b> <b>available.</b> <b>In</b> terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E

5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where {{he knew he had}} the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, {{vegetarian}} borscht {{served with}} sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as , is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to {{provide an opportunity to}} use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the new calving season. Cold borscht blended {{with sour cream}} is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.|$|E
5|$|With large {{metallic}} red inflorescences {{and attractive}} feathery leaves that {{are perhaps the}} softest of all Banksia species, B.brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. Seeds and plants are <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour {{as soon as they}} open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage.|$|E

5|$|The {{years after}} the Black Death left many women widows; in the wider economy labour was in short supply and land was {{suddenly}} <b>readily</b> <b>available.</b> <b>In</b> rural areas peasant women could enjoy a better standard of living than ever before, but {{the amount of work}} being done by women may have increased. Many other women travelled to the towns and cities, {{to the point where they}} outnumbered men in some settlements. There they worked with their husbands, or in a limited number of occupations, including spinning, making clothes, victualling and as servants. Some women became full-time ale brewers, until they were pushed out of business by the male-dominated beer industry in the 15th century. Higher status jobs and apprenticeships, however, remained closed to women. As in earlier times, noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands' absence and again, if necessary, defended them in sieges and skirmishes. Wealthy widows who could successfully claim their rightful share of their late husband's property could live as powerful members of the community in their own right.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E
