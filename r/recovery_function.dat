They {{are developing a}} magneto-electrostatic reactor named [...] "F1" [...] that is based in-part on the polywell. It introduces a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces that provide a new means of preserving energy and particle losses {{that would otherwise be}} lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this <b>recovery</b> <b>function</b> as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremmstralung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis, which relied on interpolation. The new model demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. Prior to building a scale reactor, they are developing an HPC simulation and benchtop test device using a modified spindle cusp to validate these results. Fusion One presented their work at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual Review Meeting.|$|E

40|$|The {{grounding}} of semiotics in the finiteness {{of cognition}} is extended {{by examining the}} assumption that cognition can be compared or described. To this end, the two means by which qualitative values for cognition are putatively derived – introspection and observation – are framed {{in terms of the}} semiosic field as metacognition and trans-metacognition. These <b>recovery</b> <b>functions</b> are seen to be complex and mutable, dependent on context and habitus rather than objective encapsulation of past thought. An alternative view of cognitive similarity is offered: that <b>recovery</b> <b>functions</b> stabilise a mythology of cognition that facilitates its allocation by important discourses such as psychology, neurology, philosophy, and indeed semiotics. These superstructural discourses, in turn, operate to shape the context and habitus of new agents, including the proliferation of <b>recovery</b> <b>functions.</b> To formalise this cyclically determinative process, a concept of semioformation is introduced that locates the ontogeny of agents among the cumulative externalities of other agents. Determination, rather than description, is therefore posited as the effect of the assignment of qualitative or equivalence values to cognition. With this in mind, technology is highlighted as a critical area in which to examine <b>recovery</b> <b>functions</b> and semioformation. In particular, the category of the real is seen as undergoing rapid mutation...|$|R
40|$|The UV-irradiated temperature-sensitive early SV 40 mutant tsA 209 {{is able to}} {{activate}} at the non-permissive temperature the expression of mutator and <b>recovery</b> <b>functions</b> in rat cells. Unirradiated SV 40 activates these functions only to a low extent. The expression of these mutator and <b>recovery</b> <b>functions</b> in SV 40 -infected cells was detected using the single-stranded DNA parvovirus H- 1 as a probe. Because early SV 40 mutants are defective in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis at the non-permissive temperature, {{these results suggest that}} replication of UV-damaged DNA is not a prerequisite for the activation of mutator and <b>recovery</b> <b>functions</b> in mammalian cells. The expression of the mutator function is dose-dependent, i. e. the absolute number of UV-irradiated SV 40 virions introduced per cell determines its level. Implications for the interpretation of mutation induction curves in the progeny of UV-irradiated SV 40 in permissive host cells are discussed. © 1982 Masson, Paris.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose. To study {{different}} aspects of macular function in eyes with early age-related macular degeneration (early AMD: drusen with or without retinal pigment epithelium alterations) and normal visual acuity, to obtain a complete evaluation of macular function impairment in early AMD and to study the relationship between macular function and the ophthalmoscopic signs of early AMD. Methods, Forty-seven subjects with early AMD and visual acuity better than 20 / 25 {{in at least one}} eye were studied: 34 patients had bilateral early AMD (group 1), 13 had neovascular AMD in the fellow (nonstudy) eye (group 2). Thirty-six age-matched healthy subjects were used as controls. Thirty degree stereoscopic fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography were performed to grade macular lesions. Macular <b>recovery</b> <b>function,</b> central visual field sensitivity, spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity, and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test were used to study {{different aspects}} of macular function. Results. Except for color vision, all macular function tests were significantly impaired in eyes of patients with early AMD compared to those in control subjects. No functional difference was found between groups 1 and 2. The increase in drusen number negatively influenced macular <b>recovery</b> <b>function.</b> Increasing drusen confluence reduced macular <b>recovery</b> <b>function</b> as well as central visual field sensitivity and some selected spatial frequencies of spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity. Geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and focal hyperpigmentation reduced macular <b>recovery</b> <b>function</b> and contrast sensitivity at the highest spatial frequency. Conclusions. Macular <b>recovery</b> <b>function,</b> central visual field sensitivity, and spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity are adequate and reliable indicators of macular function impairment in early AMD. Macular <b>recovery</b> <b>function</b> is the test that best reflects the ophthalmoscopic characteristics of early AMD because its deterioration parallels the worsening of typical fundus lesions. Function tests are valuable in the evaluation of patients with early AMD, particularly when interventional trials are planned...|$|E

40|$|The {{refractory}} {{behavior of}} the electrically stimulated auditory nerve can be described by the <b>recovery</b> <b>function,</b> which plots the ECAP amplitude {{in response to a}} masker/probe stimulus pair {{as a function of the}} time interval (Masker Probe Interval, MPI) between the two stimuli. The <b>recovery</b> <b>function</b> is characterized by two time intervals or periods: In the first interval (the Absolute Refractory Period, ARP), typically lasting for 300 to 400 us, the neurons stimulated by the masker are in absolute refractory and unable to respond to the probe stimulus. As the MPI is gradually increased beyond the ARP, the stimulated neural population is increasingly able to respond to the probe stimulus (i. e. relative refractory) as the inhibitory effects of the masker diminishes. This second interval (the Relative Refractory Period, RRP) can be characterized by the time constant of an asymptotically increasing exponential function (Morsnowski et al. 2006). This recovery time constant provides an indication of the neurons’ temporal characteristics. Previous reports (e. g. Battmer et al. 2004) suggest that this time constant is affected by the stimulation level used to determine the <b>recovery</b> <b>function.</b> Such a dependency would make it difficult to characterize the refractory {{behavior of the}} stimulated neurons using the <b>recovery</b> <b>function.</b> In this study, the refractory behavior of the electrically stimulated auditory nerve with respect to stimulation level was examined retrospectively.
