50|$|The Silverhill pottery {{opened in}} 1838 and {{provided}} {{an important source}} of employment for local people. It consisted of a large open shed with a tiled roof and a <b>round</b> <b>kiln</b> where roof tiles and chimney pots were made.|$|E
5000|$|On {{her time}} at Newcomb College, Joor wrote: [...] [...] [...] many {{memories}} of those beginning days of Newcomb {{in the tiny}} vine-covered brick building that housed the college heating plant! We were so like a little family group the few of us working at our tables with Mr. Meyer thumping out his vases at the wheel beside us, and the big <b>round</b> <b>kiln</b> looming up in the other corner of the room, with the splashed glazing table beside it! I loved so I sued to linger on and on, forgetting everything but the jar under my hand [...] [...] [...]|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a {{procession}} for the Fiesta de San Esteban (Saint Stephen), Acoma Pueblo, ca. 1900. A {{large group of}} people are walking in {{a procession}} {{on the right side}} of the road between the high walls of the adjacent pueblo adobes. Some of the women carry parasols. The rafter tails are exposed, and ladders lean against the walls providing access to upper levels. Some observers sit on the roofs. A <b>round</b> <b>kiln</b> (?) is visible in the left foreground...|$|E
50|$|In 1931, the Pottery was {{acquired}} as {{a subsidiary of}} James Oakes & Co. (Riddings) Ltd. and renamed Lovatts Potteries Ltd. One of the first actions of the new ownership was to introduce a substantial programme of modernisation, including the installation of a gas-fired Dressler Kiln to replace the old <b>Round</b> <b>Kilns.</b> The Dressler kiln allowed the continuous production of ware, and was much more efficient in both fuel and labour than the traditional <b>round</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of the {{original}} farm buildings. The oast originally had four <b>kilns,</b> two <b>round</b> and two square. Hops had last been dried here some time before 1925. The two square kilns were demolished in 1935 and the stowage was damaged in a fire in 1951. The oast was restored in 1984, both <b>round</b> <b>kilns</b> and one square kiln being restored with cowls. The oast houses a reconstruction of a village store, being the interior fittings of a general store in Hawkhurst.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the open}} area among the {{buildings}} were uncovered simple <b>round</b> <b>kilns</b> and one sizable waste pit. This installation served as workshop district, specialized among others to reparations and perhaps simple production of the Roman military equipment and weaponry. This evidence support an idea that inside the fortified area operated certain numbers of civilian personnel under protection of the Roman army. Their sustenance depended on contracts with the Roman army and for that they followed them even {{in the time of}} war into the hostile territory ...|$|R
50|$|Brickell {{was known}} for his skill at {{building}} kilns. Most of the kilns at Driving Creek Railway were designed and built by Brickell using bricks made on-site from clay sourced on the same property. According to Christine Leov-Lealand's biography, Brickell built his first brick kiln at age seven under the family home in Devonport, which was almost set alight. In 1968, he built a <b>round</b> coal-fired <b>kiln</b> for potter Yvonne Rust in Greymouth; in 1975, he built a kiln for artist Ralph Hotere in Port Chalmers, fired from pine bark recycled from a nearby wharf. In 1982, Brickell was invited to Vanuatu to build a kiln and establish a ceramics programme for young people, and in 1986, he built a wood-fired salt-glaze kiln for the Northern Arizona University Art Gallery.|$|R
5000|$|Samarra {{witnessed}} the [...] "coming of age" [...] of Islamic art. Polychrome painted stucco allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: {{the invention of}} faience, and of metallic lusterware. Hadithic prohibition {{of the use of}} golden or silver vessels {{led to the development of}} metallic lusterware in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second <b>round</b> through the <b>kiln,</b> but the wish to exceed fine Chinese porcelain led to the development of this technique.|$|R
