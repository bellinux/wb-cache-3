Full penetration autogenous welds {{were made at}} a constant laser power of 4. 9 kW using a continuous-wave (CW) fibre laser at travel speeds of 3. 0 – 5. 0 m/min and focal positions of + 4 to − 4 mm.

Based on the results, it was believed that relatively small influence of ionisation on fibre laser induced plume enhanced the welding process stability and lowered the threshold power density for keyhole formation. Both Ar and He shielding gases could therefore, be used effectively to produce good quality welds.

Mathematical models have been devised expressing the levels of controllable welding factors {{as a function of}} the joint geometry, such that acceptable weld beads are produced. Weld beads were required to be both geometrically acceptable and mechanically sound despite changes in the root face thickness (0. 5 mm - 2. 5 mm) and root gap (0 - 1. 5 mm). The equations are intended to form part of an adaptively controlled robotic arc welding system. Simulation was used to develop the adaptive expressions. The study was applied to the <b>root</b> <b>weld</b> bead of the closing seam of railway bogie side frames fabricated from structural steel. The self shielding flux cored electrode arc welding process was used to weld single J preparations orientated in the horizontal-vertical position.

Mathematical models derived from factorially designed experiments were used to relate the weld bead geometry, incidence of porosity and the occurrence of electrode stubbing to a function of upto seven factors. A data base of almost 1000 test welds was generated, in which each test was characterised by 76 pieces of information.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the structure and chemical composition changes of gas metal arc welded joints of wear resistant plate with constructional steel plate with possible application as replacing material for reservoirs and chute in cement industry. Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Design/methodology/approach: Wear resistant plates can be used for elements working in intensive abrasion resistance conditions to obtain considerable material and economical savings based on the manufacturing costs reducing and decreasing turnaround time for replacing worn parts. During the welding process of two materials, when one is wear plate and the other is steel plate significant structure changes and mixing of alloying components in weld area are observed. Findings: Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root, most of important changes during welding of wear resistant material are connected with melting, mixing and carbides passage into weld area, non uniform chemical composition of the welded joint creates different microstructures with different hardness. Practical implications: Welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. <b>Root</b> <b>weld</b> must be free of cracks and possibly free of intermixing with wear resistant plate material.

40|$|The {{location}} {{of oil and}} gas reserves in Australia and the distribution of centres of population have created a need for an extensive network of land based transmission pipelines. There is a continuing need to expand this network but this must be achieved within increasingly stringent cost targets and in accordance with changing environmental constraints. The pipeline industry in Australia has traditionally employed smaller diameter and thinner wall pipe materials than are common in many other parts of the world. In order to improve cost effectiveness there is also a trend to increase the yield strength of the material and to further reduce wall thickness. Girth welding of pipelines in the field represents a significant proportion of the installation cost and is currently performed by highly skilled manual welders using the shielded metal arc process (SMAW), cellulosic electrodes and a 2 ̆ 7 stovepipe 2 ̆ 7 technique. The use of lower wall thickness has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} weld runs and the overall cost. The higher yield strength low alloy pipe materials have been shown to have excellent weldability but as yield strength increases there may be an increased risk of weld metal cracking, particularly if overmatching welds are required. The current Australian field welding practice has been analysed and the local constraints identified. Based on this review a list of desirable attributes for suitable processes was drawn up. The international literature on process options for mechanised girth welding was reviewed and techniques, which fitted the Australian requirements were identified. The most attractive mechanised girth welding options for further investigation were identified as: • GMAW (New technology controlled transfer) • Pulsed plasma keyhole welding • High current (buried arc/keyhole) GTAW 3 ̆c• MIAB welding The rationale behind these suggestions is discussed and the implications for the pipeline industry in adopting mechanised girth welding are explored. Suggestions regarding the design of suitable systems are put forward. A practical assessment of the first of these short listed options was conducted and found to offer considerable promise. This process is tolerant to gap variations, inaccuracy in groove preparation and pipe misalignment. High welding speeds (735 mm/min) are also achieved, with high quality welds deposited without varying welding parameters as the arc progresses along the circumference.

40|$|Fiber {{laser welding}} and fiber laser-arc hybrid welding have been {{developed}} into very useful industrial processes {{over the past few}} years. However, the use of fiber lasers can be associated with quality problems at the <b>weld</b> <b>root</b> such as intermittent penetration, melt ejection, and humping. This paper explains the mechanisms which create these instabilities and suggests a repair technique which would alleviate the problems in some cases. The main difference between fiber and CO 2 laser welding is that during fiber laser welding there is a strong downward thrust on the melt in the keyhole. (This is not the case during CO 2 laser welding.) The downward thrust on the melt is generated {{as a result of the}} fiber laser evaporating the top faces of bumps on the melt surface. The downward flow has two main effects; (a) the melt can achieve velocities which result in melt ejection from the root of the weld—which can result in intermittent penetration, (b) the supply of hot metal to the bottom of the weld makes the process much more thermally uniform at the top and bottom of the weld. This uniformity means that the melt is extended backward several millimeters on the top and bottom surfaces—which can result in melt humping in the <b>weld</b> <b>root</b> as well as on the top surface. This paper examines these <b>weld</b> <b>root</b> instabilities and also describes a technique of <b>weld</b> <b>root</b> remelting which has been shown to be effective in smoothing out the <b>root</b> of the <b>weld</b> to improve its tensile and fatigue properties...|$|R
