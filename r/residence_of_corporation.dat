For individuals, physical presence in a jurisdiction is the main test. Some jurisdictions also determine residency of an individual by reference to a variety of other factors, such as the ownership of a home or availability of accommodation, family, and financial interests. For companies, some jurisdictions determine the <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> a <b>corporation</b> based on its place of incorporation. Other jurisdictions determine the <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> a <b>corporation</b> by reference to its place of management. Some jurisdictions use both a place-of-incorporation test and a place-of-management test.|$|R

40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies of}} well-known U. S. multinationals such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Hewlett-Packard Co. have received much attention recently. Multinationals 2 ̆ 7 use of foreign shell entities to shift income {{away from the}} United States is subject to scrutiny. The debate is primarily about the sourcing of income, not about the tax <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> the corporate entities involved. That is hardly surprising, because many view the tax <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations</b> as meaningless. That meaninglessness is occasionally cited to support {{the adoption of a}} territorial system of taxation, in which residence is arguably less relevant for tax outcomes. This report summarizes some conclusions from a forthcoming Boston College Law Review article in which Marian recommends a fresh look at corporate tax residence. Marian argues that the perception of meaninglessness is a result of misguided normative discussion and that it cannot be avoided by adopting a territorial system. In his report, Marian develops a functional model under which corporate tax residence tests are designed to support the policy purposes of corporate taxation, and the tests are not independently justified in normative terms. A functional approach suggests that the United States should adopt a corporate tax residence test under which domestic corporations for tax purposes are corporations whose securities are listed for public trading in the United States, or whose place of central management and control is in the United States...|$|R

The basis <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> {{taxation}} is {{that residents}} enjoy {{protection in the}} state where they contribute towards the costs of government. In tax treaties residence is used for purposes of allocating income and taxing rights between contracting states. For treaty purposes residence is determined on a day to day basis, hence a person can be resident in two countries at concurrent time periods. It is important to determine the <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> a <b>corporation</b> in a specific jurisdiction for purposes of ascertaining the treaty benefits that the entity can enjoy and the allocation of income between contracting states in a treaty. Usually a company’s tax residence is considered to create a sufficient connection with the country that has jurisdiction over it. The recognition <b>of</b> the <b>residence</b> status <b>of</b> natural and juristic persons is the cornerstone <b>of</b> international taxation. <b>Residence</b> is also used as an antiavoidance tax measure in international tax...|$|R
