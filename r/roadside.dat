5|$|Along the routing of M-28, MDOT has {{established}} several <b>roadside</b> parks and rest areas. Two {{of these are}} in Ontonagon County near Ewen and Trout Creek. A park with a picnic area, and a footbridge lies near Tioga Creek in Baraga County east of the US41 junction. In Three Lakes a scenic turnout and a <b>roadside</b> park overlook Lake Michigamme, and along Lake Superior south of Marquette is a tourist information center built as a log cabin. East of the H-01 junction in Au Train is a <b>roadside</b> park that includes Scott Falls. Further east, a year-round rest area {{is located on the}} west end of the Seney Stretch. Three other <b>roadside</b> parks lie east of Harvey in Shelter Bay, on the shores of Deer Lake and west of Newberry.|$|E
5|$|Farmers and growers often sell {{surplus food}} and flowers in boxes on the <b>roadside,</b> {{relying on the}} honesty of {{customers}} to drop the correct change into the money box and take what they want. In the 21st century, diversification of agriculture and amendments in planning strategy have led to farm shops replacing many of the <b>roadside</b> stalls.|$|E
5|$|Ikata has two <b>roadside</b> {{stations}} along Route 197. These are highway rest stops {{that offer}} refreshments, travel information, recreation facilities, and local goods for sale.|$|E
30|$|For a {{real image}} with curved <b>roadsides,</b> the {{proposed}} method successfully extracts the current {{position of the}} <b>roadsides</b> by improving the detection of road edges. To this end, we generate multiple hypotheses representing possible locations for <b>roadsides.</b> During this phase, we would evaluate all possible detections of the road edges {{to ensure that we}} find the correct positions of the <b>roadsides.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Roadsides</b> have {{significantly}} higher SOC, {{which can be}} explained by the following. First, soils in <b>roadsides</b> are seldom disturbed, while other land uses undergo transformations and replacement of vegetation by structures or other vegetation, which depletes SOC. Second, atmospheric deposition from vehicles and high accumulation of dust from nearby sealed surfaces result in increased nutrient content in <b>roadsides</b> (Chon et al. [1998]; Park et al. [2010]; Li et al. [2013]). Third, street litter and animal waste in <b>roadsides</b> may also lead to SOC accumulation (Park et al. [2010]; Zhao et al. [2013]). Similar to SOC, the highest C/N is found in <b>roadsides</b> followed by industrial areas. However, soil TN shows no statistical difference (P[*]=[*] 0.052) between seven land-use types.|$|R
50|$|Their {{habit of}} feeding near <b>roadsides</b> {{sometimes}} results in collisions with traffic. A {{decline in the}} numbers of these birds seen along <b>roadsides</b> in northern India has been noted.|$|R
5|$|MDOT {{provides}} {{a number of}} different services to motorists traveling along the state trunkline highway system. Along M-66, there are six different carpool lots located near Nashville, Woodland, Belding, Sheridan, Sears and Marion. There are additional services provided to travelers in the form of <b>roadside</b> parks and rest areas. There are two <b>roadside</b> parks along the highway, one is between Woodland and Woodbury, and the second is in Sheridan. The roadway also {{provides a}}ccess to the Ionia State Recreation Area and a state harbor on Lake Charlevoix.|$|E

30|$|The soil pH, BD, and AP in <b>roadsides</b> and {{residential}} areas are {{significantly higher than}} in the forests. The soil Mn, SOC, and C/N are higher in <b>roadsides</b> than the rest land-use types. Soil AP is significantly higher in road greenbelts.|$|R

5|$|After {{decades of}} debate, the A303's {{junction}} with the A344, {{just east of}} Stonehenge, was closed in 2013 as part of improvements to visitor facilities. During this work, a <b>roadside</b> monument {{was moved to the}} visitor centre; the stone monument is to Captain Eustace Loraine and Staff-Sergeant Richard Wilson, killed in July 1912 in the first fatal accident of the recently formed Royal Flying Corps.|$|E
5|$|Australian kites may be {{sedentary}} or nomadic, {{and generally}} occur in open grasslands or valleys {{where there are}} scattered clumps of trees. In urban areas they are found {{on the edge of}} towns on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, or grassy <b>roadside</b> verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes, drier marshland, and farmland.|$|E
5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for the brook that ran near the <b>roadside</b> and that {{eventually}} went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, {{turned out to be}} difficult to farm.|$|E

5|$|Following Kahaanis success, Kolkata {{became a}} {{preferred}} destination for Bollywood filmmakers. They felt the landscapes of Mumbai and Delhi were overused for several decades, while Kolkata retained its unique visuals such as metro trains, rickety trams, hand-pulled rickshaws, dingy bylanes, palatial mansions, dilapidated houses of North Kolkata, <b>roadside</b> eateries, ghats of river Ganga, British-era buildings, restaurants and iconic structures and areas including Howrah Bridge, Kalighat Temple, Nakhoda Mosque, Kumortuli idol-making district and Victoria Memorial.|$|E
5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water {{that had been left}} at the <b>roadside</b> by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
