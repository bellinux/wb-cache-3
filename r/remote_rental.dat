40|$|Executive SummaryAn {{assessment}} of tenant {{experiences of the}} National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing (NPARIH) Property and Tenancy Management (PTM) reforms in the Northern Territory was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Aff airs (FaHCSIA), in conjunction with the Northern Territory Government. The Allen Consulting Group implemented the project in collaboration with the Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation. PTM reforms and the new <b>Remote</b> <b>Rental</b> Framework represent a signifi cant change for remote communities and follow a substantial investment in new, rebuilt and refurbished housing stock. The reforms extend urban public housing standards to remote communities with no previous requirement to enter into a formal undertaking on joint responsibilities relating to property and tenancy management. The undertaking relates to all aspects of sustaining the housing and nominates a head tenant(s) responsible for the house and damages. The objective of the project was to fill critical in formation gaps {{about the impact of the}} PTM reforms on tenants and communities at a relatively early stage in the reform process. Hearing from communities about their experience of the reforms provides important feedback to inform the ongoing development an d implementation of policy, program design and effective service delivery. This report outlines the findings of a survey of tenants in 10 0 households in selected remote Northern Territory communities, against background information about the roll out of th e reforms and local implementation involving over 3, 200 new, rebuilt and refurbished houses. Background information was obtained through review of policy and program documentation, and consultation with key government stakeholders and community service providers. Additional background was obtained through a targeted literature review that included relevant government reports and emerging research...|$|E

50|$|Skelton was {{infatuated}} with his appearance on color television, and he cajoled CBS to colorcast the program (In 1961, Skelton also invested in three <b>rental</b> <b>remote</b> vans which had full live, film, and color videotape capability). Although visionary, the venture in color was premature {{and when it}} failed, CBS bought Skelton's facilities (formerly Charlie Chaplin Studios) as part of renewing Skelton's contract.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A kiosk is a {{separate}} electronic computer terminal that allows the users to access information service. Traditional kiosks such as Automated Teller Machines (ATM) use software application with graphical user interfaces similar to normal computer system to allow users to accomplish their transaction tasks. However, this interaction mode has been proven {{to be difficult to}} use and not user-friendly for almost half of self-service users. A new type of interactive service kiosk which uses remote Video Mediated Communication (VMC) technology is to provide face-to-face talking with a customer servant to achieve the goal. Interactive VMC-based service kiosk is a tool that can be utilized in information technology field, bringing its customer convenience and close care to the virtual network. Differ from previous automated kiosk technologies which were concentrated on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), VMC-based kiosk puts emphasis on human-to-human interface technology. It’s not only providing easier user situation for personal services but also bringing benefits for service providers due to the customized service VMC-based service kiosks offered. VMC-based kiosk service utilizes cost-saving goals accomplished meanwhile gives stimulations to achieve a new scale of perspectives and possibilities in the right direction for the company. The target for the thesis is to exploit <b>remote</b> car <b>rental</b> service using VMC-based kiosk solution and analyze its attributions relate to another three service areas, banking, travelling and reception, in order to find out in what kinds of intended future services VMC technology can be beneficial. For the purpose, this case study uses qualitative approach with scenario-based prototyping and user testing. The test results were gathered in a real use environment where nine people used the prototype and were interviewed in situ. The use situations and interviews were video recorded and transcribed for qualitative content analysis. Based on testing participants’ experience and feedbacks, the three testing cases indicated that interactive kiosk services using VMC technology in general was considered positive and well accepted. This study also clearly showed that remote VMC-based kiosk service can be successfully transferred to different service areas where similar types of negotiation-based service processes are common. By VMC-based kiosks services, customers can be offered face-to-face talk as a natural communication mode which is an overwhelmed advantage over the traditional kiosk system. Participants in study testing also felt easy and convenient in VMC-based kiosk service use by these features. Meanwhile, more concerns of how to better use of VMC-based kiosk service in other perspectives are still required in the future...|$|R
