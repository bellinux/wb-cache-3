40|$|This article {{examines}} the market memory effect in convertible bond markets. We look at the pricing of convertible bonds issued after the original issuer <b>redeemed</b> previous <b>issues</b> without giving an opportunity for investors to benefit from bond value appreciation. We find evidence that the market underprices new convertible bond issues of firms that called their previous convertible bonds early compared with new convertibles bonds of firms that called their previous convertibles late...|$|R
40|$|We allow {{banks to}} choose between two {{networks}} in a simple version of the Cavalcanti and Wallace (1999) model of inside money. Members of a network have access to credit but must <b>redeem</b> banknotes <b>issued</b> by other members in random meetings. We find equilibria in which members of a particular network issue more valuable notes, but face the same ex-ante payoff as that of their competition. Banks are shown {{to be concerned with}} both credit externalities and with monetary liabilities. When the size of the bank sector is small, these two opposing forces may result in a stable equilibrium. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} new, supply-side {{explanation}} for the consistent, statistically signiﬁcant, empirical observation that covered warrant prices are {{higher than those of}} corresponding traded options. Covered warrant market-makers, who set prices, are also the issuers and always have net short positions. Their reservation prices for <b>redeeming</b> or <b>issuing</b> more warrants reﬂect the change in their total hedgingrelated costs. For overall net short positions we show both bid and ask reservation prices lie above perfect-market values, since transaction costs increase both issuers’ marginal costs of warrant issuance and the marginal beneﬁts of warrant redemption. The model generates prices and bid-ask spreads consistent with existing empirical evidence and also new testable implications...|$|R
50|$|While gold- or silver-backed {{representative}} money {{entails the}} legal {{requirement that the}} bank of <b>issue</b> <b>redeem</b> it in fixed weights of gold or silver, fiat money's value is unrelated {{to the value of}} any physical quantity. A coin is fiat currency to the extent that its face value, value defined in law, is greater than its market value as metal.|$|R
30|$|The third line in Fig. 1 {{illustrates}} the maturity {{structure of the}} discontinuous financing policy. At time t, the firm issues debt with a fixed maturity structure of k periods. After k periods (e.g., years), the firm refinances this debt issue at time t+k by <b>redeeming</b> the debt <b>issued</b> on the most recent refinancing date t, D_t, and issuing new debt D_t+k according to its target leverage ratio applied to the prevailing {{market value of the}} firm.|$|R
5000|$|Regular {{warrants}} are redeemable by {{the government}} treasurer after they are issued. [...] "Registered warrants" [...] bear interest and need not be redeemed by the treasurer until the warrant maturity date. [...] If warrants cannot be immediately <b>redeemed</b> by the <b>issuing</b> entity, the collecting bank may accept the warrants as short term debt instruments and collect interest when redeemed in accordance with a prior agreement with the issuing entity. The collecting bank may refuse to accept a warrant issue, in which case other banks may also refuse to accept them.|$|R
40|$|Clawback {{provisions}} {{allow the}} issuer to partially <b>redeem</b> a bond <b>issue</b> often {{within three years}} of issuance using proceeds only from new equity issues. Empirical evidence indicates the clawback provision is rarely exercised. This poses an interesting dilemma as clawback provisions are an expensive source of funding, often commanding yields that are significantly higher than traditional corporate bonds. We develop a simple model that provides a rationale for the scarcity of call redemptions and the higher yields of clawback bonds. The model predicts a relation between issuance of clawback bonds, cash flow volatility and the probability of renegotiation of clawback debt contracts...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of whether transactable forms of privately issued, demandable debt are better used as "banknotes" or "checks. " The distinction between the two is that a check must be <b>redeemed</b> by the <b>issuing</b> bank with each use, whereas a banknote can circulate. We find that {{the answer to the question}} depends critically on the cost of early redemption. If this cost is small, banknotes will not circulate, so the question is moot. If this cost is large, incentive problems will prevent the issue of banknotes. For intermediate values of the early redemption cost, the option of early redemption limits the bank's risk-taking behavior, so that banknotes will be preferred over checks.

5|$|On August 13, 1898, the Spanish–American War {{ended with}} Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States. The Banco Español de Puerto Rico was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills {{equivalent}} to the United States dollar, creating the Puerto Rican dollar. In 1902, the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner. Two more series were issued until 1913. After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were <b>redeemed</b> for those <b>issued</b> by the United States Treasury. The peso and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues, including commemorative banknotes, private currency, and a quarter coin designed with Fort San Felipe del Morro in the face.|$|R
5000|$|Gift {{cards are}} divided into [...] "open loop" [...] or [...] "network" [...] cards and [...] "closed loop" [...] cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card {{companies}} and can be redeemed by different establishments, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only <b>redeemed</b> by the <b>issuing</b> provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees. In either case the giver would buy the gift card (and {{may have to pay}} an additional purchase fee), and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the [...] "hybrid closed loop" [...] card where the issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific mall.|$|R

5000|$|Based at Marks' Farringdon studio, Maximus was {{run on a}} 'film club' basis, {{meaning that}} punters would have {{to sign up for}} {{membership}} before purchasing the films, mirroring the way membership-only sex cinemas were run at the time. While his earlier 8mm films largely consisted of nothing more explicit than the models posing topless, late-sixties titles like Apartment 69 and The Amorous Masseur were generally softcore sex affairs. Marks had been eager to shoot soft porn material ever since the Window Dresser case, much to the disdain of Pamela Green, who dissolved their business partnership in 1967. [...] "He was fond of good living and a drink or two, and he wanted to go on to soft porn," [...] Green told Tit-Bits magazine in 1995, adding [...] "there was this one film where he was dressed as a dirty old man and he's creeping round Piccadilly Circus, then you see him in bed with this girl". One Maximus short The Ecstasy of Oral Love even adopts a pseudo-sex-education front, showing a couple frantically licking each other, ending with some relatively graphic oral sex scenes which are inter-cut with supposedly socially <b>redeeming</b> title cards <b>issuing</b> advice to 'young married couples'.|$|R
5000|$|The Port Carlisle {{line was}} leased for £3100 a year; its {{preference}} stock became NBR preference stock, its mortgage debt became debentures yielding 3% a year, and its ordinary stock {{was to get}} a dividend of 1% (or 3% less than the dividend on NBR ordinary stock if that exceeded 4%) The Silloth lease (negotiated separately) was for £2000 a year: Silloth ordinary stock became NBR ordinary stock, its authorised debt became NBR debt. The ultra vires assets and borrowings were left to the Silloth company to liquidate: the directors responsible for acquiring assets {{not covered by the}} act of incorporation were treated as having personally bought those assets; they were also to assume personal responsibility for half the borrowing in excess of the amount authorised by the act, the other half to be <b>redeemed</b> by the <b>issue</b> of preference stock the dividend on which would be paid from the rent of the line. [...] The requisite Acts were obtained, despite scathing comments ("The North British Company are the best hands in the world that I know of for making bad bargains") from Lord Redesdale the chairman of the Lords committee.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three papers that have the valuation of derivative securities as a common theme. The first paper empirically compares three convertible bond valuation models. We use an innovative approach where all model parameters are estimated by the Marquardt (1963) algorithm using a subsample of convertible bond prices. The model parameters are then used for out-of-sample forecasts of convertible bond prices. The mean absolute deviation, which is calculated as the absolute difference between the model and the market price and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} market price, is 1. 70 % for the Ayache-Forsyth-Vetzal (2003) model, 1. 74 % for the Tsiveriotis-Fernandes (1998) model, and 2. 12 % for the Brennan-Schwartz (1980) model. For this and other measures of fit, the Ayache-Forsyth-Vetzal and the Tsiveriotis-Fernandes models outperform the Brennan-Schwartz model. The second paper examines the market memory effect in convertible bond markets. More specifically, we look at the pricing of convertible bonds issued after the original issuer adversely <b>redeemed</b> previous <b>issues</b> without giving an opportunity for investors to benefit from bond value appreciation. We find evidence that the market underprices new convertible bond issues of firms that call their bonds early. We also find that the degree of market underpricing depends on whether the convertibles are more debt- or equity-like. In the third paper, the European put-call parity condition is used to estimate the early exercise premium for American currency options traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Using a sample of 331 pairs of call and put options with the same exercise price and time to expiration, we find that the early exercise premium on average is 5. 03 % for put options and 4. 60 % for call options. The premia for both call and put options are strongly related to the interest rate differential and time to expiration. These results are important to consider when valuing American currency options using European option pricing models...|$|R
50|$|The Solidus Bond {{utilizes}} SHA-256 elliptical encryption on a decentralized {{block chain}} {{to create and}} <b>redeem</b> debt instruments <b>issued</b> in a digital currency. The bonds are brought into existence upon command by any investor via algorithm rather than fiat. Coupon payments and bond redemption are also executed by algorithm, {{eliminating the need for}} brokerages and theoretically reducing bond duration to zero, making credit ratings obsolete. Investors choose bond size and bond maturity of seven days to 10 years. Payments are emitted from the block chain to the SwiftCoin wallet chosen by the investor at the time of bond creation. There are no commissions or fees to pay. The only requirement to purchase a Solidus Bond is a SwiftCoin wallet and a sufficient balance of the SwiftCoin digital currency to cover the face value of the bond. Bond ownership is conveyed solely through possession. There are no accounts, records, or user databases and the block chain ledger is not public. Interest rates are set by the market and were 18% in 2016. Holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies convert to SwiftCoin to access the Solidus Bond block chain, then cash back into their initial currency at bond expiry. Solidus Bonds are not open source. Unlike Bitcoin, Solidus Bonds cannot be mined.|$|R
5000|$|Honduras was one {{of three}} Central American {{countries}} to exhibit at the exposition. While their display was modest in comparison to others, their exhibit was highlighted by a personal visit to the exposition by Honduran President Luis Bográn. During this visit Bográn's host was Burke. Bográn was impressed by Burke's personality. The two became fast friends. Bográn was looking for someone to market the wealth of natural resources Honduras had to offer the world. Burke envisioned New Orleans as being the primary importing port for all of Central America's exports. In 1886 as an inducement to Burke, Bográn offered two large mining concessions along the Jalán and Guayape rivers in return for Burke's promise to help build an industrial school in Tegucigalpa, Honduras' capital city. Burke accepted and visited Honduras at least twice between 1886 and 1888. In 1888 a reform-minded opposition succeeded in defeating Burke. The time Burke had used in connection with his position as state treasurer was now applied to develop his mining ventures. In 1889 Burke undertook a trip to London to secure financing for a modern mining operation. While in London his successor, William Henry Pipes, discovered significant discrepancies in amount of funds available in the state treasury. Burke was considered a primary suspect of this embezzlement. From London, Burke denied these allegations and stated he intended to return to New Orleans to confront his accusers. After reviewing the evidence on hand, a grand jury handed down nineteen indictments against Burke. The evidence indicated that Burke had failed to destroy state bonds which had been <b>redeemed</b> and <b>issued</b> additional baby bonds without authorization. [...] Sources place the amount of missing treasury funds anywhere from $64,000 to $2 million. [...] In early December, Burke decided not to return to New Orleans and was later personally welcomed by President Bográn to Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Burke did not come empty-handed; he had succeeded in acquiring financing of $8 million for his mining venture. Arresting Burke was not an issue, because Honduras had not yet formalized a set of extradition treaties with the U.S.|$|R
