Yoshida was {{dominated}} for most of the first round, <b>receiving</b> <b>leg</b> kicks and punches from the veteran Tamura and having his back taken on the ground, but he eventually managed to throw down Tamura and performed a sode guruma jime for the tap out.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>receiving</b> <b>leg</b> {{surgery in}} autumn 2012, Idowu {{continued}} {{to struggle with}} fitness and form during 2013. In July 2013 {{he announced that he}} was [...] "taking a step back" [...] from the sport [...] "for the foreseeable future", a step that some interpreted as tantamount to retirement. However, Idowu returned to top-level international competition at the Shanghai Diamond League meeting in May 2014, after a spell of training and competition in Australia.|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} relative effectiveness of four-layer and short-stretch bandaging for venous ulceration. Methods: A total of 387 adults with a venous ulcer, who were <b>receiving</b> <b>leg</b> ulcer treatment either in primary care or as a hospital outpatient, were recruited to this parallel-group open study and randomized to either four-layer or short-stretch bandages. Follow-up continued until the patient's reference leg was ulcer free or {{for a minimum of}} 12 months. The primary endpoint was time to complete healing of all ulcers on the reference leg. Secondary outcomes included proportion of ulcers healed, health-related quality of life, withdrawals and adverse events. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results: Unadjusted analysis identified no statistically significant difference in median time to healing: 92 days for four-layer and 126 days for short-stretch bandages. However, when prognostic factors were included in a Cox proportional hazards regression model, ulcers treated with the short-stretch bandage had a lower probability of healing than those treated with the four-layer bandage: hazard ratio 0 · 72 (95 per cent confidence interval 0 · 57 to 0 · 91). More adverse events and withdrawals were reported with the short-stretch bandage. Conclusion: Venous leg ulcers treated using a four-layer bandage healed more quickly than those treated with a short-stretch bandage. ...|$|E
50|$|In January 2012, a 67-year-old woman <b>received</b> <b>leg</b> {{lacerations}} {{after she}} was struck by falling branches from a gum tree in Heywood Park. Around 200 people were present at the time, picnicking on Australia Day. The weather was hot and windy.|$|R
50|$|The {{penetrating}} partner {{stands in}} front of the <b>receiving</b> partner, whose <b>legs</b> dangle over the edge of a bed or some other platform like a table. With the <b>receiving</b> partner's <b>legs</b> lifted towards the ceiling and resting against the penetrating partner, this is sometimes called the butterfly position. This can also be done as a kneeling position.|$|R
50|$|In {{the missionary}} positions, to achieve optimal alignment, the <b>{{receiving}}</b> partner's <b>legs</b> {{should be in}} the air with the knees drawn towards their chest. Some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiving partner's hips can also be useful. The penetrating partner positions themselves between the <b>receiving</b> partner's <b>legs.</b> The penetrating partner controls the thrusting rhythm. This position is often cited as good for beginners, because it allows them to relax more fully than is usual in the doggy style position.|$|R
40|$|Bond issuers {{frequently}} immunize/hedge {{their interest}} rate exposure {{by means of}} interest rate swaps (IRS). The <b>receiving</b> <b>leg</b> matches all bond cash-flows, while the pay leg requires floating rate coupon payments of form LIBOR + a spread. The goal of hedging against interest rate risk is only achieved in full if {{the present value of}} this spread is zero. Using market data we show that under a traditional IRS hedging strategy an investor could still experience significant cash flow losses given a 1 % shift in the underlying benchmark yield curve. We consider the instantaneous interest-rate risk of a bond portfolio that allows for general changes in interest rates. We make two contributions. The paper analyzes the size of hedging imperfections arising from the widening of the floating rate spread in a traditional swap contract and subsequently proposes two new practical, effective and analytically tractable swap structures; Structure 1 : An Improved Parallel Hedge Swap, hedges against parallel shifts of the yield curve and Structure 2 : An Improved Non-Parallel Hedge Swap, hedges against any movement of the swap curve. Analytical representations of these swaps are provided such that spreadsheet implementations are easily attainable.

40|$|The Indirect Measurement of Active Drag (IMAD) {{was used}} to study the {{contribution}} of the legs and arms to propulsion in breaststroke swimming. Contrary to MAD (Measuring of Active Drag) system, the IMAD can be used for all strokes and therefore enabled us to study the breaststroke swim to estimate not only the percentage of leg and arm contribution to propulsion but also the percentage of swimmers’ arms and legs co- ordinations. The method revealed that the best coordination was 84. 02 % and that the contribution of arms and legs in propulsive force were 43. 80 % and 56. 20 % respectively, showing that the swimmers <b>received</b> <b>leg</b> contribution better than arm contribution in propelling...|$|R
50|$|The <b>receiving</b> partner's <b>legs</b> are {{together}} turning {{to one side}} while looking up towards the penetrator, who has spread legs and is kneeling straight behind the other's hips. The penetrator's hands are on the other's hips. This position can be called the modified T-square.|$|R
5000|$|Lionhead rabbit {{is one of}} {{the newer}} breeds of {{domestic}} rabbits in the United States, and has recently passed the American Rabbit Breeders' Association presentation process and has been accepted as an ARBA recognized breed in the varieties of Tortoise and Ruby Eyed White. As of February 1st, 2014 they have been eligible to show for Best in Show and <b>receive</b> <b>legs</b> of Grand Champion like any other of the accepted breeds. The Lionhead rabbit has a wool mane encircling the head, reminiscent of a male lion, hence the name. Other characteristic traits of the Lionhead include a high head mount, compact upright body type, short well-furred 2" [...] - 3" [...] ears, and weigh usually between 2 1/2 pounds but no more than 3 3/4 pounds.|$|R

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for professional footballers (soccer) and road cyclists to remove leg hair {{for a number of}} reasons. In the case of a crash or tackle, the absence of the leg hair means the injuries (usually road rash or scarring) can be cleaned up more efficiently, and treatment is not impeded. Professional cyclists as well as professional footballers also <b>receive</b> regular <b>leg</b> massages, and the absence of hair reduces the friction and increases their comfort and effectiveness.|$|R
