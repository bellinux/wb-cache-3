25|$|According to Mazzarella's 1818 {{biography}} of Lalli, {{on his return}} to Venice he recited some of his poetry to Zeno and asked for his opinion.

At this point, Lalli revealed his true identity to Zeno and confessed to the reason he had left Naples. Zeno took him under his wing and introduced him to the Grimani family who hired Lalli to assist in the management of their theatres (Teatro San Samuele and Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo) and to <b>re-work</b> older libretti for new productions.|$|E
25|$|As {{the flight}} test program proceeded, Boeing {{encountered}} {{problems in the}} 747-400's production process, leading it to disclose delivery delays of up to one month for the first 20 aircraft built. A primary reason for the delays was the unprecedented complexity of interior configurations offered to airlines, which ranged from lavatory and galley locations to the color shades of cabin warning labels. Coupled with new, relatively inexperienced workers, a lack of veteran technicians, interior configurations needing costly <b>re-work,</b> and teething problems with electronics integration on the advanced flight deck, 747-400 production fell behind schedule. The company managed to resolve early production issues by mid-1989, with all three 747-400 engine variants delivered within four months of each other, and overall delays not exceeding several weeks.|$|E

I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and <b>re-work</b> them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E

500|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the special}} effects, the costuming, the set re-constructions and the {{residual}} payments to The Original Series cast, Behr later described [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations" [...] as [...] "probably the most expensive hour of episodic TV ever produced". The only member of The Original Series cast who was spoken to directly by the producers was Leonard Nimoy, who was enthusiastic about the idea and was surprised that it had taken them so long to come up with it. The remaining cast members were each contacted through Paramount's legal department. Dennis McCarthy wanted to <b>re-work</b> the Jerry Fielding score previously used on [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles". He said that he intended to use the production equipment and orchestra available to bring the score up to the same scale previously seen on Deep Space Nine. However, the producers wanted a new score and so McCarthy explained that he composed it in a Fielding-inspired mindset. The only piece that was directly re-recorded by McCarthy was the Alexander Courage [...] "Theme from Star Trek", which involved a 45 piece orchestra.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Walter Skinner had {{evolved over the}} course of The X-Files sixth season. At the start of season six, however, the producers and writers felt that Skinner's character was becoming [...] "expendable". With their transfer away from the X-Files division, Mulder and Scully saw less and less of their former boss. Originally, John Shiban, the writer of the episode, wanted to infect Mulder with nanobots. However, he decided that since the audience knew Mulder would not be killed, this plot would not be very effective. In order to compensate for this loss, Shiban decided to <b>re-work</b> Skinner back into the series mythology by putting him in Mulder's place. Shiban, inspired by the 1950 noir film D.O.A. and its 1988 remake which he jokingly called [...] " [...] pretty bad movies", decided to craft an episode of The X-Files around the conceit of [...] "a guy who's been poisoned [...] has only a short time to live and has to use that time to find out why and by whom he's being murdered".|$|E
500|$|In June 2007, Kelly Rowland {{embarked}} on the Ms. Kelly Tour to promote her second solo album Ms. Kelly. The five date tour visited Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. Ms. Kelly {{was released on}} July 3, 2007 in the United States. Originally entitled My Story, the album's first version was actually scheduled for a June 2006 release, but Rowland, her management and Columbia Records decided to shelve the album {{at the last minute}} to <b>re-work</b> a version with a different vibe as the singer considered the final track listing [...] "too full of midtempos and ballads." [...] Rowland eventually consulted additional producers to collaborate on the album, including Billy Mann, Mysto & Pizzi, Sean Garrett, Scott Storch, and Polow da Don. Upon its release, Ms. Kelly debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and at number two on the R/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first-week sales of 86,000 copies. Outside the US, the album widely failed to reprise the success of Simply Deep, barely reaching the top-forty on the majority of all charts it appeared on, except for the UK, where it opened at number 37.|$|E

500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you stop and think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to <b>re-work</b> his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E
500|$|As the {{sessions}} progressed, U2 attempted {{to record a}} suitable take of the song [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", which began as a demo that the Edge had composed individually. However, the group struggled with the chord and time signature shifts, forcing significant [...] "screwdriver work" [...] to fix a recorded version of the song. Eno estimated approximately 40% of the time spent on The Joshua Tree was dedicated to that song alone. During takes, Lanois used a pointer and a chalkboard to help walk the band through the song's changes. In an attempt to force the group to start anew, Eno intended to [...] "stage an accident" [...] whereby the song's tapes would be erased. According to Flood, engineer Pat McCarthy had to restrain Eno to prevent this from happening. Ultimately, the erasure never occurred. Another aspect of the album that required <b>re-work</b> was Bono's lyrics. The vocalist had another set of lyrics {{for most of the}} record, but the other group members were dissatisfied with them, forcing rewrites. Lanois said the production team extensively screened Bono's lyrics and offered suggestions, as many lines did not sound as good when sang against a backing track as they did when written down. Bono's revised lyrics were described as [...] "absolutely stunning" [...] by Meegan, who believed that the insecurity the singer felt from having his work critiqued further motivated him.|$|E
