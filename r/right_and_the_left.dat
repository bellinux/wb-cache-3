25|$|Schleiermacher {{continued}} with his translation of Plato and prepared {{a new and}} greatly altered edition of his Christlicher Glaube, anticipating the latter in two letters to his friend Gottfried Lücke (in the Studien und Kritiken, 1829), in which he defended his theological position generally and his book in particular against opponents on the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blunt's {{first year}} in office was difficult, and he was criticized by both the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> In February 2006, a poll {{conducted}} by SurveyUSA showed him with a 33% job approval rating, the fifth lowest of any governor in the nation. His approval among Republicans polled was 62%, but his rating among Democrats was only 12%. This {{was one of the greatest}} partisan divides of any governor.|$|E
25|$|The two-tiered Holy Ark on {{the eastern}} wall was a splendid structure, {{intricately}} carved with gilded woodcarvings, representing plants, animals and Jewish symbols, with a double-headed eagle on top. It was approached by a twofold flight of steps, with iron balustrades, ascending from the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> Hanging from the walls and ceilings there were numerous bronze and silver chandeliers. The synagogue contained a valuable collection of ritual objects. The building was repaired in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1929 crash, 450,000 {{people were}} unemployed. In {{the same year}} Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party won its first seats in the city parliament. Nazi Propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels became Gauleiter (party {{district}} leader) of Berlin in 1926. On July 20, 1932, the Prussian government under Otto Braun in Berlin was dismissed by presidential decree. The republic was nearing its breakdown, under attack by extreme forces from the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> On January 30, 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{fracture}} of mandible involved the midline and the adjacent {{part of the}} left mandible. Her right and left first incisors and the left canine tooth were affected by this fracture. The sockets of the right second incisor, the left first molar, and the left second molar are empty, with these teeth missing. The first and second left upper molars are partially fractured. Both the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> upper third molars are nonerupted. Conversely, the Lady's upper right canine, premolars, first molar, and second molar are still present. This group of teeth has no visible attrition, and no occlusal irregularity of their surface.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} protests {{followed}} the coup, and initially the military's response was mild. However, on 7 July 1962, a peaceful student protest on Rangoon University campus was suppressed by the military, killing over 100 students. The next day, the army {{blew up the}} Students Union building. Peace talks were convened between the RC and various armed insurgent groups in 1963, but without any breakthrough, and during the talks {{as well as in}} the aftermath of their failure, hundreds were arrested in Rangoon and elsewhere from both the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the political spectrum. All opposition parties were banned on 28 March 1964. The Kachin insurgency by the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) had begun earlier in 1961 triggered by U Nu's declaration of Buddhism as the state religion, and the Shan State Army (SSA), led by Sao Shwe Thaik's wife Mahadevi and son Chao Tzang Yaunghwe, launched a rebellion in 1964 as a direct consequence of the 1962 military coup.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} day, Bhishma {{arranged}} the Kaurava {{forces in the}} formation of an eagle with himself leading from the front, while Duryodhana's forces protected the rear. Bhishma wanted to be sure of avoiding any mishap. The Pandavas countered this by using the crescent formation with Bhima and Arjuna {{at the head of the}} <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> horns, respectively. The Kauravas concentrated their attack on Arjuna's position. Arjuna's chariot was soon covered with arrows and javelins. Arjuna, with amazing skill, built a fortification around his chariot with an unending stream of arrows from his bow. Abhimanyu and Satyaki combined to defeat the Gandhara forces of Shakuni. Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked Duryodhana in the rear. Bhima's arrows hit Duryodhana, who swooned in his chariot. His charioteer immediately drove them out of danger. Duryodhana's forces, however, saw their leader fleeing the battlefield and soon scattered. Bhishma soon restored order and Duryodhana returned to lead the army. He was angry at Bhishma, however, at what he saw as leniency towards the five Pandava brothers and spoke harshly at his commander. Bhishma, stung by this unfair charge, fell on the Pandava army with renewed vigor. It was as if there were more than one Bhishma on the field.|$|E

2500|$|Early Marxist {{movements}} were {{at odds with}} the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the European continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the Communist Manifesto, which began [...] " [...] spectre [...] is haunting Europe", stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the Russian Empire, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to World War I. Many monarchists (except constitutional monarchists) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the <b>Right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Left.</b>|$|E

This also coincided with a culmination of growing personal disillusionment with the Labour movement. [...] In 2009, Hitchens wrote of this period, [...] "Against the Labour Party, which I knew to be penetrated by all manner of Marxists, and soaked in the ideas of the revolutionaries, it was increasingly necessary to support the Tories. This was partly because of the strikers' lies, but much more because of Poland and Czechoslovakia. On the Cold War, I knew she (Thatcher) was <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Left</b> were wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|On [...] October, II Corps {{attacked}} on {{both sides}} of La Bassée Canal and German counter-attacks were made each night.

Givenchy was recaptured by the British on 16 October, Violaines was taken and a foothold established on Aubers Ridge on 17 October; French cavalry captured Fromelles. On 18 October, German resistance increased as the German XIII Corps arrived, reinforced the VII Corps and gradually forced the II Corps to a halt. On 19 October, British infantry and French cavalry captured Le Pilly (Herlies) but were forced to retire by German artillery-fire.|$|E

[...] Comey conceded, [...] "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July." [...] While the e-mail matter is resolved, legal questions on Comey's actions remain. [...] Comey and the FBI have been broadly criticized on the editorial pages from both the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> with headlines reading: [...] "James Comey should be fired" [...] (Chicago Tribune); [...] "FBI chief James Comey should resign" [...] (The Washington Times); [...] and [...] "FBI Director James Comey is Unfit for Public Service" [...] (Newsweek).

2500|$|Nour's Viața Basarabiei {{represented}} the legalist {{side of the}} Bessarabian emancipation movement, to the irritation of more radical Romanian nationalists. Cazacu recalls: [...] "Although moderate, the atmosphere was so stuffed, the hardships so great, the attacks of the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> so relentless, that in a short while [...] also succumbed, not without having had its useful effect in the awakening of national sentiment, even among the Moldavians {{in various parts of}} Russia, in the Caucasus, and in Siberia." [...] A nationalist historian, Nicolae Iorga, accused Nour of promoting [...] "class fraternity" [...] between the Russians and the Romanians in Bessarabia, citing Nour's explicit rejection of the Russian Revolution. Nour enlisted other negative comments from Iorga when he began writing Bessarabian notices in the Romanian daily Adevărul, which had Jewish proprietors. Iorga, an antisemite, commented: [...] "Mr. Alexe Nour of Chișinău assures us now that his new gazette [...] will not be a philosemitic one". According to Iorga, Nour was given reason to [...] "feel sorry" [...] about the Adevărul collaboration.|$|E
2500|$|Out of office, Bevan soon {{exacerbated}} the split within the Labour Party between the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> For {{the next five}} years, Bevan {{was the leader of}} the left wing of the Labour Party, who became known as Bevanites. They criticised high defence expenditure (especially for nuclear weapons), called for better relations with the Soviet Union, and opposed the party leader, Attlee, on most issues. [...] According to Richard Crossman Bevan hated [...] "the in-fighting which you have to do in politics.... He wasn't cut out to be a leader, he was cut out to be a prophet." [...] In 1954, Gaitskell defeated Bevan in a hard fought contest to be the Treasurer of the Labour Party. In March 1955, when Britain was preparing for tests of its first hydrogen bomb, Bevan led a revolt of 57 Labour MPs and abstained on a key vote. The Parliamentary Labour Party voted 141 to 113 to withdraw the whip from him, but it was restored within a month due to his popularity.|$|E
