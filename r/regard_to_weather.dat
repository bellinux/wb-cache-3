50|$|The factors {{underlying}} {{brown-tail moth}} population dynamics are little understood {{and have been}} only thoroughly investigated by few researchers. They found that parasitoids, microsporidial disease and intraspecific competition {{were the most important}} mortality agents. In North America, the incidence of parasitism is the most important factor dictating the persistence of the exotic populations exclusively in coastal habitats. Knowledge concerning the role of plant factors is limited to larval performance and development on different host plants. With <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> factors, it is known that diapausing larvae are cold tolerant but susceptible to freezing by extreme cold. In North America, besides parasitism, cold temperatures may prevent the browntail moth from extending its invasive range from coastal to inland habitats. Intraspecific competition may also be implicated in brown-tail moth mortality, since in several populations survival was higher at low densities. During outbreaks browntail moth females show an increased fecundity.|$|E

5000|$|The Irish color word glas for {{the third}} way of martyrdom can be {{translated}} as either [...] "blue" [...] or [...] "green."

40|$|Barium and lithium vapors were {{released}} from sounding rockets in the thermosphere and observed from aboard a jet aircraft {{at an altitude}} of 40, 000 ft. The purpose of the releases was to demonstrate the feasibility of an all-weather technique for observing chemical releases and to evaluate methods of observing daytime releases. The selected flight plan of the aircraft allowed a series of observations of the trail from two different straight line paths. Data were recorded photographically. The reduction in sky brightness at the 40, 000 -ft altitude as compared to the ground allows the use of a filter with a 10 -A bandwidth for trail photography in the daytime. These photographs verified the calculation of the usable angular field of the narrow-band filters. Photographs of a 45 -min-old trail of lithium vapor were obtained up to 20 min after sunrise at the aircraft. It is concluded that now vapor trail observations may be made during the daytime without <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and logistic restrictions...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how social-ecological {{systems are}} {{and can be}} {{resilient}} to climate change {{is one of the}} world's most crucial problems today. It requires knowledge at local and global scales, the integration of natural and social sciences, and a focus on biocultural diversity. Small Pacific Islands and the knowledge-practice-belief systems of their peoples {{have a long history of}} resilience to environmental variability and unpredictability, including in areas with marginal habitats and with periodic, severe disturbance (e. g., drought, flood, storms, and tsunami). We review the state of research on these knowledge systems as it pertains to resilience and adaptation, and we highlight critical research needs to address the interrelated areas of: (1) local-scale expertise and observations of change with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather,</b> life-history cycles, and ecological processes; (2) customary resource management institutions and practices (i. e., with agroforests and the nearshore marine environment); and (3) the roles of leaders, social institutions, and social networks in the context of disturbance and change. We conclude that these knowledge systems can contribute high-resolution observations, benchmark data, and insights into practices that enhance resilience and adaptive capacity in integrated terrestrial and marine systems. Community-based and participatory approaches can complement and ground-truth climate models and direct culturally appropriate resource management, research, and adaptation measures. Although most islands in the Pacific are small, their knowledge systems include valuable insights on seasonal cycles, ecological processes, and the management of biocultural diversity that are relevant at a broad scale for understanding resilience and adaptability to the social-ecological effects of climate change...|$|E

The material consists of 40 % (by weight) fibres and 60 % matrix. Other additives, such as ultraviolet (UV) stabiliser and maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (MaPE) as a coupling agent {{were added to the}} composite material. The biocomposite was subjected to 1000 hours (h) of accelerated weathering tests, which consisted of heat, moisture and UV light, intended to imitate the outdoor environment. The tensile properties of the K-HDPE composite were recorded after 0, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 h of exposure to the accelerated weathering. Compared with neat {{high-density polyethylene}} (HDPE), the K-HDPE composite has 22. 7 % lower tensile strength when produced but displays a less rapid rate of strength deterioration under weathering (After 1000 h of exposure the tensile strength of K-HDPE drops 29. 4 %, whereas, for neat HDPE, it falls rapidly by 36 %). Due to better stiffness, the Young’s modulus of the K-HDPE composite is much higher than that of neat HDPE. The fibres {{on the surface of the}} K-HDPE composite gradually start to whiten after 200 h of exposure and become completely white after 600 h of exposure. For neat HDPE, micro-cracking on the surface can be observed after 200 h of exposure and the stress-strain curve obtained from the tensile test indicates its increase in brittleness proportional to the amount of weathering time...|$|E
40|$|Typically {{only the}} copolar {{channels}} of weather radar data {{is used for}} extracting various parameters or observables. ZDR, kDP and PhiDP for example are prominent extracts from Zxx and Zyy and have {{quite a lot of}} applications in the field of precipitation measurements. Nevertheless, the use of the full polarimetric coherent scattering matrix to extract physical properties according to the scattering process has only poorly been addressed, particularly due to high costs in establishing such complicated systems being able to coherently measure co- and crosspolar scattering amplitudes and phases. However, DLRs "POLDIRAD" is such a fully polarimetric weather radar operating in C-band, able to acquire time series (raw) data, containing all the information needed to apply polarimetric decomposition techniques in order to extract physical information about the illuminated scatterers from the observed scattering process. This paper presents a study about the possibilities of applying coherent polarimetric techniques to time series (raw) data, and the aim is to evaluate an understanding of the potential of such techniques with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> radar data. It will concentrate on the Entropy-Alpha decomposition, based on Pauli-matrices, because the physical interpretation is pretty much straight forward and easy to understand and therefore a good point to start from. This decomposition has originally been developed for application to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, and hence all the advances in this technique concentrate on targets on the earth's surface rather than meteorological targets as raindrops, snow or hail. The first step is to prepare the data, i. e. changes in phase due to propagation through the medium have to be corrected as well as phase shifts due to Doppler effects. The second step involves calculating the Covariance (or Coherence) matrix from the scattering matrix time series per range bin. Therefrom this matrix contains the statistical fluctuations of targets over time. By diagonalysing the hermitian Covariance matrix in the third step it is possible to extract the dominant physical scattering mechanisms. The observables Entropy and Alpha-angle are quite simple measures, which help to interpret the results. The forth step consists of choosing areas in the Entropy-Alpha plane in order to classify the data. Refinement of this classification using the first Eigenvalue (intensity) might be necessary and thus investigated as well. The results will show that it is clearly possible to distinguish between different types of scattering, and moreover that there is sufficient variation in scattering types to be able to apply a reasonable classification. It is not only possible to differentiate meteorological targets, but also to detect ground clutter or areas with high noise levels, which simplifies the process of pre-classifying weather radar data. Furthermore the results will be compared to "traditional" classification methods in order to analyse, if this new method provides additional, complementary or maybe even completely new information or relations...|$|E

30|$|The {{influence}} of tapping and weathering on sapwood and heartwood {{is shown in}} the Scores plots of the PCAs (Fig.  1 a, b). The overlapping groups indicate that sapwood is not affected by tapping, whereas weathering causes chemical changes (Fig.  1 a). They are explained with spectral characteristics in Fig.  2. Interpretation of PC can be done by the loadings (plots not shown). For sapwood the main bands relevant for the segregation are related to lignin (1510, 1260 and 1217  cm−[*] 1) and the broad region with superimposed bands around 1050  cm−[*] 1. It demonstrates the major impact of weathering and the minimal effect of tapping on sapwood (seen in the scores of Fig.  1 a). Heartwood and tapped heartwood are partly separated (Fig.  1 b). According to the loadings plot of the first principal component (not shown) the band at 1688  cm−[*] 1 is responsible for the grouping. Segregation due <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> takes place along the second principal component, where additionally also the lignin band of 1510  cm−[*] 1 is relevant. With <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> there is no difference between tapped and not tapped sapwood and heartwood, respectively. Tapped and not tapped samples overlap. Resinous parts before and after weathering are segregated as well by the third principal component (Fig.  1 c), where the typical resin bands at 1690 and 1276  cm−[*] 1 dominate the loadings.|$|R
