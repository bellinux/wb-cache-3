The scales beneath the hind wings reflect a green-white iridescence.

In this study we investigated the hypothesis that migration processes determine the observable spatio-temporal synchrony in population dynamics of larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> at the valley scale. We explored the effect of orography at a finer resolution on modelled potential dispersal ranges of larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> by incorporating a high resolution GIS based migration model with a coarse resolution population dynamics simulation model. Modelled migration paths were affected considerably by inclusion of orography compared to predecessor models that ignored orographical effects.

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of cyclic larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> population densities, for instance synchrony (valley scale) and travelling waves (Alpine arc scale), {{have been observed}} at different scales and maybe related to distinct causes. In this study, quantification of population data through cross-correlation analysis and spectral analysis revealed that larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> population cycles at the valley scale could {{be considered to be}} in close synchrony with one another. At the Alpine arc scale the presence of travelling waves could generally be confirmed. These results have implications for the understanding of the causal mechanisms behind the observed spatio-temporal patterns, suggesting that at the valley scale synchrony depends not only on distances between subpopulations, but is also affected by environmental/habitat characteristics that vary in space. At the Alpine scale, distance between populations is of greater importance in shaping spatio-temporal patterns than at the valley scale...|$|R

40|$|Ideally {{studies on}} the {{population}} dynamics of organisms should be holistic, general, precise, and realistic (64). Much too often, however, support for research on forest pests approximates {{the curve of the}} gradations in time and space, resulting in periodic gathering of bits and pieces of information that differ little from that gathered earlier or elsewhere (68). Therefore {{it is not surprising that}} lack of compre hensive, quantitative information on many generations of a field population has handicapped the progress of theoretical thinking on the dynamics of populations, which badly needs "more light and less heat " (86). It has been proposed that research efforts should be coordinated internationally on a few model insects in order to cope with complexity and diversity of population dynamics at a high level of efficiency (25). We consider that the larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth,</b> Zeiraphera diniana, would meet the criteria for being such a model insect (18). The coincidence of large-scale insect outbreaks, the availability of effective insecti cides, and economic expansion of industry and tourism after World War II pro moted several extensive control actions against such forest pests as the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, in eastern Canada and the larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth,</b> Z. diniana, in Switzerland. Public demand to protect the subalpine larch forests in the recreation area of the Engadine (Switzerland) against the recurring defoliation by the larch <b>bud</b> <b>moth</b> triggered the present research phase. This article is the first attempt to publish the results of the research period (1949 - 1975) comprehensively. In addition, information concerning previous outbreaks of Z. diniana is reviewed on a worldwide base...|$|R
