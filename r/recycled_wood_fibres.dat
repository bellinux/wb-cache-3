This research is also proposed to avoid environmental pollution from give harm to human and economic aspect. Hydrothermal carbonization is conducted by supercritical unit and pyrolysis conducted by furbnace with temperature, volume and time control. The required temperature for this research is 200 °C and proportional with time in 4 hours. Each experiment needs to change the volume of material to 1 50 g and 175 g.

The presence of inorganic pollutants and non-wooden material in <b>recycled</b> <b>wood</b> material was investigated.

40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>fibres</b> {{can be used}} as {{reinforcement}} in plastics for {{load carrying}} purposes. Some advantages compared with conventional man-made <b>fibres</b> are that <b>wood</b> <b>fibres</b> come from a renewable resource, have high specific stiffness and strength, are generally less hazardous to health, biodegradable, and can be manufactured at low cost and high volumes. A clear disadvantage with cellulose-based materials for structural use is their dimensional instability in humid environments. The hygroelastic properties are of high importance in materials development of improved wood-fibre composites. This work deals with the stiffness and hygroexpansion of <b>wood</b> <b>fibres</b> for composite materials. The long-term aim is to design engineered <b>wood</b> <b>fibre</b> composites based on better basic knowledge of <b>wood</b> <b>fibres.</b> Mechanistic models have been used to link the fibrous microstructure with macroscopic composite engineering properties. The properties have been characterized experimentally for various wood-fibre composites and their fibre-mat preforms, by means of curvature measurements at various levels of relative humidity, as well as tensile and compressive tests. From these test results and microstructural characterization, the longitudinal Young’s modulus and transverse coefficient of hygroexpansion of <b>wood</b> <b>fibres</b> were identified by inverse modelling. Some effects of various pulp processes and fibre modifications on the elastic properties of the fibre were observed, illustrating how the mixed experimental-modelling approaches can be used in more efficient materials screening and selection. An improved micromechanical analysis for wood-fibre composites has been presented. The model is more appropriate to combine with laminate analogy, to link fibre properties on the microscale to the macroscopic composite properties and vice versa. It also offers the possibility to include the effects of ultrastructure since it can account for an arbitrary number of phases. An approach to model ultrastructure-fibre property relations has been demonstrated. It includes analytical modelling of multilayered cylindrical fibres as well as finite element modelling of fibres with irregular geometry characterized with microscopy. Both approaches are useful and could be combined with experiments to reveal insights that can pave way for a firmer link between the <b>wood</b> <b>fibre</b> ultrastructure and <b>wood</b> <b>fibre</b> properties.

Additionally a beech wood refiner fibre-PP composite {{as well as a}} beech wood chip-PP composite are mixed with regenerated cellulosic fibres (5 wt. % and 10 wt. %) to further enhance the impact resistance. To increase the interfacial adhesion with the matrix and to improve the dispersion of particles two different coupling agents with contents from 2 wt. % to 8 wt. % are tested with two wood plastic composites (WPC). One is made of beech <b>wood</b> refiner <b>fibres</b> and the other one is produced from beech wood chips. The present study investigated Charpy impact property of <b>wood</b> <b>fibres</b> {{reinforced polypropylene}} as a function of fibre modification, content of regenerated cellulosic fibres and coupling agent.

Charpy impact resistance is improved by mixing regenerated cellulose fibres (RCF) and RCF-PP-granule with beech <b>wood</b> refiner <b>fibres</b> and chips. The maximum increase in impact resistance is two times for refiner fibres and 10 % RCF-PP-granule respectively three and a half times for chips and 10 % RCF-PP-granule.
