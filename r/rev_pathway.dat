In this study, we demonstrate that Eps 15 and Eps 15 R, two EH-containing proteins, synergize with Hrb and Hrbl to enhance the function of Rev in the export pathway.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that interaction of eukaryotic initiation factor 5 A (eIF- 5 A) with the Rev trans-activator protein of HIV- 1 mediates the transport of unspliced or incompletely spliced viral mRNAs across the nuclear envelope. Consequently, mutants of eIF- 5 A block Rev function and thereby replication of HIV- 1 in trans, indicating that eIF- 5 A is a crucial protein that connects the viral Rev regulator with cellular RNA transport systems. Here we show that the ribosomal protein L 5, which is the central protein component of the 5 S rRNA export system, is a cellular interaction partner of eIF- 5 A. Functional studies demonstrate that overexpression of L 5 protein significantly enhances Rev activity. Furthermore, Rev nuclear export activity is inhibited in human somatic cells by antibodies that recognize eIF- 5 A or L 5. Our {{data suggest that the}} <b>Rev</b> export <b>pathway</b> shares components of a cellular transport system involved in the intracellular trafficking of polymerase III (5 S rRNA) transcripts...|$|R

40|$|The Rev protein of HIV- 1 {{actively}} shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm and mediates {{the export}} of unspliced retroviral RNAs. The localization of shuttling proteins such as Rev {{is controlled by the}} relative rates of nuclear import and export. To study nuclear export in isolation, we generated cell lines expressing a green fluorescent protein-labeled chimeric protein consisting of HIV- 1 Rev and a hormone-inducible nuclear localization sequence. Steroid removal switches off import thus allowing direct visualization of the <b>Rev</b> export <b>pathway</b> in living cells. After digitonin permeabilization of these cells, we found that a functional nuclear export sequence (NES), ATP, and fractionated cytosol were sufficient for nuclear export in vitro. Nuclear pore-specific lectins and leptomycin B were potent export inhibitors. Nuclear export was not inhibited by antagonists of calcium metabolism that block nuclear import. These data further suggest that nuclear pores do not functionally close when luminal calcium stores are depleted. The distinct requirements for nuclear import and export argue that these competing processes may be regulated independently. This system should have wide applicability for the analysis of nuclear import and export...|$|R
40|$|The RAD 6 postreplication {{repair and}} {{mutagenesis}} pathway {{is the only}} major radiation repair pathway yet to be extensively characterized. It has been previously speculated that the RAD 6 pathway consists of two parallel subpathways, one error free and another error prone (mutagenic). Here we show that the RAD 6 group genes can be exclusively divided into three rather than two independent subpathways represented by the RAD 5, POL 30, and REV 3 genes; the <b>REV</b> 3 <b>pathway</b> is largely mutagenic, whereas the RAD 5 and the POL 30 pathways are deemed error free. Mutants carrying characteristic mutations {{in each of the}} three subpathways are phenotypically indistinguishable from a single mutant such as rad 18, which is defective in the entire RAD 6 postreplication repair/tolerance pathway. Furthermore, the rad 18 mutation is epistatic to all single or combined mutations in any of the above three subpathways. Our data also suggest that MMS 2 and UBC 13 play a key role in coordinating the response of the error-free subpathways; Mms 2 and Ubc 13 form a complex required for a novel polyubiquitin chain assembly, which probably serves as a signal transducer to promote both RAD 5 and POL 30 error-free postreplication repair pathways. The model established by this study will facilitate further research into the molecular mechanisms of postreplication repair and translesion DNA synthesis. In view of the high degree of sequence conservation of the RAD 6 pathway genes among all eukaryotes, the model presented in this study may also apply to mammalian cells and predicts links to human diseases...|$|R
50|$|The late {{phase of}} the viral life cycle is {{characterized}} by the expression of viral proteins that are encoded on the long, unspliced (9kb) or partially spliced (4 kb) messages containing the RRE. Because of their retention and splicing signals, these intron-containing RNAs are initially retained in the nucleus for splicing/degradation. However, after a sufficient level of Rev has been produced by the 2 kb messages, these longer messages can be exported to the cytoplasm via a <b>Rev</b> dependent export <b>pathway.</b> Nuclear export of these RNAs is achieved by a specific, co-operative assembly of multiple Rev molecules on the RRE. Assembly of this Rev-RRE complex is followed by the recruitment of a human protein complex containing the proteins exportin-1 (XPO1/CRM1) and Ran-GTP. Rev recruits this export machinery via a nuclear export sequence (NES) present in Rev. This Rev-RRE-Xpo1/RanGTP complex is then transported to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, these messages are translated to produce all the remaining viral proteins or packaged as genomes for newly budding virions (see Figure).|$|R
40|$|The cis- and {{trans-acting}} {{components of}} the <b>Rev</b> regulatory <b>pathway</b> employed by equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) to regulate and coordinate viral gene expression were examined in complementation experiments. Viral protein expression and mRNA expression were compared in cells transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant proviruses in combination with Rev expression plasmids. Mutation of the predicted rev gene abolished Gag protein synthesis, and this defect was complemented, in trans, by Rev. Analysis of viral mRNAs from transfected cells confirmed that EIAV expresses five major mRNAs: the full-length and singly spliced mRNAs contain introns and encode viral structural proteins while the three fully spliced mRNAs, encoding nonstructural genes, are generated by alternative splicing. Compared to cells transfected with the wild-type provirus, the intron-containing mRNAs produced from the rev-minus mutant were present at reduced levels in the nuclear RNA fraction and were not detected in the cytoplasm. This pattern of viral mRNA synthesis was restored to the wild-type pattern by providing Rev in trans. In contrast to the intron-containing mRNAs, cytoplasmic accumulation of the multiply spliced class of mRNAs was independent of Rev. Closer examination of the multiply spliced class of viral mRNAs by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed a Rev-dependent alternative splicing phenomenon. In the absence of Rev, proviruses expressed a four-exon mRNA at high levels; the addition of Rev caused both {{a decrease in the}} levels of the four-exon mRNA and the appearance of a related mRNA lacking exon 3. The cis-acting RNA elements that mediate Rev responsiveness were studied with deleted proviruses, which revealed that EIAV contains at least two elements located near the ends of envelope gene. Unlike the Rev-responsive elements in other retroviruses, the cis-acting regions of EIAV do not appear to form complex secondary structures...|$|R
40|$|DNA interstrand {{crosslinks}} (ICLs) {{formed by}} antitumor agents, such as cisplatin or mitomycin C, are highly cytotoxic DNA lesions. Their repair {{is believed to}} be triggered primarily by the stalling of replication forks at ICLs in S-phase. There is, however, increasing evidence that ICL repair can also occur independently of replication. Using a reporter assay, we describe a pathway for the repair of cisplatin ICLs that depends on transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair protein CSB, the general nucleotide excision repair factors XPA, XPF and XPG, but not the global genome nucleotide excision repair factor XPC. In this <b>pathway,</b> <b>Rev</b> 1 and Pol zeta are involved in the error-free bypass of cisplatin ICLs. The requirement for CSB, Rev 1 or Pol zeta is specific for the repair of ICLs, as the repair of cisplatin intrastrand crosslinks does not require these genes under identical conditions. We directly show that this pathway contributes to the removal of ICLs outside of S-phase. Finally, our studies reveal that defects in replication- and transcription-dependent pathways are additive in terms of cellular sensitivity to treatment with cisplatin or mitomycin C. We conclude that transcription- and replication-dependent pathways contribute to cellular survival following treatment with crosslinking agentsope...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Rev</b> 1 -Polζ <b>pathway</b> is {{believed}} to be the major mechanism of translesion DNA synthesis and base damage-induced mutagenesis in eukaryotes. While it is widely believed that Rev 1 plays a non-catalytic function in translesion synthesis, the role of its dCMP transferase activity remains uncertain. To determine the relevance of its catalytic function in translesion synthesis, we separated the Rev 1 dCMP transferase activity from its non-catalytic function in yeast. This was achieved by mutating two conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic domain of Rev 1, i. e. D 467 A/E 468 A, where its catalytic function was abolished but its non-catalytic function remained intact. In this mutant strain, whereas translesion synthesis and mutagenesis of UV radiation were fully functional, those of a site-specific 1,N 6 -ethenoadenine were severely deficient. Specifically, the predominant A→G mutations resulting from C insertion opposite the lesion were abolished. Therefore, translesion synthesis and mutagenesis of 1,N 6 -ethenoadenine require the catalytic function of the Rev 1 dCMP transferase, in contrast to those of UV lesions, which only require the non-catalytic function of Rev 1. These results show that the catalytic function of the Rev 1 dCMP transferase is required in a lesion-specific manner for translesion synthesis and base damage-induced mutagenesis...|$|R
40|$|The hdm 2 gene is overexpressed in {{a variety}} of human tumors. Its gene product localizes {{predominantly}} to the nucleus, where it acts as an inhibitor of the p 53 tumor suppressor gene product. It is shown here that the hdm 2 oncoprotein constantly shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Shuttling of hdm 2 does not depend on its interaction with p 53. Nuclear export of hdm 2 is mediated by a signal sequence similar to the nuclear export signal of the rev protein from human immunodeficiency virus and other lentiviruses. Mutation of this signal sequence abolishes detectable nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. When fused to a carrier protein, the hdm 2 signal sequence can mediate nuclear export after intranuclear microinjection into HeLa cells. The export of hdm 2 can be blocked by a competitive inhibitor of rev export, arguing that the export pathways for hdm 2 and rev are either overlapping or identical. Inhibition of its export modifies the ability of hdm 2 to block p 53 -mediated transcriptional activation, and hdm 2 's export function is required to accelerate the degradation of p 53. Thus the <b>rev</b> nuclear export <b>pathway</b> may be used to regulate an oncogene product's activity and modulate cellular growth...|$|R
40|$|Background: The HIV- 1 {{regulatory}} protein Rev, which {{is essential for}} viral replication, mediates the nuclear export of unspliced viral transcripts.

40|$|DNA damage {{tolerance}} (DDT) pathways, including translesion synthesis (TLS) and additional unknown mechanisms, enable recovery from replication arrest at DNA lesions. DDT pathways are regulated by post-translational modifications of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at its K 164 residue. In particular, mono-ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase RAD 18 {{is crucial for}} Polη-mediated TLS. Although the importance of modifications of PCNA to DDT pathways is well known, the relevance of its homo-trimer form, in which three K 164 residues are present in a single ring, remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that multiple units of a PCNA homo-trimer are simultaneously mono-ubiquitinated in vitro and in vivo. RAD 18 catalyzed sequential mono-ubiquitinations of multiple units of a PCNA homo-trimer in a reconstituted system. Exogenous PCNA formed hetero-trimers with endogenous PCNA in WI 38 VA 13 cell transformants. When K 164 R-mutated PCNA was expressed in these cells at levels that depleted endogenous PCNA homo-trimers, multiple modifications of PCNA complexes were reduced and the cells showed defects in DDT after UV irradiation. Notably, ectopic expression of mutant PCNA increased the UV sensitivities of Polη-proficient, Polη-deficient, and REV 1 -depleted cells, suggesting the disruption of a DDT pathway distinct from the Polη- and <b>REV</b> 1 -mediated <b>pathways.</b> These results suggest that simultaneous modifications of multiple units of a PCNA homo-trimer are required for a certain DDT pathway in human cells...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication requires efficient nuclear export of incompletely spliced and unspliced HIV- 1 mRNA transcripts, which {{is achieved by}} Rev expression at an early stage of the viral life cycle. We have recently shown that expression of Sam 68, the 68 -kDa Src-associated protein in mitosis, is able to alleviate Rev function block in astrocytes by promoting Rev nuclear export. In the present study, we utilized an antisense RNA expression strategy to down-modulate constitutive Sam 68 expression and examined its effect on Rev function, HIV- 1 gene expression, and viral replication. These results showed that down-modulation of constitutive Sam 68 expression markedly inhibited HIV- 1 production in 293 T cells and viral replication in T lymphocytes such as Jurkat and CEM cells, as well as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Rev-dependent in trans complementation and reporter gene assays further demonstrated that inhibition of HIV- 1 gene expression by Sam 68 down-modulation was due to impeded Rev activity. Moreover, digital fluorescence microscopic imaging revealed that down-modulation of Sam 68 expression caused exclusive nuclear retention and colocalization of both Rev and CRM 1. Taken together, these data suggest that adequate Sam 68 expression is required for Rev function and, thereby, for HIV- 1 gene expression and viral replication, and they support the notion that Sam 68 is directly involved in the CRM 1 -mediated <b>Rev</b> nuclear export <b>pathway...</b>|$|R

40|$|When a replicative DNA {{polymerase}} stalls upon encountering a photoproduct on {{the template}} strand, it is relieved by other low-processivity polymerase(s), which insert nucleotide(s) opposite the lesion. Using an alkaline sucrose density gradient sedimentation technique, we previously classified this process termed UV-induced translesion replication (UV-TLS) into two types. In human cancer cells or xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) cells, UV-TLS was inhibited by caffeine or proteasome inhibitors. However, in normal human cells, {{the process was}} insensitive to these reagents. Reportedly, in yeast or mammalian cells, REV 3 protein (a catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase ζ) is predominantly involved in the former type of TLS. Here, we studied UV-TLS in fibroblasts derived from the Rev 3 -knockout mouse embryo (Rev 3 KO-MEF). In the wild-type MEF, UV-TLS was slow (similar to that of human cancer cells or XP-V cells), and was abolished by caffeine or MG- 262. In 2 cell lines of Rev 3 KO-MEF (Rev 3 −/− p 53 −/−), UV-TLS was not observed. In p 53 KO-MEF, which is a strict control for Rev 3 KO-MEF, the UV-TLS response {{was similar to that}} of the wild-type. Introduction of the Rev 3 expression plasmid into Rev 3 KO-MEF restored the UV-TLS response in selected stable transformants. In some transformants, viability to UV was the same as that in the wild-type, and the death rate was increased by caffeine. Our findings indicate that REV 3 is predominantly involved in UV-TLS in mouse cells, and that the <b>REV</b> 3 translesion <b>pathway</b> is suppressed by caffeine or proteasome inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHIV- 1 {{sequences}} {{are highly}} diverse {{due to the}} inaccuracy of the viral reverse transcriptase. This diversity has been studied and used to categorize HIV isolates into subtypes or clades, which are geographically distinct. To develop effective vaccines against HIV- 1, immunogens representing different subtypes may be important for induction of cross-protective immunity, but little data exist describing and comparing the immunogenicity induced by different subtype-based vaccines. This issue is further complicated by poor expression of HIV structural antigens due to rev dependence. One costly approach is to codon optimize each subtype construct to be examined. Interestingly, cis-acting transcriptional elements (CTE) can also by pass rev restriction by a <b>rev</b> independent export <b>pathway.</b> We reasoned that rev+CTE constructs might have advantages for such expression studies. A subtype A envelope sequence from a viral isolate from east Africa was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector {{under the control of}} the CMV-IE promoter. The utility of inclusion of the Mason–Pfizer monkey virus (MPV) -CTE with/without rev for driving envelope expression and immunogenicity was examined. Expression of envelope (gp 120) was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and by pseudotype virus infectivity assays. The presence of rev and the CTE together increased envelope expression and viral infection. Furthermore the CTE+rev construct was significantly more immunogenic then CTE alone vector. Isotype analysis and cytokine profiles showed strong Th 1 response in plasmid-immunized mice, which also demonstrated the superior nature of the rev+CTE construct. These responses were of similar or greater magnitude to a codon-optimized construct. The resulting cellular immune responses were highly cross-reactive with a HIV- 1 envelope subtype B antigen.
