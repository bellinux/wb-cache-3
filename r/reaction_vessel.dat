25|$|Another way to {{increase}} the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it {{is removed from the}} equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel.</b> The hot gases are cooled enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> to undergo further reaction.|$|E
25|$|In these {{reactions}} {{which both}} {{occurred in the}} same <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel,</b> the solubility of the silver chloride would be increased {{as a result of}} the formation of the complex ion. The complex ion formation is favorable takes away a significant portion of the silver ions in solution, as a result the equilibrium for the formation of silver ions from silver chloride will shift to the right to make up for the deficit.|$|E
25|$|The ideal {{conditions}} for imine hydrogenation {{depend on the}} nature of the substrate and catalyst system. Generally, higher pressures of hydrogen gas are needed in order to achieve reasonable reaction times; however, hydrogen pressure does not appreciably affect enantioselectivity. If the active catalyst is generated in situ, Schlenck techniques or a glove box should be employed. Parr shakers may be used for reaction pressures up to 4 bar, although precise temperature control is difficult to achieve in the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel.</b> For higher hydrogen pressures, specialized autoclave equipment is required.|$|E
50|$|Usually, the FDM {{process is}} used to print hollow <b>reaction</b> <b>vessels</b> or microreactors. If the 3D print is {{performed}} within an inert gas atmosphere, the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessels</b> can be filled with highly reactive substances during the print. The 3D printed objects are air- and watertight for several weeks. By the print of <b>reaction</b> <b>vessels</b> in the geometry of common cuvettes or measurement tubes, routine analytical measurements such as UV/VIS-, IR- and NMR-spectroscopy can be performed directly in the 3D printed vessel.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} {{and still a}} commonly practised form of hydrogenation in teaching laboratories, this process is usually effected by adding solid catalyst to a round bottom flask of dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using nitrogen or argon gas and sealing the mixture with a penetrable rubber seal. Hydrogen gas is then supplied from a H2-filled balloon. The resulting three phase mixture is agitated to promote mixing. Hydrogen uptake can be monitored, which can be useful for monitoring progress of a hydrogenation. This is achieved by either using a graduated tube containing a coloured liquid, usually aqueous copper sulfate or with gauges for each <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 80% of {{production}} involves suspension polymerization. Emulsion polymerization {{accounts for about}} 12%, and bulk polymerization accounts for 8%. Suspension polymerization affords particles with average diameters of 100–180μm, whereas emulsion polymerization gives much smaller particles of average size around 0.2μm. VCM and water are introduced into the reactor along with a polymerization initiator and other additives. The contents of the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> are pressurized and continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is exothermic and thus requires cooling. As the volume is reduced during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.|$|E
25|$|Under typical circumstances, hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and {{acidogenesis}} {{occur within}} the first <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel.</b> The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature (either mesophilic or thermophilic) prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to {{the rate at which}} feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste. In this instance, there may be a pasteurisation or sterilisation stage prior to digestion or between the two digestion tanks. Notably, {{it is not possible to}} completely isolate the different reaction phases, and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of zeolite synthesis is {{the production of}} pure phase material and a study by Lowe et al. showed that small and possibly significant amounts of template remaining in supposedly clean vessels could influence the crystallisation of subsequent gels. Two cleaning methods are widely used to clean the synthesis <b>reaction</b> <b>vessels</b> i. e. hydrofluoric acid or a solution of sodium hydroxide at reaction temperature, but their efficacy has not been tested. Zeolite omega was synthesized with both organic and inorganic templates and, following synthesis, the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessels</b> were cleaned by a novel method, described here, using hydrofluoric acid, crown ethers, and ultrapure water. This new method was compared to the standard methods by using a ‘scavenging gel’ to test the cleanliness of the vessels. The ‘scavenging gel’ produced some crystalline material when used following conventional cleaning whereas, when the vessels were cleaned using the method described here, the gel failed to crystallise. Conductivity measurements have proved a reliable index to the cleanliness of the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{process of}} {{reactive}} distillation involves using the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> as the still.

Distillation [...] "over a reactant" [...] could be classified as a reactive distillation. It is typically used to remove volatile impurity from the distallation feed.
