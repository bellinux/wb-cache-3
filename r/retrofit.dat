40|$|Although a {{significant}} number of studies have been conducted on the behavior of the reinforced concrete beam-column joints <b>retrofitted</b> with FRP materials, limited investigation considered the overall seismic behavior of the <b>retrofitted</b> frames. In this article, experimental and numerical studies are performed on a scaled-down eight-story and two full scaled low-rise ordinary moment resisting frames (OMRFs) <b>retrofitted</b> with FRP at the joints. Additional, rotational stiffness of the joints is implemented into pushover models to predict seismic performance and behavior factor of the <b>retrofitted</b> frames. Results indicate that FRP retrofitting is more effective than steel braces for low-and medium-rise OMRFs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of an {{investigation}} into the effectiveness of FRP retrofitting the joints in enhancing the seismic performance level and the seismic behaviour factor (R) of ordinary RC frames. The flexural stiffness of FRP <b>retrofitted</b> joints of the frame is first determined using nonlinear analyses of detailed FE models of RC-joint–FRP composite. The <b>retrofitted</b> joint stiffness is then implemented into the FE model of the frame in order to carry out nonlinear static (pushover) analyses on the FRP <b>retrofitted</b> frame. The seismic performance level and R-factor components of the <b>retrofitted</b> frame are then compared with those of the original frame and the same frame <b>retrofitted</b> with steel bracings, reported previously. The results show that the performance level and the seismic behaviour factor of the FRP <b>retrofitted</b> RC frame are significantly enhanced in comparison with the original frame and are comparable with those of the steel-braced frame. It is also found that using FRP at joints may upgrade an ordinary RC frame to an intermediate and even a high ductility frame...|$|R
5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle {{is removed from the}} freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the <b>retrofit,</b> about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches. Another feature of the <b>retrofit</b> monitors truck weight—a safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E
5|$|Several {{adjustments}} {{were made}} to shift the availability of passes from paper tickets to SmarTrip cards in 2012 and 2013. In May 2014 Metro announced plans to <b>retrofit</b> more than 500 fare vending machines throughout the system to dispense SmarTrip cards, rather than paper fare cards, and eventually eliminate magnetic fare cards entirely. This was completed in early December 2015 when the last paper farecard was sold. The faregates stopped accepting paper farecards on March 6, 2016, and the last day for trading in farecards to transfer the value to SmarTrip was June 30, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April, Breckinridge made daily {{visits to}} an ailing Henry Clay. Clay died June 29, 1852, and Breckinridge {{garnered}} nationwide praise and enhanced popularity in Kentucky after eulogizing Clay in the House. Days later, {{he spoke in}} opposition to increasing a subsidy to the Collins Line for carrying trans-Atlantic mail, noting that Collins profited by carrying passengers and cargo on mail ships. In wartime, the government could commandeer and <b>retrofit</b> Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opinion {{that they would be}} useless in war. Finally, he showed Cornelius Vanderbilt's written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his expense and carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins. Despite this, the House approved the subsidy increase.|$|E
25|$|The R160s have {{provisions}} for future installation for Communications-based train control (CBTC). Currently, only 68 R160As (8313-8380) have been <b>retrofitted</b> with CBTC equipment for operation on the L service alongside trains of CBTC-equipped R143 cars. However, 1486 R160s, 309 sets (250 five-car units, and 59 four-car units) are {{planned to be}} <b>retrofitted</b> with CBTC for Queens Boulevard service by June 2020.

5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to <b>retrofit</b> these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|Four F-111C {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C reconnaissance configuration. These aircraft met the RAAF's requirement for aircraft to reinstate its photographic reconnaissance capacity. While the original order for F-111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six reconnaissance variants, the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike aircraft and later <b>retrofit</b> six with reconnaissance pallets. In 1971 the USAF dropped plans to fit {{some of its}} F-111s as reconnaissance aircraft, but sold {{the design of the}} reconnaissance pallet to Australia for $3 million. At this time the RAAF decided to fit the pallet to four rather than six aircraft. The reconnaissance pallet contains four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit and is fitted in the F-111's weapons bay. The RF-111Cs retained their strike capability.|$|E
5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic <b>retrofit</b> project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{conducted}} {{a project to}} develop a common protocol for indoor environmental quality (IEQ) assessment and to assess the effects of energy <b>retrofits</b> on IEQ. This paper focuses on thermal comfort, which was first assessed based on 2 -month continuous monitoring in 16 multi-family buildings (94 apartments) in Finland and 20 buildings (96 apartments) in Lithuania during heating season before <b>retrofits.</b> In addition, corresponding data after <b>retrofits</b> were available from three buildings (17 apartments) from Finland and seven (30 apartments) from Lithuania. Two data loggers per apartment were placed to evaluate Tw and RHw (warm area), and Tc and RHc (coldest spot). Questionnaire data regarding housing quality and health were collected from the occupants. The results before <b>retrofits</b> indicated high Tw (> 23 °C) for {{a large proportion of}} time in Finnish apartments, whereas opposite trend was observed in Lithuania. After <b>retrofits,</b> proportion of time with high Tw was higher while proportion of apartments with low RHw was lower in Finland, whereas in Lithuania, about one fourth of the apartments had higher Tw and RHw, hence fulfilling the national guidelines. The average absolute humidity was higher after <b>retrofits</b> in both countries, especially in Lithuania (by 15 %). Occupant responses indicated improved thermal comfort. Therefore, potential effects of energy <b>retrofits</b> on occupants’ thermal environment and satisfaction were demonstrated, and simply adjusting indoor temperature could help to save energy. Further analysis is needed to include the effects of outdoor conditions, as well as overall IEQ to the assessment...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963, several {{proposals}} from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for rapid transit and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing the bridge rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making the bridge the worst traffic bottleneck in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, the bridge was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers also determined that sections of the bridge would fail during a large earthquake or a major windstorm, and that the bridge was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a seismic <b>retrofit</b> and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend the life expectancy to 20 to 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Seismic <b>retrofit</b> (or rehabilitation) {{strategies}} {{have been developed}} {{in the past few}} decades following the introduction of new seismic provisions and the availability of advanced materials (e.g. fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP), fiber reinforced concrete and high strength steel). <b>Retrofit</b> strategies are different from <b>retrofit</b> techniques, where the former is the basic approach to achieve an overall <b>retrofit</b> performance objective, such as increasing strength, increasing deformability, reducing deformation demands while the latter is the technical methods to achieve that strategy, for example FRP jacketing.|$|E
25|$|For {{reinforced}} concrete beam-column joints – various <b>retrofit</b> solutions {{have been proposed}} and tested in the past 20 years. Philosophically, the various seismic <b>retrofit</b> strategies discussed above can be implemented for {{reinforced concrete}} joints. Concrete or steel jacketing have been a popular <b>retrofit</b> technique until the advent of composite materials such as Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Composite materials such as carbon FRP and aramic FRP have been extensively tested for use in seismic <b>retrofit</b> with some success. One novel technique includes the use of selective weakening of the beam and added external post-tensioning to the joint {{in order to achieve}} flexural hinging in the beam, which is more desirable in terms of seismic design.|$|E

30|$|The load–drift {{hysteresis}} {{loops of}} the <b>retrofitted</b> specimens were {{almost the same}} as that of the control specimen J- 0. However, most <b>retrofitted</b> specimens except for J-A and J-SJ 2 showed maximum lateral loads greater than the values predicted by beam flexural strength. This indicates that the joint failed after beam yielding. Thus, in the <b>retrofitted</b> specimens, the structural behavior would be relatively more ductile than that of J- 0. In the J-SJ series, J-SJ 1 and J-SJ 3 were more effective than J-SJ 2.|$|R
40|$|Column grand {{composite}} {{curves and}} the exergy loss profiles {{produced by the}} Column-Targeting Tool of the Aspen Plus simulator are {{used to assess the}} performance of the existing distillation columns, and reduce the costs of operation by appropriate <b>retrofits</b> in a biodiesel production plant. Effectiveness of the <b>retrofits</b> is assessed by means of thermodynamics and economic improvements. We have considered a biodiesel plant utilizing three distillation columns to purify biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) and byproduct glycerol as well as reduce the waste. The assessments of the base case simulation have indicated the need for modifications for the distillation columns. For column T 202, the <b>retrofits</b> consisting of a feed preheating and reflux ratio modification have reduced the total exergy loss by 47 %, while T 301 and T 302 columns exergy losses decreased by 61 % and 52 %, respectively. After the <b>retrofits,</b> the overall exergy loss for the three columns has decreased from 7491. 86 kW to 3627. 97 kW. The <b>retrofits</b> required a fixed capital cost of approximately $ 239, 900 and saved approximately $ 1, 900, 000 /year worth of electricity.
