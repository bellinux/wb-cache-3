5|$|A {{symbol of}} 800 years of monarchy, the sovereign's {{coronation}} <b>regalia</b> {{is the only}} working collection in Europe– other present-day monarchies have abandoned coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies– and is the largest set of <b>regalia</b> in the world. Objects used to invest and crown the monarch variously denote his or her roles as Head of State, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces. Wives of kings are crowned as queen consort with a plainer set of <b>regalia.</b> Since 1831, a new crown has been made specially for each queen consort.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state <b>regalia</b> as {{collateral}} for loans throughout the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state <b>regalia</b> were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state <b>regalia.</b> The holy relics of the coronation <b>regalia</b> stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Use of <b>regalia</b> by monarchs in England can {{be traced}} back to its early history. A {{permanent}} set of coronation <b>regalia,</b> once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12thcentury. By the Tudor period it was usual for monarchs to inherit state <b>regalia</b> from his or her predecessor. Most of the present collection as a whole dates from around 350 years ago when King CharlesII ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor <b>regalia</b> had been either sold or melted down by Oliver Cromwell, a republican who overthrew the monarchy in 1649, during the English Civil War. Only four original items pre-date the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon, which is the oldest object in the collection, and three early 17th-century swords.|$|E
5|$|Arrowmen also {{exchange}} a special handshake as {{a token of}} brotherhood, along with other signs and passwords. A signature acronym, WWW, is often depicted in publications, <b>regalia,</b> etc.|$|E
5|$|Fourth Degree Knights may {{optionally}} {{purchase and}} wear the full <b>regalia</b> and join an assembly's Color Corps. The Color Corps {{is the most}} visible arm of the Knights, as they are often seen in parades and other local events wearing their colorful <b>regalia.</b> Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo, baldric, white gloves, cape, and naval chapeau. In warm climates and during warm months, a white dinner jacket may be worn, if done as a unit.|$|E
5|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, the only surviving {{items of the}} coronation <b>regalia</b> were a 12th-century spoon and three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.) Detailed records of old <b>regalia</b> survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings {{from the time of}} Charles I. For the coronation of Charles II, gems were rented because the treasury could not afford to replace them.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, most English goldwork {{was made}} in London workshops, which {{produced}} ecclesiastical work, clothing and furnishings for royalty and the nobility, heraldic banners and horse-trappings, and the ceremonial <b>regalia</b> for the great Livery Companies of the City of London and for the court.|$|E
5|$|In 1161, Edward the Confessor {{was made}} a saint, and objects {{connected}} with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his <b>regalia</b> in perpetuity {{and that they were}} to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by Richard Sporley, a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, dalmatic, pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the holy communion a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold– all of which were to be considered precious relics. Although the claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion on the abbey's part, and some of the <b>regalia</b> had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation <b>regalia</b> in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the north}} tower, the cathedral Treasury Museum {{displays}} a number of gold and silver articles used in the religious services. There is also a collection of textiles including Queen Margaret's golden gown. The burial <b>regalia</b> of Gustav Vasa, John III and their wives can also be seen.|$|E
5|$|Since the Restoration, {{there have}} been many {{additions}} and alterations to the <b>regalia.</b> A new set of <b>regalia</b> was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, CharlesII having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when MaryII was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband WilliamIII. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest, and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Starting with Queen Anne, gemstones were hired for coronations and replaced with paste and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice which continued until the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, {{originally}} the Crown Jewels of England, are 140 historic royal ceremonial objects, including the <b>regalia</b> and vestments worn by {{kings and queens}} of the UK at their coronations.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Connie Chan, {{unveiled}} on August 2006, {{was the first}} figure to appear in full Chinese <b>regalia.</b> The model's costume {{was inspired by the}} musical Only You, set in the Yuan Dynasty, in which Chan formerly starred.|$|E
5|$|The monarch of the Commonwealth realms, Queen ElizabethII, owns a {{historic}} collection of jewels– some as monarch {{and others as}} a private individual. They are separate from the coronation and state <b>regalia</b> {{that make up the}} Crown Jewels.|$|E
5|$|A {{coronation}} is the act {{of placement}} or bestowal of a crown upon a monarch's head. The term generally also refers {{not only to the}} physical crowning but to the whole ceremony wherein {{the act of}} crowning occurs, along with the presentation of other items of <b>regalia,</b> marking the formal investiture of a monarch with regal power. Aside from the crowning, a coronation ceremony may comprise many other rituals such as the taking of special vows by the monarch, the investing and presentation of <b>regalia</b> to the monarch, and acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects and the performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to the particular nation. Western-style coronations have often included anointing the monarch with holy oil, or chrism as it is often called; the anointing ritual's religious significance follows examples found in the Bible. The monarch's consort may also be crowned, either simultaneously with the monarch or as a separate event.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, rare Demon Fangs can {{be earned}} through combat {{which can be}} traded for additional, unique items that are {{beneficial}} in gameplay but not required to complete the game. Weapons inspired by the Imperial <b>Regalia</b> of Japan (the Reflector, the Rosaries and the Glaive) can be equipped on Amaterasu as either main or sub-weapons (one each), and used {{in addition to other}} melee attacks that the player can have Amaterasu learn through the course of the game.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{tensions}} rose between Conrad and Lothair due to diverging {{views on}} church politics. Lothair visited Italy in 1132-33, and was crowned emperor by Innocent II on 4 June 1133. In his absence, Conrad was ordained an archbishop. This directly infringed on the emperor's right, recently {{confirmed by the}} Pope, to invest a bishop with his <b>regalia</b> before he was ordained. It earned a stern rebuke from Lothair.|$|E
5|$|Encaenia: Fordham College at Rose Hill hosts an Encaenia {{each year}} in early May. Faculty, administrators, and {{students}} process in academic <b>regalia,</b> and candidates for degrees at the current year's Commencement receive various awards and honors. The ceremony includes a sentimental speech by the year's valedictorian, {{as well as a}} generally more humorous, yet equally endearing, speech by the honorary Lord or Lady of the Manor.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the United States Navy {{named the}} newly {{commissioned}} , a Watson-class vehicle cargo ship and Large, Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off ship, in his honor. The ship was christened by his daughter Annita, who {{was dressed in}} traditional <b>regalia.</b> It was attended by several men who served alongside her father {{as well as several}} flag officers.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their <b>regalia</b> as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of <b>regalia</b> worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} of the British monarch is {{a ceremony}} (specifically, initiation rite) {{in which the}} monarch of the United Kingdom is formally invested with <b>regalia</b> and crowned at Westminster Abbey. It corresponds to the coronations that formerly took place in other European monarchies, {{all of which have}} abandoned coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The general {{framework}} of the coronation service {{is based on the}} sections contained in the Second Recension used in 973 for King Edgar. Although the service has undergone two major revisions, a translation and has been modified for each coronation for the following thousand years, the sequence of taking an oath, anointing, investing of <b>regalia,</b> crowning and enthronement found in the Anglo-Saxon text have remained constant. The coronation ceremonies takes place within the framework of Holy Communion.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereign}} wears {{a variety}} of different robes and other garments {{during the course of the}} ceremony. In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the <b>regalia,</b> it is customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch. (The present exceptions are the supertunica and Robe Royal, which both date from the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1821).|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's ability {{to intervene in}} the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476. When the chieftain of the Heruli, Odoacer, deposed Western Emperor Romulus Augustus, sending the imperial <b>regalia</b> to Constantinople, Zeno had just regained his throne, and he could only appoint Odoacer dux of Italy, thereby ending the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The traditions {{established}} in the medieval period continued later. By {{the middle of the}} 15thcentury, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of StEdward. A crown was also displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Around this time, three swords– symbols of kingship since ancient times– were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy. Another emerging item of state <b>regalia</b> was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of HenryVIII in 1509; it would be added to the coronation <b>regalia</b> in the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Congress created {{instruction}} in military science and tactics {{at the college}} level. As {{a result of the}} act, St. John's brought a cadet corps to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic <b>regalia</b> for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E
5|$|Charles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, {{at which}} the Honours of Scotland (the <b>regalia</b> of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could not be {{returned}} to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours, and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar. They {{were brought to the}} castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool. Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.|$|E
5|$|In 597, a Benedictine monk {{had been}} sent by Pope GregoryI to start {{converting}} Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and <b>regalia</b> took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with {{which he or she}} was usually buried upon death.|$|E
5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, she could not {{exercise}} a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial <b>regalia,</b> two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January AD 13, Tiberius held {{a triumph}} for their {{victory over the}} Pannonians and Dalmatians, that he had {{postponed}} {{on account of the}} defeat of Varus at Teutoburg Forest. He was accompanied by Germanicus among his other generals, for whom he had obtained the triumphal <b>regalia,</b> and Germanicus took a distinguished part in the celebration. He was given the opportunity to display his consular insignia and his triumphal ornaments whereas his brother Drusus received no special honors except being the son of a triumphator.|$|E
5|$|Pistrucci was {{introduced}} to Lord and Lady Spencer by Banks. Lady Spencer showed Pistrucci a model of Saint George and the Dragon by Nathaniel Marchant and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style {{as part of her}} husband's <b>regalia</b> as a Knight of the Garter. Pistrucci had already been thinking of such a work, and he produced the cameo. The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet's Hotel in Leicester Square, where he had stayed after coming to London.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the {{movement}} in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 {{to the beginning of the}} 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining. The fifteenth century also sees the first evidence of ceremonial <b>regalia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Annunciation was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh. Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation– that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)– and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal <b>regalia.</b> In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with <b>regalia,</b> and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the war was a {{complete}} Byzantine victory, and Tzimiskes decided to take full advantage. Although he initially recognized Boris II as the legitimate Bulgarian tsar, after the fall of Dorostolon his intentions changed. This became evident during his triumphal return to Constantinople, where the emperor entered the Golden Gate behind a wagon carrying an icon of the Virgin Mary as well as the Bulgarian <b>regalia,</b> with Boris and his family following behind Tzimiskes. When the procession reached the Forum of Constantine, Boris was publicly divested of his imperial insignia, and at the church of Hagia Sophia, the Bulgarian crown was dedicated to God.|$|E
5|$|While bishop, de Gray often lent {{the king}} money, {{and on one}} {{occasion}} held the royal <b>regalia</b> as security for the repayment of a loan; he {{also served as a}} royal justice. In 1203 de Gray accompanied Archbishop Hubert Walter and several papal legates on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to King Philip II of France. Philip had demanded that John's niece Eleanor of Brittany or his nephew Arthur of Brittany be surrendered to him together with all of John's lands on the continent, none of which John was prepared to concede. Philip invaded Normandy after the bishops returned to England.|$|E
5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the <b>regalia</b> of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E
