40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of discriminating the different varieties, <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and seasons of Taiwan partially fermented tea by using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). A total of 308 partially fermented tea samples with 6 different tea varieties, 6 <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and 2 different production seasons were collected and analyzed. The principal component analysis (PCA) result of NIRS spectra data showed that the first three principal components could explain the sample variation LIP to 95. 0 %. The ability of classifying different <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> of tea samples by PCA was the best followed by tea varieties. The discriminant model further established by NIRS data with partial least square (PLS) could recognize and identify the varieties, <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and seasons of tea samples up to 98. 4 % (299 of 305), 97. 4 % (296 of 304), and 100 %, respectively. Using the established discriminant model, the tea samples with different varieties, <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and seasons could be correctly predicted and identified at the levels of 96. 3 %, 94. 1 % and 99. 2 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the main}} purpose is to make clear the basic {{character}} of horticulture <b>production</b> <b>area</b> in Fukuoka prefecture. The main method of analysis is management consulting method. It means we make the consulting index of structure, management control, and organization. The consulting index of structure means number of farmer, yield per farmer, unit price of farmer and so on. The consulting index of management control means the level of strategy and control method in production and selling. The consulting index of organization means the level of homogeneity and the ability of revolution and so on. In this analysis, we try to make clear {{the basic character of}} strawberry <b>production</b> <b>area</b> in Fukuoka prefecture by using such a consulting index. The management consulting method is still useful for horticulture <b>production</b> <b>area.</b> Because of, the recent horticulture <b>production</b> <b>area</b> become more complicated. And recent combination of cooperatives induce the merger of such <b>production</b> <b>areas.</b> In this condition, it is so useful that make clear the basic character of horticulture <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> by using management consulting method. わが国の経営診断に関わる研究は, 後述するように比較的歴史が長く, 数多くの研究がなされている. しかしその方法論がすでに確立され, 現場において実践されているといった状況とはいいがたく, 今日でもなお, 経営診断の実践的重要性は高いと言えよう. 特に産地を対象にした経営診断は産地の性格がますます複雑化している今日, 重要な実践的課題と考えられる. その理由の 1 つとして, 現在全国各地で進行している農協の合併が挙げられる. 農協の合併は当然のことながら旧農協毎に存在した産地(部会) の合併を促す結果となっている. その際各産地の性格を明確にする診断分析をおこない, 産地の合併を推進するための基礎的資料の提供が重要な課題となっているからである. 小稿の主な目的は福岡県内の施設園芸産地を対象に産地診断分析をおこない, 現段階の県内いちご産地の現状と問題点を整理することにある. 小稿ではまずはじめに, 各産地の診断分析をおこなう前に, これまでの経営診断に関する研究を簡単に整理し, 本研究の視点を提示する. それらを踏まえ本研究では, これまで個別農家に行われてきた経営診断(指標分析) を参考に, 産地の主要な構造指標(農家数, 1 戸当たり単収, 1 戸当たり面積, 1 戸当たり単価, etc) による診断をおこなう. さらに産地の生産および販売上の管理戦略がいかなる現状にあるのか, またその生産および販売の管理戦略を支える部会の組織がいかなる構造・成熟度合いにあるのか調査をおこなう. 以下, 小稿では産地診断を構造指標, 管理指標, 組織指標の視点からおこない, 現状の問題点を整理する予定である...|$|R

It combines full truckload (FTL) routes between the <b>production</b> <b>area</b> and the RDCs and less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments from the RDCs to each customer.
