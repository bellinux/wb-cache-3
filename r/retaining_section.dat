40|$|DE 1004056716 A UPAB: 20060620 NOVELTY - The device has a {{drilling}} tool holding device (1) for holding {{a drilling}} tool (a). An ultrasonic vibration generator (3) generates an ultrasonic vibration, which is brought {{on to the}} device (1). The device (1) is swingably supported at a carrier (2) in a direction of a rotating axis (x) of the tool. The device (1) comprises a tool <b>retaining</b> <b>section</b> (4) and a connection section that is extended {{in the direction of}} the axis. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (A) a machine tool with a tool holding device (B) a drilling method for drilling deep holes. USE - Used for a machine tool (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - The tool holding device facilitates the drilling tool to drill deep holes in a simple, accurate and cost-effective manner. The generator generates the vibration that is brought on to the holding device, thus improving a chip breakage and chip evacuation independent of material properties of the materials to be cut, reducing operating temperatures and tool breakdown, increasing service life of the tool and improving process stability and surface quality...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study used}} the {{finite element method}} (FEM) to analyze the stress field and seepage field of a roller-compacted {{concrete}} (RCC) dam, with an upstream impervious layer constructed with different types of concrete materials, including three-graded RCC, two-graded RCC, conventional vibrated concrete (CVC), and grout-enriched vibrated RCC (GEVR), corresponding to the design schemes S 1 through S 4. It also evaluated the anti-seepage performance of the imperious layer in the four design schemes under the normal water level and flood-check level. Stress field analysis of a <b>retaining</b> <b>section</b> and discharge section shows that the maximum tensile stress occurs near the dam heel, the maximum compressive stress occurs near the dam toe, and the stress distributions in the four schemes can satisfy the stress control criteria. Seepage field analysis shows that the uplift pressure heads in schemes S 3 and S 4 descend rapidly in the anti-seepage region, and that the calculated results of daily seepage flow under the steady seepage condition in these two schemes are about 30 %– 50 % lower {{than those in the}} other two schemes, demonstrating that CVC and GEVR show better anti-seepage performance. The results provide essential parameters such as the uplift pressure head and seepage flow for physical model tests and anti-seepage structure selection in RCC dams...|$|E

However, his other brother, John II, then claimed a part, so in 1321 Eric conceded Bergedorf (with Vierlande) to him, whose share thus became known thereafter as Saxe-Bergedorf-Mölln while Eric's was known as Saxe-Ratzeburg-Lauenburg.|$|R

50|$|Dacrydium is a genus of {{conifers}} {{belonging to}} the podocarp family Podocarpaceae. Sixteen species of evergreen dioecious trees and shrubs are presently recognized. The genus was first described by Solander in 1786, and formerly included many more species, which were divided into sections A, B, and C by Florin in 1931. The revisions of de Laubenfels and Quinn (see references), reclassified the former section A as the new genus Falcatifolium, divided Section C into new genera Lepidothamnus, Lagarostrobos and Halocarpus, and <b>retained</b> <b>Section</b> B as genus Dacrydium.|$|R

These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to <b>retain</b> <b>sections</b> of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|R

5|$|Brown's 1810 {{monograph}} did {{not include}} an infrageneric classification of Dryandra, and neither did his Prodromus, published later that year. In 1830, however, he introduced the first taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra, placing D.floribunda in section Dryandra verae along with most other species, because its follicles contain a single seed separator. Dryandra verae was renamed Eudryandra by Carl Meissner in 1845. Eleven years later Meissner published a new arrangement, retaining D.floribunda in D.sect. Eudryandra, and further placing it in the unranked subgroup § Ilicinae, because of the similarity of its leaves to those of Ilex (holly). In 1870, George Bentham published a revised arrangement in his Flora Australiensis. Bentham <b>retained</b> <b>section</b> Eudryandra, but abandoned almost all of Meissner's unranked groups, including § Ilicinae. D.floribunda was instead placed in D.ser. Floribundae along with four other species with small, mostly terminal flowers, left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves.|$|R
