40|$|A milk {{marketing}} board (MMB) is a legislatively specified compulsory marketing institution, {{and a common}} way to regulate markets for dairy products. MMBs are based on price discrimination. As price discrimination leads to unequal profitability between products, <b>receipts</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales</b> are pooled and farmers receive a single price adjusted for composition and quality. It is well documented that price discrimination through MMBs incurs an efficiency loss to the society. Earlier contributions, Ippolito and Masson (1978) and Serck-Hansen (1979), point out that a particularly high loss is incurred if export of dairy products {{is included in the}} MMB. It proves difficult to find examples where this is the case. MMB countries are either large with a low export share in dairy products (USA and Japan), have economies of scale (Australia) or exports are excluded from the MMB arrangement (Canada). However, we find Norway to be a good example. Using a numerical model of the Norwegian agricultural sector we show that substantial efficiency gain may be achieved by deregulating the dairy sector, mainly due to the elimination of exports. It is estimated that a transition to cost based pricing may increase the economic surplus by NOK 1. 5 billion, which is 26 % of the production value. This computed gain from deregulation is far larger than for the other MMB-countries...|$|E

The U. S. leads the world in the production and marketing of these floriculture and nursery crops also known as the “green” industry. Floriculture includes: bedding/garden plants, cut cultivated greens, cut flowers, flowering potted plants, foliage plants, floriculture propagative material. Flowering potted plants and foliage plants represent only items intended for indoor or patio use. Nursery includes: broadleaf evergreens, coniferous evergreens, deciduous shade trees, deciduous flowering trees, deciduous shrubs and other ornamentals, fruit and nut plants, Christmas trees (cut and to be cut), transplants for commercial truck crop production, and propagation material (except transplants for commercial crop production). The green industry is the fastest growing sector of U. S. agriculture, representing 11 percent of gross cash farm crop receipts in 1997 (USDA, 1999).

40|$|During {{the early}} 1980 s, many less {{developed}} countries (LDCs) experienced a phenomenon which is not readily explicable using conventional macroeconomic theory: accelerating inflation coupled with output contraction. Moreover, arguments based on supply shocks do not adequately explain {{the performance of the}} LOCs over this period. In explaining the apparent anomaly of accelerating inflation coupled with output contraction, the model developed here assigns an important role to the availability of bank credit.; In many LDCs, the government fixes interest rates on bank deposits and loans. If rates on loanable funds are set below market clearing levels, this leads to credit rationing. Generally, firms must pay wages to workers in advance of the <b>receipts</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales.</b> Bank credit is needed to finance the hiring of labor when there are few alternative sources of finance. Loan availability can thus have a crucial impact on the supply of output. The credit constraint is exacerbated when the government's fiscal deficit instigates inflationary pressure. In response, households reduce deposit holdings leading to a contraction in loan availability and recession.; Initially, the fiscal deficit and the money supply are assumed to be exogenously determined. Later, the analysis examines a feedback effect of inflation leading to increases in the fiscal deficit and further inflationary pressure. As inflation accelerates, individuals try to shift out of money balances and into inflation hedges contracting the real money supply, real loan availability, and output. Thus the model suggests an explanation for the vicious circle of accelerating inflation and declining output which is observed in many LDCs. Developing countries; Loans, Foreign...|$|E

A firm will determine the values of its endogenous variables so as to maximize its gain Λ, being subject to the relation (1). Our hypothesis on the gain function is as follows, (2) [numerical formula] A firm will determine the values of its endogenous variables so as to maximize its gain Λ, being subject to the relation (1). Our hypothesis on the gain function is as follows, (2) A = n-￡l, where II stands for the present values of "gross" profit which is expected to be gained from (money) capital invested during one unit of time (the term "gross" is used here to show that this profit contains interest cost) and Ω represents the appraised money term value of psychological resistance which the firm may feel when employing that amount of capital during one unit of time. II can be divided into two kinds of gross profit, profit from the capital invested into the productive operation, II_ 1 and profit from the capital invested into the capital assets, II_ 2. If we show explicitly the endogenous variables which are considered to influence II_ 1, II_ 2 and Ω, (3) [numerical formula] where Y_ 1,,Y_m are the debt balances of various types of funds (including capital stock) Therefore [numerical formula] Here μ and v denote the average time lengthes for whithdrawal of money expensed in the forms of C and I respectively. The μ and v have to be taken into consideration in this way because II was defined as the gross profit per unit time. The conditional equations for equilibrium in which Λ is maximized subject to (1) are (4) [numerical formula] If a firm behaves according to the gain maximization hypothesis defined above, (4) must hold at any periods. So if any one expression of these equations (4) is known in its value, it means that the values of the other expressions are known at the same time. In this sense, let us examine the value of[numerical formula] If we neglect general administrative expense, distribution cost and corporation tax,[numerical formula] becomes (5) where y^^～_ is sale-proceeds which the firm expects to obtain expending the current cost C, X the physical quantity of sales, P its price, q the physical quantity of inputs and s its price. The marginal productivity (dX) /(dq) can be calculated from "operating production function," which is the technological relation between output X and input q operating: the given equipment. In this paper we adopted two alternative methods in order to get the value s/P・(dq) /(dX). One way is to take the slope of the line connecting: two points, namely, the point (C_t, y^^～_ and the point (C_,y^^～_), in the space of (C,. y^^～_) as the approximate value of s/P・(dq) /(dX). But in this case price change must be taken into account (the change of capital equipments was assumed to be negligible). This price modification was done by the following formula. (6) [numerical formula] The other method is to estimate the operating production functions directly. Generally speaking, they can not be estimated without data of the capital assets, the measurement of which is notoriously difficult. Fortunately the data of productive capacity are available in the iron and steel industry, and we assume that the productive capacity Q is this output level corresponding to the operating degree which produces the maximum value of q/X. We specified the operating production function by and using the above assumption about the productive capacity we could estimate the values of two parameters α and β at each period of each firm. (dq) /(dX) is given by αβ・sinβq. Then, using the values of [numerical formula] estimated by the atove procedures, we sought the factors affecting v/μ・(dI) /(dII_ 2) and μ・(θY_i) /(θΩ) (i== 1, ・・・・・・, m) by the regression analysis. In other words, we tried to estimate the shape of the marginal gross profit schedule of investment-and of the marginal fund resistance schedules. They are the partial derivative functions of Λ.
