40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{perceptions}} that differ among university personnel and students with disabilities regarding the vagueness in the legal definition of the term <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations.</b> The theoretical framework that guided this study was the social model of disability. Using a sequential mixed-method design, the first strand surveyed 98 students and 93 personnel; then 10 % of each group participated in an interview or focus group. The main research questions explored the different accommodations offered by university personnel versus those that were used by students and the different perceptions of the term <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations</b> in accordance with ADA law. A chi-square test was used to analyze yes/no survey data and a t test was used for the Likert scale question. In the first strand there were statistically significant findings in distribution and perception of 35 specific accommodations, including advocacy and counseling. Both focus group and interview data were analyzed and themes emerged, such as specific accommodations. An important finding from the qualitative strand was that more than half the students thought they were not receiving <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations</b> while the majority of university personnel thought they provided <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations.</b> The key result was the lack of a clear consensus between students with disabilities and university personnel in definitions of <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations.</b> Disseminating the results of this research study can create positive social change in the legislative and academic arenas by creating a better understanding of the impact of the current standard of <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations.</b> One recommendation is the creation of federal and state level commissions to administer, manage, and maintain policies for colleges...|$|R

25|$|Prohibited {{discrimination}} may include, {{among other}} things, firing or refusing {{to hire someone}} based on a real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities. A <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{is a change in}} the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated. An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.|$|E

40|$|Students with ADHD {{struggle}} {{in higher education}} {{as a result of}} various functioning and participation problems. However, there are remaining gaps in the literature. First, it remains unclear how often and during which teaching and evaluation methods problems arise. Second, we do not yet know which <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations</b> are most effective to deal with the functioning. And third, we do not know which accommodations are most effective to address participation problems of students with ADHD in higher education. This study addresses these three gaps in literature. In total, 86 students with ADHD, 42 student counsellors and 86 students without a disability participated in a survey-based study. The results show that students with ADHD most frequently experience problems with sustaining and focusing attention and it is demonstrated that most problems arise during classical teaching or evaluation methods. Finally, the perception of the effectiveness of <b>reasonable</b> <b>accommodations</b> is strongly dependent on which problems students experience in higher education.
