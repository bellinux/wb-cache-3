2500|$|Since {{there is}} {{continuous}} withdrawal of steam and continuous <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages {{have to be}} made up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. [...] Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.|$|E

These deposits usually form a dense layer that impedes heat transfer and cause costly boiler tube failures. Most corrosion products that deposit in the boiler {{originate in the}} pre-boiler systems. The majority of corrosion products consist of colloidal and particulate metals and their oxides. The compounds are swept into the boiler and deposit on boiler tube surfaces. A major factor contributing to this problem is increased <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> containing corrosion products from various processes used throughout the steam plant. Internal corrosion must also be considered. Corrosion not only contributes to deposits, but also results in metal damage. The new software program can predict scaling and corrosion tendencies based on relevant thermodynamic and transport processes in the steam cycle. Plant data is input on a routine basis and the software provides early warning of abnormal conditions and improves overall plant efficiency. The paper discusses the capability of this novel software program and demonstrates cost benefit in implementing this unique tool in steam plants...|$|E

40|$|We {{suggest to}} subject anharmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensates to {{sinusoidal}} forcing with a smooth, slowly changing envelope, and {{to measure the}} coherence of the system after such pulses.

50|$|Industrial {{cogeneration}} plants normally {{operate at}} much lower boiler pressures than utilities.

Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water. 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities {{are less likely to}} have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. In Marangoni dropwise condensation, condensate drops move spontaneously when a bulk temperature gradient {{is applied to the}} condensing surface. It was considered that the velocity of drop movement is strongly affected by the horizontal component of Marangoni force around a condensate drop. And it is easy to infer that the horizontal component of Marangoni force is decided by both strength of Marangoni force and shape (angle) <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> drop. In previous studies, it was shown that the velocity <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> drop movement increases with the increase of bulk surface tension gradient and has a strong relation to initial drop distance. Initial drop distance was adopted as a parameter to express the characteristics of drop velocity, since the qualitatively relations among initial drop distance, Marangoni force and shape <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> drop inferred from the previous experimental results. However, those relations are still not known clearly in detail. Furthermore, the mechanism on the condensate drop movement is also still not well understood. Therefore, in this paper, experimental study was carried out and the quantitative relation between initial drop distance and angle <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> drop is investigated. In addition, numerical calculations on the condensation process of water-ethanol vapor mixture and the behavior <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> were performed by using the VOF (Volume Of Fluid) method to qualitatively analyze the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>condensate</b> drop movement. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|Technological advancement, {{as well as}} {{consumer}} demands, has {{motivated the}} miniaturization of electronic/mechanical systems and increase of device power and performance. The notebook computer is not an exception, and innovative thermal management solutions must be employed {{to compensate for the}} increased heat dissipation in the space-constrained enclosures. The majority of current cooling systems in laptop computers rely on heat pipes attached to a remote heat exchanger with micro-fans providing forced convection to reject heat to the ambient, however this technique can not accommodate the increasing heat fluxes in the confined laptop enclosure. In this study, a two-phase closed loop cooling system is designed and tested for a laptop computer. The cooling system consists of an evaporator structure containing boiling structures connected to a compact condenser with mini fans providing external forced convection. A pump is also incorporated to assist the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>condensate</b> back to the evaporator. The cooling system is characterized by a parametric study which determines the effects of volume fill ratio of coolant, initial system pressure, and pump flow rate on the thermal performance of the closed loop. Experimental data shows the optimum parametric values which can dissipate 25 W of chip power with a chip temperature maintained at 95 C. Numerical analysis provides additional data to further enhance the heat dissipation from the external air-cooled side of the condenser by studying the effects of ventilation and air flow rate across the system. Thermal management of mobile systems must be considered during the early design phases, and this research shows the feasibility of implementing of a two-phase cooling system to dissipate 25 W in a laptop computer.
