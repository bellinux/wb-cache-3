40|$|Aims: Markers of {{subclinical}} {{target organ}} damage (TOD) increase cardiovascular (CV) risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors. We wanted to establish thresholds for three markers of TOD based on absolute CV risk in different <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> categories. Methods and results: In {{a cohort of}} 1968 healthy patients, we measured urine albumin creatine ratio (UACR), pulse wave velocity (PWV), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and traditional risk factors. Patients were categorized according to Systemic Coronary Evaluation (SCORE), European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> and Framingham risk score (FRS) and three corresponding endpoints were recorded: CV death (SCORE-endpoint), a composite of CV death and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke (ESH/ESC-endpoint), and a composite that also included hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease and transient cerebral ischemic attack (FRS-endpoint). During a median follow of 12. 8 years events totaled 81 SCORE-, 153 ESH/ESC-endpoints and 280 FRS-endpoints. Thresholds for UACR, PWV and LVMI are presented using 10 -year risk threshold of more than 5 % (SCORE-endpoint), more than 10 %(ESH/ESC-endpoint) and more than 20 %(FRS-endpoint), which indicated high risk and eligibility for primary prevention. As an example, the threshold was 0. 83  mg/mmol, 13. 7  m/s and 119  g/m 2 for UACR, PWV and LVMI, respectively, for patients at moderate added risk according to ESH/ESC <b>risk</b> <b>chart.</b> Conclusion: Thresholds for UACR, PVW and LVMI based on absolute risk have primarily impact on risk stratification in patients with intermediate risk. The thresholds for PWV and LVMI in patients with moderate risk according to the ESH/ESC <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> were similar to currently applied thresholds whereas the threshold for UACR was considerable lower than the threshold for microalbuminuria...|$|E

40|$|Aim: Risk {{charts and}} risk score, {{based on the}} global {{absolute}} risk, are key tools for CVD risk assessment. When applied to the population from which they derive, they provide the best estimate of CVD risk. That is why the CUORE Project has among its objectives {{the assessment of the}} Italian population’s cardiovascular risk, identifying the model for the prediction of coronary and cerebrovascular events in 10 years. Methods: Data fromdifferent cohorts enrolled in the North, Centre and South of Italy between the 1980 s and the 1990 s were used. From the 7, 056 men and 12, 574 women aged 35 - 69 years, free of cardiovascular disease at base-line and followed up for a mean time of 10 years for total and cause-specific mortality and non fatal cerebrovascular and coronary events, 894 major cardiovascular events (596 coronary and 298 cerebrovascular) were identified and validated. To assess 10 -year cardiovascular risk, the risk score and <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> were developed for men and women separately, considering the first major coronary or cerebrovascular event as the endpoint. Results: The risk score is applied tomen andwomen aged 35 - 69 years and includes age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, smoking habit, diabetes and hypertension treatment using continuous values when possible. The <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> is applied to persons aged 40 - 69 years and includes the same risk factors as risk score, except for HDL-cholesterol and hypertension treatment, and uses categorical values for all variables.

40|$|Estimation of {{absolute}} risk {{of cardiovascular disease}} (CVD), preferably with population-specific <b>risk</b> <b>charts,</b> has become a cornerstone of CVD primary prevention.

The SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> for fatal CVD risk assessment were first calibrated for Germany with 1998 risk factor level data and 1999 mortality statistics. We present an update of these <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> based on the SCORE methodology including estimates of relative risks from SCORE, risk factor levels from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults 2008 - 11 (DEGS 1) and official mortality statistics from 2012.

In a nationwide sample of 3062 adults aged 40 - 65 years free of major CVD from DEGS 1, the mean 10 -year risk of fatal CVD estimated by the updated charts was lower by 29 % and the estimated proportion of high risk people (10 -year risk > = 5 %) by 50 % compared to the older <b>risk</b> <b>charts.</b> This recalibration shows a need for regular updates of <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> according to changes in mortality and risk factor levels in order to sustain the identification of people with a high CVD risk...|$|R

40|$|Background: Development of a {{validated}} risk {{prediction model}} for future cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Australians {{is a high}} priority for cardiovascular health strategies. Design: Recalibration of the SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> based on Australian national mortality data and average major CVD risk factor levels. Methods: Australian national mortality data (2003 – 2005) were used to estimate 10 -year cumulative CVD mortality rates for people aged 40 – 74 years. Average age-specific and sex-specific levels of systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and prevalence of current smoking were generated from data obtained in eight Australian large-scale population-based surveys undertaken from the late 1980 s. The SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> was then recalibrated by applying hazard ratios for 10 -year CVD mortality obtained in the SCORE project.

40|$|Three {{percent of}} the {{population}} harbors an intracranial aneurysm. A minority of these aneurysms will rupture and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH is a devastating disease with high case fatality and morbidity. A major contributor to the poor outcome after SAH is delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). About 30 % of the SAH patients develop DCI, {{but it is difficult to}} predict which patients. This thesis focuses on new insights on the incidence of SAH, the etiological pathway of aneurysm rupture, and early prediction of DCI. We performed a meta-analysis including 52 studies on the incidence of SAH. Overall, the incidence was 9. 2 per 100, 000 person-years, whereas incidence rates were doubled in Japan and Finland. Another main finding was that at young ages the incidence is higher in men, whereas after the age of 55 years it is higher in women. In another study, we compared several morphological characteristics on CT-angiograms in patients with ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. The main finding was that direction of flow into the aneurysm and nonspherical shape are potential new risk factors for aneurysm rupture. In DCI, we can distinguish between two infarct patterns: single infarction and infarction in multiple cerebral vascular territories. By comparing the risk profiles of SAH patients we found that these different infarct patterns are not distinct disease entities, but different degrees of the same pathophysiological process. Up to now it is not possible to predict easily and accurately which patients will be affected with DCI. Established predictors of DCI are large amount of subarachnoid blood and poor clinical condition on admission. In a review we systematically summarized the evidence on other predictors. We included 52 studies on early clinical, laboratory and radiological predictors routinely available after SAH and categorised the studies according to methodological quality. Our main finding was the strong evidence for smoking as a predictor of DCI. For several suggested predictors more research is needed to assess whether or not they are predictors of DCI. Early systemic inflammatory response syndrome, hyperglycaemia on admission, hydrocephalus, and history of diabetes may prove to have additional predictive value. Next, we analysed and compared multiple predictive models for development of DCI in patients with SAH. We developed a practical <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> for the development of DCI. The best model to predict DCI consisted of 4 predictors present on admission and easy to assess: clinical condition, amount of cisternal blood, amount of intraventricular blood, and age. Additional predictors were smoking and hyperglycaemia, but both contributed little to improvement of the model performance. Low or high risk of DCI can be reliably predicted by a simple <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> including these 4 predictors. The <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> presents an absolute risk between 12 and 61 % for the individual patient.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dutch {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) prevention guidelines recommend {{the use of}} modified SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> to estimate 10 -year risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease and congestive heart failure). This combined risk {{is derived from the}} SCORE mortality risk using multipliers. These multipliers have been shown to underestimate overall CVD risk. We aimed to compare the current Dutch <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> with charts that estimate a broader range of clinically relevant CVD using updated multipliers. METHODS: We constructed new <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> for 10 -year CVD using updated, recently published multipliers from the EPIC-Norfolk study, based on ratios of fatal CVD to clinically relevant CVD (fatal plus nonfatal CVD requiring hospitalisation for ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and aortic aneurysm). Our primary outcome was the proportion of the three risk categories, i. [*]e. 'high risk' (> 20 % 10 -year risk), 'intermediate risk' (10 - 19 %) and 'low risk' (< 10 %) in the new <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> as compared with the current <b>risk</b> <b>charts.</b> RESULTS: Applying the updated fatal CVD/clinical CVD multipliers led to a marked increase in the high-risk categories (109 (27 %) vs. 244 (61 %), (p < 0. 001)), an absolute increase of 229 %. Similarly, the number of low-risk categories decreased (190 (48 %) vs. 81 (20 %) (p < 0. 001)). CONCLUSION: The current Dutch <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> seriously underestimate the risk of clinical CVD, even in the first 10  years. Even when analyses are restricted to CVD events that required hospitalisation, true 10 -year risks are more than double the currently estimated risks. Future guidelines may be revised to reflect these findings...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Risk</b> <b>charts</b> {{are used}} to {{estimate}} the risk of cardiovascular diseases; however, most have been developed in Western countries. In Japan, currently available <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> are based on mortality data. Using data on cardiovascular disease incidence from the JMS Cohort Study, we developed charts that illustrated the risk of stroke. Methods and Results: The JMS Cohort Study is a community-based cohort study of cardiovascular disease. Baseline data were obtained between 1992 and 1995. In the present analysis, the participants were 12 276 subjects without a history of stroke; the follow-up period was 10. 7 years. Color-coded <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> were created by using Cox’s proportional hazards models to calculate 10 -year absolute risks associated with sex, age, smoking status, diabetes status, and systolic blood pressure. The risks of stroke and cerebral infarction rose as age and systolic blood pressure increased. Although the risk of cerebral hemorrhage were generally {{lower than that of}} cerebral infarction, the patterns of association with risk factors were similar. Conclusion: These <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> should prove useful for clinicians and other health professionals who are required to estimate an individual’s risk for stroke.

40|$|Background: <b>Risk</b> <b>charts</b> that {{depict the}} {{absolute}} risk of myocardial infarction (MI) for each combination {{of risk factors}} in individuals are convenient and beneficial tools for primary prevention of ischemic heart disease. Although <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> have been developed using data from North American and European cardiovascular cohort studies, {{there is no such}} chart derived from cardiovascular incidence data obtained from the Japanese population. Methods and Results: We calculated and constructed <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> that estimate the 10 -year absolute risk of MI by using data from the Jichi Medical School (JMS) Cohort Study—a prospective cohort study which followed 12 490 participants in 12 Japanese rural communities for an average of 10. 9 years. We identified 92 cases of a clinically-certified MI event. Color-coded <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> were created by calculating the absolute risk associated with the following conventional cardiovascular risk factors: age, sex, smoking status, diabetes status, systolic blood pressure, and serum total cholesterol. Conclusions: In health education and clinical practice, particularly in rural communities, these charts should prove useful in understanding the risks of MI, without the need for cumbersome calculations. In addition, they can be expected to provide benefits by improving existing risk factors in individuals.

40|$|Aims : The aims of {{this study}} were to examine whether risk {{prediction}} models for recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events have prognostic value, and to particularly examine the performance of those models based on non-laboratory data. We also aimed to construct a <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> based on the risk factors that showed the strongest relationship with CVD. Methods and results : Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate a risk score for each recurrent event in a CVD patient who was enrolled in a very large randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients were then classified into groups according to quintiles of their risk score. These risk models were validated by calibration and discrimination analyses based on data from patients recruited in New Zealand for the same study. Non-laboratory-based risk factors, such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, angina grade, history of myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke, diabetes or hypertension and treatment with pravastatin, were found to be significantly associated with the risk of developing a recurrent CVD event. Patients who were classified into the medium and high-risk groups had two-fold and four-fold the risk of developing a CVD event compared with those in the low-risk group, respectively. The risk prediction models also fitted New Zealand data well after recalibration. Conclusion : A simpler non-laboratory-based risk prediction model performed equally as well as the more comprehensive laboratory-based risk prediction models. The <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> based on the further simplified Score Model may provide a useful tool for clinical cardiologists to assess an individual patient 2 ̆ 7 s risk for recurrent CVD events. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Although {{elevated}} {{cardiovascular disease}} (CVD) risk factors {{are associated with}} a higher risk of developing heart conditions across all ethnic groups, variations exist between groups in the distribution and association of risk factors, and also risk levels. This study assessed the 10 -year predicted risk in a multiethnic cohort of women and compared the differences in risk between Asian and Caucasian women. Methods: Information on demographics, medical conditions and treatment, smoking behavior, dietary behavior, and exercise patterns were collected. Physical measurements were also taken. The 10 -year risk was calculated using the Framingham model, SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> for low risk and high risk regions, the general CVD, and simplified general CVD risk score models in 4, 354 females aged 20 – 69 years with no heart disease, diabetes, or stroke at baseline from the third Australian Risk Factor Prevalence Study. Country of birth was used as a surrogate for ethnicity. Nonparametric statistics were used to compare risk levels between ethnic groups. Results: Asian women generally had lower risk of CVD when compared to Caucasian women. The 10 -year predicted risk was, however, similar between Asian and Australian women, for some models. These findings were consistent with Australian CVD prevalence. Conclusion: In summary, ethnicity needs to be incorporated into CVD risk assessment. Australian standards used to quantify risk and treat women could be applied to Asians in the interim. The SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> for low-risk regions and Framingham risk score model for incidence are recommended.

Furthermore, compared with ESH, CVR class according to SCORE was lower in the majority of patients (n = 72, 68 %) while it was similar in 23 (22 %) and higher in 11 patients (10 %).

CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients with mainly moderate or severe hypertension, the distribution of cardiovascular risk was strikingly different according to ESH categorical tables and SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>charts.</b> This might be explained in part by the lower weight attributed to blood pressure in risk assessment, especially in young female subjects.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—A {{systematic}} reanalysis of 10  year {{coronary heart}} disease incidence data from the northern and the southern European cohorts of the seven countries study, to contribute indirectly {{to the production of}} a European coronary <b>risk</b> <b>chart.</b>  DESIGN AND SETTING—Men aged 40 - 59 years at entry were studied in three northern European cohorts based in Finland and Netherlands (n =  2213); and in 10  southern European cohorts based in Italy, former Yugoslavia, and Greece (n =  5897). Multiple logistic models for the prediction of coronary deaths, coronary incidence (hard criteria), and coronary incidence (any criterion) were solved for the two geographical groups and their pool. Risk factors fed into the models were age, systolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, and cigarette smoking.  RESULTS— 10 year {{coronary heart disease}} mortality and incidence were higher in northern than in southern Europe, with ratios around 2. 65.  Ratios among the three coronary heart disease manifestations were identical in the two cultural groupings. Coefficients of the multiple logistic models were similar and not significantly different between the two groupings. When applying the coefficients back to the same or the opposite population, the relative risk was large and similar in the different cultures. Relative risk was larger for more severe coronary heart disease manifestations. The absolute risk was overestimated when applying the northern European model to southern European populations and vice versa, with ratios of about 1. 5  and 0. 5, respectively. Coronary risk charts created to reproduce the shape of those incorporated in recent European guidelines confirmed the excess of absolute risk in the northern compared with the southern European cohorts, all else being equal.  CONCLUSIONS—In theory, a more appropriate European coronary <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> could be produced by adopting coefficients to correct for different background incidence rates in different cultures.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} which patient and C-arm characteristics are the strongest predictors of intraoperative patient radiation dose rates (DRs) during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedures {{and create a}} patient <b>risk</b> <b>chart.</b> Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 74 EVAR procedures, including 16, 889 X-ray runs using fixed C-arm imaging equipment. Four multivariate log-linear mixed models (with patient as a random effect) were constructed. Mean air kerma DR (DRAK, mGy/s) and the mean dose area product DR (DRDAP, mGycm 2 /s) were the outcome variables utilized for fluoroscopy as differentiated from digital subtraction angiography (DSA). These models were used to predict the maximum radiation duration allowed before a 2 -Gy skin threshold (for DRAK) or a 500 -Gycm 2 threshold (for DRDAP) was reached. Results: The strongest predictor of DRAK and DRDAP for fluoroscopy imaging was the radiation protocol, with an increase of 200 % when changing from "low" to "medium" and 410 % from "low" to "normal. " The strongest predictors of DRAK and DRDAP for DSA were C-arm angulation, with an increase of 47 % per 30 ° of angulation, and body mass index (BMI), with an increase of 58 % for every 5 -point increase in BMI. Based on these models, a patient with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2, combined with 45 ° of rotation and a field size of 800 cm 2 in the medium fluoroscopy protocol has a predicted DRAK of 0. 39 mGy/s (or 85. 5 minutes until the 2 -Gy skin threshold is reached). While using comparable settings but switching the acquisition to a DSA with a " 2 frames per second" protocol, the predicted DRAK will be 6. 6 mGy/s (or 5. 0 minutes until the 2 -Gy threshold is reached).

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the influence of implementation of SCORE charts with widely available indexes of organ damage, with the purpose to ameliorate individual {{risk assessment}}. METHODOLOGY: We searched www. Pubmed. gov for evidence about the predictive value of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), microalbuminuria (MAU) and metabolic syndrome on different risk profiles estimated by SCORE. Interventional and observational trials including at least 200 patients and published after 2000 were selected. RESULTS: The presence of organ damage as well as the number of abnormal parameters indicating organ damage is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, independently of SCORE. In the area of high risk, the impact of different markers of organ damage is heterogeneous. Combined risk models of SCORE and subclinical organ damage have major impact on risk stratification and may impact on recommendation in primary prevention in all SCORE categories. CONCLUSION: Available evidence suggests a tangible clinical advantage of adding the evaluation of simple organ damage markers to <b>risk</b> <b>charts</b> in cardiovascular <b>risk</b> predictio...|$|R

The result of a simple intervention was also evaluated. Material and methods: All individuals born 1950 living in Akureyri and Hafnarfjörður were invited to take part in a study to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors. Blood pressure was measured, hight, weight and an ECG was registrated. Blood test were done, including serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides and fasting blood glucose. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from height and weight (kg/m 2). The european <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> was used to estimate the cardiovascular risk. Information about the status of cardiovascular risk factors were given to each participant and they were given advise about lifestyle modifications and in some cases medical treatment of these risk factors. One year later these participants were again invited to take part in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. Results: Of those invited 70...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI) is complex disease; its pathogenesis {{is not completely}} understood and several variables {{are involved in the}} disease [...] The aim of this paper was to assess: 1) the predictive capacity of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in consistently distinguishing the two different conditions (AMI or control). 2) the identification of those variables with the maximal relevance for AMI. Genetic variances in inflammatory genes and clinical and classical risk factors in 149 AMI patients and 72 controls were investigated. From the data base of this case/control study 36 variables were selected. TWIST system, an evolutionary algorithm able to remove redundant and noisy information from complex data sets, selected 18 variables. Fitness, sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy of the association of these variables with AMI risk were investigated. Our findings showed that ANNs are useful in distinguishing risk factors selectively associated with the disease. Finally, the new variable cluster, including classical and genetic risk factors, generated a new <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> able to discriminate AMI from controls with an accuracy of 90...|$|E

This study assessed the 10 -year predicted risk in a multiethnic cohort of women and compared the differences in risk between Asian and Caucasian women. Methods: Information on demographics, medical conditions and treatment, smoking behavior, dietary behavior, and exercise patterns were collected. Physical measurements were also taken. The 10 -year risk was calculated using the Framingham model, SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> for low risk and high risk regions, the general CVD, and simplified general CVD risk score models in 4, 354 females aged 20 – 69 years with no heart disease, diabetes, or stroke at baseline from the third Australian Risk Factor Prevalence Study. Country of birth was used as a surrogate for ethnicity. Nonparametric statistics were used to compare risk levels between ethnic groups. Results: Asian women generally had lower risk of CVD when compared to Caucasian women. The 10 -year predicted risk was, however, similar between Asian and Australian women, for some models. These findings were consistent with Australian CVD prevalence. Conclusion: In summary, ethnicity needs to be incorporated into CVD risk assessment. Australian standards used to quantify risk and treat women could be applied to Asians in the interim. The SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> for low-risk regions and Framingham risk score model for incidence are recommended. The inclusion of other relevant risk variables such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and low levels of physical activity may improve risk estimation.

Nurses {{play a role in}} ensuring patient safety by following fall prevention guidelines. The purpose of this evidence-based study was to implement the RE-AIM evaluation tool to determine the impact of the Safe Five program on staff compliance with the program; patients 2 ̆ 7 awareness of the need for falls prevention; and falls among older adults, ages 65 years and older, admitted to an acute care nursing unit. The literature supports implementing a falls prevention program with multifactorial and interdisciplinary components, and an evaluation plan to help decrease falls in acute care settings. The Safe Five falls prevention program was implemented on the acute care nursing unit in an effort to decrease the inpatient falls rate on the unit. The inpatient falls data were collected retrospectively, 2 years pre implementation of the Safe Five program, and 8 to 10 months post implementation. Data were collected from the Safe Five checklists, recorded inpatient fall rates, and high fall <b>risk</b> <b>chart</b> audits provided by staff and nurse manager; they were then analyzed using the RE-AIM evaluation tool.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study revolves around {{the analysis of the}} safety risks involved with one construction project, and the respective economic effects of risk prevention and safety management. As a result of the co-ordination of systems, and harmonising of work between the Project Leader, Safety Co-ordinator and Contractor, an adequate strategy was developed {{for the safety of the}} project Escola de Ciências da Saúde da Universidade do Minho. The risk evaluation is carried out in simulated form, and task by task, introduced into the work programme. This gives a history of risk evaluation over the course of the project. The simulation allows peaks of risk to be identified, which will then lead to additional proposals of prevention measures. These prevention measures will serve to reduce risk and consequently lead to a curve on the <b>risk</b> <b>chart.</b> They consist not only of on-site measures, but also of the integrated implementation of working safety policies. We should be aware that risk can be reduced, but is difficult to eliminate altogether. The implementation of prevention systems and working safety policies has its own cost, but what we intend to prove, by attributing costs to risks, is that safety has lower costs than a lack of safety...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} the predictive value of some new biomarkers in the assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) population and to perform a correlation between the SCORE risk results and the risk profile estimated by the use of these biomarkers. Finally, we aimed to establish if the CVD risk assessment can be improved by adding the biomarkers into the SCORE risk equation. Material and Methods: In the study population the CVD risk assessment was performed using the SCORE High <b>Risk</b> <b>Chart.</b> The new individual biomarkers were: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate, albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), cystatin C, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and apolipoprotein B (apo-B). Results: The SCORE risk prediction model results were significantly altered by adding in the equation apo-B and HDLc values. An increase of one standard deviation of the apo-B values caused the increase of the SCORE results with 0. 19 standard deviations while an increase of one standard deviation of the HDLc values decreased the SCORE results with 0. 26 standard deviations. Conclusions: Advanced lipid testing, including the measurement of apo-B, provides a more comprehensive cardiac risk assessment and should be used in the development of specifically designed risk-scores for T 2 DM individuals...|$|E
