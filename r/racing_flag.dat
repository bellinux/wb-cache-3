2500|$|The General Lee {{was based}} on a 1969 Dodge Charger owned by Bo and Luke (the series used mostly 1969 Chargers in the beginning; later on, they also {{modified}} 1968 Chargers to look like 1969s by installing 1969-model taillamps, taillamp panels, and grilles). It was orange with a Confederate battle flag painted on the roof, the words [...] "GENERAL LEE" [...] over each door, and the number [...] "01" [...] on each door. In the original five Georgia-filmed episodes, a Confederate flag along with a checkered <b>racing</b> <b>flag</b> in a criss-cross pattern could be seen behind the rear window; this was removed when it was felt that this extra detail did not show up enough on-screen to warrant the already very tight time constraints of preparing and repairing each example of the car. The name refers to the American Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The television show {{was based on}} the movie Moonrunners, in turn based on actual moonshine runners who used a 1958 Chrysler named Traveler, after General Lee's horse (with a slight spelling change). Traveler was originally intended to be the name of the Duke boys' stock car too, until producers agreed that General Lee had more punch to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is on my}} <b>racing</b> <b>flag.</b> Let me impress upon you, ladies, that a <b>racing</b> <b>flag</b> is {{a square}} flag, and {{that that is not}} a flag at all, but a burgee. Every club has its burgee; as you see, that is a white cross on a blue ground with a crown in the centre, and is the burgee of the Royal Thames, of which I was elected a member last month.|$|E

50|$|At the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology, {{teams had}} {{to enter a}} {{specific}} building, where they would find 1500 Vietnamese 'hon' hats. One team member had {{to look through the}} hats for one with a tiny <b>race</b> <b>flag</b> on the underside. For every hat they picked up, they would have to place it on the head of their partner, continuing to stack them up higher and higher. If the hats fell off of their head at any point, the team would have to serve a 10-minute penalty before continuing. Once teams found the hat with the tiny <b>race</b> <b>flag,</b> they could exchange it for their next clue, directing them to the Pit Stop at the Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long.|$|R

50|$|In FIA sanctioned races, a {{white flag}} warns of a slow car ahead. In non-FIA races, a white <b>racing</b> <b>flag</b> is {{displayed}} from the starter's tower {{indicates that the}} race leader is running his/her final lap. The white flag can be pointed at the race leader to avoid confusion of other drivers. Drivers may wave a small white flag after a collision to indicate that they are uninjured.|$|E

However, Swan minority partner Anthony Marlowe stated his intent to run with Whitt {{for the remainder of the}} 2014 season. [...] Days later the 26 team was acquired by the former Swan co-owner and he merged his ownership into BK Racing, with Whitt remaining behind the wheel.

2500|$|<b>Racing</b> <b>flags</b> are {{traditionally}} used in auto racing and similar motorsports to indicate track condition and to communicate important messages to drivers. Typically, the starter, sometimes the grand marshal of a <b>race,</b> waves the <b>flags</b> atop a flag stand near the start/finish line. Track marshals are also stationed at observation posts along the race track {{in order to}} communicate both local and course-wide conditions to drivers. [...] Alternatively, some race tracks employ lights to supplement the primary flag at the start/finish line.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2009-10 season, the Bobcats sported {{redesigned}} uniforms, {{having a}} mixture of characteristics from both Hornets and Bobcats uniforms. They also resemble the Magic's current kit. The home uniforms were white and featured an arched [...] "Bobcats" [...] in blue with orange and white trim. Road uniforms were blue and featured an arched [...] "Charlotte" [...] in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs feature silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore.

Two battleships, silhouetted above [...] "SSN 789", represent [...] BB-1 and BB-58, the vessels that previously bore the INDIANA namesake.

The crest is encompassed by a gold outline of the state of Indiana.|$|E

25|$|In {{auto and}} {{motorcycle}} <b>racing,</b> <b>racing</b> <b>flags</b> {{are used to}} communicate with drivers.
