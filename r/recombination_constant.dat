40|$|The strange mass-independent isotope {{effect for}} the {{enrichment}} of ozone and the contrastingly unconventional strong mass-dependent effect of individual reaction rate constants are studied using statistical (RRKM) -based theory with a hindered-rotor transition state. Individual rate <b>constant</b> ratios of <b>recombination</b> reactions and enrichments are calculated. The theory assumes (1) an "eta-effect," which {{can be interpreted as}} a small deviation from the statistical density of states for symmetric isotopomers, compared with the asymmetric isotopomers, and (2) weak collisions for deactivation of the vibrationally excited ozone molecules. A partitioning effect controls the <b>recombination</b> rate <b>constant</b> ratios. It arises from small differences in zero-point energies of the two exit channels of dissociation of an asymmetric ozone isotopomer, which are magnified into large differences in numbers of states in the two competing exit channel transition states. In enrichment experiments, in contrast, this partitioning factor disappears exactly [Hathorn and Marcus, J. Chem. Phys. 112, 9497 (2000) ], and what remains is the eta-effect. Both aspects can be regarded as "symmetry driven" isotopic effects. The two experiments, enrichments and rate constant ratios, thus reveal markedly different theoretical aspects of the phenomena. The calculated low-pressure ozone enrichments, the low-pressure <b>recombination</b> rate <b>constant</b> ratios, the effects of pressure on the enrichment, on the individual <b>recombination</b> rate <b>constant</b> ratios, and on the <b>recombination</b> rate <b>constant</b> are consistent with the experimental data.

40|$|A {{recently}} formulated {{effective field}} theory for the three-body system with large scattering length {{is applied to the}} process of three-body recombination to a weakly bound s-wave state in Bose gases. We find that the three-body <b>recombination</b> <b>constant</b> α is not universal but can only take values between zero and 67. 9 ¯ha 4 /m, where a is the scattering length. Near a Feshbach resonance, α should oscillate between those limits as the magnetic field B approaches the point where a → ∞. In any interval of B where a increases by a factor of 22. 7, α should have a zero. The successful achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation has triggered a large interest in trapped interacting Bose gases. One of the main factors limiting the achievable density in these experiments is the loss of atoms through the process of 3 -body recombination. Such losses occur when three atoms scatter to form a molecular bound state (called a “dimer” for brevity) and a third atom. The kinetic energy of the final state particles usually allows all three atoms to escape from the trapping potential. This 3 -body recombination process is also interesting in its own right as it provides a unique window on 3 -body dynamics. The number of recombination events per unit time and volume can be parametrized as νrec = αn 3, where α is the <b>recombination</b> <b>constant</b> and n the density of the gas. The calculation of α in general is a complicated problem, because it is sensitive to the detailed behavior of the interaction potential [1]. In the case of 3 -body recombination to a weaklybound s-wave state, the problem may simplify. For atoms of scattering length a and mass m, the binding energy of the dimer is simply Bd = ¯h 2 /(ma 2).

The exact analytic solutions, i. e., the K-adiabatic and K-active steady-state population distribution function of reactive complexes, g(EJK) and g(EJ), respectively, are derived for the K-adiabatic and K-active master equation cases using properties of inhomogeneous integral equations (Fredholm type).

Since the spatial gradient changes when the thickness of a device is varied, we study thickness series of two different polymer:fullerene systems and measure the charge density dependence of mobility and lifetime.

These spin-dependent rate constants have not been extracted previously from the experimental data because they require fitting its magnetic field-dependence to the results of quantum spin dynamics simulations. We find that the triplet <b>recombination</b> rate <b>constant</b> decreases exponentially with the length of the wire, consistent with the superexchange mechanism of charge recombination. However, the singlet <b>recombination</b> rate <b>constant</b> is nearly independent of the length of the wire, suggesting that the singlet pathway is dominated by an incoherent hopping mechanism. A simple qualitative explanation for the different behaviours of the two spin-selective charge recombination pathways is provided in terms of Marcus theory. We also find evidence for a magnetic field-independent background contribution to the triplet yield of the charge recombination reaction, and suggest several possible explanations for it. Since none of these explanations is especially compelling given the available experimental evidence, and since the result appears to apply more generally to other molecular wires, we hope that this aspect of our study will stimulate further experimental work.

In particular, the predicted linear rise of both current and response was found at a. c. frequencies up to 100 - 200 Hz; and the end of this linear range coincided with the end of steady-state conditions during the reversed-field phase. Essentially similar steady-state limits were found under conventional, unipolar pulse regimes.

We show that typical measurements of the radiative bimolecular <b>recombination</b> <b>constant</b> in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 are strongly affected by photon re-absorption which masks a much larger intrinsic bimolecular recombination rate constant. By investigating a set of films whose thickness varies between 50 nm and 533 nm, we find that the bimolecular charge recombination rate appears to slow by an order of magnitude as the film thickness increases.

Hence we postulate that the wide range of literature values reported for such coefficients is partly to blame on differences in photon out-coupling between samples, with crystal grains or mesoporous scaffolds of different sizes influencing light scattering, while thinner films or index-matched surrounding layers can reduce the possibility for photon re-absorption.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} computationally and analytically investigates ways {{to model}} solar cells when the lateral {{motion of charge}} carriers and light are relevant. We focus on back-contact perovskite solar cells, and assessing the experimental technique of scanning photocurrent microscopy {{as a means to}} investigate them. Solar cells are three-dimensional objects frequently modelled as being one-dimensional. However, for more complex designs of solar cell or if the cell is only point-illuminated, one-dimensional modelling is insufficient. In the first study, some conditions for reducing the complexity of two-dimensional drift-diffusion simulations are investigated for a back-contact perovskite cell. Analytic expressions for the relationship in both the low extraction velocity and high extraction velocity regimes are demonstrated, and the conditions where these approximations break down are investigated. These findings are then applied a point-excited film with an extended electrode, a problem encountered during scanning photocurrent microscopy. We show the current recorded in this case should decay exponentially with the distance between excitation and electrode, with a decay constant that can be related to device parameters. The characteristic equilibration time for the system to reach this current is demonstrated to increase linearly with distance. Between this gradient and the exponent, information about the diffusion and recombination mechanics can be extracted from a variety of systems. Photon recycling is the process in whereby photogenerated carriers recombine to generate light that is absorbed again within the solar cell. In the second section, we apply the findings of the first section to show that experimental results published elsewhere are best explained by photon recycling in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite back-contact solar cells. However we do not have an established theoretical model for long-ranged lateral optical transport in these solar cells. Three models are developed: a bimolecular model for unscattered, coherent transport; a photon diffusion model for frequently scattered, noncoherent light; and a monomolecular, assisted-diffusion model. The modal nature of coherent optical transport is considered and modifications to previous one-dimensional theories are made. The nature of the photon diffusion model is discussed, as are theoretical shortcomings. All three models are then solved numerically and compared to experimental results. The low-scattering photon diffusion models correspond well to the experiment. The third investigation involves the performance of different architectures of back-contact perovskite cells. These cells potentially offer increased current due to less shadowing by front electrodes. We compare them {{to each other and to}} traditional vertical structures. It is found that, in terms of internal transport, the back-contact solar cells give less efficient performance than the vertical design. The best of the back-contact cells investigated is a flat interdigitated design. The increase in efficiency from optical factors would have to exceed 10 % for the overall efficiency of back-contact cells to be higher than vertical devices.

We calculate the three-body loss rates in heteronuclear mixtures of atoms for the case of large scattering length between the unlike atoms. Using zero-range interactions, we present results from the numerical solution of the integral equations for the recombination amplitude in momentum space and extract expressions for the <b>recombination</b> rate <b>constants.</b> Moreover, we calculate the relative positions of loss features for diﬀerent sign of the scattering length and a ﬁrst comparison with available experimental data is shown...|$|R

First, {{the results obtained}} for a SiGe spike emitter are compared with the conventional HBT. Then model parameter extraction {{with the help of}} HICUM model is performed in the simulated data for the new device. The accurate compact modeling introduces a new <b>recombination</b> time <b>constant</b> parameter inside the existing HICUML 2. 24 model. Modeling results with the extended model indicate a good agreement not only in DC characteristics but also in dynamic behavior. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
