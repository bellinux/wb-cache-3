50|$|At the Wapi Eagle Casino, Detective Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) {{speaks with}} casino manager Nicole Jackson (Claudia Ferri) and {{security}} chief Roberta Drays (Patti Kim), {{both of whom}} deny seeing Rosie. Sarah learns that the casino camera footage gets erased after 24 hours and asks to interview customers. Nicole tells her that she is on Indian land, which is not under state regulation, and orders her to leave. Outside the casino, Sarah calls a district attorney to obtain a warrant on the bank that owns the casino ATMs, so she can review their camera footage. Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) arrives and they discuss the case. She tells him that Rosie's phone and backpack were never found and could be inside the casino. The girl had taken the last ferry to the island on Friday and must have spent the night there. Sarah tells him that the casino manager will offer no help. As her phone begins to <b>ring,</b> <b>Holder</b> calls his sister and leaves a voice mail, saying {{that he plans to}} attend his nephew’s school event. Sarah’s call is from her son Jack's school. He has been absent for the past three days. Holder drives Sarah to the motel, where she finds Jack’s phone but not him. Thinking Regi might know where Jack may be, Holder drives Sarah to the marina. However, Regi has already sailed away on her boat. Sarah speaks to the mother of Jack's best friend by phone. She is told that Jack is the leader of a group of boys who cut class and gather at a place called The Tunnel.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{mounting}} scheme {{to control the}} displacement of a mirror (or other small object) by a cylindrical piezoelectric actuator, giving uniform response and no phase lag up to high frequencies. This requires a simple <b>ring</b> <b>holder,</b> and unmodified off-the-shelf components. In our implementation, the piezo-mirror assembly has its first mechanical resonance around 120 kHz, close to the resonance for the bare piezo. The idea is to decouple the fundamental elongation mode of the piezo-mirror assembly from the holder by side-clamping the assembly at its zero-displacement plane for this mode. The main drawback is a reduced mirror displacement, by a factor 2 in our case (mirror displacement is ~ 2. 5 μm). Also, the mirror needs to be light {{with respect to the}} piezo: still, we use a standard half-inch mirror. The resulting system is very compact as it fits inside a 1 -in. commercial steering mirror post...|$|E

The in-fluence of polymer coating concentration on skin pH, coating-skin adhesion, and coating absorption upon anti-microbial performance were investigated. Aqueous solu-tions of 0. 5 to 4. 8 % (wt/vol) PS were prepared with 10 % (wt/vol) TSP (PS + TSP coating), and alginate + ASC coatings contained 1 % (wt/vol) calcium chloride in 1, 200 ppm of ASC mixed with an aqueous solution of 0. 5, 1. 0, or 1. 5 % (wt/vol) sodium alginate.

40|$|The {{constant}} pursuit in {{the automotive}} industry to increase the engines performance, new solutions are always developed and tested to reduce the friction and increase the efficiency in the engine. One component that contributes to friction losses is the piston ring pack where the top compression stands for up to 40 %. This master thesis collaborated with Scania’s material science department Basic engine and covers the friction and wear of four different materials on the cylinder liner surface against the top compression ring. The four tested materials were grey cast iron with different honing quality and three atmospheric plasma sprayed coatings with titanium oxide, chromium oxide and Metco’s mixture F 2071 which is a stainless steel mixed with a ceramic. A martensitic steel piston ring with a chromium coated sliding surface was used for all the testing in the Cameron-Plint TE 77 test-rig. This is a pin-on-disc test method and the parameters used for testing is set to replicate the environment the ring is exposed to at the top dead centre. The test-rig has been in Scania’s possession {{for a long time}} and has not always given a satisfying result. An uneven contact between the ring and liner has been a problem resulting in only worn edges of the liner specimen. The piston <b>ring</b> <b>holder</b> was therefore redesigned to be able to adjust the radius of the ring. This allowed a good conformability between the ring and liner to be obtained. The tested materials were evaluated according to friction and wear. Friction was measured with the test-rig and the wear was calculated with surface profiles that were measured before and after testing. Worn surfaces were studied in a SEM to verify which wear mechanism that was active. The changes of the surfaces was studied with the use of following surface parameters Ra, Rk, Rpk, Rvk and if there was a connection between these parameters and friction and wear coefficient. Independent of honing quality showed the grey cast iron lowest friction coefficient just under 0. 13, the F 2071 liner showed a friction coefficient just above 0. 13. Both oxide layers showed similar friction where the chromium oxide had a friction just below 0. 15 and the titanium oxide lay just above 0. 15. Lowest wear coefficient had the chromium oxide followed by F 2071, titanium oxide and the bad honed grey cast iron. These three liners showed almost the exact same wear coefficient. Worst wear coefficient had the grey cast iron with a good honing quality. A mild abrasive wear mechanism was active during the wear test and vague wear marks was found on the surface. There is no connection between wear coefficient and friction and the change in surface roughness during the test does not affect the friction...|$|E

40|$|Under an interagency {{agreement}} with the Department of Energy, the NASA Lewis Research Center manages a Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine Technology (HDET) research program. The overall program objectives are {{to reduce fuel consumption}} through increased engine efficiency, reduce engine exhaust emissions, and provide options for the use of alternative fuels. The program is administered with a balance of research contracts, university research grants, and focused in-house research. The Cummins Engine Company participates in the HDET program under a cost-sharing research contract. Cummins is researching and developing in-cylinder component technologies for heavy-duty diesel engines. An objective of the Cummins research is to develop technologies for a low-emissions, 55 -percent thermal efficiency (LE- 55) engine. The best current-production engines in this class achieve about 46 -percent thermal efficiency. Federal emissions regulations are driving this technology. Regulations for heavy duty diesel engines were tightened in 1994, more demanding emissions regulations are scheduled for 1998, and another step is planned for 2002. The LE- 55 engine emissions goal is set at half of the 1998 regulation level and is consistent with plans for 2002 emissions regulations. LE- 55 engine design requirements to meet the efficiency target dictate a need to operate at higher peak cylinder pressures. A key technology being developed and evaluated under the Cummins Engine Company LE- 55 engine concept is the spherical joint piston and connecting rod. Unlike conventional piston and connecting rod arrangements which are joined by a pin forming a hinged joint, the spherical joint piston and connecting rod use a ball-and-socket joint. The ball-and-socket arrangement enables the piston to have an axisymmetric design allowing rotation within the cylinder. The potential benefits of piston symmetry and rotation are reduced scuffing, improved piston ring sealing, improved lubrication, mechanical and thermal load symmetry, reduced bearing stresses, reduced running clearances, and reduced oil consumption. The spherical joint piston is a monolithic, squeeze-cast, fiber-reinforced aluminum piston. The connecting rod has a ball end that seats on a spherical saddle within the piston and is retained by a pair of aluminum bronze <b>holder</b> <b>rings.</b> The <b>holder</b> <b>rings</b> are secured by a threaded ring that mates with the piston. As part of the ongoing research and development activity, the Cummins Engine Company successfully completed a 100 -hr test of the spherical joint piston and connecting rod at LE- 55 peak steady-state engine conditions. In addition, a 100 -hr transient cycle test that varied engine conditions between LE- 55 no-load and LE- 55 full-load was successfully completed...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we derive the {{asymptotic}} {{expansion of the}} Kiihler-Einstein metrics on certain quasi-projective varieties, which can be compactified by adding a divisor with simple normal crossings. The weighted Cheng-Yau Hilder spaces and the log-filtrations based on the bounded geometry are introduced to characterize the asymptotics. We first develop {{the analysis of the}} Monge-Ampere operators on these weighted spaces. We construct a family of linear elliptic operators which can be viewed as certain conjugacies of the specially linearized Monge-Ampbre operators. We derive a theorem of Fredholm alternative for such elliptic operators by the Schauder theory and Yau's generalized maximum principle. Together these results derive the isomorphism theorems of the Monge-Ampbre operators, which imply that the Monge-Ampere operators preserve the log-filtration of the Cheng-Yau <b>Holder</b> <b>ring.</b> Next, by choosing a canonical metric on the submanifold, we construct an initial Kidhler metric on the quasi-projective manifold such that the unique solution of the Monge-Ampere equation belongs to the weighted - 1 Cheng-Yau <b>Hölder</b> <b>ring.</b> Moreover, we generalize the Fefferman's operator to act on the volume forms and obtain an iteration formula. (cont.) Finally, with the aid of the isomorphism theorems and the iteration formula we derive the desired asymptotics from the initial metric. Furthermore, we prove that the obtained asymptotics is canonical {{in the sense that it}} is independent of the extensions of the canonical metric on the submanifold. by Damin Wu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5000|$|This {{process is}} based on the 1950s patent for hydramolding by Fred Leuthesser, Jr. and John Fox of the Schaible Company of Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States. It was {{originally}} used in producing kitchen spouts. This was done because in addition to the strengthening of the metal, hydromolding also produced less [...] "grainy" [...] parts, allowing for easier metal finishing.In sheet hydroforming (SHF) there are bladder forming (where there is a bladder that contains the liquid; no liquid contacts the sheet) and hydroforming where the fluid contacts the sheet (no bladder). Bladder forming is sometimes called flexforming. Flexforming is mostly used for low volume productions, as in the aerospace field.Forming with the fluid in direct contact with the part can be done either with a male solid punch (this version is sometimes called hydro-mechanical deep drawing) or with a female solid die.In hydro-mechanical deep drawing, a work piece is placed on a draw <b>ring</b> (blank <b>holder)</b> over a male punch then a hydraulic chamber surrounds the work piece and a relatively low initial pressure seats the work piece against the punch. The punch then is raised into the hydraulic chamber and pressure is increased to as high as 100 MPa (15000 psi) which forms the part around the punch. Then the pressure is released and punch retracted, hydraulic chamber lifted, and the process is complete.|$|R

A water suspension of the sample material was placed onto a sample holder for transmission experiments and then covered with a Mylar foil (6  μm thick, DuPont Tejjin Films, Chester, VA, USA). Then, the second Mylar foil covers the sample to avoid losses. Finally, the sample holder was completed with a sample <b>holder</b> <b>ring,</b> making it ready for X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments in transmission mode.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop {{calibration}} equations to predict the chemical composition of raw, homogenized rabbit meat by means of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). 44 Pannon White rabbits were housed in groups in three different pen types (16 anim. /m 2), and were fed the same diet. Another 45 animals were housed in cages (12 anim. /m 2) and fed by different feeding regimes. Rabbits were slaughtered at the bodyweight of 2. 4 - 2. 5 kg. Homogenized fresh and freeze-dried left total hind leg muscles were investigated by NIRS using a NIRSystem 6500 equipment with small <b>ring</b> cup sample <b>holder.</b> The ether extract and protein content of all samples were determined chemically. Samples 44 of housing experiment were applied in producing LOCAL calibration equations tested on the 45 samples from the separate feeding experiment.

Results are reassuring, because the equations were applicable, however the analyzed samples were from independent housing and feeding systems. Therefore the chemical compositions differed in the two datasets, i. e. 9. 46 %, and 11. 79 % for fat, 85. 75 % and 83. 44 % for protein content in calibration and prediction datasets, respectively.
