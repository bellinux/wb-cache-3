50|$|It is safe {{to freeze}} chicken {{directly}} in its original packaging, but this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time. Therefore, for prolonged storage, it is recommended to overwrap these packages. It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is. If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer, the food is still safe to use, {{but it is still}} recommended to overwrap or <b>rewrap</b> it. Chicken should be away from other foods, so if they begin to thaw, their juices won't drip onto other foods. If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store, it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the leg, the teams were told they were to next travel to the city of Jaipur. Upon arrival they had to head to the Jantar Mantar sundial where they found 50 men in turbans walking around. Six of the men had their next clue hidden within their turban, but if they did not find their next clue, they would have to <b>rewrap</b> the man's turban before being allowed to continue. The clue sent them to a cricket stadium for the Roadblock, asking [...] "Who is the best batsman?". One team member had to hit at least one of six cricket balls bowled to them to receive their next clue. If they could not hit any of the six bowls, they had to sit out for a penalty time period before they could attempt the Roadblock, again. Once they hit a ball, they were given their next clue.|$|E
50|$|The {{much smaller}} Remreed crosspoints, {{introduced}} {{at about the}} same time as 1AESS, were packaged as grid boxes of four principal types. Type 10A Junctor Grids and 11A Trunk Grids were a box about 16x16x5 inches (40x40x12 cm) with sixteen 8x8 switches inside. Type 12A Line Grids with 2:1 LCR were only about 5 inches (12 cm) wide, with eight 4x4 Stage 0 line switches with ferrods and cutoff contacts for 32 lines, connected internally to four 4x8 Stage 1 switches connecting to B-links. Type 14A Line Grids with 4:1 LCR were about 16x12x5 inches (40x30x12 cm) with 64 lines, 32 A-links and 16 B-links. The boxes were connected to the rest of the fabric and control circuitry by slide-in connectors. Thus the worker had to handle a much bigger, heavier piece of equipment, but didn't have to unwrap and <b>rewrap</b> dozens of wires.|$|E
40|$|Nucleosomes sterically occlude their wrapped DNA from {{interaction}} with many large protein complexes. How proteins {{gain access to}} nucleosomal DNA target sites in vivo is not known. Outer stretches of the nucleosomal DNA spontaneously unwrap and <b>rewrap</b> with high frequency, providing rapid and efficient access to regulatory DNA target sites located there; but rates {{for access to the}} nucleosome interior have not been measured. Here we show that for a selected high affinity nucleosome positioning sequence the spontaneous DNA unwrapping rate decreases dramatically with distance inside the nucleosome. The rewrapping rate also decreases, but only slightly. Our results explain the previously known strong position-dependence to the equilibrium accessibility of nucleosomal DNA, which is characteristic of both selected and natural sequences. Our results point to slow nucleosome conformational fluctuations as a potential source of cell-cell variability in gene activation dynamics; and they reveal the dominant kinetic path by which multiple DNA binding proteins cooperatively invade a nucleosome...|$|E

The show is a loose spinoff of the show Unwrapped, whose host Marc Summers acts as [...] "Head Judge" [...] for each episode, alongside {{a representative of the}} company that produces the food of the day, and a third impartial judge involved in the food industry in some way (chef, critic, blogger, etc.).|$|R
40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} {{of phase}} reconstruction {{based on the}} integral of phase gradient is presented. The algorithm directly derives two real-valued partial derivatives from three phase-shifted interferograms. Through integrating the phase derivatives, the desired phase is reconstructed. During the phase reconstruction process, {{there is no need}} for an extra <b>rewrapping</b> manipulation to ensure values of the phase derivatives lie in the interval [-pi, pi] as before, thus this algorithm can prevent error or distortion brought about by the phase unwrapping operation. Additionally, this algorithm is fast and easy to implement, and insensitive to the nonuniformity of the intensity distribution of the interferogram. The feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated by both computer simulation and experiment...|$|R
2500|$|About {{half the}} {{population}} of Madagascar practices traditional religions, which tend to emphasize links between {{the living and the}} dead. They believe that the dead join their ancestors in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. This spiritual communion is celebrated by the Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of famadihana, or [...] "turning over the dead". In this ritual, relatives' remains are removed from the family tomb, <b>rewrapped</b> in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor. In the festivities, they eat, drink, and literally dance with the dead. After one or two days of celebrating, they shower the body with gifts and rebury it.|$|R
50|$|During routine inspections, bridge cables are {{unwrapped}} and wedges {{are used}} to separate the individual strands. Inspectors look for signs of moisture and corrosion throughout the cable. In the 1990s engineers experimented with several materials on a small section of the cables of the Bear Mountain Bridge. After a year the test areas were reexamined and one polymer-based, non-toxic paste material {{was found to be}} superior. The bridge cables were then <b>rewrapped</b> in 2000 using the material.

New York State Bridge Authority chief engineer William Moreau is hopeful that the new material will lengthen the life of the cables, and lower the need for inspection and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|She predeceased {{her husband}} and her mummified corpse was placed with that of Pinedjem II in Tomb DB320 in the Theban Necropolis, in which it was rediscovered in 1881. She was buried in the 5th regnal year of Siamun in coffins that were {{originally}} made for Pinedjem's sister and first wife Isetemkheb. Both the inner and outer coffins were found, but one of them was reused for the reburial of Ramesses IX. It is unknown whether her coffin was reused after her death or that she donated it to the reburial of Ramesses. The later theory is supported by the fact that she also donated linens for the <b>rewrapping</b> of his mummy; the former is indicated by the fact that apparently no attempt has been made to redecorate the coffin for a male mummy.|$|R
50|$|Work {{from the}} Widom {{laboratory}} {{has shown that}} nucleosomal DNA is in equilibrium between a wrapped and unwrapped state. Measurements of these rates using time-resolved FRET revealed that DNA within the nucleosome remains fully wrapped for only 250 ms before it is unwrapped for 10-50 ms and then rapidly <b>rewrapped.</b> This implies that DNA {{does not need to}} be actively dissociated from the nucleosome but that there is a significant fraction of time during which it is fully accessible. Indeed, this can be extended to the observation that introducing a DNA-binding sequence within the nucleosome increases the accessibility of adjacent regions of DNA when bound. This propensity for DNA within the nucleosome to “breathe” is predicted to have important functional consequences for all DNA-binding proteins that operate in a chromatin environment.|$|R
