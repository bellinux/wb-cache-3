He annexed Timbuktu in 1468, after Islamic leaders of the town requested his assistance in overthrowing marauding Tuaregs who had taken the city following the decline of Mali. However, Ali met stark <b>resistance</b> <b>after</b> <b>setting</b> his eyes on the wealthy and renowned trading town of Djenné (also known as Jenne). After a persistent seven-year siege, he was able to forcefully incorporate it into his vast empire in 1473, but only after having starved its citizens into surrender.|$|E
50|$|Weight {{stripping}} a.k.a. Number Setting: Weight stripping is {{a technique}} used after failure with a normal resistance in certain exercises, particularly with easily adjustable machines, whereby the weight trainer or a partner gradually reduces the <b>resistance</b> <b>after</b> a full <b>set</b> is taken to failure. With each reduction in resistance, as many possible reps are completed and the resistance is then reduced again. This is continued until the resistance is approximately half the original resistance.|$|R

40|$|Murine {{fibrosarcoma}} cells (SSK) {{exhibit a}} transient cisplatin <b>resistance</b> <b>after</b> low-dose irradiation (5 x 2 Gy) in vitro and in vivo. When resistance is lost, {{it can be}} restored by a single drug exposure which, without preirradiation, does not generate cisplatin resistance in parental cells. There is no cross-resistance to radiation. Metallothioneins, which are associated with cisplatin <b>resistance</b> <b>after</b> high-dose irradiation (15 x 6 Gy), do not correlate with induction and loss of cisplatin <b>resistance</b> <b>after</b> low-dose irradiation. Since cisplatin survival curves are also monotonous when drug resistance diminishes, an adaptive response is more likely than a mutational event to underlie cisplatin-induced resistance. Drug resistance can be overcome by combined exposure to cisplatin {{in the presence of}} the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX). Under these conditions, cisplatin sensitivity is increased 2. 4 - to 2. 8 -fold in the resistant strains compared with only 1. 5 - to 1. 8 -fold in the parental cells. The cellular platinum content with and without IBMX treatment is not significantly different in sensitive and resistant cells. Loss of drug resistance correlates with a decrease in cisplatin sensitisation by IBMX. This suggests that cisplatin <b>resistance</b> <b>after</b> low-dose irradiation may be associated with alterations of the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway...|$|R
