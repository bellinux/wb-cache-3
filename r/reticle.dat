5|$|Most sights {{have either}} active or passive {{adjustments}} for the <b>reticle</b> brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions. A very dim <b>reticle</b> will help prevent loss of night vision in low-light conditions, while a brighter <b>reticle</b> will display more clearly in full sunlight.|$|E

5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected <b>reticle</b> system. Instead, a representative <b>reticle</b> is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E
50|$|In surveying, <b>reticles</b> are {{designed}} for specific uses. Levels and theodolites would have slightly different <b>reticles.</b> However, both may have features such as stadia marks to allow distance measurements.|$|R
50|$|Both wafers and <b>reticles</b> can {{be handled}} by SMIF pods in a {{semiconductor}} fabrication environment. Used in lithographic tools, <b>reticles</b> or photomasks contain the image that is exposed on a coated wafer in one processing step of a complete integrated semiconductor manufacturing cycle. Because <b>reticles</b> are linked so directly with wafer processing, they also require steps {{to protect them from}} contamination or from being the source of contamination in the litho tool.|$|R

5|$|P90 USG:The P90 USG (United States Government) {{model is}} similar to the {{standard}} P90, except the reflex sight housing is aluminium, and the sight has a revised <b>reticle.</b> The black <b>reticle</b> consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or <b>reticle</b> at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that <b>reticle.</b> The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a <b>reticle</b> image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated <b>reticle</b> image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the <b>reticle</b> move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the <b>reticle</b> image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or <b>reticle.</b> They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated <b>reticle</b> image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
40|$|For EUVL to be {{successful}} {{it is essential that}} <b>reticles</b> can be made without defects and that they can be cleaned without causing any damage. Contamination of <b>reticles</b> can be in two ways: particles due to handling can cause printable defects and carbon contamination due to residual hydrocarbons can cause change in CD and loss of throughput. We have shown in previous work that our Shielded Microwave Induced Remote Plasma (SMIRP) is excellent for cleaning EUV multilayer mirrors without any damage. In this presentation we show that SMIRP also can be used to clean EUVL <b>reticles...</b>|$|R

5|$|Many <b>reticle</b> {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight <b>reticle</b> is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime <b>reticle,</b> which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black <b>reticle.</b> The night <b>reticle</b> for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex sight housing.|$|E
5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming <b>reticle</b> that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming <b>reticle</b> on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the <b>reticle</b> movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E

50|$|In {{the open}} {{division}} one can have {{any number of}} many optical sights and bipods, {{and there is no}} size restriction on muzzle brakes. 1-4 or 1-6 scopes are popular in the Open division. Some use <b>reticles</b> with marked hold overs, while others prefer <b>reticles</b> with a simple dot and crosshair and choose to dial long range adjustments on the turrets instead.|$|R
50|$|The first {{suggestion}} for etched glass <b>reticles</b> {{was made by}} Philippe de La Hire in 1700. His method was based on engraving the lines on a glass plate with a diamond point. Many modern crosshairs are actually etched onto a thin plate of glass, which allows a far greater latitude in shapes. Etched glass <b>reticles</b> can have floating elements, which do not cross the reticle; circles and dots are common, and some types of glass <b>reticles</b> have complex sections designed for use in range estimation and bullet drop and drift compensation (see external ballistics). A potential disadvantage of glass <b>reticles</b> {{is that they are}} less durable than wire crosshairs, and the surface of the glass reflects some light (about 4% per surface on uncoated glass) lessening transmission through the scope, although this light loss is near zero if the glass is multicoated (coating being the norm for all modern high quality optical products).|$|R
5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In {{the same}} fashion as the P90 USG, this model has an {{aluminium}} reflex sight housing with a revised <b>reticle.</b> The black <b>reticle</b> consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a full, {{360-degree}} field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, {{and behind the}} dragon. Enemies come from all directions, varying in size and health, and also appear on an on-screen radar that monitors the dragon's surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming <b>reticle,</b> and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the <b>reticle</b> over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen {{require the use of}} the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.|$|E
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected <b>reticle</b> bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected <b>reticle</b> creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the <b>reticle</b> to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

The experiments for which EBL 2 is intended are: accelerated lifetime tests for EUV Mirrors; EUV <b>Reticles</b> and pellicles; and Materials used in EUV lithography.

EBL 2 is able to manipulate and to illuminate EUV <b>reticles</b> with scanner compatibility...|$|R
50|$|Several issues noted were reliability, {{specifically}} with intensifier tubes being damaged due to moisture. This problem was fully addressed in final production. It was also noted the mount designed {{to secure the}} AN/PVS-4 to the M60 machine gun was difficult to install and prone to loss of zero. The sight <b>reticles</b> for both the M16 rifle and M14 rifle required firing a minimum of 20 rounds to seat before the zeroing procedures could begin, leading to an excessive expenditure of ammunition. The sight <b>reticles</b> were subsequently modified, requiring only 2 rounds for seating purposes. Early <b>reticles</b> for the M16/M203 could not be zeroed for each weapon simultaneously. Rubber eye guard separation from the sight was a common problem that was addressed.|$|R

5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated <b>reticle</b> was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E
5|$|Identical to its {{predecessor}} however, {{the core of}} the gameplay is centred on the player's ability to make Robbit jump and shoot projectiles at enemies. Robbit can jump up to three times (as indicated by the new interface), allowing him to reach extreme heights in the game. As with the first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 introduced new in-game power ups and weapons such as a powerful laser beam, missiles and trip mines. In addition to the new weapons, the player can find and use the older weapons in form of fireworks to deal massive damage to enemies. Other weapons include cherry bombs, rockets and Roman candles. The player still has the ability to shoot low-powered projectiles where a target <b>reticle</b> is centred {{in the middle of the}} screen.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped <b>reticle</b> {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E

50|$|Telescopic sights {{come with}} a variety of {{different}} <b>reticles,</b> ranging from the traditional crosshairs to complex <b>reticles</b> designed to allow the shooter to estimate accurately the range to a target, to compensate for the bullet drop, and to compensate for the windage required due to crosswinds. A user can estimate the range to objects of known size, the size of objects at known distances, and even roughly compensate for both bullet drop and wind drifts at known ranges with a reticle-equipped scope.|$|R
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a <b>reticle</b> is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armor, travel to numerous planetary systems, and scan planets for mineral resources. These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that {{are found in the}} missions, providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others. Scanning requires the player to move a <b>reticle</b> over a planet and launch a probe when an oscilloscope warns of near resources. Additional upgrades, equipment, and nonessential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the <b>reticle</b> to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E

Analysis of the samples was performed with SEM/EDX and with SIMS-SPM to verify the complete removal of carbon from the bottom of the trench. Analysis showed that there are small traces of carbon still present on the samples. This can be contributed to contamination which has occurred during transport and storage or that the grown carbon has some edges which are higher due to localized high intensity in the focus of the e-beam...|$|R
