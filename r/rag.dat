In Victorian Britain <b>rags</b> were not only associated with the inadequate clothing of the poor, they were also viewed as a valuable commodity, widely collected for recycling into paper. This essay examines <b>rags</b> as simultaneously despised and precious objects, tracing the connections between Victorian accounts of poverty, the industrial recycling of <b>rags</b> into paper, and the redemption narratives created by Charles Dickens about rescued children. A supporter of <b>Ragged</b> Schools and champion of <b>rags</b> recycling, Dickens drew on the idea of the transformation of dirty <b>rags</b> into clean paper in his representations of <b>ragged</b> children. To him, the recycling of <b>rags</b> indicated the civilizing forces of modernity, and reading Dickens's representations of <b>ragged</b> children in this context reveals how cloth recycling became a paradigm for society's duties towards destitute children. This essay explains Dickens's juxtaposition of <b>ragged</b> children with references to rag-dealing in his novels; by this means he suggested that street children, like their <b>ragged</b> clothing, were capable of being purified and transformed into social usefulness...|$|R
