Nevertheless, many professionals still advise breastfeeding mothers to temporarily discontinue breastfeeding after contrast media imaging. Therefore, we performed this review to provide health professionals with basic knowledge and skills for appropriate use of contrast media. Methods A joint working group of the Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM), Italian Society of Paediatrics (SIP), Italian Society of Neonatology (SIN) and Task Force on Breastfeeding, Ministry of Health, Italy prepared a review of the relevant medical literature on the safety profile of contrast media for the nursing infant/child.

40|$|Background. The {{radioguided}} localization of occult breast lesions (ROLL) technique often utilizes iodinated {{radiographic contrast}} {{to assure that}} the local injection of (99 m) Tc-MAA corresponds to the location of the lesion under investigation. However, for this application, this contrast has several shortcomings. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the safety, effectiveness and technical feasibility of the use of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as <b>radiological</b> <b>contrast</b> and tissue marker in ROLL. Materials and methods. The safety assessment was performed by the acute toxicity study in Wistar rats (n = 50). The radiological analysis of breast tissue (n = 32) from patients undergoing reductive mammoplasty was used to verify the effectiveness of PDMS as <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> The technical feasibility was evaluated through the scintigraphic and histologic analysis.

MSK is a renal malformation characterized by cystic anomalies of precalyceal ducts, which is frequently associated with nephrocalcinosis and renal stones.

40|$|Abstract Background Anaphylactoid {{reactions}} to iodinated contrast media are relatively common and potentially life threatening. Opinion is divided {{as to the}} utility of medications for preventing these reactions. We performed a systematic review to assess regimes {{for the prevention of}} anaphylactoid {{reactions to}} iodinated contrast media. Methods Searches for studies were conducted in the Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL databases. Bibliographies of included studies and review articles were examined and experts were contacted. Randomised clinical trials that examined agents given prior to iodinated contrast material for the prevention of anaphylactoid reactions were included in the review. The validity of the included studies was examined using a component approach. Results Six studies met the inclusion criteria, but only one of these fulfilled all of the validity criteria. There were four studies that examined the use of H 1 antihistamines, each was used to prevent anaphylactoid reactions to ionic contrast. The random effects pooled relative risk demonstrated a significant reduction in the overall rate of anaphylactoid reactions (RR = 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 18 - 0. 9, p = 0. 027). There were insufficient studies to produce a pooled statistic for the use of corticosteroids, however regimes of steroids (methylprednisolone 32 mg) given at least six hours and again two hours prior to the administration of contrast suggested a reduction in the incidence of anaphylactoid reactions. Conclusion In conclusion, there are few high quality randomised clinical trials that have addressed the question of the optimal methods to prevent allergic type reactions to iodinated <b>radiological</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> Allowing for these limitations, the results suggest that H 1 antihistamines given immediately prior to the administration of ionic contrast may be useful in preventing reactions to ionic contrast and are suggestive of a protective effect of corticosteroids when given in two doses at least six hours prior and again two hours prior to the administration of contrast, both ionic and non-ionic. These agents should be considered for use in patients who are at high risk of an anaphylactoid reaction to contrast media and for who prophylactic therapy is considered necessary. Further research is needed before definitive recommendations can be made. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} : Iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> are {{frequently}} administered in ICU patients. Recent studies challenge {{the relevance of}} <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> toxicity in ICU patients and relate occurrence of acute kidney injury to baseline characteristics and severity of illness. Recent findings : Various findings in studies with kidney biomarkers indicate the causal relationship between <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> exposure and kidney damage. <b>Contrast</b> <b>media</b> exposure not only causes direct tubular damage and renal hypoperfusion but also initiates the formation of reactive oxygen species in its turn causing tissue damage. The route of administration determines the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury with a higher incidence when <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> are administered by intra-arterial route versus intravenous route. The impact of contrast-associated acute kidney injury on hospital length of stay, the need for renal replacement therapy and survival remains {{a matter of debate}} because of discrepancies between observational versus case-matched studies and limitations of the individual studies. Summary : There are diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms explaining the causal relationship between the administration of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> and the development of acute kidney injury.

40|$|Introduction: Commercially {{available}} iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> show similar {{molecular structure}} but significant different physico-chemical properties. The {{relevance of the}} viscosity of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> may be underestimated as a contributing factor for clinically relevant renal failure after application of those drugs. The aim of this preclinical study is to assess the role of viscosity and osmolarity of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> regarding their retention and perfusion time in kidney. Furthermore the expression of marker genes for renal damage and hypoxia was tested to evaluate a potential renal damage and hypoxia after application of iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> To a certain extent protein configuration has been explored for the early recognition of renal deficiencies. To evaluate the toxic potentials in renal cell-damage furthermore this assay examinates cytotoxical differences between iodinated monomer <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> and iodinated dimere <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> Material and methods: The retention time of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> after application of low-viscous, low-osmolar (Iopromide 300) and high-viscous, iso-osmolar (Iodixanol 320) <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> and the iodine concentration over time was determined using computer tomography (CT) and X-ray fluorescence analysis (RFA) in healthy Han-Wistar and renally impaired ZSF 1 -rats. The latter served {{as a model for}} age and diabetes-related renal damage. The expression of kidney injury molecule 1 (Kim- 1) and Heme Oxygenase I (HO- 1) was measured in healthy Han Wistar rats by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR). The protein syntheses with Multiplex ELISA was also tested on Han Wistar rats. Porcine tubule cells, LLC-PK 1, were subjected to <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> exposure followed by assessment of ATP and MTT tests. The perfusion time of the kidney after <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> application was determined using contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Results: CT and RFA in the kidneys of animals treated with Iodixanol revealed prolonged retention of iodine in the kidney as compared to animals treated with Iopromide. This difference was even more pronounced in renally impaired rats. 24 hours after Iodixanol treatment, significantly increased levels of Kim- 1 and HO- 1 transcript levels were observed compared to the saline and Iopromide treatment. When evaluating the proteins in the renal tissue {{that can be used for}} the early detection of renal deficiencies, for the dimeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> there have been found elevated values for some proteins in comparison to the values found in the proband animal group treated with monomeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> The MTT and ATP concentration show a concentration dependent decrease. Conclusion: A prolonged retention of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> in the kidney was observed after administration of high-viscous, iso-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> One possible explanation for this effect could be the high viscosity of high-viscous, iso-osmolar dimeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> and the lack of dilution by osmotic diuresis. This prolonged exposure is possibly associated with higher renal toxicity as indicated by the elevated expression of biomarkers for hypoxia and renal injury...|$|R

Method is a literature review based on scientific papers that compared iso-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> with low-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> The Result shows that the iso-osmolar contrast medium iodixanol was better for the kidneys of diabetics undergoing coronary angiography, and that the amount of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> plays a critical role in the appearance of CIN.

40|$|Iopamidol (Iopamiron 370) was {{examined}} {{for use in}} intravenous urography in 37 patients who previously developed adverse reactions to conventional ionic <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> or {{had a history of}} allergy. The patients were divided into three groups (group A 1 : 22 patients with previous adverse reactions to <b>contrast</b> <b>media,</b> but without history of allergy, group A 2 : 8 patients with previous adverse reactions to <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> and with history of allergy, group B: 7 patients with a history of allergy, but without experience of using <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> Adverse reactions to iopamidol were observed in 6 patients (one in group A 1, four in group A 2, one in group B) and there were no serious adverse reactions. In conclusion, iopamidol seems to be a safe contrast medium for the patients without history of allergy, but we should examine it carefully {{as in the case of}} conventional ionic <b>contrast</b> <b>media...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Discomfort {{characterized}} by pain and warmth are common adverse effects {{associated with the}} use of intra-arterial iodinated <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> (CM). The objective of this review was to pool patient-reported outcomes available from head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to compare the discomfort rates associated with iso-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> (IOCM; i. e., iodixanol) to those reported with various low-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> (LOCM).

40|$|Contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI) {{has been}} one of the leading causes for hospital-acquired AKI and is {{associated}} with independent risk for adverse clinical outcomes including morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to provide a brief summary of the studies that focus on nonpharmacological strategies to prevent CI-AKI, including routine identification of at-risk patients, use of appropriate hydration regimens, withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, selection of low-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> or isoosmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media,</b> and using the minimum volume of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> as possible. There is no need to schedule dialysis in relation to injection of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> or injection of contrast agent in relation to dialysis program.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a clinical image, course and state of anaphylactic shock manifested in uneasiness, nausea, instinct on vomiting, vomiting, contractions of intestines, red skin face, narrowing, hypotension, epileptic seizure in a thirty-year-old patient, which {{happened after the}} i. v. injection application of non-ionic iodic <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> (Iopromide; Ultravist 300 ® - Schering) at urography. The autors {{point to the fact}} that the application of non-ionic iodic <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> does not provide an absolute protection of patients. On the contrary, even these iodic <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> can lead to a serious reacton.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effect of oil-soluble <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> compared with water-soluble <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> after hysterosalpingography (HSG) in infertile couples. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and six nonrandomized controlled studies evaluating pregnancy rates after {{the use of}} oil- or water-soluble <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> during HSG. SETTING: Institute of Epidemiology and Health Services Research, Leeds, United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Four identified RCTs studied 800 patients and six nonrandomized studies comprised an additional 1, 806 patients, all experiencing primary or secondary infertility. INTERVENTION: Hysterosalpingography as part of infertility investigation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pregnancy rates after HSG. RESULTS: Pregnancy rates were significantly higher in the oil-soluble <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> group compared with the water-soluble <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> group in the RCTs. Inclusion of the six nonrandomized studies did not alter this conclusion. This apparent benefit was greatest for patients with unexplained infertility. CONCLUSIONS: Oil-soluble <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> have a therapeutic effect compared with water-soluble media and this effect is greatest for patients who have been diagnosed as having unexplained infertility. New techniques {{for the evaluation of}} tubal patency support the hypothesis that tubal "plugs" may be involved in proximal tubal blockage. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Pathophysiology of {{contrast}} medium–induced nephropathy. BackgroundContrast medium–induced nephropathy (CIN) {{is a well-known}} cause of acute renal failure, but the development of CIN remains poorly understood. A {{number of studies have}} been performed with the one aim, to shed some light onto the pathophysiology of CIN. These have led to manifold interpretations and sometimes contradicting conclusions. MethodsThis review critically surveys mechanisms believed to mediate CIN by highlighting the complex pathophysiologic entity, including altered rheologic properties, perturbation of renal hemodynamics, regional hypoxia, auto- and paracrine factors [adenosine, endothelin, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) ], and direct cytotoxic effects. Moreover, the importance of physicochemical properties of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> are made clear. ResultsThe more recently developed iso-osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> are dimers, not monomers as the widely used nonionic low osmolar <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> The dimers have physicochemical features different from other <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> which may be of clinical importance, not only with respect to osmolality. The viscosity of the commercially available dimers is considerably higher than blood. ConclusionMany experimental studies provide evidence for a greater perturbation in renal functions by dimeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> in comparison to nonionic monomeric <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> Clinical trials have yielded conflicting results...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{test the}} effects of various <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> on the {{pulmonary}} surfactant system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by lung lavage, {{the effects of}} surfactant suspended in saline were compared with surfactant suspended in the <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> Visipaque, Gastrografin, Omnipaque, Telebrix M, Telebrix and Hexabrix, to establish their influence on oxygenation and lung mechanics. RESULTS: After the induction of ARDS, surfactant instillation improved oxygenation, total lung capacity (TLC(35)), volume at 5 cm H(2) O end-expiration (V(5)) and Gruenwald index. The effects of Visipaque and Gastrografin were comparable with those of surfactant alone from 90 min onwards and at 120 min, respectively. Surfactant suspended in the other <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> resulted in significantly lower values in the above-mentioned parameters. Surface tension was lowest in surfactant suspended in saline alone. Surfactant suspended in Visipaque and Gastrografin had lower surface tension compared with surfactant suspended in the other <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> CONCLUSION: The ionic and non-ionic <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> used in this study, cause an impairment of the physico-chemical behaviour of exogenous surfactant. Therefore, these <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> cannot be regarded as safe in case of accidental exposur...|$|R
30|$|<b>Contrast</b> <b>media</b> are {{currently}} used for imaging {{at least one}} to 70 million times {{per year in the}} United States (Christiansen 2005). Computed tomography (CT) examination with administration of <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> causes a risk of developing adverse reactions to the <b>contrast</b> <b>media.</b> Compared with the use of ionic <b>contrast</b> <b>media,</b> nonionic low osmolality <b>contrast</b> <b>media</b> (LOCMs) have been associated with a reduced overall prevalence of adverse reactions (Grant and Camamo 1997; Jacobs et al. 1998). However, adverse reactions due to nonionic LOCMs remain an important cause of admissions to the emergency room (ER). Furthermore, the lower incidence of adverse reactions resulted in fewer opportunities to develop and maintain these necessary skills (Segal and Bush 2011). In the present study, we evaluated the characteristics of patients transferred from the CT room to the ER with moderate or severe adverse reactions due to nonionic LOCMs and evaluated the risk factors for severe adverse reactions.|$|R
