2500|$|Standards of sportsmanship differ. In cricket, the {{standard}} of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase [...] "It's just not cricket" [...] was coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life. In {{the last few decades}} though, top-level cricket has become increasingly fast-paced and competitive, increasing the use of appealing and sledging, although players are still expected to abide by the umpires' <b>rulings</b> <b>without</b> <b>argument,</b> {{and for the most part}} they do. Even in the modern game fielders are known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit, despite what could have been a spectacular save (though they may well be found out by the TV umpire anyway) and also signal if they did not take a catch even if it appeared that they did. In addition, many cricket batsmen [...] "walk" [...] when they think they are out, even if the umpire does not declare them out. This is considered a very high level of sportsmanship, as a batsman might easily take advantage of incorrect umpiring decisions; but with the introduction of the decision review system this has become more difficult (in games when the system is in use). The [...] "Spirit of Cricket" [...] was added as a preamble to the Laws in 2000, declaring that [...] "Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it should be played not only within its Laws but also within the Spirit of the Game. Any action which is seen to abuse this Spirit causes injury to the game itself".|$|R

The environment variable PWD (in Unix/Linux shells) or CD (in DOS/Windows shells) is also set for use in scripts, so that one need not start an external program. Microsoft Windows file shortcuts have the ability to store the working directory.|$|R

Additionally, Tiberius's treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as Asinius Gallus.|$|R
