50|$|Law {{enforcement}} and legislation in all countries were very slow {{to react to}} the appearance of <b>rogue</b> security <b>software</b> even though it simply uses new technical means to carry out mainly old and well-established kinds of crimes. In contrast, several private initiatives providing discussion forums and lists of dangerous products were founded soon after the appearance of the first <b>rogue</b> security <b>software.</b> Some reputable vendors also began to provide lists of <b>rogue</b> security <b>software,</b> for example Kaspersky.

5000|$|RISC OS Six brought portability, {{stability}} and internal structure improvements, including full 26/32-bit neutrality. It is now highly modularised, with legacy and hardware specific features abstracted, and other code separated for easier future maintenance and development.

Legacy components, like the VIDC driver, and obsolete functionality for the BBC Micro have been abstracted too.

40|$|Traditionally, {{cryptography}} and its {{applications are}} defensive in nature, and provide privacy, authentication, and security to users. In this paper we present {{the idea of}} Cryptovirology which employs a twist on cryptography, showing that {{it can also be}} used o ensively. By being o ensive we mean that {{it can be used to}} mount extortion based attacks that cause loss of access to information, loss of con dentiality, and information leakage, tasks which cryptography typically prevents. In this paper we analyze potential threats and attacks that rogue use of cryptography can cause when combined with <b>rogue</b> <b>software</b> (viruses, Trojan horses), and demonstrate them experimentally by presenting an implementation of a cryptovirus that we have tested (we took careful precautions in the process to insure that the virus remained contained). Public-key cryptography is essential to the attacks that we demonstrate (which we call attacks&quot;). We also suggest countermeasures and mechanisms to cope with and prevent such attacks. These attacks have implications on how the use of cryptographic tools should be managed and audited in general purpose computing environments, and imply that access to cryptographic tools should be well controlled. The experimental virus demonstrates how cryptographic packages can be condensed into a small space, which mayhave independent applications (e. g., cryptographic module design in small mobile devices). ...|$|E

40|$|MathType (current version 6. 6) is a {{third-party}} software package for typesetting and editing complex mathematical equations and expressions. It is sold and distributed by Design Science, Inc. headquartered in Long Beach, California. It sells for about $ 100 ($ 60 academic), and is offered free as a 30 -day trial. It is a macro-driven package {{that serves as}} an “add-on” to Microsoft Word or other editing programs. MathType has significant compatibility issues, however, with Adobe Acrobat; and generating PDF files from documents containing MathType elements is far from straightforward. We recently encountered a dissertation that had used MathType to set 100 + mathematical expressions in an MS Word file, and all attempts to generate a PDF file from the Word document were unsuccessful. Users may wish to refer to Design Science’s TechNote # 69 for further information, although the solutions proposed there did not work for this user. These included such radical steps as deleting and replacing system fonts, enabling macros, etc. Master’s and doctoral candidates who intend to submit a PDF file of their thesis or dissertation (as is required) should avoid using MathType software unless they are prepared (and able) to generate a proper and reliable PDF file on their own. I cannot (and will not attempt to) make a usable PDF file from Word documents with MathType elements. We have not experienced problems with files using MS Word’s own equation editor or with files typeset using τεκ or LAτεκ. If you have doubts or issues or concerns about other packages, I am happy to test any sample files before you go too far down any road. It is tragic to come up against the deposit deadline and find that some <b>rogue</b> <b>software</b> package is creating problems for everyone. Good luck, and happy “mathing. ...|$|E
