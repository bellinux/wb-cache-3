40|$|This paper {{deals with}} road {{extraction}} in suburban areas from high resolution aerial images. The extraction results {{are intended to}} be used for updating a road database. The road extraction algorithm follows a region-based approach in which the image is first segmented using the normalized cuts algorithm with colour and edge criteria. Then, the initial segments are grouped to larger segments in order to overcome the oversegmentation which {{is a result of the}} first step. The segments are subsequently evaluated by shape criteria in order to extract <b>road</b> <b>parts.</b> Large segments that contain several roads are shaped irregularly; therefore, large segments are split prior to the <b>road</b> <b>part</b> extraction. The splitting is based on the skeleton of the segment. After the <b>road</b> <b>part</b> extraction, most <b>roads</b> in the image are covered by one extracted <b>road</b> <b>part.</b> However, some <b>roads</b> are covered by several <b>road</b> <b>parts</b> with gaps between them. In order to combine these <b>road</b> <b>parts</b> to one <b>road,</b> neighbouring <b>road</b> <b>parts</b> are connected if they have a similar main direction and a relatively high continuation smoothness. Results for some test images show that the approach is suitable for the extraction of roads in suburban images. 1...|$|R
