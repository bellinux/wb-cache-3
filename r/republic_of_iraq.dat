[...] "I do not respond to this so-called court, with all due respect to its people, and I retain my constitutional right as the president of Iraq", Saddam declared. He added, [...] "Neither do I recognize the body that has designated and authorized you, nor the aggression because all that has been built on false basis is false." [...] When the judge asked for his name, Saddam refused, stating [...] "I am the president of the Iraq". He returned the question, asking Kurdish judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin, [...] "Who are you?
