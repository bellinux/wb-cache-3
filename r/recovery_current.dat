This help to prevent the device from conducting large negative current, which in turn reduce its reverse recovery charge and reverse recovery time. Results obtained from experiments with insulated gate bipolar transistor showed a significant reduction in the time where current falls to zero when opposing current was injected into the device during its turn-off transient. Further simulation results from numerical modeling showed that the injected opposing current temporary increase recombination in the device and therefore reduce the extracted excess carriers that stored within the device.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} p-n diode and the Schottky diode is the reverse recovery time (trr), when the diode switches from the conducting to the non-conducting state. In a p-n diode, the reverse recovery time {{can be in the}} order of several microseconds to less than 100 ns for fast diodes. Schottky diodes do not have a recovery time, as there is nothing to recover from (i.e., there is no charge carrier depletion region at the junction). The switching time is ~100 ps for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes. With p-n-junction switching, there is also a reverse <b>recovery</b> <b>current,</b> which in high-power semiconductors brings increased EMI noise. With Schottky diodes, switching is essentially [...] "instantaneous" [...] with only a slight capacitive loading, which is much less of a concern.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>recovery</b> <b>current</b> is an {{important}} parameter that influences {{the performance of the}} DC power supply based on the power CT in a high voltage active electronic current transformer. It is closely related to the saturation state of the core of the transformer, which harvests energy from the magnetic field generated by the current through the high voltage power line. The <b>recovery</b> <b>current</b> of three types of core material are systematically discussed in terms of their characteristics, which are the Silicon Steel, the Nanocrystalline Alloy, and the Fe-based Amorphous. The closed core of the Nanocrystalline Alloy and Fe-based Amorphous has the feature of low <b>recovery</b> <b>current.</b> Both of them can carry out a lower <b>recovery</b> <b>current</b> within 0. 5 A in the DC power supply; The gapped core of the Silicon Steel is able to work at the highest <b>recovery</b> <b>current</b> among the three types of cores in the same dimension, which benefits the higher input current of the DC power supply, beyond 2000 A. Resultant data of analysis provides a prospective reference for design of the DC power supply {{with a wide range of}} input current by application of the combined cores...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{investigates the}} relationship between high frequency oscillations created in power modules and their radio frequency noise emission. It is shown that high frequency oscillations with slew rates comparable or higher than the ones generated by the used semiconductors leads to significant higher noise emission in the radio frequency range. During turn on of the IGBT a high frequency oscillation is created between the stray inductances of the DC-Link and the reverse capacitances of the blocking freewheeling diodes. The DC-Link stray inductances are charged by the reverse <b>recovery</b> <b>current</b> of the freewheeling diode. When the reverse <b>recovery</b> <b>current</b> peak is passed the diode begins to block and the energy stored in the inductances oscillates to the reverse capacitance of the diode. The quality of the oscillation is mainly influenced by the tailing of the diodes reverse <b>recovery</b> <b>current.</b> At the investigated three phase, 600 V, 200 A power module the observed t urn on resonance frequency is 33 MHz. The crucial characteristic of this phenomenon is that the noise emission is not only higher at the resonance but for all frequency above, too. By reducing the module inductances the resonances are shifted to higher frequencies but measurements show that the emitted spectrum stays the same. To reduce the module inductances do not solve the problem. The {{results of the investigation}} enable the design of power modules with reduced radiated emissions...|$|E
