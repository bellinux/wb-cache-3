50|$|The engine, a liquid-cooled Ford Mercury V8 3.9 litres 95 hp, made {{a maximum}} speed of about 75 km/h possible. There were three forward gears and one reverse. An {{auxiliary}} gearbox, placed behind the engine, functioned as <b>reversing</b> <b>device</b> and {{allowed for the}} dual drive capacity: the rear driver could use the same gears as the main driver. However, the maximum speed in the reverse direction was, for safety reasons and because the back drive system had been deliberately made less robust to save weight, indicated by the manufacturer as 50 km/h. In both cases steering was via the front wheels, with a minimum turning radius of 11.15 m. Both drivers had {{a full set of}} standard steering controls, even with separate odometers. Each driver had a rectangular hatch in front of him, that could hinge upwards to provide an unimpeded view of the road; due to the short nose there were no dead angles in his field of vision. When closed the outside could still be seen via a vision slit, protected by armoured glass and fully closable through a small sliding armour plate. The environment could then be better observed by means of five prismatic blocks placed below the raised circular top hatch. The blocks could be quickly replaced when damaged. The front of the main compartment also had small side hatches, likewise fitted with vision slits; the back driver had such a small hatch available within the larger hatch at his right. In darkness vision could be improved by two large headlamps on both the front and the back of the vehicle.|$|E

We consider programming a dispersive filter near atomic resonance in rare earth ion doped crystals, which leads to unprecedented high values of dispersive power. This filter is used in an approximate imaging scheme, combining a single time lens and a single dispersive section and operating as a time <b>reversing</b> <b>device,</b> with potential applications in radio-frequency signal processing. This scheme {{is closely related to}} three-pulse photon echo with chirped pulses but the connection with temporal imaging and dispersive filtering emphasizes new features.

40|$|Reverse {{shoulder}} arthroplasty {{is being}} used more frequently to treat irreparable rotator cuff tears {{in the presence of}} glenohumeral arthritis and instability. To date, however, design features and functions of reverse shoulder arthroplasty, which may be associated with subluxation and dislocation of these implants, have been poorly understood. We asked: (1) what is the hierarchy of importance of joint compressive force, prosthetic socket depth, and glenosphere size in relation to stability, and (2) is this hierarchy defined by underlying and theoretically predictable joint contact characteristics? We examined the intrinsic stability in terms of the force required to dislocate the humerosocket from the glenosphere of eight commercially available <b>reverse</b> shoulder arthroplasty <b>devices.</b> The hierarchy of factors was led by compressive force followed by socket depth; glenosphere size played a much lesser role in stability of the <b>reverse</b> shoulder arthroplasty <b>device.</b> Similar results were predicted by a mathematical model, suggesting the stability was determined primarily by compressive forces generated by muscles...|$|R

In this procedure the interface recombination velocity is used as fitting parameter. The model verification shows an accurate modeling of the leakage current at full depletion in combination with a back-gate potential dependence.
