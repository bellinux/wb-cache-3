For all powder the large density improvement by <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> was seen. The density increment by <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> greatly depended on the density namely residual cavities before <b>shear</b> <b>loading.</b> Then the density increment by <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> was large for high hardness powder on 700 MPa. However, on 300 MPa the density increment for stainless powder was smaller than for titanium powder although the density before <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> was lowest. This was because the plastic deformation of high hardness powder was not easily promoted even by <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> in low compression pressure.

To {{investigate}} axial rotational {{stability of the}} thoracic spine under dorsal and ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Idiopathic scoliosis is a condition restricted exclusively to humans. An important difference between humans and other vertebrates {{is the fact that}} humans ambulate in a fully erect position. It has been demonstrated that certain parts of the human spine, more specifically the dorsally inclined lower thoracic and high lumbar parts, are subject to dorsally directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> It has been hypothesized that these dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> reduce the rotational stability of the spine, thereby increasing the risk to initiate idiopathic scoliosis. METHODS. Fourteen porcine and 14 human thoracic functional spinal units (FSUs) with intact costotransverse and costovertebral articulations were used for biomechanical testing. In both dorsal and ventral directions, <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> were applied to the upper vertebra of the FSU in the midsagittal plane (centrally), and at 1 cm to the right and to the left (eccentrically), resulting in a rotary moment. Vertebral rotation was measured at 3 incremental loads by an automated optoelectronic 3 -dimensional (3 D) movement registration system. RESULTS. The results of this study showed that eccentrically applied <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> induce vertebral rotation in human as well as in porcine spinal segments. At the mid-thoracic and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> CONCLUSION. These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I 2, PGI 2) has {{a variety}} of functions, {{including}} inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, vasodilation, and antiplatelet aggregation. PGI 2 production in endothelial cells has been reported to increase biphasically after <b>shear</b> <b>loading,</b> but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. To clarify the mechanism for the second phase of PGI 2 upregulation, we examined the gene expression of the enzymes involved in PGI 2 production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after shear-stress (24 dyne/cm 2) loading. The production of 6 -keto-PGF 1 a, a stable metabolite of PGI 2, increased time-dependently under shear stress. The arachidonic acid liberation from membrane phospholipids in HUVECs after 12 hours of <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> was increased significantly compared with the static condition. No change was observed for cytosolic phospholipase A 2 expression, as detected by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 mRNA increased after 1 hour of <b>shear</b> <b>loading,</b> and the increase lasted for 12 hours, the longest time tested, whereas COX- 2 mRNA increased after 1 hour of <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> and peaked at 6 hours.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{years of}} dedicated {{research into the}} origin of idiopathic scoliosis, the pathogenesis of this classic orthopaedic disorder has so far remained elusive. A striking feature of idiopathic scoliosis {{is the fact that}} it does not occur in vertebrates other than humans, despite many similarities in the basic architecture of the vertebral column across the species. From recent work by Castelein et al, it was demonstrated that the fully erect posture, which is unique to humans, significantly alters spinal loading conditions. It was shown that the backward inclined or 'declive' segments of the human spine are subject to dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> These dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> are an important distinction between the human spine and the spine of all other vertebrates. In this thesis, it was postulated that excessive dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> during the period of rapid growth, could lead to rotational instability of the declive segments of the spine. If progressive, these dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> not only reduce rotational stability, but also can enhance a slight preexistent vertebral rotation. 1. In a biomechanical in vitro study on porcine and human spinal segments, we showed that at the mid and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> We believe that these dorsally directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> can, under critical circumstances during growth, introduce vertebral rotation, whereas ventrally directed loads counteract rotation. 2. The normal, nonscoliotic human spine shows a preexistent pattern of rotation in the transverse plane. The thoracic vertebrae are predominantly rotated to the right side, similar to what is seen in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. We believe that if the spine starts to decompensate into scoliosis, it seems logical that this built-in rotational pattern will be followed. 3. In neuromuscular scoliosis, it was demonstrated that despite the difference in origin, curve patterns in neuromuscular disease show many similarities with those in idiopathic scoliosis, such as a strong prevalence of right convex thoracic curves. We concluded that preexistent rotation, rather than muscle imbalance, also plays an important role in directing subsequent rotation in neuromuscular disease, as it does in idiopathic scoliosis. 4. We also showed the existence of a predominant rotation of the thoracic vertebrae to the right side in the quadruped spine, similar to what was found in humans. It was concluded that preexistent rotation can be considered as a physiological process in the normal development of the spine, independent of the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis. 5. Finally, we demonstrated that the normal, nonscoliotic spine of humans with a complete mirror image reversal of the internal body organs (situs inversus totalis) shows a preexistent pattern of vertebral rotation opposite to what is seen in humans with normal organ anatomy. It was concluded that the asymmetrical anatomy of the thoracic organs is likely to play an important role in the development of this preexistent rotational tendency...|$|R

However, meniscal repair constructs are also exposed to shear forces parallel to the circumferential meniscal fibers during healing, particularly in the midportion of the meniscus. HYPOTHESIS: Material properties of meniscal repair devices cannot be extrapolated from tensile to <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> scenarios. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: In 84 harvested and isolated bovine lateral menisci following removal of adjacent soft tissue, a standardized vertical lesion was set followed by repair using all-inside flexible (FasT-Fix, FasT-Fix AB, RapidLoc) and rigid (Meniscus Screw, Meniscus Arrow) meniscal repair devices. Vertical and horizontal 2. 0 Ethibond sutures were used as controls. The repaired meniscal construct was tested in a tensile (parallel to the axis of the tested repair device) and <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> scenario (perpendicular to the axis of the tested repair device) at 5 mm/min and 37 degrees C environmental temperature. Maximum load to failure, stiffness, and failure mode were recorded. RESULTS: The absolute load to failure values of each repair device in the shear scenario were only marginally different from the tensile load scenario. However, the stiffness of several tested devices was markedly reduced in the shear scenario. In both scenarios, large differences of the load to failure and the stiffness between the implant types up to 5 -fold were found (P <. 05). The failure mode of several all-inside flexible repair devices was different in the <b>shear</b> versus tensile <b>load</b> scenario, while the failure mode of the rigid systems was similar in both scenarios. CONCLUSION: All-inside meniscal repair devices exposed to <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> scenarios have comparable maximum loads to failures as tensile load scenarios.

40|$|The {{design is}} {{described}} and test of two large (36 in. x 47 in.) graphite/epoxy sandwich shear webs. One sandwich web {{was designed to}} exhibit strength failure of the facings at a <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> of 7638 lbs/in., which is a characteristic loading for the space shuttle orbiter main engine thrust beam structure. The second sandwich web was designed to exhibit general instability failure at a <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> of 5000 lbs/in., to identify problem areas of stability critical sandwich webs and to assess the adequacy of contemporary analysis techniques...|$|R
