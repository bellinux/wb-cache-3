5|$|Leaving Prussia, Pulaski {{sought refuge}} in France, where he unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to join the}} French Army. In 1773, his opponents in Poland accused him of attempted <b>regicide,</b> and proceedings began at the Sejm Court on June 7.|$|E
5|$|James Temple (1606–1680) was a puritan and English Civil War {{soldier who}} was convicted of the <b>regicide</b> of Charles I. Born in Rochester, Kent, to a well-connected gentry family, he was the second of two sons of Sir Alexander Temple, {{although}} his elder brother died in 1627. As a child, Temple moved with his father from Rochester to Chadwell St Mary in Essex and then to Etchingham in Sussex, where he settled.|$|E
5|$|Lady Macbeth is {{a leading}} {{character}} in William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth (c.1603–1607). The wife of the play's tragic hero, Macbeth (a Scottish nobleman), Lady Macbeth goads her husband into committing <b>regicide,</b> after which she becomes queen of Scotland. Later, however, she suffers pangs of guilt for her part in the crime, which drives her to sleepwalk. She dies off-stage in the last act, an apparent suicide.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>regicides,</b> such as Richard Ingoldsby were pardoned, while {{a further}} {{nineteen}} served life imprisonment. The {{bodies of the}} <b>regicides</b> Cromwell, Bradshaw and Ireton which had been buried in Westminster Abbey were disinterred and hanged, drawn and quartered in posthumous executions. In 1662, three more <b>regicides</b> John Okey, John Barkstead and Miles Corbet were also hanged, drawn and quartered. The officers of the court that tried Charles I, those who prosecuted him and those who signed his death warrant, have been known ever since the restoration as <b>regicides.</b>|$|R
50|$|To the {{south-southwest}} can be {{seen the}} undulating forests of West Rock Ridge State Park, site of the <b>Regicides</b> Trail. At its southwest extremity, the QT connects with the <b>Regicides</b> Trail, along the West Rock Ridge, where it passes Judges' Cave.|$|R
50|$|<b>Regicides</b> Trail is a Blue-Blazed hiking trail, about 7 miles (11 km) long, roughly {{following}} {{the edge of}} a diabase, or traprock, cliff northwest of New Haven, Connecticut. It is named for two <b>regicides,</b> Edward Whalley and his son-in-law William Goffe, who signed the death warrant of King Charles I of England. Upon the restoration of Charles II to the throne and the persecution of the <b>regicides,</b> the pair hid in Judges Cave near {{the south end of the}} trail in 1660.|$|R
5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the <b>regicide</b> mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.|$|E
5|$|The county {{magistrate}} and commandery administrator {{were the}} official court judges {{of the county}} and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary; it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first {{would be the first}} to judge him or her. If a commandery-level court case could not be resolved, the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and <b>regicide</b> in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{physician}} {{recommended a}} program of amusements. A member of the court suggested that Charles surprise Isabeau and the other ladies by joining a group of courtiers who would disguise themselves as wild men and invade the masquerade celebrating the remarriage of Isabeau's lady-in-waiting, Catherine de Fastaverin. This {{came to be known}} as the Bal des Ardents. Charles was almost killed and four of the dancers burned to death, when a spark from a torch brought by Orléans lit one of the dancer's costumes. The disaster undermined confidence in Charles' capacity to rule. Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted <b>regicide</b> and sorcery, into offering penance for the event.|$|E

5|$|Temple gained {{military}} {{experience as a}} member of the Duke of Buckingham's expedition to the Isle of Ré in 1627. As a puritan, he joined the Parliamentary army at the outbreak of the Civil War and fought at the Battle of Edgehill. He rose to become a colonel and commanded Tilbury Fort, an important defensive position on the approach to London by river. He was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Bramber in September 1645 to replace an ejected Royalist. He sided with the army in opposing any compromise with the King, and was appointed as a judge at the trial of King Charles I of England. Temple attended most of the court sessions and was the 28th (of 59) to sign the King's death warrant. After the restoration of Charles II, he was convicted of <b>regicide,</b> but avoided execution and was imprisoned on Jersey, where he died.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{returned}} to Parliament with {{the recall of}} the Rump and Long Parliaments by General Monck, but following the Restoration in 1660, he was excluded from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, because of {{his role in the}} trial and execution of Charles I. He was captured in Warwickshire while trying to travel to Ireland, under his first wife's maiden name of Busbridge. He was held in the Tower of London before being tried as a <b>regicide.</b> He tried to avoid the death penalty by saying that he had only acted as a judge in Charles I's trial in order to give information to the Royalists. He went on to claim that he had tried to prevent the King's execution, begging Oliver Cromwell to spare him. He did avoid execution and was sentenced to life imprisonment. As a result of security concerns, a number of regicides, including Temple were sent to Jersey in the Channel Islands. Initially he was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil, and subsequently in Elizabeth Castle, where he is reported to have died on 17 February 1680.|$|E
5|$|The Bal des Ardents (Ball of the Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (Ball of the Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted <b>regicide</b> and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E

5|$|As the Scions mourn their fallen comrade, Aymeric parleys for aid in Ishgard's {{defense against}} Nidhogg's forces. Minfilia and Alphinaud reluctantly pledge {{the support of}} the Scions and Crystal Braves, though the other Grand Company leaders decline to provide assistance, citing {{domestic}} troubles and remembering Ishgard's reticence during the three Garlean invasions. The adventurer leads a band of volunteers at the Steps of Faith, Ishgard's main bridge. They manage to repel the attack and a victory celebration is held at Ul'dah with the hopes of pressuring Ishgard to rejoin the Alliance. At the banquet, Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo privately discloses to the Warrior of Light that she plans to dissolve the monarchy in order to erode the power of the Syndicate which is the source of much of Ul'dah's corruption. However, the sultana's wine is poisoned and Teledji Adeledji bursts in to accuse the player of <b>regicide</b> just as Nanamo takes her last breath. Adeledji brings the adventurer forward to the banquet with his charges and denounces Raubahn for his negligence. Enraged, Raubahn murders Adeledji but Lolorito, another scheming Syndicate member, takes this as proof of Raubahn's guilt and has him arrested. The Crystal Braves are revealed to be in the pay of Lolorito and attempt to apprehend the fleeing Scions who are taken out one by one. Only a humbled Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light manage to escape with the help of Raubahn's son Pipin Tarupin. Cid takes them to Coerthas where the grateful Ishgardians grant them asylum from the Syndicate's pursuers.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of Royton is linked closely with what was then its manor house, Royton Hall, which was {{inhabited}} by the Byron family for over 350years. During that period the Byrons' involvement in regional and national affairs added prestige to what was otherwise an obscure and rural township. John de Byron was {{a witness to the}} charter of incorporation of 1301, which elevated the township of Manchester to the status of a borough. A descendant of John—John Byron—served as High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1572, and was knighted by Elizabeth I in 1579. John served as Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire {{at the time of the}} Spanish Armada, and sourced infantry from Royton towards the English military. His son, also called John, fought during the English Civil War on the side of the Cavaliers. His actions led to making him John Byron, 1st Baron Byron of Rochdale by way of a peerage granted by King Charles I. Following the <b>regicide</b> of Charles I, and the rise of Cromwellian England, Baron Byron's possessions, including his lands in Royton, were confiscated. Royton Hall was then purchased by Thomas Percival, a wealthy linen manufacturer whose descendants continued to occupy the hall until around 1814. The hall was then inherited by the Radcliffe Baronets.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} Ívarr's {{possible}} collusion with Haraldr Guðrøðarson, {{the slaying of}} Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson may be evidence that the continuing strife between the rival branches descended from the half-brothers, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson and Óláfr, continued well into the mid thirteenth century. In fact, the killing is the last recorded example of <b>regicide</b> in the Norse-Gaelic realm, and may partly evidence the Europeanisation of the peripheral regions of the British Isles during the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries. As it turned out, the reign of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's successor was short-lived, since Haraldr Guðrøðarson was recalled to Norway in 1250, for having unjustly seized the kingship. Once in Norway, the latter was detained from returning to the Isles, and is not heard of again. Within two years, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's brother, Magnús, was installed in the kingship. The latter reigned {{until his death in}} 1265, and was the last member of the Crovan dynasty to rule as king in the Isles. An after-effect of the inter-dynastic warring within the Crovan dynasty was the partitioning of the kingdom between rival factions. For example, from about 1187 to 1226, and for a brief period in 1229, the kingdom was divided between the half-brothers; and for a brief period in 1230/1231 it was divided between Óláfr and his nephew, Guðrøðr Rögnvaldsson. Although Haraldr Óláfsson appears to have reigned over a united kingdom, the years between his death and the installation of Magnús in 1252 is a murky period indeed, and {{it is possible that the}} kingdom was divided between rival factions during this brief span of years. Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was evidently survived by a daughter, Maria. In 1305, a grandson of this woman pursued a claim to Mann.|$|E
