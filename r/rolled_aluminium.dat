A probability distribution of the profile is derived under the normal approximation. The parameters of the distribution are estimated by the maximum likelihood method. Next, the derived probability distribution is compared with the real observations and a goodness of fit test is carried out. It shows that the derived distribution fits reasonably well. Finally, a large sample distribution of the profile is also derived.

40|$|International audienceFormability {{of metals}} {{depends on the}} crystallographic texture {{produced}} during thermo-mechanical processing. The crystallographic orientation of the deformed grains results from the deformation path applied. Asymmetric rolling is a new process {{which is expected to}} improve the formability of <b>rolled</b> <b>aluminium</b> sheets by introducing intense shear deformation and consequently shear texture. The asymmetric rolling is applied to aluminium alloy AA 6016 with roll diameters ratio of 1. 5. Both single grain and grain interaction models are employed to investigate the evolution of texture during conventional and asymmetric rolling processes. The superior planar and normal anisotropy values of asymmetrically rolled and annealed sheet over the conventionally produced one are interpreted in terms of differences in the deformed microstructures ensuing rolling and recrystallization textures...|$|E

40|$|A {{tessellation}} {{which is}} capable of producing rough boundaries is proposed. Some properties of the proposed tessellation are also described. Key words: tessellation, stochastic growth, roughness 1. Introduction The work described below is motivated by complex images such as that in Fig. 1, which displays grains in <b>rolled</b> <b>aluminium,</b> viewed through polarized light. Statistical analysis of grain characteristics (eg. size, shape) first requires segmentation of the grains. In order to compare quantitatively the performance of different segmentation techniques, {{it is useful to}} develop and analyse models which mimic the important characteristics of real images, such as that in Fig. 1. In this paper, we describe a tessellation which attempts to mimic those shape characteristics. One observation about the grains is that they have rough boundaries. Therefore common tessellations such as the Voronoi, Delaunay and Poisson line tessellations (see [9]) are inappropriate for our purpose, as they h [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Fracture {{behaviour}} {{under different}} stress states of four heats of hot rolled {{low pressure gas}} (LPG) grade steel and three 1 mm thick cold <b>rolled</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys (Al-Cu-Mg, AI-Mg and AI-Mn) is compared. Dimple fracture was present in all four materials but the dimples were larger and of more uniform size in LPG steel compared with those present in the Al-alloys. Depending on the relative strength of pearlite and pearlite-matrix interface, failure in LPG steel was either transgranular or ductile intergranular. In the Al-alloys, particle-matrix decohesion was always responsible for dimple formation and transgranular fracture. In the Al-Cu-Mg and AI-Mg alloys a bimodal dimple size distribution, traceable to precipitates of two different sizes, was present but in the AI-Mn alloy the dimple size was larger and of nearly the same size. The results are {{explained in terms of}} composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys. (C) 2001...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a highly deformed layer at the surface of <b>rolled</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloy sheet results from shear deformation during rolling.

(2, 4 - 5) This deformed layer also has a detrimental effect on other types of localised corrosion.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the 12 th International ESAFORM Conference on Material Forming, Twente, The Netherlands, April 27 - 29 2009, and published in the Proceedings. The RAP process (Recrystallisation And Partial melting) is a reheating route used to give shear-thinning and thixotropic behaviour to a billet of semi-solid material. This process uses the recrystallisation phenomenon to obtain globular solid grains surrounded by a liquid matrix. Recrystallisation of <b>rolled</b> 7075 <b>aluminium</b> alloys in the T 6 condition is difficult because dispersoid particles pin the grain boundaries. Here we examine with Electron Backscattered Diffraction the presence of intermetallic phases in the structure after reheating to various temperatures in the semi-solid range and quenching. The presence of these particles could explain some of the microstructural behaviour at semisolid temperatures. In addition, EBSD is used to examine whether recrystallisation has occurred...|$|R
