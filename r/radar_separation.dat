5000|$|Procedural {{separation}} is separation {{based upon the}} position of the aircraft, based upon reports made by the pilots over the radio. It therefore does not necessarily require the use of radar to provide air traffic control using procedural separation minima. In procedural control, any period during which two aircraft are not vertically separated is said to be [...] "level change". In some cases, procedural separation minima are provided for use with radar assistance, however {{it is important not to}} get this mixed up with <b>radar</b> <b>separation</b> as in the former case the radar need not necessarily be certified for use for <b>radar</b> <b>separation</b> purposes, the {{separation is}} still procedural.|$|E
50|$|In {{air traffic}} control, {{the risk of}} {{aircraft}} colliding is managed by applying separation rules. These rules require aircraft to be separated by either a minimum vertical distance, or, {{if for some reason}} they cannot be separated vertically, by a minimum horizontal distance defined by various means. One of the means of determining horizontal separation is by a controller observing the radar returns of the aircraft to be at least a minimum horizontal distance apart. This is the essence of radar control, and is known as <b>Radar</b> <b>separation.</b> Standard <b>radar</b> <b>separation</b> varies from airspace to airspace and country to country, however 3 nms in terminal airspace and 5 nms in en route airspace are common minima.|$|E

40|$|In modern {{electronic}} warfare, {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) radar {{has become}} an important tool for electronic reconnaissance and intelligence transmission because of its anti-stealth, high resolution, low intercept and anti-destruction characteristics. As a common MIMO radar signal, discrete frequency coding waveform (DFCW) has a serious overlap of both time and frequency, so it cannot be directly used in the current <b>radar</b> signal <b>separation</b> problems. The existing fuzzy clustering algorithms have problems in initial value selection, low convergence rate and local extreme values which will lead to the low accuracy of the mixing matrix estimation. Consequently, a novel mixing matrix estimation algorithm based on data field and improved fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is proposed. First of all, the sparsity and linear clustering characteristics of the time–frequency domain MIMO radar signals are enhanced by using the single-source principal value of complex angular detection. Secondly, the data field uses the potential energy information to analyze the particle distribution, thus design a new clustering number selection scheme. Then the particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced to improve the iterative clustering process of FCM, and finally get the estimated value of the mixing matrix. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves both the estimation accuracy and the robustness of the mixing matrix...|$|R

40|$|Design and {{performance}} of the Wake Vortex Prediction and Monitoring System WSVBS are described. The WSVBS has been developed to tactically increase airport capacity for approach and landing on single runways as well as closely-spaced parallel runways. It is thought to dynamically adjust aircraft separations dependent on weather conditions and the resulting wake vortex behavior without compro-mis>ing safety. Dedicated meteorological instrumentation and short-term numerical terminal weather prediction provide the input {{to the prediction of}} wake-vortex behavior and respective safety areas. LIDAR monitors the correctness of WSVBS predictions in the most critical gates at low altitude. The WSVBS is integrated in the arrival manager AMAN of DLR. Performance tests of the WSVBS have been accomplished at Frankfurt airport in winter 2006 / 07 and at Munich Airport in summer 2010. Aircraft separations for landings on single runways have been compared employing the concepts of either heavy-medium weight class combinations or dynamic pairwise separations where individual aircraft type pairings are considered. For the very conservative baseline setup of the WSVBS the potential capacity gains of dynamic pairwise operations for single runways appear to be very small. On the other hand, the consideration of individual aircraft types and their respective wake characteristics may almost double the fraction of time when <b>radar</b> <b>separation</b> could be applied...|$|E
40|$|On large {{airports}} {{with numerous}} departures per hour, controllers need to organize departing aircraft {{in such a}} way that maximum throughput is achieved. The demanded initial spacing of departures from the same runway, or dependent runways, poses a limiting factor. On most airports, an aircraft that follows the same departure pattern as its predecessor, a so called “in-trail departure”, requires <b>radar</b> <b>separation</b> of 3 nautical miles (NM). If the departure direction diverges more than 15 degrees, controllers may apply reduced initial spacing of 2, 400 meters (approx. 1. 3 NM) according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), or 6000 feet (ft) according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which allows earlier take-off clearance for following traffic, and thus higher throughput of the airport. The Unified Departure Operation Spacing (UDOS) concept allows the controller to apply reduced initial spacing, even for in-trail departures, if certain conditions are met. Those conditions include non-increasing distance to the preceding aircraft until <b>radar</b> <b>separation</b> is established, a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) with a target speed, established separation after at most 10 NM along track, and the presence of jet engines on the according aircraft. This paper investigates the departure situation on a large German airport hub and determines the potential of the UDOS concept on this particular airport. The current separation standards, including definitions of both ICAO and FAA, as well as the UDOS concept are reviewed. Prerequisites for the application of UDOS on that airport hub are presented and evaluated. Real data of departure operations on the airport in focus is available for multiple days of operation, including detailed information on the aircraft type, the actual take-off time (ATOT), and the assigned SID. By using this information, a baseline scenario for each available day of operations is constructed and investigated on presumably applied separation. Subsequently, an optimized departure scenario is established, allowing reduced initial spacing, and thus faster take-off clearance, whenever a flight qualifies for reduced separation. The qualification is determined by the evaluation of anticipated trajectories, based on the given SID route, the aircraft type, and a fuel weight estimation considering the designated arrival airport. A theoretical gain in departures per hour, when using the UDOS concept, is determined. Simulation of these scenarios is performed by operating the simulation environment of DLR's Institute of Flight Guidance. Departure trajectories are created with the air traffic simulator TrafficSim, which has been designed to support development of air traffic scenarios. It uses EUROCONTROL's Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in order to generate precise trajectories for many different aircraft types, and is capable of simulating up to 30, 000 aircraft in real time. All aircraft in the investigated scenarios are equipped with a flight management system (FMS) that can satisfy altitude constraints as well as time constraints and speed constraints. Conflict-freeness of the optimized scenario is ensured by using highly precise and fast conflict detection algorithms available in DLR's FATS...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} concept for {{precision}} departures based on satellite navigation augmented by either a wide area or local differential GPS {{such as the}} Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) and Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). The simplest version consists of an “inverted” precision approach in which the aircraft follows the glide path on an opposite track. As a next step, an extended capability allows for lateral area navigation combined with an angular climb out path. Both concepts are tested and evaluated using the Generic Cockpit Simulator GECO operated by the DLR Institute of Flight Guidance. These trajectories could either be encoded in the aircraft navigation database analogue to SBAS LPV approaches or broadcast by a GBAS ground station with terminal area path (TAP) functionality. Moreover, we show initial results in deriving requirements for a 4 dimensional performance based navigation concept defined as a 4 D Required Navigation Performance (4 D RNP). A four dimensional RNP concept needs {{to be seen as}} an extension of the current RNP X definitions and must include a required navigation performance for the vertical and the along track dimension as well as for time. The derivation of the requirements is based on the existing standards for Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) and <b>radar</b> <b>separation</b> combined with the required probabilities concerning Target Level of Safety (TLS). An operational implementation of 4 D RNP airspace would require trajectory management and continuous data connection between air traffic control and the aircraft. The along-track or longitudinal component is tightly connected to the time component by means of speed and the required time of arrival at each given waypoint.

40|$|For {{applications}} in hydrology and meteorology, {{it is often}} desirable to separate regions of stratiform and convective rain from meteorological radar observations, both from ground-based polarimetric radars and from space-based dual frequency radars. In a previous study by Bringi et al. (2009), dual frequency profiler and dual polarization radar (C-POL) observations in Darwin, Australia, had shown that stratiform and convective rain could be separated in the log 10 (Nw) versus Do domain, where Do is the mean volume diameter and Nw is the scaling parameter which {{is proportional to the}} ratio of water content to the mass weighted mean diameter. Note, Nw and Do are two of the main drop size distribution (DSD) parameters. In a later study, Thurai et al (2010) confirmed that both the dual-frequency profiler based stratiform-convective rain separation and the C-POL <b>radar</b> based <b>separation</b> were consistent with each other. In this paper, we test this separation method using DSD measurements from a ground based 2 D video disdrometer (2 DVD), along with simultaneous observations from a collocated, vertically-pointing, X-band profiling radar (XPR). The measurements were made in Huntsville, Alabama. One-minute DSDs from 2 DVD are used as input to an appropriate gamma fitting procedure to determine Nw and Do. The fitted parameters - after averaging over 3 -minutes - are plotted against each other and compared with a predefined separation line. An index is used to determine how far the points lie from the separation line (as described in Thurai et al. 2010). Negative index values indicate stratiform rain and positive index indicate convective rain, and, moreover, points which lie somewhat close to the separation line are considered 'mixed' or 'transition' type precipitation. The XPR observations are used to evaluate/test the 2 DVD data-based classification. A 'bright-band' detection algorithm was used to classify each vertical reflectivity profile as either stratiform or convective, depending on whether or not a clearly-defined melting layer is present at an expected height, and if present, maximum reflectivity within the melting layer as well as the corresponding height are determined. We will present results of quantitative comparisons between the XPR observations-based classifications and the simultaneous 2 DVD data-based classifications. Time series comparisons will be presented for thirteen events in Huntsville...|$|R

The Ibiza Channel, located in the Balearic Sea, is of particular importance since it controls the exchanges in the western Mediterranean Sea. In order to understand and describe the upper ocean dynamics, a multi-sensor/integrated approach was applied in the Ibiza Channel in the first days of August 2013 during the G-AltiKa mission. This approach combines: Sea-level anomaly (SLA) measurements from Saral-AltiKa track no. 16, which passed west of Ibiza island. 1 -Hz and 40 -Hz data were considered. Glider data obtained along the satellite track a few hours after its passage. The horizontal resolution ranges from 5 km offshore to about 1 km in the coastal area. HF radar hourly velocities on a 3 km-resolution grid that partially covers the study region (range up to 74 km offshore). Dynamic height (DH) was derived from the glider temperature and salinity profiles, while Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) was obtained by combining SLA and the new Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) jointly produced by CLS and SOCIB. From DH and SLA, the cross-track velocities were derived using geostrophy relations. Different filters were applied on SLA data and different reference levels were tested for the DH computation. DH and ADT both displayed very weak variations, on the order of 2 - 3 cm, along the glider trajectory. The gliderand the altimetry-derived velocities exhibit the signal of a meander centered at 38. 65 ◦N and a narrow coastal current flowing northward a few kilometers off Ibiza. These computed velocities are on the order of 20 cm/s, as confirmed by the HF <b>radar.</b> The time <b>separation</b> between the passage of the satellite and the glider can explain the discrepancies observed between the two platforms. Our results highlight the promising measurements offered by SARAL/AltiKa in the coastal band. In particular, the satellite was able is able to capture the northern edge of the meander which lied on a shallow bathymetry, less than 10 km from the coast. They also constitute the first experiment where satellite altimetry and glider measurements were obtained almost simultaneously on the same track, in a region covered by a HF radar.

40|$|The {{key element}} in the Dragon program is the {{utilization}} of remote sensing technologies for geo- and bio-scientific research. Considering the vast extent of the Polar Regions and the difficulties to access those, it is immediately clear that in particular the use of data from Earth Observing (EO) satellites is essential for monitoring ice sheets, ice shelves and sea ice. Recent studies on sea ice focus both on aspects regarding the interaction mechanisms between ocean, ice and atmosphere and their implications for weather and climate, and on information retrieval about ice mechanics and ice conditions for supporting marine traffic and offshore operations. During the Dragon- 2 and 3 phases, researchers from the First Institute of Oceanography, Qingdao, China, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the Danish Meteorological Institute, and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany have successfully established a close information exchange with respect to sea ice classification and ice parameter retrieval. Direct collaboration projects were focused on ice thickness retrieval using polarimetric SAR data from the Bohai Sea, and the possibility to estimate ice thickness in the Arctic based on compact satellite radar polarimetry. The PIs Ji, Zhang, and Dierking {{as well as the}} other members of the Dragon sea ice team have been involved in various external collaborative projects, which have been positively influencing their work in the Dragon program. The objective of this presentation is to give an overview about important European projects and studies that were carried out during the Dragon- 3 phase and are of importance for future activities in the Dragon- 4 program. Here, we focus on sea ice classification and drift retrieval using synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> (SAR). The <b>separation</b> of different ice types is needed for marine operations (mainly thin, smooth ice separated from thicker compacted ice) and for scientific process studies regarding, for example, heat exchange between ocean and atmosphere through the ice, or exchange of momentum between ice, on the one hand, and atmosphere and ocean, on the other hand. The major step in sea ice classification is to sub-divide sea ice SAR images into distinct regions based on similarities of parameters derived from the radar signal(s), and relate those regions to existing sea ice classification schemes. A special case is the separation of open water and ice for the determination of ice concentration. In this context, different research groups study different statistical models to adequately describe the distribution of radar parameter values typical for single ice types. Besides multi-polarization imagery, acquired with polarimetric SAR, multi-frequency data sets (that require combined acquisitions from SAR systems on different satellites) are in the focus of recent investigations in European groups. In order to improve the reliability of the classification and the retrieval of ice parameters, more advanced models for describing the multivariate dependencies are needed. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to make the whole classification process automatic, reliable and robust. Classification during the melting season, which is hampered by moist or wet snow layers and ice surfaces, and by melt ponds on the ice, is an important topic as well. The direct validation of sea ice maps and parameter retrievals is difficult because of the logistic difficulties to obtain the needed complementary data. The European sea ice remote sensing group hence closely collaborate with field researchers or participate themselves in field cruises to the Polar Regions. The retrieval of sea ice thickness from remote sensing data is one of the holy grails of polar research. European partners are developing and demonstrating the regional mapping of sea ice thickness based on multi-sensor satellite data (e. g. Sentinel- 1 SAR combined with AMSR 2) and parallel thickness simulations of a sea ice model (CMEMS Topaz). Thin ice (< 30 cm) areas are detected using AMSR 2 data and are excluded to reduce ice classification ambiguities in SAR images. Also areas with ice concentrations less than 70...|$|R
40|$|Mars Pathfinder, {{the first}} low-cost, quick Discovery class mission to be completed, {{successfully}} {{landed on the}} surface of Mars on July 4, 1997, deployed and navigated a small rover, and collected data from 3 science instruments and 10 technology experiments. The mission operated on Mars for 3 months and returned 2. 3 Gbits of new data, including over 16, 500 lander and 550 rover images, 16 chemical analyses of rocks and soil, and 8. 5 million individual temperature, pressure and wind measurements. The rover traversed 100 m clockwise around the lander, exploring about 200 square meters of the surface. The mission captured the imagination of the public, and garnered front page headlines during the first week. A total of about 566 million internet "hits" were registered during the first month of the mission, with 47 million "hits" on July 8 th alone, making the Pathfinder landing by far the largest internet event in history at the time. Pathfinder was the first mission to deploy a rover on Mars. It carried a chemical analysis instrument, to characterize the rocks and soils in a landing area over hundreds of square meters on Mars, which provided a calibration point or "ground truth" for orbital remote sensing observations. The combination of spectral imaging of the landing area by the lander camera, chemical analyses aboard the rover, and close-up imaging of colors, textures and fabrics with the rover cameras offered the potential of identifying rocks (petrology and mineralogy). With this payload, a landing site in Ares Vallis was selected because it appeared acceptably safe and offered the prospect of analyzing a variety of rock types expected to be deposited by catastrophic floods, which enabled addressing first-order scientific questions such as differentiation of the crust, the development of weathering products, {{and the nature of the}} early Martian environment and its subsequent evolution. The 3 instruments and rover allowed seven areas of scientific investigation: the geology and geomorphology of the surface, mineralogy and geochemistry of rocks and soils, physical properties of surface materials, magnetic properties of airborne dust, atmospheric science including aerosols, and rotational and orbital dynamics of Mars. Scientists were assembled into 7 Science Operations Groups that were responsible for requesting measurements by the 3 instruments, rover and engineering subsystems for carrying out their scientific investigations and for analyzing the data and reporting on their findings. The spacecraft was launched on December 4, 1996 and had a 7 month cruise to Mars, with four trajectory correction maneuvers. The vehicle entered the atmosphere directly following cruise stage separation. Parachute deployment, heatshield and lander <b>separation,</b> <b>radar</b> ground acquisition, airbag inflation and rocket ignition all occurred before landing at 2 : 58 AM true local solar time (9 : 56 : 55 AM PDT). The lander bounced at least 15 times up to 12 in high without airbag rupture, demonstrating the robustness of this landing system. Reconstruction of the final landing sequence indicates that the parachute/backshel 1 / 1 ander was tilted due to a northwest directed wind and wind shear, which resulted in the lander bouncing about I km to the northwest and initially downhill about 20 m from where the solid rockets fired. Two anomalously bright spots located in the lander scene are likely the heatshield, which continued in a ballistic trajectory about 2 km downrange (west southwest), and the backshell/parachute, which stayed nearer to where the rockets fired. Unconnected disturbed soil patches in the scene indicate that the final few bounces of the lander were from the east-southeast and were followed by a gentle roll to the west before coming to rest on the base petal. The location of the lander away from where the solid rockets fired and considerations of the exhaust products used to inflate the airbags and their fate, indicate that the Pathfinder landing system is one of the cleanest designed leaving the local area essentially contaminant free. The radio signal from the low-=gain antenna was received at 11 : 34 AM PDT indicating a successful landing...|$|R
