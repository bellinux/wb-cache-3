5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a <b>room</b> <b>filled</b> with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a <b>room</b> <b>filled</b> with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E

40|$|Previous anthracological {{research}} on multi-use pit fills at Kaman-Kalehöyük in central Turkey shows {{a sudden and}} dramatic increase in pine use from the Early Iron Age onwards, accompanied by a decline in taxa richness from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age. This paper explores whether fuel choice was the driving factor behind this pattern of change through a comparative taxonomic analysis of wood charcoal assemblages derived from multi-use pits, domestic hearths, and <b>room</b> <b>fills</b> accumulated during the Middle Bronze Age to Late Iron Age occupation at the site. Results from the hearth assemblages parallel those from the pits, documenting a decline in taxa richness from the Middle Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age, particularly during the Hittite Empire period, followed by {{a dramatic increase in}} pine in the Iron Age. However, the <b>room</b> <b>fill</b> composition does not match the same pattern. Results confirm that changes in taxonomic representation represented in the pit fills at Kaman-Kalehöyük was driven by fuel wood selection, with remains from <b>room</b> <b>fills</b> reflecting different selection behaviour relating to construction activities...|$|R

A printing press was installed in the palace for him to learn typography. He was taken hunting in the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes. In 1720 and 1721, when he was just ten, the young King himself danced before for the court and public in ballet performances in the Salle des Machines of the Tuileries Palace.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler <b>room</b> <b>filled</b> with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of one sort or another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.|$|E
