5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented <b>rye</b> <b>flour</b> and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

25|$|As alchemy {{evolved into}} the science of chemistry, vessels called retorts became used for distillations. Both alembics and retorts are forms of {{glassware}} with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle which acted as air-cooled condensers to condense the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of <b>rye</b> <b>flour.</b> These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called pot stills. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols such as cognac, Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, tequila and some vodkas. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by bootleggers in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for the domestic production of flower water or essential oils.|$|E

2500|$|Rugbrød (...) (Danish style rye bread) is a {{very common}} bread in Denmark. Rugbrød usually resembles a long brown {{extruded}} rectangle, no more than 12cm high, and 30–35cm wide, dependent upon the bread pan {{in which it is}} baked.

The most commonly present yeast species in the production of naturally leavened dough is Saccharomyces exiguus, which is more acid-tolerant than commercially produced S. cerevisiae, although the latter and other strains may also be present. Research has shown that when creating a naturally fermented starter, any naturally present S. cerevisiae will have died off after a few days.|$|E
40|$|The water {{extractable}} (WE) arabinoxylans {{from two}} <b>rye</b> <b>flours</b> differing in baking quality were studied following sequential extraction with water at 4, 40, and 100 degreesC. Ammonium sulfate fractionation {{of the resulting}} WE fractions and subsequent analysis revealed substantial differences {{in the structure of}} the isolated materials. Furthermore, it allowed us to identify the factors contributing to arabinoxylan water extractability. Our results provide compelling evidence for the existence of separate polymers in rye WE arabinoxylans with different substitution degrees, ranging from quantitatively dominating, lowly substituted populations (arabinose to xylose ratio, Ara/Xyl similar to 0. 5) to comparatively less abundant, highly substituted analogues (Ara/Xyl similar to 1. 3). Generally, arabinoxylan water extractability was governed by the relative proportion of lowly and highly branched structures. A gradually increasing proportion of highly substituted populations was observed from cold to hot WE fractions. This was associated with the lower proportion of monosubstituted xylopyranosyl residues in the backbone, the higher proportion of disubstituted xylopyranosyl residues, and the higher level of substitution with feruloyl residues. Notable differences in the ratio of phenolic compounds to arabinose residues were observed between corresponding polymers isolated from <b>rye</b> <b>flours</b> of high and low baking quality, whereas the differences in their molecular weights were much less pronounced. status: publishe...|$|R

The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found by fermenting flour under semiliquid conditions (dough yield 330) and, especially, by using wholemeal wheat flour. Fourteen peptides, not previously reported as ACEinhibitory, were identified from the water/salt-soluble extract of wholemeal wheat sourdough (IC 50 0. 19 - 0. 54 mg/mL).

Buckwheat was the ingredient that dominantly affected the dough and biscuit quality. Doughs with buckwheat were significantly harder and less sticky. Significant lowering of dough cohesiveness was found only at the maximal tested buckwheat dose. The biscuits enriched with buckwheat had increased spread, hardness and fracturability. Rye showed an improving effect on dough (decreased hardness, increased cohesiveness) and biscuit characteristics (decreased spread, hardness and fracturability) but the effect did not reach significant level. However, {{no significant differences in}} sensory tests were obtained among the tested biscuits. Hence, buckwheat has a potential to be used as an ingredient in honey biscuit making to develop more nutritional end-product especially if adequate processing methods to improve its suitability in food applications are additionally considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInsight into {{solubilisation}} {{mechanisms of}} rye arabinoxylans during breadmaking {{is important for}} understanding the biochemical processes that affect bread attributes. Purified ethanol precipitated water-extractable arabinoxylans (WE-AX) and residual unextractable counterparts (WU-AX) were isolated from <b>rye</b> <b>flours</b> and resulting breads. While the endosperm flours had lower endoxylanase activities and higher arabinose-to-xylose ratios of WU-AX than those of corresponding wholemeals, there were not any significant differences between them in the mean amounts of WU-AX hydrolysed during breadmaking. Nevertheless, they were highly affected by rye cultivar used for breadmaking. On average, 42 % and 36 % of WU-AX were recovered in bread WE-AX fraction, causing its 11 % and 8 % increase, respectively for endosperm and wholemeal breads. Bread WE-AX, however, had lower molecular weights than those of starting flours, implying chains depolymerisation.

40|$|Five rye (Secale cereale L.) lines {{ranging in}} extract {{viscosity}} (EV) from 5 to 95 cp were evaluated {{with respect to}} their physiochemical characteristics and those of their constituent water-extractable arabinoxylans (WEAXs). A significant positive correlation was observed between the EVs of rye wholemeals and their soluble dietary fibre and WEAX contents. Gel permeation chromatography of rye wholemeal water extracts revealed the presence of different proportions of a high molecular weight fraction (HAM), which correlated positively with their EVs. Treatment of a water extract of rye with xylanase followed by gel permeation chromatography indicated that the FDAW consisted primarily of arabinoxylan. Successive treatment of a water extract of rye with &# 945;-amylase, lichenase, protease and xylanase confirmed that the viscosity of the extract was primarily related to its content of arabinoxylan. Microscopic examination revealed that kernels of high EV rye had somewhat larger aleurone cells and thicker endosperm cell walls than did kernels of low EV rye. Extract viscosities of <b>rye</b> <b>flours</b> were higher than those of corresponding wholemeals, indicating concentration of WEAX in flour. Failing numbers of flours in {{the presence or absence of}} enzyme inhibitor correlated positively with their EVs. Farinography and breadmaking tests revealed that EV of <b>rye</b> <b>flours</b> and rye/wheat flour blends was positively correlated with dough stability and negatively correlated with loaf volume. Inclusion of rye, particularly high EV rye, in chick diets seriously impeded growth performance and feed efficiency. Substantially lower digesta viscosities were observed in chicks fed bread diets than in those fed wholemeals. Water-extractable arabinoxylan was isolated from high, intermediate and low EV ryes. Structural analysis using H-NMR indicated that the WEAX from high EV rye was a less branched macromolecule having a lower degree of di-substituted Xy 1 p residues and a higher degree of un-substituted Xy 1 p residues as compared to WEAXs from intermediate and low EV ryes. Size exclusion HPLC/triple detection revealed that the WEAX from high EV rye had a higher molecular weight, a larger radius of gyration, a larger hydrodynamic radius and a higher intrinsic viscosity compared to the WEAXs from intermediate and low EV ryes...|$|R
