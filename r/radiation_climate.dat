Under clear skies, a mid-sized sugar maple tree (Acer saccharum Marsh.) reduced irra-diance in its shade on a south-facing wall by about 80 % when in leaf, and by nearly 40 % when leafless. Reductions by a similar-sized London plane (Platanus acerifolia W.) were generally slightly smaller. The percentage reductions varied with the fraction (DR) of diffuse radiation, and could be approximated by regressions with DR ' as the independent variable.

40|$|Annual crops {{on family}} farms in {{tropical}} regions are highly sensitive to climate. The increase in temperature will accelerate {{the growth and}} development of crops, thus shortening their seasonal cycle, in turn resulting in a decrease in intercepted solar <b>radiation.</b> <b>Climate</b> warming will increase the atmospheric evaporative demand, thermal stress frequency and crop maintenance respiration, likely resulting in lower yields. Conversely, reduced cold stress and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide storage are factors that increase yields. Little is known about changes in rainfall patterns, wind velocities and solar radiation. Given the poorly predicted positive and negative effects of biotic stress and potential interactions, there are still too many uncertainties {{to be able to}} forecast how yield patterns will change for most crops. Crop models are promising prospective analysis tools because they incorporate some of this complexity, but there is still insufficient data and expertise to be able to calibrate and validate them. Tropical agriculture can contribute to enhancing carbon storage or to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but adaptation to climate hazards is also necessary to ensure food security and income for farmers. Techniques such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, sustainable rice intensification (intermittent drying of rice fields), planting holes or index insurance can help fulfil these two objectives.

40|$|English Summary - Living in Arctic watersThe Arctic {{ocean and}} its {{seasonally}} changing sea-ice cover influence {{the heat and}} energy exchange between cold air masses and warmer ocean currents which finally affects the climate. In these high latitudes scientists from various fields are searching for answers related to global change questions and theirs effects on marine communities. One problem is the ozone-hole and the resulting increase in biologically harmful ultraviolet radiation. The use of divers is essential for many field experiments such as measurements of the underwater <b>radiation</b> <b>climate,</b> collecting of marine organisms and observation and identification of ecological interactions between different species. Many physiological processes of marine macroalgae such as photosynthesis and growth are inhibited by UV radiation. The sensitivity of individual species is generally related to the depth zonation, i. e. eulittoral macroalgae are more resistant than sublittoral plants. The synthesis and accumulation of UV-absorbing substances may prevent photodamage and hence represents an important adaptation mechanism against UV stress. Although UV effects on whole macroalgal communities are not well investigated, losses in productivity and biomass, and consequently decreases in associated animals such as crustaceans and fish can be expected if the UV is further increasing. Benthic marine macroalgae represent suitable bio-indicators for environmental changes in Arctic coastal waters...|$|E

40|$|The functional-structural tree model LIGNUM {{represents}} the above-ground {{part of the}} coniferous and the deciduous trees with four structural units closely analogous to real tree parts. The units are tree segment, bud, branching point and axis. The general framework of LIGNUM for coniferous trees has been described in Perttunen et al., 1996, and for deciduous trees in Perttunen et al., 2001. LIGNUM is intended as a generic modelling tool. The growth of different tree species can be simulated by changing model parameters, descriptions of metabolism, structural dynamics (i. e., birth, growth and senescence of the structural units) and representing the tree architecture by bringing out species specific branching rules. Photosynthetic production depends on the solar radiation. The <b>radiation</b> <b>climate</b> of the tree crown and interception of radiation by each segment is evaluated.

With measurements taken at a single point in time they can provide reliable estimates of relative diffuse anddirect solar radiation andcan also be usedto estimate the light climate in different times of the year. The four above mentioned methods for solar radiation estimation were applied at the same points in gaps and under adjacent canopies in unevenaged, mixed Dinaric fir-beech and pure beech montane forests. Locations covereda range of radiation andstandstructure conditions. Data analyses showedgoodreliability of all four methods over the whole range (2 – 80 %) of radiation conditions.

40|$|Mining is {{not only}} an {{essential}} component of social and economic development since prehistoric time, but it also gives a large impact on our civilization. Gold is a noble metal that is highly valued. The extraction of minerals from earth is known as traditional mining. Gold also can be extracted from electronic waste or e-waste, and this new concept is called urban mining. There are many stages in traditional and urban mining process. However, in this study, the focus was on crushing and grinding processes to produce 1 kg of gold. Crushing and grinding are processes in the milling stage. This research evaluates and compares the environmental impacts of crushing and grinding processes, based on electricity consumption. About 50 to 65 % of total electricity in milling was used for crushing and grinding processes. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used as a tool to evaluate the environmental burdens of electricity usage in converting ore and electronic waste to gold bars.

This is expressed both in the higher values of the radiation dose to be expected and in the deviation of the type and spectral distribution of cosmic radiation in space from terrestrial radiation.

Firstly, the radiation exposure of the astronaut onboard is to be detected and, secondly, the influence of radiation on the proper functioning of equipment and materials on and in the spacecraft is to be determined. The radiation measuring technique {{used for this purpose}} has to supply statements on the radiation doses, types of radiation and their spectral distribution to be expected. Based on the known effectiveness of radiation as a function of its type and energy, it is possible to derive risks and possible protective measures. The overall goal of this project was to carry out further research of the dynamic radiation situation in near space by means of passive radiation detectors. The project was broken down into the following topics: (1) determination of the depth dose distribution of primary cosmic radiation behind thin screens outside spacecraft; (2) detection of the neutron energy distribution and neutron dose inside spacecraft; (3) interpretation of the readings of TL detectors and solid-state trace detectors inside spacecraft.

40|$|The {{impact that}} future climatic {{conditions}} {{will have on}} agricultural productivity depends on the sensitivity to each environmental factor and relative changes in temperature, precipitation and UV-B radiation. The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) is a microclimatic crop cultivated almost worldwide and Spain is the world's second-largest strawberry producer after the USA. Strawberry production in Huelva has been affected by climate change in recent decades. Temperature and solar radiation are primary environmental factors controlling short-day strawberry plant growth and development. Temperature is a limiting factor in crop productivity. We assessed the effect of variations in temperature and solar radiation on strawberry production and crop cycle duration. The study {{was carried out in}} commercial strawberry fruit production fields in the province of Huelva (Spain's southwestern coast). Fresh plants of cv.

The resulting crop was recorded weekly in the production field: early and total strawberry productions (g/plant), were recorded from January to March and from January to May, respectively. Data revealed that between early production and temperature (R²= 0. 86) and between early production and solar radiation (R²= 0. 73) there was a linear relationship. However, total production and temperature (R²= 0. 69) and total production and solar radiation (R²= 0. 69) were related by a quadratic relationship.
