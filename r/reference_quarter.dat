For this purpose, we use time series models to forecast the missing observations of monthly indicators. We then examine GDP forecasts under different amounts of monthly information. We find that already a limited amount of monthly information improves the predictions for current-quarter GDP growth to a considerable extent, compared with ARIMA forecasts.

40|$|In general, {{rational}} {{economic agents}} trade off {{the cost of}} waiting for the statistical agencies disseminate the final results of the relevant surveys before making a decision, on the one hand, and of making use of some model based predictions. Thus, from the viewpoint of agents, predictions and preliminary results from surveys often compete against each other. Comparing the loss attached to predictions, on the one hand, and to possible preliminary estimate from incomplete samples, on the other, provides a broad guidance in deciding if and when statistical agencies should release preliminary and final estimates. In this paper, the case of the dissemination of figures on quarterly GDP in the Euro Area is examined. The main conclusion is that the so called “flash estimates” actually provide valuable information to the users, while intermediate releases, published before three months {{from the end of the}} <b>reference</b> <b>quarter</b> can be substituted by model based estimation without any loss of accuracy. ...|$|E

Their equation links quarterly Canadian GDP growth with monthly data on retail sales, housing starts, consumer confidence, total hours worked, and U. S. industrial production. The authors use time-series methods to forecast missing observations of the monthy indicators; this allows them to assess {{the performance of the}} method under various amounts of monthly information. The authors' model forecasts GDP growth as early as the first month of the <b>reference</b> <b>quarter,</b> and its accuracy generally improves with incremental monthly data releases. The final forecast from the model, available five to six weeks before the release of the National Income and Expenditure Accounts, delivers improved accuracy relative to those of several macroeconomic models used for short-term forecasting of Canadian output. The implications of real-time versus pseudo-real-time forecasting are investigated, and the authors find that the choice between real-time and latestavailable data affects the performance ranking among alternative models.

This model extends beyond the usual lags and time line aspect of the price discovery process. The retail real estate sector is investigated within the Singapore context, as this sector changes dynamically and non-linearly in relation to rental, cost and general demand expectations and to exogenous shocks like the Severe Advanced Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the conceptual and measurement processes and {{issues relating to}} international migration statistics in Australia and its comparison with international standards. The Australian Bureau of Statistics derives estimates of resident population on a quarterly basis by adding natural increase and net overseas migration (NOM). The main source of data used to calculate NOM are incoming and outgoing passenger cards collected and processed by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Each month, there are well over one million arrivals and departures at Australian borders and accuracy of NOM is vital as it currently accounts for around half of Australia's population growth. NOM is derived as the difference between permanent and long-term (12 months or more) arrivals and departures. Two NOM figures, preliminary and revised are produced. Preliminary NOM contains primarily traveller movements data modelled by an estimate of travellers who will change their intended duration of stay. Revised NOM is produced up to 15 months after the <b>reference</b> <b>quarter</b> with an adjustment for the actual duration of stay or absence of a traveller. A number of adjustments designed to reflect differences between stated travel intentions and actual travel behaviour are applied to overseas arrivals and departures data. An unintended consequence {{of this is that}} persons arriving with a stated intention of staying {{for more than a year}} are excluded if they make short visits overseas during their overall long-term residency in Australia. There is need to further improve the methodology to adjust for all changes in intended duration of stay of arriving and departing passengers...|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} a policy to be effective, the links between the policy tools and the sub- sequent targets must be known, understandable, stable, and predictable. In this respect, this thesis is {{composed}} of three separate yet related empirical studies, that target important macroeconomic variables, which {{play a central role}} in the conduct of macroeconomic policies. First, simple regression estimates and a factor-based model are utilized to produce forecasts for Bahrain quarterly GDP growth using quarterly data-set that cover the period from 1995 : Q 1 to 2008 : Q 3. To do so, we run a simple regression model using a small data-set including six explanatory variables carefully selected based on in-sample correlation with the target variable. Alternatively, a factor model based on 65 indicators is employed to forecast Bahrain GDP growth. Using simulated out- of-sample experiments we assess and compare the performance of both approaches. The main finding from our forecasting experiment is that the best forecasting performance can be reached using simple regression estimates with a carefully selected small set of variables. In particular, by looking at point and density nowcasts, we find that a simple regression model that use industrial production as an indicator are more accurate than a static factor approach that uses over 65 variables. The official flash estimates of Bahrain quarterly GDP are published with a delay of 90 days after the end of the <b>reference</b> <b>quarter.</b> Our flash estimates, based on simple regression model, reduce the lag to 54 days. Second, we aim to forecast West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices using a large monthly data-set that cover the period from March 1983 to December 2011. To achieve this aim, forecasting with factor models offer a usual approach that utilizes large data-sets, however; a forecasting model which simply includes all factors in state space equation and do not allow for time varying may be not suitable with a highly volatile market such as oil market. To overcome these limitations, we employ an approach that accounts both for parameter and model uncertainty. In particular, we implement the the Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) approach suggested by Koop and Korobilis (2012). The key element of the DMA approach is that it allows both for model and parameter to vary at each point of time. By doing so, the DMA is robust to structural breaks. Empirical findings show that DMA approach outperforms any other alternative model used in the forecasting literature. We show that there is model but not parameter variation. Finally, we find that the DMA approach provides a better proxy of expected spot prices than future prices. Third, the Johansen cointegration technique is used to examine the long-run relationship between oil consumption, nuclear energy consumption, oil price and economic growth for eight countries over the period from 1965 - 2010. The countries investigated are divided into two groups. The first group includes four industrialized countries: USA, Canada, Japan and France, while the second group includes four emerging economies: Russia, China, South Korea and India. Results suggest that there is a long-run relationship between the four variables. Exclusion tests show that at least one energy source enter the cointegration space significantly, which im- plies that energy a long-run impact on economic growth. The emerging economies found to be heavily dependent on both oil and nuclear energy consumption. We also examine the causal linkage between the variables through exogeneity test. There is evidence of a unidirectional causality between energy consumption (oil or nuclear) and economic growth in all investigated countries. Our findings have important pol- icy implications that should be taken into account in designing appropriate energy policies. Energy conservation policies might have drawbacks or damaging repercus- sions on economic growth for this group of countries. ...|$|E

Mares were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two treatment groups at Day 40 - 50 of gestation: 1) needle puncture of allantois and treatment with erogenous progestins (Altrenogest, 22 mg, per os, once daily, 30 days) (Group PP; n = 12), or 2) aspiration of allantoic fluid and treatment with erogenous progestins (Group AP; n = 12). Exogenous progestins were administered to simulate elevated progesterone concentrations, as would be detected if a single fetus remained viable following the termination of a twin. For comparative purposes, two treatment groups were added during the second year: 3) puncture or aspiration of the allantois without erogenous progestin treaunent (Group NP; n= 8), or 4) ultrasonography without needle entry into allantois or treatment with erogenous progestins (control; Group C; n= 4). Pregnancy status was monitored using transrectal ultrasonography for one week following treatment and weekly for three additional weeks. Intrauterine endoscopic examinations were performed on all mares with non-viable fetuses 30 days following treatment to identify and retrieve mummified fetuses. Fetal death occurred as a result of both allantoic puncture and aspiration procedures with a tendency (P= 0. 06) for fetal death rates to be higher following allantoic aspiration (I O/ 1 2; 83 %) than allantoic puncture (6 / 12 : 50 %). The control procedure did not result in fetal death. Day of treatment affected fetal outcome in the allantoic puncture group. Fetal death rate was increased (P= 0. 01) when the allantois was punctured between Days 40 - 44 of gestation as compared with Days 4550 of gestation. Following fetal death, retained mummified fetuses occurred more often (P= 0. 03) in mares treated with exogenous progestins than in mares not treated with exogenous progestins.

40|$|The thesis {{contains}} four essays covering {{topics in}} the field of real time econometrics and forecasting. The first Chapter, entitled “An area wide real time data base for the euro area” and coauthored with Domenico Giannone, Jerome Henry and Magda Lalik, describes how we constructed a real time database for the euro area covering more than 200 series regularly published in the European Central Bank Monthly Bulletin, as made available ahead of publication to the Governing Council members before their first meeting of the month. Recent research has emphasised that the data revisions can be large for certain indicators and can have a bearing on the decisions made, as well as affect the assessment of their relevance. It is therefore key {{to be in a position}} to reconstruct the historical environment of economic decisions at the time they were made by private agents and policy-makers rather than using the data as they become available some years later. For this purpose, it is necessary to have the information in the form of all the different vintages of data as they were published in real time, the so-called "real-time data" that reflect the economic situation at a given point in time when models are estimated or policy decisions made. We describe the database in details and study the properties of the euro area real-time data flow and data revisions, also providing comparisons with the United States and Japan. We finally illustrate how such revisions can contribute to the uncertainty surrounding key macroeconomic ratios and the NAIRU. The second Chapter entitled “Maximum likelihood estimation of large factor model on datasets with arbitrary pattern of missing data” is based on a joint work with Marta Banbura. It proposes a methodology for the estimation of factor models on large cross-sections with a general pattern of missing data. In contrast to Giannone et al (2008), we can handle datasets that are not only characterised by a 'ragged edge', but can include e. g. mixed frequency or short history indicators. The latter is particularly relevant for the euro area or other young economies, for which many series have been compiled only since recently. We adopt the maximum likelihood approach, which, apart from the flexibility with regard to the pattern of missing data, is also more efficient and allows imposing restrictions on the parameters. It has been shown by Doz et al (2006) to be consistent, robust and computationally feasible also in the case of large cross-sections. To circumvent the computational complexity of a direct likelihood maximisation in the case of large cross-section, Doz et al (2006) propose to use the iterative Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Our contribution is to modify the EM steps to the case of missing data and to show how to augment the model in order to account for the serial correlation of the idiosyncratic component. In addition, we derive the link between the unexpected part of a data release and the forecast revision and illustrate how this can be used to understand the sources of the latter in the case of simultaneous releases. We use this methodology for short-term forecasting and backdating of the euro area GDP on the basis of a large panel of monthly and quarterly data. The third Chapter is entitled “Nowcasting Inflation Using High Frequency Data” and it proposes a methodology for nowcasting and forecasting inflation using data with sampling frequency higher than monthly. In particular, this Chapter focuses on the energy component of inflation given the availability of data like the Weekly Oil Bulletin Price Statistics for the euro area, the Weekly Retail Gasoline and Diesel Prices for the US and the daily spot and future prices of crude oil. Although nowcasting inflation is a novel idea, there is a rather long literature focusing on nowcasting GDP. The use of higher frequency indicators in order to Nowcast/Forecast lower frequency indicators had started with monthly data for GDP. GDP is a quarterly variable released with a substantial time delay (e. g. two months after the end of the <b>reference</b> <b>quarter</b> for the euro area GDP). The estimation adopts the methodology described in Chapter 2, modeling the data as a trading day frequency factor model with missing observations in a state space representation. In contrast to other procedures, the methodology proposed models all the data within a unified single framework that allows one to produce forecasts of all the involved variables from a factor model, which, by definition, does not suffer from overparametrisation. Moreover, this offers the possibility to disentangle model-based "news" from each release and then to assess their impact on the forecast revision. The Chapter provides an illustrative example of this procedure, focusing on a specific month. In order to assess the importance of using high frequency data for forecasting inflation this Chapter compares the forecast performance of the univariate models, i. e. random walk and autoregressive process, with the forecast performance of the model that uses weekly and daily data. The provided empirical evidence shows that exploiting high frequency data relative to oil not only let us nowcast and forecast the energy component of inflation with a precision twice better than the proposed benchmarks, but we obtain a similar improvement even for total inflation. The fourth Chapter entitled “The forecasting power of international yield curve linkages”, coauthored with Kleopatra Nikolaou, investigates dependency patterns between the yield curves of Germany and the US, by using an out-of-sample forecast exercise. The motivation for this Chapter stems from the fact that our up to date knowledge on dependency patterns among yields curves of different countries is limited. Looking at the yield curve literature, the empirical evidence to-date informs us of strong contemporaneous interdependencies of yield curves across countries, in line with increased globalization and financial integration. Nevertheless, this yield curve literature does not investigate non-contemporaneous correlations. And yet, clear indication in favour of such dependency patterns is recorded in studies focusing on specific interest rates, which look at the role of certain countries as global players (see Frankel et al. (2004), Chinn and Frankel (2005) and Wang et al. (2007)). Evidence from these studies suggests a leading role for the US. Moreover, dependency patterns recorded in the real business cycles between the US and the euro area (Giannone and Reichlin, 2007) can also rationalize such linkages, to the extent that output affects nominal interest rates. We propose, estimate and forecast (out-of-sample) a novel dynamic factor model for the yield curve, where dynamic information from foreign yield curves is introduced into domestic yield curve forecasts. This is the International Dependency Model (IDM). We want to compare the yield curve forecast under the IDM versus a purely domestic model and a model that allows for contemporaneous common global factors. These models serve as useful comparisons. The domestic model bears direct modeling links with IDM, as it can be seen as a nested model of IDM. The global model bears less direct links in terms of modeling, but, in line with IDM, it is also an international model that serves to highlight the advantages of introducing international information in yield curve forecasts. However, the global model aims to identify contemporaneous linkages in the yield curve of the two countries, whereas the IDM also allows for detecting dependency patterns. Our results that shocks appear to be diffused in a rather asymmetric manner across the two countries. Namely, we find a unidirectional causality effect that runs from the US to Germany. This effect is stronger in the last ten years, where out-of-sample forecasts of Germany using the US information are even more accurate than the random walk forecasts. Our statistical results demonstrate a more independent role for the US. Doctorat en Sciences économiques et de gestioninfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

Through persona and narrative voice, the first poems drafted for the thesis, including Halabja 1988, Ponce de Leon, Lady at Uptown Market, Wedlock, Strange Light, and others, examine the nuances of our varied relationships to economic and political abundance as, variably, 'perpetrator,' 'victim,' and 'bystander,' innocent or otherwise. Poems drafted during the second year of thesis work, such as Map of Му Heart, L'Enfant Soldat, The Mother, The Bedroom, Circle and others, sought to examine the question more introspectively in order tо investigate the inexorable relationship between self and memory and the simultaneous singularity and universality of experience.

Includes bibliographical <b>references.</b> Fifty-three <b>Quarter</b> Horse yearlings were fed 0,. 92, 1. 86 or 2. 80 % Sodium Zeolite A (SZA) in the total diet. Beginning at approximately 18 mo of age, the horses were trained to ride, conditioned and run in nine match races [...] three races each at 274 m, 320 m and 366 m. During the last long slow distance workout (LSD), the last LSD with sprints workout prior to racing, and each race, blood samples were collected and heart rates (HR), respiration rates (RR) and rectal temperatures (RT) were measured at rest, after the warm-up, and at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min of recovery. Blood samples were analyzed for packed cell volume (PCV) and plasma ionized calcium (Ca++), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), lactate (LA-) and glucose. Data were analyzed by ANOVA using the repeated measures GLM of SAS Scheffe's multiple comparison test to compare means by treatment, race and sample (time). Results were considered significant at P<. l. The horses were able to run increasingly longer races without corresponding changes in HR, Na+, K+, Ca++, glucose, or PVC. Pre-race excitement was responsible for most of the change from resting HR in the races. However, maximum HR were not as high as is commonly reported in TB horses running longer distances. Mean RR and RT were higher during recovery with increasing race distance. Plasma silicon concentrations were elevated in treated horses, proving the bioavailability of silicon in SZA. There were no detected harmful effects and no important physiological advantages due to feeding SZA. There were no differences in HR, RR, RT, PCV, Ca++, Na+, K+, LA- or glucose between treated and untreated horses. With the Student's t test, fillies were found to be shorter at the withers and hip and smaller in heartgirth and external cannon bone circumference than geldings. However, there were no differences between genders in weight, condition score, rump- fat, soundness or race times. These results suggest that the routine decision to select against good fillies as race horses is not beneficial...|$|R
5000|$|Ratna Pala {{had a long}} reign {{for about}} thirty years as his second grant was given in the twenty sixth year of his reign. His son was Purandara Pala. From some of the verses in the Indra Pala inscription, found at Guwahati, Hoernle {{supposed}} that Purandara Pala died during the lifetime of his father Ratna Pala who was therefore succeeded by his grandson Indra Pala. This supposition has been confirmed by the subsequent discovery of the inscription of Dharma Pala wherein it is stated that Pundara Pala died as juvaraja. In the Indra Pala inscription Purandara Pala {{is described as a}} poet. In this inscription also the capital {{is said to have been}} Sri Durjya. It is also stated that Purandara Pala [...] "had the distinction of obtaining for wife the princess Durlabha who was descended from the royal races of the extensive kingdoms conquered by the victorious arms of Jamadagnis son". It is not possible to find from this <b>reference</b> from what <b>quarter</b> princess Durlabha came. Parasurama is said to have overthrown all Kshattriya kings and so it can be surmised that Durlabha was a Kshattriya princess, the daughter of some well-known king of northern India of that time, otherwise she would not have been so glorified. Vidyavinod says that some Brahmans were settled near Parasurama Kunda where a Hindu kingdom may have existed and Purandara Pala may have married a princess of that kingdom. It seems that this surmise is not correct. It is stated that [...] "when king Indra Pala sat on his throne the mosaic floor of his audience hall looked like a fruit-covered tree by reason of the strewn-about jewels that fell from the crowns of the princes as they voluntarily stood reverently bowing before him with joined hands". It is also said that during his virtuous reign the earth was [...] "greatly flourishing" [...] and that he [...] "had a residence of corresponding virtues, a town full of elephants, horses and jewels and impregnable to the attacks of any royal dynasty, whence it was named Sri Durjaya".|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{he found}} himself, {{at the end}} of half an hour, {{standing}} on the only spot in Charles Street which had any significance for him. It had occurred to him that if he couldn't call upon Verena without calling upon Olive, he should be exempt from that condition if he called upon Mrs. Tarrant. It was not her mother, truly, who had asked him, it was the girl herself; and he was conscious, as a candid young American, that a mother is always less accessible, more guarded by social prejudice, than a daughter. But he was at a pass in which it was permissible to strain a point, and he took his way in the direction in which he knew that Cambridge lay, remembering that Miss Tarrant's invitation had <b>reference</b> to that <b>quarter</b> and that Mrs. Luna had given him further evidence. Had she not said that Verena often went back there for visits of several days--that her mother had been ill and she gave her much care? There was nothing inconceivable in her being engaged at that hour (it was getting to be one o'clock) in one of those expeditions--nothing impossible in the chance that he might find her in Cambridge. The chance, at any rate, was worth taking; Cambridge, moreover, was worth seeing, and it was as good a way as another of keeping his holiday. It occurred to him, indeed, that Cambridge was a big place, and that he had no particular address. This reflexion overtook him just as he reached Olive's house, which, oddly enough, he was obliged to pass {{on his way to the}} mysterious suburb. That is partly why he paused there; he asked himself for a moment why he shouldn't ring the bell and obtain his needed information from the servant, who would be sure to be able to give it to him. He had just dismissed this method, as of questionable taste, when he heard the door of the house open, within the deep embrasure in which, in Charles Street, the main portals are set, and which are partly occupied by a flight of steps protected at the bottom by a second door, whose upper half, in either wing, consists of a sheet of glass. It was a minute before he could see who had come out, and in that minute he had time to turn away and then to turn back again, and to wonder which of the two inmates would appear to him, or whether he should behold neither or both.|$|R

Includes bibliographical <b>references.</b> Eight mature <b>Quarter</b> Horses were exercised by simulated cutting horse training in a repeated switchback experiment. Horses were fed a control (C) and a 10 % fat-supplemented (F) concentrate with bermudagrass hay in a 60 : 40 ratio. A digestion trial was conducted prior to d 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Every 7 d a standardized exercise test (SET) was conducted utilizing a mechanical 'cow' device to stimulate anaerobic metabolism. Heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT) and venous blood samples were taken prior to, during the SET and over recovery from the SET. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the biceps femoris before and after each SET. Body weight and condition were maintained on similar (P>. 05) amounts of feed. (P>. 05) amounts of feed. On d 7 the 'apparent digestibilities of energy, ether extract and neutral detergent fiber in F were higher (P<. 05) than those in C. By d 14 apparent digestibility of crude protein was higher (P<. 05) for F than C. There was no difference in HR between treatments or days. There were decreases (P<. Ol) in RR and RT over days, indicative of easier heat dissipation due to decreased ambient temperature (P<. 06) and humidity (P<. Ol) because of seasonal changes. When horses were fed F, there was an increase (P<. 05) in muscle glycogen storage from d 0 to d 28, however, values on a given d were not different from values when the horses were fed C. There was no increase in muscle glycogen over time when horses were fed C. On d 7, 14 and 28, muscle glycogen utilization increased (P<. 05) from d 0 when horses were fed F, but values for glycogen utilization were not different between treatments on any d. Pre-exercise data was normalized to set d 0 values equal to zero, due to higher (P<. 05) glycogen concentrations when horses were fed C than F. Consequently, d 28 pre-exercise muscle glycogen concentrations were higher (P<. 05) when horses were fed F than C. Plasma lactate concentrations did not differ between treatments, however, there was a decline (P<. 05) by days. Plasma glucose concentrations on d 28 when horses were fed F were lower than when fed C at numerous sampling times. Plasma oleate concentrations appeared to be higher when horses were fed F than C at all sampling times examined on d 14 and 28, and plasma linoleate concentrations increased on d 28 at rest and 30 min recovery when horses were fed F...|$|R
