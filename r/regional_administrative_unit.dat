40|$|Local {{self-government}} has a {{long tradition}} in Sweden. The first legislation in this field is generally considered to be the Local Government Ordinances of 1862, which separated Church of Sweden tasks from civil ones. Church tasks were assigned to the parishes of this Lutheran State church, while civil tasks were assigned to cities and rural municipal districts. At the regional level, the Ordinances established a new unit of selfgovernment known as the county council (landsting), whose territory normally coincides with the national government’s <b>regional</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>unit,</b> the county (län). On January 1, 2000, the Church of Sweden separated from the State. As a result, the parishes have lost their municipal status. In other words, there are now two types of local government bodies in Sweden, with the municipality, kommun, as the local unit and the county council, landsting, (in some cases called a “region”) as the regional unit. The number of municipalities (which cover the entire territory of Sweden) is 289. There are 18 county councils, two regions and the municipality of Gotland. The current Local Government Act, which went into effect in 1992, defines the roles of municipalities, county councils and regions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Whether {{women are}} more or equally {{susceptible}} to the carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoke on the lungs compared with men {{is a matter of}} controversy. Using a large French population-based case–control study, we compared the lung cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking by gender. Methods: The study included 2276 male and 650 female cases and 2780 male and 775 female controls. Lifetime smoking exposure was represented by the comprehensive smoking index (CSI), which combines the duration, intensity and time since cessation of smoking habits. The analysis was conducted among the ever smokers. All of the models were adjusted for age, department (a <b>regional</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>unit),</b> education and occupational exposures. Results: Overall, we found that the lung cancer risk was similar among men and women. However, we found that women had a two-fold greater risk associated with a one-unit increase in CSI than men of developing either small cell carcinoma (OR 15. 9, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 7. 6, 33. 3 and 6. 6, 95 % CI 5. 1, 8. 5, respectively; Po 0. 05) or squamous cell carcinoma (OR 13. 1, 95 % CI 6. 3, 27. 3 and 6. 1, 95 % CI 5. 0, 7. 3, respectively; Po 0. 05). The association was similar between men and women for adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that heavy smoking might confer to women a higher risk of lung cancer as compared with men.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} empirically {{the dynamics}} of regional inequalities in GDP per capita. Our starting hypothesis is that the evolution of regional inequalities should follow a bell-shaped curve depending {{on the level of}} national economic development. Â A number of authors going from Kuznets (1955) to Lucas (2000) have provided extensive theoretical arguments along this line suggesting that growth, because of its very nature, is unlikely to appear everywhere at the same time. Regional inequalities should then rise when countries start developing and then fall once a certain level of national economic development is reached as long as spillovers are strong enough to transmit growth and technological progress across regions. We test empirically these predictions by using regional data for a panel of European countries and by making use of semi-parametric estimation techniques.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} empirically {{the dynamics}} of regional inequalities in GDP per capita. Our starting hypothesis is that the evolution of regional inequalities should follow an inverted u-shaped curve depending {{on the level of}} national economic development. This hypothesis relates directly to a number of theoretical findings put forward in the new growth literature, in particular, by Tamura (1996) and Lucas (2000) who study the growth transition dynamics of regional/national economies arguing that inequalities should first rise then decline depending on the total amount of knowledge available in the economy which is directly linked to the level of economic development. These arguments also correspond to earlier seminal papers by Kuznets (1955) and Williamson’s (1965) who argued that national growth dynamics may drive, at least initially, to a rise in regional inequalities. We test empirically these predictions by using regional data for a panel of European countries and by making use of semi-parametric estimation techniques. Our results provide strong support for an inverted U-shaped curve in the relationship between the national per capita income level and the extent of regional inequalities independently of the time period and <b>regional</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> considered.

It was found that * differences in living standards between regional units have been decreasing during the transformation in Poland and in the Czech Republic. In the latter this process is slow and smooth, while in Poland there was a relatively sharp decline which then stopped entirely in 1994 * the only country with increasing differences between regions is Hungary and these differences are growing at a constant rate * the lowest level of regional differences in the LSI was found in Poland, followed by the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic * the regional differences in Hungary are almost twice as high as in the Czech Republi...|$|R

In any case the Christianity had reached the area {{by the end of the}} 8th century and, according to Harms, there was already a wooden church in Müden in 866. The earliest written record of the village goes back to the year 1022. In the deed of gift by the Bishop of Hildesheim, Bernward, dated 1 November 1022 for the abbey of St. Michael in Hildesheim is the following statement: item Mutha in pago Muthiwide ("likewise Müden in the sub-district (Untergau) of Mündungswald"). Muthiwide, the Latinized form of the Old Saxon term Muthiwiddi (Muth = mouth) refers to the name of a sub-district in the Loingau.

Until the middle of the 15th century the history of Müden was linked to the neighbouring village of Hermannsburg, with which it formed a common parish until 1440. The region was ruled by the House of Billung until the line died out, it then went over to the Guelphs and until 1866 belonged to the House of Hanover.

40|$|Up to now border {{regions of}} {{national}} {{states have been}} and still are characterized by “ends”: the end of traffic and communication infrastructures, the end of national laws and mentalities. They {{have been part of}} the peripheral space surrounding the centre or the centres of national states. Borders have been and partly still are lines of more or less strict separation between one state and another, between one people and another. Encouraged by the increasing cooperation between the “centres” after World War II, border regions seek to change their bad situation caused, on both sides, by their separating border line, through cooperation across these lines. Initially represented by personal contacts, soon cooperation came to take institutional forms that would stimulate it. The most accepted of cross border cooperation becomes the “Euroregion. ” Usually Euroregions are associations of neighbouring local or <b>regional</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> on the borderlines of two or three, rarely more than three states. Since 1957 when the so-called “Euregio” was founded on the German-Dutch border, these Euroregions have aimed at improving the welfare of the people on both sides of the border. One of the most effective ways to reach this aim is the holistic method of regional development. This means making use of the whole regional potential in a sustainable way for the people living in the region. Therefore, all Euroregions – beside their differences in size or organization – have common projects for cross border regional development. Slowly, Euroregions have been acknowledged as suitable instruments for cross border regional development. Soon after 1989 Euroregions appeared, by transfer and attraction, in the former widely isolated countries in Eastern Europe. One of the dozens of Euroregions now existing in this area is the DKMT-Euroregion, the “Danube-Körös-Maros-Tisza-Euroregion” between Serbia, Hungary, and Romania...|$|R

There are several advantages to using remote sensing to monitor drought, especially in developing countries with limited historical meteorological records and a low weather station density. In the present study, we assessed agricultural drought in the croplands of the BioBío Region in Chile. The vegetation condition index (VCI) allows identifying the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation conditions associated with stress because of rainfall deficit. The VCI was derived at a 250 m spatial resolution for the 2000 – 2015 period with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD 13 Q 1 product. We evaluated VCI for cropland areas using the land cover MCD 12 Q 1 version 5. 1 product and compared it to the in situ Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for six-time scales (1 – 6 months) from 26 weather stations. Results showed that the 3 -month SPI (SPI- 3), calculated for the modified growing season (November–April) instead of the regular growing season (September–April), has the best Pearson correlation with VCI values with an overall correlation of 0. 63 and between 0. 40 and 0. 78 for the <b>administrative</b> <b>units.</b> These results show a very short-term vegetation response to rainfall deficit in September, which is reflected in the vegetation in November, and also explains to a large degree the variation in vegetation stress. It is shown that for the last 16 years in the BioBío Region we could identify the 2007 / 2008, 2008 / 2009, and 2014 / 2015 seasons as the three most important drought events; this is reflected in both the overall <b>regional</b> and <b>administrative</b> <b>unit</b> analyses.
