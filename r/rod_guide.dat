50|$|Commonly, a breech-end {{extension}} tube, {{known as}} a bore guide or <b>rod</b> <b>guide,</b> is also {{used in conjunction with}} the cleaning rod to prevent cleaning solvent from spilling out into the receiver, and to keep the rod supported and centered inside the bore in order to minimize potential damage to riflings. Similarly, a muzzle guide or muzzle guard might be used if the cleaning rod is to be inserted from the muzzle end of the firearm {{in order to protect the}} crown of the muzzle from mechanical damage.|$|E
50|$|The SKS {{is easily}} field {{stripped}} and reassembled without specialized tools and the trigger group and magazine {{can be removed}} with an unfired cartridge. The rifle has a cleaning kit stored in a trapdoor in the buttstock, with a cleaning rod running under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. The cap for the cleaning kit {{also serves as a}} cleaning <b>rod</b> <b>guide,</b> to protect the crown from being damaged during cleaning. In common with some other Soviet-era designs, it trades some accuracy for ruggedness, reliability, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost.|$|E
50|$|The RPK {{features}} a heavier and longer barrel than the AKM, this {{allows for the}} weapon to be fire for {{extended periods of time}} without major loss in accuracy due to the barrel heating up. The chrome-lined barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver and cannot be replaced in the field. It is fitted with a new front sight base, the gas block lacks a bayonet lug and an under-barrel cleaning <b>rod</b> <b>guide.</b> The barrel also {{features a}} folding bipod mounted near the muzzle, and a front sight base with a lug that limits the bipod's rotation around the axis of the barrel. The barrel has a threaded muzzle, enabling the use of muzzle devices such as flash hiders, compensators, and blank-firing adapters. When a muzzle device is not being used, the threads on the muzzle can be covered by a thread protector. The barrel is pinned to the receiver in a modified trunnion, reinforced by ribbing, and is slightly wider than the trunnion used on the standard AKM type rifles. Symmetrical bulges {{on both sides of the}} front trunnion ensures a proper fit inside the receiver.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} is a one-piece {{tube with}} a screwed in match barrel. Goncz Armament utilized heat treated 4130 solid chrome alloy for the receiver tube. On the Goncz GA and Claridge T and L models, and all rifles, it also {{acts as a}} barrel shroud. The receiver tube houses the bolt, <b>guide</b> <b>rods</b> and <b>guide</b> springs. All Claridge Hi-Tec and Goncz Armament firearms utilize match barrels manufactured in-house that are button-rifled.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the design}} is simple and {{effective}} with some clever touches; for example the bolt <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> assembly <b>guides</b> the bolt in the receiver, retains the recoil springs and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding {{the upper and lower}} receivers together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a hinge pin immediately forward of the magazine well.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSafety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> {{tubes are}} {{important}} components of fast reactor cores for ensuring safe reactor operation. Their failure or considerable changes of their size {{may lead to}} safety rod wedging that is unacceptable. Two guide tubes, one each from BN- 350 and BOR- 60, were examined post-irradiation to determine {{the reasons for their}} deformation and loss of functionality. These tubes were constructed from high-nickel alloy EP- 150 and austenitic 18 Cr 9 Ni, respectively. It is found that various forms of deformation of safety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> tubes occur due to non-uniform swelling along the tube height, perimeter and across-wall thickness. The swelling gradients can lead to bowing and ovality, and can be accompanied by significant internal stresses within the tube material. The latter can lead to size reduction of guide tube dimension in some directions due to irradiation creep. High levels of swelling-induced residual stresses, in combination with a swelling-induced embrittlement of the tube material, can lead to the tube failure {{even in the absence of}} any external loading...|$|E

The MATARE (MWbel-TAlink-RElap) code is a multi-pin deformation analysis code created through the dynamic coupling between the thermal-hydraulic code RELAP 5 and multiple instances of the single-pin thermal mechnanics code MABEL. The main aim is to predict the behaviour of the fuel rods under conditions leading to clad ballooning, and to investigate whether plausible inter-pin inhomogeneities inhibit coherent ballooning and consequent flow passage blockage. The inter-pin differences analysed included different fuel burn-ups, the presence of burnable poisons (Gadolinium oxide), {{and the existence of}} the control <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> thimbles.

30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston <b>rod,</b> <b>guide</b> sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston rod and guide sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Crack {{detection}} in {{the region}} of the weld root for control rod nozzles installed in the reactor pressure vessel cap, is difficult due to limited accessibility. For ultrasonic testing, probe coupling is possible only at the inner surface of the engine <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> tube. There is a water gap of 2 to 3 mm between guide tube and control rod nozzle. Investigations were preformed to determine ultrasonic inspection parameters best suited to crack detection across a water gap. Measurements across a water gap were carried out on planar, convex and concave surfaces specimens. Test reflectors (spark eroded notches) were introduced at different depths for the respective specimen. The notches had different positions and orientations in relation to the weld. After detection of test reflectors, sizing tolerances were reviewed. Measurement data were post processed by means of reconstruction technique using SAFT. Measurement and analysis results are presented...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of approaches for assessment of core debris heat transfer and Control <b>Rod</b> <b>Guide</b> Tube (CRGT) cooling effectiveness in case of a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) severe accident. We consider a hypothetical scenario with stratified (metal layer atop) melt pool in the lower plenum. Effective Convectivity Model (ECM) and Phase-Change ECM (PECM) are developed for the modeling of molten metal layer heat transfer. The PECM model takes into account reduced convection heat transfer in mushy zone and compositional convection that enables simulations of noneutectic binary mixture solidification and melting. The ECM and PECM are (i) validated against relevant experiments for both eutectic and noneutectic mixtures and (ii) benchmarked against CFD-generated data including the local heat transfer characteristics. The PECM is then applied to the analysis of heat transfer in a stratified heterogeneous debris pool taking into account CRGT cooling. The PECM simulation results show apparent efficacy of the CRGT cooling which can be utilized as Severe Accident Management (SAM) measure to protect the vessel wall from focusing effect caused by metallic layer...|$|E

30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} servo cylinder with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the servo cylinder. Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the support oil cushion of the variable hydraulic pressure support structure, oil cushion of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the servo cylinder piston <b>rod,</b> <b>guide</b> sleeve, and piston, as well as the cylinder oil film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented. A hydraulic dynamic shear scissor is used as a research target to derive a structural dynamic model. Comparative simulations are performed using Matlab Simulink. Additionally, flow field analysis of the novel structure is performed, which verifies the rationality and feasibility of the proposed structure and system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this study, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) {{model is}} {{established}} {{to obtain the}} 3 -D flow characteristic, temperature distribution of the pressurized water reactor (PWR) upper plenum and hot-legs. In the CFD model, the flow domain includes the upper plenum, the 61 control <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> tubes, the 40 support columns, the three hot-legs. The inlet boundary located at the exit of the reactor core and the outlet boundary is set at the hot-leg pipes several meters away from upper plenum. The temperature and flow distribution at the inlet boundary are given by sub-channel codes. The computational mesh {{used in the present}} work is polyhedron element and a mesh sensitivity study is performed. The RANS equations for incompressible flow is solved with a Realizable k-ε turbulence model using the commercial CFD code STAR-CCM+. The analysis results show that the flow field of the upper plenum is very complex and the temperature distribution at inlet boundary have significant impact to the coolant mixing in the upper plenum as well as the hot-legs. The detailed coolant mixing patterns are important references to design the reactor core fuel management and the internal structure in upper plenum. Introduction.
