40|$|Most histopathologycal {{studies of}} the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream iridovirus (RSIV) disease in red sea bream have been {{performed}} by studying enlarged cells as well as necrotized cells in the spleen and other organs. These enlarged cells have been named as inclusion body bearing cells (IBCs). However, few information is available about detail of ultrastructural features of IBCs produced in the target organs of RSIV-infected fish.  In the present study, details of ultrastructural features of IBCs that were produced in the spleen tissue of naturally RSIV-infected <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream were investigated under electron microscope. Under electron microscope, RSIV-infected <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream had the presence of two types of IBCs: typical IBCs allowing virus assembly within viral assembly site (VAS), and atypical IBCs which degenerate organelles without virus assembly.

Morphogenesis steps on RSIV-infected <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream were observed as filamentous-filed virions, partially-filled virions and complete virions with 145 - 150 nm in size.

Two levels of lipid (210 and 260 g/kg) and three levels of phosphorus (17, 14 and 12 g/kgˉ¹) in the dry diets were tested. Duplicate groups of 25 <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream (average weight 3. 74 ± 0. 07 g) per 60 L glass tank were fed experimental diets {{three times a day}} near to satiation level at 22 to 28 °C water temperature.

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{sensitivity}} of yellowtail Senola quinqueradiata and <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream Pagrus major tq Nocardia seriolae was investigated. The LDso for yellowtail and <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream after being injected with N. seriolae was 1. 1 x 103 CFU/l 00 9 B. W. and 3. 4 x 104 CFU/l 00 g B. W., respectively. In an immersion challenge, the LDso for yellowtail was 1. 2 x 104 CFU/mL, while no mortality {{was observed in}} <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream at 1. 0 x 105 CFUlmL for 26 days. These data indicate that yellowtail is {{more sensitive to the}} bacterium than <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream. Serum bactericidal activity against N. seriolae was not observed in both fish species. Production of superoxide anion in kid-ney phagocytes isolated from <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream significantly increased in response to addition of live N. seriolae. However, such increase of superoxide anion production was not detected in yellowtail kidney phagocytes.

40|$|The {{long-range}} {{studies on}} the ecology and dynamics of various organisms, chiefly including larvae and juveniles of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream, and on the environmental conditions of the ecosystem, have been performed at Shijiki Bay, Hirado Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. An ecosystem model of Shijiki Bay was developed mainly {{with regard to the}} dynamics of 0 -age <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream and verification of the model was carried out. The following summarizes the results. (1) Basic concept for the development of an ecosystem model of Shijiki Bay, its boundary conditions and state variables and parameters to be introduced into the model were determined by rearranging available information on the bay such as non-biological elements in the bay, ecology, dynamics and production process of zooplankton, phytoplankton and feed benthos, life form of 0 -age <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream, stock variations, and carrying capacity. (2) Spatial range of the model was decided to be central and inner parts of the bay where the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream settles and grows, and time range of the model was decided to be four months from May 5 which is the normal settling time of the fish to September 5 when the fish starts to migrate toward the open sea. (3) The model system is divided into seven parts: Copepoda, Gammaridea and Mysidacea which in turn are used as feed by the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream as it grows, wild <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream, reared <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream, competitors of the fish for feed and their predators. (4) A total of 37 parameters were used and the relationship among these components and changes in the individual numbers were expressed by a differential equation. (5) Individual numbers of feed organisms were expressed using a logistic model by incorporating predation pressure into the basal model. As parameters, intrinsic rate of increase, carrying capacity and the number of feed organisms preyed on by the <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream and other fish were introduced. (6) Change in the individual numbers of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream, competitors and predators were expressed using certain parameters such as the decreasing coefficient, feed richness-depending increasing rate and the number of prey. (7) Initial values of the variables and parameters were determined after analyzing the information obtained mainly from Shijiki Bay and analyzing the results of various sensitivity tests of provisional variables and parameters. (8) When conditions of Shijiki Bay from 1976 to 1977, a period during which individual numbers of <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream juveniles and their changes thereafter had been well detected, were simulated, the results coincided to the most part with the actually examined results. Simulation using the ecosystem model confirmed a generally considered view that the limit of the carrying capacity for <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream is about two million individuals. (9) Simulation of a releasing experiment of artificial <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream performed in 1984 showed slight differences from the results of an actual tracing examination. It is necessary to re-examine some parameters such as the survival rate of released fishes. 長崎県平戸島志々伎湾において長期間実施されてきた マダイの幼稚魚を中心とする各種生物の生態・動態なら びにそれらをとりまく環境に関する研究成果を整理し， マダイ当歳魚の動態を主軸にした志々伎湾の生態系モデ ルを開発し，モデルの検証を行った。得られた結果は以 下のようである。 （ 1 ）志々伎湾の非生物的要素や動・植物プランクトン， 餌料ベントスの生態・動態・生産過程・マダイ当歳魚 の生活様式，資源変動，環境収容力などに関する既往 の知見を整理し，志々伎湾の生態系モデルの基本的な 考え方，境界条件，導入する状態変数やパラメタの決 定を行った。 （ 2 ）モデルの空間的範囲は，マダイが着底・成長する湾 中央部と湾奥部で，時間的範囲は，標準的な着底時期 の 5 月 5 日から湾外に移出し始める 9 月 5 日までの 4 ヵ月間とした。 （ 3 ）系の構成要素は，マダイの発育につれて順次餌料と なるカイアシ類，ヨコエビ類，アミ類，マダイ天然魚， マダイ放流種苗，餌の面でのマダイとの競合者ならび にそれらに対する捕食者の 7 つである。 （ 4 ）合計 37 個のパラメタを用い，これらの構成要素間の 関係と個体数の変動は微分方程式をもって表現した。 （ 5 ）餌生物の個体数はロジスティックモデルを基本とし， それに捕食圧を組み込んで表現した。パラメタとして は内的増加率，環境収容力，マダイなどによる捕食尾 数を導入した。 （ 6 ）マダイ，競合者，捕食者の個体数の変動には減耗係 数，餌の豊度による増加率あるいは被捕食尾数などの パラメタを用いて表現した。 （ 7 ）各変数の初期値やパラメタは志々伎湾を主体とした 既往の知見を参考にしたり，仮りに与えた幾多の感度 試験の後に確定した。 （ 8 ）志々伎湾へのマダイ稚魚の来遊数とその後の個体数 変化が把握されている 1976 年と 1977 年の状態をシミュ レーションし，実際の調査とほぼ一致した結果を得た。 マダイの環境収容力の限界は，約 200 方尾の来遊であ るとするこれまでの見解を本モデルでのシミュレー ションは追認した。 （ 9 ） 1984 年に実施したマダイ人工種苗の放流実験をシ ミュレーションしたところ，実際の追跡調査結果とは 若干の相違がみられた。放流種苗の生残率などのパラ メタを再検討する必繋が示唆された...|$|R

The effect of ontogenic stage on feeding behavior parameters was examined. The range of turbulence at which <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream larvae could survive and ingest prey increased with larval growth. Therefore, turbulence is an important condition impacting survival of small larvae during the initial period of feeding. At low prey density, larvae fed at the highest feeding rate and had a high RNA : DNA ratio at a medium turbulence level {{on the order of}} 10 (- 6. 5) m 2 s(- 3). Thus, an optimum turbulence level induces faster growth, and it can be concluded that turbulence {{plays an important role in}} larval growth and survival. For interspecific comparison, a feeding success index calculated by numerical modeling in sea bream was compared to that of Pacific bluefin tuna using data reported by Kato et al. (2008). There were large differences in the index. The equivalent curve for <b>red</b> <b>sea</b> bream showed a linear relationship, while that for Pacific bluefin tuna showed a dome-shaped relationship.
