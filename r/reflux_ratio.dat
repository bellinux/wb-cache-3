40|$|A {{method of}} {{approach}} {{for developing a}} systematic design procedure for heterogeneous azeotropic distillation sequences is presented. A simple technique for calculating liquid-liquid-vapor equilibrium is developed. The technique is capable of distinguishing between metastable and absolutely stable liquid phases and therefore gives reliable predictions {{about the number of}} coexisting equilibrium liquid phases. The procedure has been used to calculate residue curve maps and to design heterogeneous azeotropic distillation columns. A residue curve map analysis for heterogeneous mixtures is developed to aid in the sequencing of heterogeneous distillation columns. In the analysis, distillation boundaries and the projected liquid boiling envelope are superimposed to divide the triangular composition diagram into distinct distillation regions. Classes of residue curve maps which give rise to feasible column sequences are identified. Several kinds of sequences are presented and it is shown that the conventional sequence frequently requires much larger <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios</b> than other alternatives. ^ A simple technique is developed for discovering the underlying geometric conditions which govern the calculation of minimum <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios</b> in heterogeneous azeotropic distillation columns. A set of finite difference mass balance equations which describe the steady-state composition profile are derived and used to demonstrate the design technique. A differential approximation to these equations are developed for calculating minimum <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios</b> and for studying the effect of design variables of these complex columns. The results show that a small change in the operating conditions can cause a significant shift in the column composition profile while maintaining the product compositions essentially constant. The design procedure, therefore, provides rather unique information about the operability of these columns and the study suggests that the composition profile sensitivity {{must be taken into account}} in control system design. ^ Finally, a procedure for calculating minimum <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios</b> for heterogeneous distillation columns is presented. The method can be extended to calculate minimum <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios</b> in homogeneous distillation columns with non-sharp splits. ...|$|R

50|$|The above {{explanation}} {{reflects the}} theoretical way fractionation works. Normal laboratory fractionation columns will be simple glass tubes (often vacuum-jacketed, and sometimes internally silvered) {{filled with a}} packing, often small glass helices of 4 to 7 mm diameter. Such a column can be calibrated by the distillation of a known mixture system to quantify the column in terms of number of theoretical trays. To improve fractionation the apparatus is set up to return condensate to the column {{by the use of}} some sort of reflux splitter (reflux wire, gago, Magnetic swinging bucket, etc.) - a typical careful fractionation would employ a <b>reflux</b> <b>ratio</b> of around 4:1 (4 parts returned condensate to 1 part condensate take off).|$|E
50|$|Reflux {{refers to}} {{the portion of the}} {{condensed}} overhead product that is returned to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for condensing the vapours flowing upwards. The <b>reflux</b> <b>ratio,</b> which is the ratio of the (internal) reflux to the overhead product, is conversely related to the theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the distillation products.Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the <b>reflux</b> <b>ratio,</b> heat reflux and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter and height. In most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include feed load size and properties and the type of distillation column used. The two major types of distillation columns used are tray and packing columns. Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are corrosive or temperature sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure drop is important. Tray columns, on the other hand, are used for larger columns with high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most oil refinery operations, tray columns are mainly used for the separation of petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.|$|E

Experimental tests were carried out in both of a pervaporation module and a reactive distillation column. Under suitable conditions, the pervaporation tests have shown higher than 99. 9 % H 2 O mole fraction in the permeate. The design by the residue curve maps has shown the alleviation of azeotropes of H 2 O-reaction components mixtures under pervaporation. The experimental study at standard conditions has shown a gain of 10 % in tert-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE) yield when the zeolite membrane tube was inserted inside the distillation column.

40|$|This Article {{provides}} new {{predictions for}} selectivity in batch reactive distillation, identifying the <b>reflux</b> or reboil <b>ratio</b> and a Damkhler number (Da) {{as the key}} operating parameters. The dimensionless Da incorporates the influence of liquid holdup, vapor rate, and rate of reaction. Example results for a system of serial isomerization reactions and for the synthesis of ethylene glycol are provided. The results show that selectivity improvements in BRD are limited for high values of Da or for high values of the <b>reflux</b> or reboil <b>ratio</b> and that selectivity is enhanced as Da or <b>reflux</b> or reboil <b>ratio</b> is decreased. However, decreasing Da can cause conversion loss, which can be mitigated by increasing the <b>reflux</b> (or reboil) <b>ratio</b> {{at the expense of}} selectivity. Consequently, there is an optimum value of <b>reflux</b> or reboil <b>ratio</b> that gives a maximum yield for systems operated at low or moderate Da. For the isomerization in a BRD, the heat released by reaction can improve selectivity at the expense of conversion. For ethylene glycol synthesis at a low reboil ratio, BRD has a negative impact on both conversion and selectivity by causing separation of the reactants. We also show that decreasing the reboil ratio {{near the end of the}} BRD can increase the removal rate of EG and thereby improve selectivity. This operating strategy is different from a common operating strategy in distillation of increasing reboil ratio near the end of a batch or cut. We also find that an operation with a constant volumetric liquid flow rate provides lower selectivity than a constant molar liquid flow rate...|$|R

The thermodynamic bases for the substantially lower energy requirements include: 1) The phase change is required only once in freeze processes, {{as opposed to the}} high <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios</b> needed in most distillation separations. 2) The latent heat of fusion is less than the heat of vaporization, and the process operates at a lower temperature, so the entropy of the separation is less. 3) A heat pump is used in the freeze crystallization process to transfer heat from the freezer to the melter, providing advantages similar to the vapor compression evaporator cycle. Freeze crystallization should be considered an alternative to all distillation and evaporation separation processes.

Combining a stack of these gives the system of equations for the whole column. There is a range of solutions, because a higher <b>reflux</b> <b>ratio</b> enables fewer plates, and vice versa.

It is sent to another column rectifying the argon to the desired purity from which liquid is returned to the same location in the LP column.

The process flow sheet includes both the extractive distillation column and the entrainer regeneration column. Insight from analysis of the ternary residue curve map and isovolatility curves shows that a lower pressure reduces the minimal amount of entrainer needed and increases the relative volatility of acetone–methanol in the extractive column.

30|$|In this work, a {{commercial}} process simulator {{was used as}} a tool for evaluating performance of the systems. The base case (direct sequence) was composed of two distillation columns. Generally, degree of freedom of a conventional two-product distillation column with a condenser and reboiler is 2. Therefore, for a two-product column, it is only possible to specify two specifications. In our simulations for two-product columns, recovery and purity of one of the products were the two used design parameters. These specifications, along with feed conditions and feed stage govern performance of the column. So, the other characteristics of the separation processes (including required <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios,</b> boil up ratios, condenser duties and reboiler duties) were obtained by running the simulation and solving Mass balance, Equilibrium, Summation of mole fractions =  1 and Heat balance (MESH equations) at all stages of the column. The energy requirements of the systems were evaluated by solving MESH equations. In designing the proposed bottom flashing configuration, operating parameters were adjusted to supply the same operating conditions for the columns. The main idea was to reduce energy requirements of the system by transferring heat from top to bottom products. For a specific compression ratio, a fraction of required energy was saved through heat transfer from top to bottom products, and the remaining energy was supplied by heaters/coolers.|$|R

The case study concerns the separation of the diisopropyl ether (DIPE) –isopropyl alcohol (IPA) minimum boiling azeotrope with heavy entrainer 2 -methoxyethanol. We first explain that the unexpected energy cost OF decrease following an increase of the distillate outputs is due to the interrelation of the two distillate flow rates and purities and the entrainer recycling through mass balance when considering both the extractive distillation column and the entrainer regeneration column. Then, we find that for the studied case a lower pressure reduces the usage of entrainer and increases the relative volatility of DIPE–IPA for the same entrainer content in the extractive column.

The theory of reactive-phase diagrams for two-phase systems, in which the components undergo one equilibrium chemical reaction, is developed, and the conditions for reactive-azeotropy are derived.

Reactive-phase diagrams, which illustrate {{the influence}} of chemical reactions on phase equilibria, are computed for some typical systems. These diagrams show that reactive-azeotropes can occur even for ideal mixtures. ^ The effect of equilibrium reactions on distillation processes is illustrated by studying the simple distillation of homogeneous reactive mixtures. The residue curve maps for some typical systems show that by allowing the components of a mixture to react we can either create or eliminate simple distillation boundaries. Moreover, the addition of reaction may prevent some non-reactive azeotropes from being obtained as products of the distillation process. ^ The study of the simple distillation of reactive mixtures led {{to the definition of}} a set of transformed composition variables that reduce the conservation equations for reactive mixtures to a form identical to that for non-reactive mixtures. These variables are used to simplify the design equations for single- and double-feed reactive distillation columns.

The optimization technique suggested the employment of Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) Method using ASPEN PLUS. The input operating variables of the CDU were properties of the crude oil obtained from Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) and manipulated variables such as the flow rates, <b>reflux</b> <b>ratio,</b> temperature and pressure. The objective function of the optimization was to maximize the net profit of the desired products using the SQP method. Variation of Bottom Oil flow rate and <b>Reflux</b> <b>Ratio</b> on Net Profit calculated in Naira per year on a molar flow rate and <b>reflux</b> <b>ratio</b> reflects the expected results which should increase the profit. The outcome should indicate and suggest whether the plant is operating efficiently and the model can provide an effective planning and operation tool...|$|E

30|$|Taking {{into account}} that the {{uncovered}} area of CdTe core is highly reactive in the photooxidation process but optical properties of such nanocrystals are desirable in some cases, we propose to reduce the core reactivity by decreasing its defectiveness. By changing the stoichiometric composition of CdTe clusters, we can obtain the nanocrystals with different Te anion vacation concentration in the core. When the other synthesis conditions including Cd/TGA <b>ratio,</b> <b>refluxing</b> time, and pH remain constant, the passivation degree of this vacancies increases approaching the stoichiometric Cd/Te <b>ratio.</b> The short-term <b>refluxing,</b> insufficient to complete passivation, is necessary to obtain the different anion vacancy concentrations in the prepared CdTe/CdS QDs.|$|R

40|$|As {{energy costs}} {{continue}} to rise across the process industry, many plants have responded by developing improved energy monitoring and reporting programs. At the center of such programs are typically spreadsheet or database applications that pull information, such as fired heater excess oxygen and steam vent rates, from the plant data historian and generate summary reports that compare and trend actual performance relative to targets. On average, plants can expect to reduce overall energy costs by up to 10 % through improved management of plant variables, or metrics, that influence energy consumption. Energy metrics can generally be classified into three categories: Equipment, Utility System, and Process. Examples of each type of metric will be given in the paper. As {{a percentage of the}} overall savings sited above, the energy savings through stewardship and optimization of Equipment, Utility System and Process metrics are generally 50 %, 40 % and 10 %, respectively. Plants have generally {{done a good job of}} stewarding the 90 % of savings available through Utility and Equipment related energy metrics, primarily because target setting is fairly straightforward. However, the 10 % of savings available from Process metrics, such as tower <b>reflux</b> <b>ratios,</b> pumparound rates, and steam stripping ratios, are typically missing from energy management systems due to the difficulty in first identifying them, and second in determining the optimum targets. Target setting is most difficult because with process metrics, yield considerations must be included in the target setting process. It is quite easy, for example, to save energy by cutting tower reflux rates. But too much reduction will sacrifice yield performance. Even at elevated energy prices, even the smallest reduction in yield will typically offset any energy savings that might have been captured. Therefore, in order to effectively incorporate Process energy metrics into the plant energy management system, knowledge of both energy and yield parameters is required. This paper will explore an effective methodology for determining what process unit energy metrics are important, how to effectively set their targets, and how to incorporate them into an effective energy management system. In terms of how to identify process energy metrics, the paper will discuss which energy intensive processes should be examined first, such as crude distillation and cat cracking. In terms of target setting, the paper will describe how process engineering experience is combined with simulation to develop meaningful targets that characterize the point where yield and energy are simultaneously optimized. Finally, the work process require...|$|R
