50|$|Lepidocrocite and {{goethite}} are {{the first}} amorphous iron oxyhydroxides that appear upon oxidation of iron. High corrosion rates are initially observed. Then, an essential chemical reaction intervenes: slag and unreduced iron oxides (second phase particles) in the iron microstructure alter the polarisation characteristics and enrich the metal-scale interface with phosphorus, thus indirectly promoting passivation of the iron (cessation of rusting activity). The second-phase particles act as a cathode, and the metal itself serves as anode, for a mini-galvanic corrosion reaction during environment exposure. Part of the initial iron oxyhydroxides is also transformed into magnetite, which somewhat slows down the process of corrosion. The ongoing reduction of lepidocrocite and the diffusion of oxygen and complementary corrosion through the cracks and pores in the rust still contribute to the corrosion mechanism from atmospheric conditions.The next main agent to intervene in protection from oxidation is phosphorus, enhanced at the metal-scale interface by the same chemical interaction previously described between the slags and the metal. The ancient Indian smiths did not add lime to their furnaces. The use of limestone as in modern blast furnaces yields pig iron that is later converted into steel; in the process, most phosphorus is carried away by the slag. The absence of lime in the slag {{and the use of}} specific quantities of wood with high phosphorus content (for example, Cassia auriculata) during the smelting induces a higher phosphorus content (> 0.1%, average 0.25%) than in modern iron produced in blast furnaces (usually less than 0.05%). One analysis gives 0.10% in the slags for 0.18% in the iron itself. This high phosphorus content and particular repartition are essential catalysts in the formation of a passive protective film of misawite (d-FeOOH), an amorphous iron oxyhydroxide that forms a barrier by adhering next to the interface between metal and rust. Misawite, the initial corrosion-resistance agent, was thus named because of the pioneering studies of Misawa and co-workers on the effects of phosphorus and copper and those of alternating atmospheric conditions in <b>rust</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E

30|$|Since ancient times, {{white marble}} {{has been used}} as a popular {{material}} for sculptural artefacts such as statues, busts, and friezes as well as an architectural building material with numerous applications from flooring, wall facings, and pedestals, to columns and fountains. Although marble is a relatively stable material, the desired white surface is unfortunately prone to tarnishing when used in outdoor environments [1]. One of the major sources of tarnishing is iron. In addition to the oxidation of internal iron compounds present in stone like pyrite (FeS 2) and siderite (FeCO 3) [1, 2], contact with iron-rich ground water when marble is used in, for example, garden fountains, results in severe and unsightly discolouration [3]. Another cause is the proximity to iron metal, which is oxidized by air in the presence of rain. The solubilized ions are then transported by rain onto the marble surface, resulting in <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> [4].|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{awareness}} {{of the complexity of}} potential reaction pathways and the associated solid-phase transformations during the reduction of Fe (hydr) oxides, especially ferrihydrite. An important observation in static and advective-dominated systems is that microbially produced Fe(II) accelerates Ostwald ripening of ferrihydrite, thus promoting the formation of thermodynamically more stable ferric phases (lepidocrocite and goethite) and, at higher Fe(II) surface loadings, the precipitation of magnetite; high Fe(II) levels can also lead to green <b>rust</b> <b>formation,</b> and with high carbonate levels siderite may also be formed. This study expands this emerging conceptual model to a diffusion-dominated system that mimics an idealized micropore of a ferrihydrite-coated soil aggregate undergoing reduction.

The corrosion of steel in tap water and mineral water of three different chemical compositions (all for human use) was monitored for up to 6 months.

40|$|MasterThe {{galvanized}} steel with zinc-magnesium (Zn-Mg) alloy coating has a superior corrosion resistance in wet-dry environment containing chloride. However, the {{galvanized steel}} with Zn-Mg alloy coating processed by {{physical vapor deposition}} shows surface color degradation. When the galvanized steel with Zn-Mg alloy coating is exposed to a humid environment at high temperature, {{the surface of the}} Zn-Mg alloy coated steel easily turns to dark within a short period of time. It is suspected that this phenomenon is closely related to the formation of magnesium based corrosion product (dark rust) on the outermost surface. Since it can lead to deterioration in the coating quality, it is very critical problem for the galvanized steel with Zn-Mg alloy coating. Therefore, this research is focused on {{understanding of the nature of}} dark rust formed on the coating surface and developing the prevention methods against the formation of dark rust. Contrary to the hot dip galvanized steel (GI) and electrogalvanized steel (EG), the galvanized steel with Zn-Mg alloy coating and pure magnesium coated steel shows a surface darkening phenomenon after they are exposed to the humid environment at high temperature. It has been revealed that this is due to the anodic dissolution of magnesium from the coating layer and precipitation of needle like magnesium-based corrosion product, Mg(OH) 2, on the outermost surface after the magnesium ions exceed the solubility limit in aqueous solutions. Accelerated anodic dissolution of magnesium from the galvanized steel with Zn-Mg alloy coating was caused by the galvanic corrosion between zinc and magnesium. Since the suspected nature of the dark rust was magnesium based corrosion product, Mg(OH) 2, a carbonate treatment using the 0. 1 M NaHCO 3 solution and a zirconium plating method were employed to form a protective layer which can cover up the magnesium on the top surface. Zinc based thin film, hydrozincite, was formed after the carbonate treatment and it was revealed that the film can act as a protective barrier for the formation of dark rust even though it was exposed to DI water at high temperature of 100 oC for 20 minutes. In addition to this treatment, zirconium plating also showed a good property in terms of surface color degradation phenomenon. Although the galvanized steel with Zn-Mg alloy coating was not densely covered by the zirconium particles by the existing oxide on the coating surface, it seems that there is a clear effect on the surface darkening problem. Lastly, stannate conversion coating treatment was evaluated for the suppression of the dark <b>rust</b> <b>formation.</b> From the result of surface film analysis with the aid of FE-SEM, EDS and GDS, magnesium stannate MgSnO 3 was formed on the outermost surface.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{protective}} passive layer on the corrosion resistant Delhi iron pillar (DIP) has been addressed based on a detailed characterization of its rust. Rust characterization clearly established that the major constituents of the scale were crystalline iron hydrogen phosphate hydrate (FePO 4 H 3 PO 44 H 2 O), a-, g-, d-FeOOH and magnetite. The iron oxide/oxyhydroxides {{were present in the}} amorphous form. The role of slag particles in the matrix of the DIP iron in enhancing the passive film formation is briefly addressed initially. The process of protective <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> on DIP iron is outlined based on the rust analysis. Initially, the corrosion rate of iron is high due to the presence of slag particles. This results in enhancement of surface P content. In the presence of P, the formation of a protective amorphous compact layer of d-FeOOH, next to the metal surface, is catalyzed and this confers the initial corrosion resistance. The critical factor contributing to the superior corrosion resistance of the DIP, however, is the formation of iron hydrogen phosphate hydrate, as a thin layer next to the metal–metaloxide interface. The formation of the crystalline modification of this phosphate from the amorphous form is aided by alternate wetting and drying cycles (i. e. the environmental factor). The rate of corrosion is further lowered due to the low porosity content of the crystalline phosphate phase. The passive film formation on the DIP has been contrasted with the rusting of normal an...|$|E

Corrosion in coastal regions is a particularly relevant issue due the latter’s great importance to human society. About half of the world’s population lives in coastal regions and the industrialisation of developing countries tends to concentrate production plants close to the sea. Until the start of the 21 st century, research on the basic mechanisms of <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> in Cl − -rich atmospheres was limited to just a small number of studies.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The lack of cost-effective, {{reliable}} {{sampling methods}} for many wetland characteristics hinders efforts {{to describe the}} structural and functional properties of wetlands. This study evaluated techniques for sampling the subsurface hydrology and invertebrates of freshwater wetlands. The depth of rusting on mild steel rods was compared with water well measurements to determine the reliability of rust depth {{as a predictor of}} subsurface water levels. An emergence trap and a benthic coring device were compared to determine the utility of each for sampling the invertebrate fauna of a wetland. Accuracy of the rods in estimating different water table measurements (average, lowest, most recent) and comparability of rod data (within sets of five rods) were investigated for different reference points on the rods, residence times, and wetland soils. The effect of the presence of vegetation in a soil low in organic matter on rod accuracy also was evaluated. The depth of lowest formation of a rust band on the rods predicted average and most recent water table depths in peat soil (r² for regressions of rust band depth on water table depth ranged from 0. 71 - 0. 95). Estimates of average water table depths were most precise for peat soil. Accuracy and precision were considerably lower in sand and clay soils, but significant relationships (P < 0. 10) between depth of rust band formation and water table depth were found for all soils (r² values for sand and clay ranged from 0. 13 - 0. 55). The presence of vegetation had no effect on rod accuracy in the sand soil. Differences in rod performance between residence times were not apparent. However, a rod residence time of 4 - 6 weeks is recommended to balance the time necessary for adequate <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> on the rods and to minimize the chance of exposure to large changes in water levels. A decrease in water table depth of approximately 40 cm in one month in the clay wetland caused a month lag time in <b>rust</b> <b>formation.</b> Differences in depth of rust band formation between the five rods within replicate sets were greatest for rods from clay (mean SD = ± 7. 9 cm). Variability of rust band measurements within replicate sets was lower in peat (mean SD = ± 2. 3 cm) and sand (mean SD = ± 2. 6 cm). The results indicated that the rusty rod technique has serious limitations and should be applied only in situations where the use of standard methods must be restricted. Emergence traps and a benthic coring device were used to sample the invertebrates of a freshwater, emergent wetland during late spring and summer, 1989. The fauna captured by each technique, disparities between the techniques in sampling certain taxa, and factors potentially affecting abundance estimates were examined. In addition, the efficiency of each technique, expressed as the number of samples required to achieve a desired level of precision, in estimating mean abundances of the dominant invertebrate group, the Chironomidae, was evaluated. Total and monthly estimates of insect family richness were higher for continuous sampling of emergence than for monthly core samples of the benthos. Emergence traps also caught a greater variety of the insect taxa inhabiting the wetland. The precision and efficiency of each technique in estimating abundances of the dominant group, the Chironomidae, varied between months and habitats (open water; vegetation). The variation was most likely due to the natural spatial and temporal variations inherent in invertebrate populations. The number of samples required (n[subscript r]) to estimate mean Chironomidae abundances for the entire summer, June-September, to a precision of D= 0. 20 (equivalent to a standard error equal to 20...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of rusted and mechanical damaged flame gaps, {{and the ability of}} these flame gaps to prevent a hydrogen gas explosion transmission between an inner and outer explosion chamber. An explosion chamber intended for preventing such an explosion transmission between an inner and outer explosive atmosphere is called an Ex'd' enclosure. In the industry there are many potential ignition sources that could be a threat in an explosive atmosphere, as an explosion may occur if being ignited. Ex'd' enclosures are designed to surround the potential ignition sources and to protect a possible internal explosion from spreading to the outer environment. Ex'd' enclosures have certain design requirements specified in the international standards IEC. The design criteria that was examined in this work is (IEC 2007 a) 's requirement which states that the mean surface roughness of the flame gap opening shall be less than 6. 3 μm. The international standards also require that any damaged flame gap surface must be restored to the original state. However, the standards have no definition of what damages are considerable large enough for having to be restored to the original quality. As a result of this lack of guidance, even minor rust or mechanical damage of the flame gap surfaces must be repaired, which is a time consuming and expensive procedure. The purpose of the present research is, {{due to the lack of}} damage ranking definition, to examine what effect different damages have on the safe gap. To be able to conclude about the importance and effect of the damage, one must have a characteristic value for each slit to compare the results. The characteristic value used in this work is the maximum experimental safe gap, MESG, which is a measure of the largest gap opening that does not generate a re- ignition on the outside of the Ex'd' enclosure. An increase in MESG value does therefore imply an increased efficiency of the safe gap. The MESG value is individual for each explosive gas, and will vary as the surfaces of the flame gaps are changed. Similar experiments have previously been performed with propane as the explosive gas, but the present work is carried out with hydrogen as the explosive gas. The present work has also considered the effect of different time periods of <b>rust</b> <b>formation.</b> Six slits were set at sea side for one month and six others for two months. Rusted slits shall, according to the stardards, be restored to the initial state. But results show that corrosion actually increases the efficiency of the safe gap. The efficiency of the safe gap also increases with increased <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> on the slit's surfaces. The mechanical damaged flame gaps were applied grooves of various depths and various widths to their surfaces. All grooves were crosswise, thus in the opposite direction of the gas flow that was being pushed through the opening by the internal explosion. The MESG values of the mechanical damaged slits turned out to be larger than the undamaged slits' MESG values, which refers to an increased efficiency of the safe gap. The overall conclusion from this investigation is that damaged surfaces of flame gaps do not reduce the efficiency of the safe gap. Neither rusted nor significant mechanical damaged flame gap surfaces reduce the efficiency of the safe gap. In fact, improvements are observed in all cases. This indicates that the surface roughness requirements of the international standards which states that the mean surface roughness must be less than 6. 3 μm, is an arbitrarily chosen value. It is also shown in this study that the temperature of the hot combustion gases is lower after they have penetrated through flame gaps with grooves, rather than after penetrating through an undamaged flame gap. The probability of generating a re-ignition in the secondary chamber through flame gaps with grooves is then decreased as a result of the lower temperatur...|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{semiconductor}} {{metal oxides}} have been increasingly used in humidity, gas, and chemical sensing devices [14]. This is {{probably because of}} their simple fabrication, low cost, size reduction, appreciable sensitivity, and fast response time [1]. Catalytic metal-doped semiconductor metal oxides such as SnO 2 [15], titanium dioxide (TiO 2) [16], ZnO [17], and WO 3 [18] {{have been used to}} develop hydrogen sensors. The addition of suitable quantity of appropriate metal catalyst enhances chemical reaction through the lowering of activation energy at the metal oxide thin film and target gas interfaces. The addition of metal as a catalyst also improves target response and selectivity at room temperature [19]. ZnO nanorods and nanowires are particularly promising for these applications because of its large surface area, wide bandgap and exciton energy, fascinating sensitivity, biocompatibility, low weight, and resistance to <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> [20]. For hydrogen sensing applications, surface modifications of ZnO with metal additives such as Pt, Pd, and/or Au through various techniques have been under intensive investigations [19, 21, 22]. Several studies have demonstrated that Pd doping on ZnO nanowires and nanorods enhances room temperature hydrogen sensing through the catalytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen to atomic hydrogen at room temperature [21]. The predominant methods documented to synthesize ZnO nanorods for this particular application are chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [21, 22]. However, both CVD and MBE methods involve high temperature growth and expensive instrumentations which are not available and affordable in ordinary laboratories. These techniques also need gold (Au) and/or other expensive metal coatings for the synthesis of ZnO nanorods and nanowires [10, 11]. Moreover, Pd doping on the synthesized zinc oxides requires RF sputtering which also demands expensive laboratory setup. Additionally, previous researchers used DC measurements [19, 21, 22] which cannot elucidate the contributing factors such as the grain, grain boundary, and electrodes that might influence the target response on the Pd-sensitized ZnO nanostructures.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that iron oxide {{reduction}} by Shewanella spp. bacteria promotes the formation of FeII bearing minerals, such as the mixed FeII-FeIII hydroxysalt green rusts (GRs), in anaerobic conditions. Although the microbial-promoted generation of GRs is widely demonstrated, the mechanisms and factors governing the GR formation as the main secondary iron mineral {{at the expense of other}} products in lab-scale investigations or environmental systems are largely unknown. As GR is an effective reductant for several contaminants the mechanism controlling the formation routes of GR merit investigation, from both the environmental and engineering points of view. Some factors such as cellular material (i. e. autoclaved cells and/or bacterial polymers), synthetic anionic polymers or oxyanions have been identified to control the route of the GR mineralization as secondary mineral at the expense of other products such as magnetite. The arrangement mode of the heterogeneous aggregates resulting from the interactions between bacterial cells, iron oxide particles and polymers was suggested to influence the routes of formation of secondary iron minerals by limiting the diffusion of reactive species and thus creating favorable microenvironment for GR formation. In these aggregates, the electron transfer from cells to iron oxides is supported by organic electron shuttles. On the other hand, anionic polymers, colloidal and aqueous silicates were found to also influence the nature of the secondary iron minerals through the stabilization of the G R crystals. The e results indicate clearly that the bacterial cells d rive indirectly the nature of the secondary FeII-bearing mineral. Moreover, they give new insights into the understanding of the mechanisms of « biogenic » mineral formation based on the electron transfers from bacteria towards iron oxides. Finally, this work contributes to our understanding of the processes leading to green <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> in environmental systems, such as soils or aquatic systems bio films, in which a very high cell density can be found at a micro-scale level, associated to exo-cellular polymers and natural silica mineral composites...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide spills and {{discharges}} {{can result}} in ground and surface water contamination. Simple iron treatment provides an effective and inexpensive remediation tool for soil and water contaminated with chloroacetanilide herbicides. We found the effectiveness of zerovalent iron (Fe 0) to dechlorinate aqueous metolachlor (2 -chloro-N-(2 -ethyl- 6 -methyl phenyl) - N-(2 -methoxy- 1 -methyl ethyl) acetamide) was greatly enhanced {{in the presence of}} Al, Fe(II) or Fe(III) salts, with the following order of destruction kinetics observed: Al 2 (SO 4) 3 3 ̆e AlCl 3 3 ̆e Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 3 ̆e FeCl 3. A common observation was the formation of green rusts, mixed Fe(II) /Fe(III) hydroxides with interlayer anions that impart a greenish-blue color. The mechanism responsible for enhanced metolachlor loss {{may be related to the}} role these salts play in facilitating Fe(II) release. To investigate this catalytic effect, we characterized changes in Fe 0 composition during the treatment of metolachlor. Raman microscopic analysis and X-ray diffraction indicated that the iron source was initially coated with a thin layer of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3), and wüstite (FeO). Temporal mineralogical analysis indicated akaganeite (β-FeOOH), goethite (α-FeOOH), magnetite, and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) formed in the Fe 0 -metolachlor suspension when Al 2 (SO 4) 3 or FeSO 4 were present. Green rust II (Fe 6 (OH) 12 SO 4) was also transiently identified in Fe 0 treatments containing FeSO 4. Although conditions favoring green <b>rust</b> <b>formation</b> in a Fe 0 -batch system increased metolachlor dechlorination, we determined that green rust itself can only marginally contribute to transforming metolachlor. In contrast, metolachlor dechlorination was observed in a batch system containing magnetite or goethite and FeSO 4 at pH 8. These results indicate that creating conditions favoring green rust facilitate Fe 0 -mediated dechlorination of metolachlor by providing an available source of Fe(II) /Fe(III) and generating iron oxide surfaces that can coordinate Fe(II). This information can be useful in designing and managing Fe 0 -treatment systems. ...|$|E
