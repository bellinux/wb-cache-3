5000|$|The Jaguar V12 {{piston engine}} {{was one of}} the premier powerplants of the 1970s and 1980s. [...] It was first seen in the Series 3 Jaguar E-type of 1971 and was based loosely on an earlier design for an {{intended}} Le Mans car, the Jaguar XJ13. The V12 was only Jaguar's second engine design to go into production {{in the history of the}} company. The all-alloy block was fitted with <b>removable</b> <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> and had a SOHC two-valve alloy head with flat block mating surface, and the combustion chamber in the piston crown carved in a shallow cup form.|$|R
5000|$|It {{features}} an exclusive high pressure {{direct fuel injection}} similar to the Pumpe Düse (PD) system found in Volkswagen's car engines, the Hydraulic Electronic Unit Injector - HEUI - with electro-hydraulic digital unit injectors and extended durability, developed by the partner company Siemens/VDO. [...] An important advantage is the <b>removable</b> <b>wet</b> cylinder <b>liners</b> which will assist with easier maintenance and lower costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} water-cooled, and is {{produced}} using cast-iron cylinder block, with <b>removable</b> <b>wet</b> type cylinder <b>liners.</b> The engine utilizes diesel fuel {{delivered in a}} direct injection method from individual electronically controlled and camshaft actuated unit pumps. The cylinder heads are separate units for each cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Setting {{expansion}} of 4 phosphate-bonded investments was measured under 3 different conditions: a hygroscopic condition, a condition using a ring lined with a <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> and a condition using a ring lined {{with a dry}} liner. Accuracy of castings of a Ni-Cr alloy made {{in each of the}} 4 investments in rings lined with a <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> was measured. One investment exhibited negative potential for hygroscopic expansion. Expansion of all investments in wet-lined rings was not significantly different from their expansion under the hygroscopic condition. There {{was no significant difference in}} setting expansion between the investments when a <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> was used. Significant differences in accuracy existed between castings produced in the different investments using a <b>wet</b> <b>liner.</b> The correlation between the setting {{expansion of}} the investments using a <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> and the accuracy of castings produced using a <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> was not high and was not significant. Comparison between investments with regard to their ability to produce accurate castings in terms of mould expansion by measurement of setting expansion is of no value...|$|R

50|$|The same <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> {{engine was}} used {{throughout}} the range until {{the advent of the}} Six model in 1960, and was an overhead-valve unit of 85 mm bore and 92 mm stroke with single Solex downdraught carburettor. The compression ratio was 6.7:1. <b>Wet</b> cylinder <b>liners</b> were fitted. The engine was essentially the same as that made by Standard for the Ferguson tractor, with some changes for automobile use.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> {{engine was}} also used in the Triumph TR series of sports cars from the TR-X and 20TS prototypes to the TR4A. All the TRs using this engine used two SU {{carburettors}} except the TR4A, which used two Strombergs.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> {{engine was}} sold to {{specialist}} manufacturers without the resources {{to build their own}} engines. Most notable among these was Morgan, who used the engine in their Plus 4. Others included sports car maker Peerless, which was later reorganized as Warwick, and Swallow Coachbuilding, who used the engine in their Doretti.|$|R
5000|$|The 1959 Asardo 1500 AR-S was a one-off non-Alfa {{prototype}} {{that used}} a custom-built {{version of the}} Twin Cam.

50|$|At the time, unique {{features}} of the BMW OHV V8 included the aluminium construction of the block and head, and a coolant passage design that increased the block stiffness over typical engines with <b>wet</b> cylinder <b>liners.</b> The layout of the engine is a longitudinally-mounted 90° V8 with cast iron <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> and stiffening webs between the cylinders. Apart from the materials, the engine was similar in overall design to the Cadillac OHV V8 and Oldsmobile V8 engine of the late 1940s, with a central camshaft using pushrods to operating overhead valves in crossflow cylinder heads with wedge-shaped combustion chambers.|$|R
5000|$|The Standard <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> {{inline-four}} {{engine was}} a 2,088 cc inline four cylinder petrol engine {{produced by the}} Standard Motor Company. Originally developed for the Ferguson TE20 tractor, it was widely used for Standard passenger cars of the 1950s, most notably the Vanguard. Later it was successfully used in Standard's popular early generation Triumph TR series sports cars.|$|R
50|$|The B-series {{features}} engine bores machined {{directly into}} the block (rather than the <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> used on earlier Cummins engines). It was also set apart {{by the use of}} a shallow one-piece head, requiring closer tolerances than in other Cummins products. The engine was first manufactured in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and other plants were later added in Mexico, Turkey, and Darlington, UK.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{bought the}} assets of the Triumph Motor Company in 1944 and, after the Second World War, began {{manufacture}} of the Triumph Town and Country saloon and the Triumph Roadster based on pre-war Standard components. The drivetrain of the Roadster was replaced by the Vanguard drivetrain, including the 85 mm <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> engine, in October 1948; the saloon's drivetrain was similarly transplanted in February 1949.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Rover {{were aware that}} they needed to adopt {{innovative}} and reliable new techniques if they were to survive as a car maker and, like Fiat, to throw off their previous problems of poor build quality. One result was the K engine, to be built by Rover's partner Powertrain Ltd. This used a ladder main bearing in all models, giving an extremely rigid block that would later permit a very high redline speed in applications such as the MGF, Lotus Elise and for racing. Unlike the FIRE though, and despite the large numbers sold that served reliably for many years, this engine was tarred with Rover's past flaws and gained a reputation as unreliable. The flaws that gave rise to this reputation were caused by only some components used in only some models: particularly the head gasket and <b>wet</b> <b>liners.</b> Regarding these problems with particular component versions as indicative of poor overall engine design was undeserved. Equally, none of these problems are inherent with the techniques of <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> or through-bolting.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{constructed}} around a monobloc cylinder and crankcase casting. Unusually, this {{was available in}} either cast iron or aluminium alloy. The cylinders were replaceable <b>wet</b> <b>liners,</b> with pumped water cooling. Valves were single OHV exhaust and inlet valves. Seven bearings with cross-bolted caps supported the nitrided crankshaft. The fuel injection system was direct, into a toroidal combustion chamber within the aluminium pistons. Supercharging was by a Roots blower driven at twice crankshaft speed, for a boost pressure of 8 psi.|$|R
50|$|Rolls-Royce's first V8 {{debuted in}} 1905 but was short-lived. The company {{is better known}} for the L Series V8 which started {{development}} in 1952 and entered production in 1959, a joint-effort between Rolls-Royce and Bentley led by engineer Jack Phillips. Following contemporary design practice, it featured overhead valves (OHV), a central camshaft and wedge-shaped combustion chambers. Some of its features were inspired by the Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine, including the aluminium block with <b>wet</b> <b>liners,</b> gear-driven camshaft, (initially) outboard spark-plugs and porting.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> {{cylinder}} block features cylinder walls that are entirely removable, which {{fit into the}} block by means of special gaskets. They {{are referred to as}} [...] "wet liners" [...] because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a sleeve. <b>Wet</b> <b>liner</b> designs are popular with European manufacturers, most notably Renault and Peugeot, who continue to use them to the present. Dry liner designs use either the block's material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain [...] "dry" [...] on their outside, surrounded by the block's material. With either <b>wet</b> or dry <b>liner</b> designs, the liners (or sleeves) can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself; but in reality, they are difficult to remove and install, and for many applications (such as most late-model cars and trucks), an engine will never undergo such a procedure in its working lifespan. It is likelier to be scrapped, with new equipment—engine or entire vehicle—replacing it. This is sometimes rightfully disparaged as a symptom of a throw-away society, but on the other hand, it is actually sometimes more cost-efficient and even environmentally protective to recycle machinery and build new instances with efficient manufacturing processes (and superior machine performance and emission control) than it is to overvalue old machinery and craft production.|$|R

Two diametrically opposed spark plugs protrude into each combustion chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded by {{engineer}} Geoffrey Taylor in Surbiton, Surrey, and produced its first automobile in 1929. Alta's first vehicle was a sports car powered by a 1.1L engine, featuring an aluminium block, <b>wet</b> <b>liners,</b> and shaft-driven twin overhead camshafts, which Taylor designed himself. It was offered in naturally aspirated or supercharged form giving [...] A choice of four speed non-synchromesh or pre-selector gearboxes was available. These were mounted on a low-slung chassis frame with open two- or four-seat bodies. Thirteen were made, of which five are thought to survive.|$|R
5000|$|The car used a twin H4 type SU {{carburettor}} {{version of}} the 121 cid (1991 cc) four-cylinder Standard <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> inline-four engine from the Vanguard, tuned to increase its output to [...] The body was mounted on a substantial separate chassis with coil-sprung independent suspension at the front and a leaf spring live axle at the rear. Either wire or disc wheels could be supplied. The standard transmission was a four-speed manual unit, with overdrive available on top gear as an option. Lockheed drum brakes were fitted all round.|$|R
5000|$|The Kestrel was a post-war {{redesign}} of the Eagle featuring <b>wet</b> cylinder <b>liners</b> in (two) common cylinder blocks. It was developed into the supercharged Peregrine {{and later the}} Goshawk.|$|R
5000|$|The distinctive, and unusual, {{feature of}} the engine was its use of <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> to form the {{cylinders}}. Rather than the cylinders being bored into the cast-iron block, separate thin-walled steel tubes were inserted into a hollow block. The space between liner and block formed a large uninterrupted water jacket, which improved cooling, as did the thin tubes of the liners. The liners only loosely installed into the block with hand pressure. They sealed into the block at the bottom {{by a pair of}} soft metal [...] "spectacle washers" [...] that each sealed a pair of liners. Each liner stood slightly proud of the cylinder block face. so that it formed a good seal against the head gasket when assembled. Such <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> had been used in high performance engines for many years, but this was an early use of them for a low-cost, mass-production engine. Particularly with the advanced grinding techniques necessary to make such a thin-walled tube with good concentricity and surface finish, other manufacturers saw them as over-complex. However Banner Lane's building of sleeve-valve Bristol engines during the war had given them the necessary experience and equipment. Throughout the engine's service it was seen as a dependable and reliable, if slightly staid and tractor-like, engine and these liners never gave the trouble experienced by other engines such as the much later Rover K-series.|$|R

In the Giulietta this engine displaced [...] {{but for the}} Asardo its bore was increased from 74 mm to 79.5 mm with custom pistons and <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> from Mahle so that its final displacement was [...] The Asardo's engine had a compression ratio of 11.5:1 and was equipped with two two-barrel Weber 40mm DCOE3 carburetors. Power output for the engine was estimated to have been [...] @ 6800 rpm. Power went from the engine to the rear axle through an Alfa Romeo four-speed manual transmission.|$|R
50|$|The XU {{design was}} {{introduced}} in 1981 with the Peugeot 305. It was a SOHC or DOHC straight-4 design with two or four valves per cylinder, using petrol as fuel. It was applied transversely in front wheel drive vehicles only, tilted by 30°. Displacement ranged between 1580 and 1998 cc, and all production XU gasoline engines had a bore of 83 mm (3.3 in) or 86 mm (3.4 in). The engine uses in all models aluminium cylinder head. All models blocks are made, except XU10, in cast aluminium alloy with <b>removable</b> cast iron <b>wet</b> cylinder <b>liners.</b> XU10 blocks are made in cast iron, with bores machined directly in the block, without removable cylinder liners. Its first Citroën application was on the Citroën BX in 1983, where it appeared in 1580cc format.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{is powered}} by the Standard <b>wet</b> <b>liner</b> inline four, a 1991 cc straight-four OHV engine {{initially}} producing , an increase of 5 hp over the TR2 thanks to the largerSU-H6 carburettors fitted. This was later increased to 100 bhp at 5000 rpm {{by the addition of}} a [...] "high port" [...] cylinder head and enlarged manifold. The four-speed manual gearbox could be supplemented by an overdrive unit on the top three ratios, electrically operated and controlled by a switch on the dashboard. In 1956 the front brakes were changed from drums to discs, the TR3 thus becoming the first British series production car to be so fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, {{for such}} a modern car, the engine of the {{original}} DS 19 was also old-fashioned. It {{was derived from the}} engine of the 11CV Traction Avant (models 11B and 11C). It was an OHV four-cylinder engine with three main bearings and <b>wet</b> <b>liners,</b> and a bore of 78 mm and a stroke of 100 mm, giving a volumetric displacement of 1911 cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated [...] at 3800 rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated [...] at 4500 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The Hispano-Suiza 12M {{was one of}} two new V-12 engine designs {{first run}} in 1927-8. It {{produced}} about 375 kW (500 hp), was the first to use gas nitride hardening and introduced <b>wet</b> cylinder <b>liners</b> into Hispano-Suiza's aircraft engine range.|$|R
5000|$|Power {{came from}} {{a version of the}} Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine adapted for the 103. This inline four-{{cylinder}} DOHC engine had 2 valves per cylinder and an aluminum head and cylinder block with steel <b>wet</b> <b>liners.</b> In the Tipo 103 it displaced [...] with a bore of 66 mm and a stroke of 65.5 mm. Maximum power was [...] at 5500 rpm. In adapting the Nord engine to a transverse application the engine block and transaxle cases were build as one unit. Power was transmitted to the front wheels through a four-speed fully synchronized manual gearbox. Top speed during testing was 139 kph mph and the standing kilometer took 41.2 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|When new, the Rolls-Royce/Bentley V8 was rumoured {{to be an}} American engine design licence-built, but it was {{developed}} in-house by Rolls-Royce and Bentley engineers. This {{can be seen in}} its design characteristics, with features like an aluminium alloy cylinder block with <b>wet</b> <b>liners,</b> gear-driven camshaft, (initially) outboard spark plugs and porting inspired by the Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine. The bore spacing of 4.75" [...] was unlike any American V8 engine and the firing order was 1-5-4-8-6-3-7-2 something uncommon in any period American OHV V8. The deep skirted crankcase design is also rare with American V8 engines. Rolls-Royce however did use General Motors transmissions in their vehicles, notably the Hydramatic in Silver Cloud and the Turbo-Hydramatic in the Silver Shadow.|$|R
25|$|The Escort entered {{production}} in Brazil in July 1983. It {{was equipped with}} the Renault-based Ford CHT engine, of either 1341 of 1555cc. Both sizes were also available in alcohol-fuelled versions with marginally more power. This model was exported to Sweden, Finland, and to Norway from 1983 until 1986, where it replaced the low priced German-built Escort L. The car had a bad reputation in Scandinavia, with severe rust problems and issues with the <b>wet</b> <b>liners</b> of the Renault-designed engine. The engine was also designed to run on petrol containing some ethanol (15-20%), leading to troubles when using straight petrol. To better deal with the tropical heat, the Brazilian three-door Escort received swing-out rear windows, unlike their European counterparts. The Brazilian Escort LX was also available in Switzerland, only with the larger engine option.|$|R
50|$|Both 12M and 12N were 60° V engines with carburettors, inlets and {{exhausts}} on {{the outer}} faces. There were three carburettors per bank, each charging a pair of cylinders. Much of the new technology was in the cylinder design: these types introduced <b>wet</b> <b>liners,</b> an Hispano automobile engine innovation which brought the cooling water into {{direct contact with the}} steel cylinder barrel rather than by screwing it into an aluminium water jacket. This improved cooling, simplified assembly and allowed larger cylinder bores without increasing their separation. The cylinder barrels were open at top and bottom and threaded for screwing into the block only near the top, with valve seats ground into the aluminium cylinder head. The lower end of the barrel extended into the crankcase, simplifying both manufacture and assembly. Block and crankcase were bolted together.|$|R
