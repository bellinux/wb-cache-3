The rachis is composed of two layers: a pithy, opaque material makes up the core layer called the medulla, which is covered by a thin and translucent outer layer, that features longitudinal internal ridges on the dorsal layer and external ridges on the ventral layer.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the border}} and the border furrow of the cephalon are {{relatively}} narrow. The furrow that divides the glabella in an anterior and posterior part (or transglabellar furrow) is straight or bent slightly rearwards. The posterior lobe is parallel sided, has two pairs of lateral furrows in shape of prominent grooves, or pits small basal lobes, and no median node. The pygidium has a border that is flattened and widened. The pygidium is not entirely subcircular, because posterolateral corners are somewhat developed, but without spines. The lobes of the <b>rhachis</b> are separated by narrow groves (or transaxial furrows) that reach the median node but do not cross the <b>rhachis.</b> The distance between {{the tip of the}} <b>rhachis</b> and the border furrow is short or these even touch, but there is no furrow midline that connects the furrows defining the <b>rhachis</b> and the pygidial border.|$|E

50|$|Acadagnostus has a round cephalon without spines. The cephalic {{border is}} narrow, while the border furrow is wide. The lateral furrows of {{posterior}} lobe of glabella {{can be seen}} as sets of pits or a narrow straight or slightly curved backward furrow. It carries a node at or slightly behind the center of the rear lobe. The pygidium is subquadrate, has a flat border, that is sometimes posteriorly widened and has a weak bifurcation. A pair of small spines at the outer rear corners is present. The border furrow is wide. The <b>rhachis</b> has parallel sides or is conical, but the second segment is not narrower than its neighbours. Furrows crossing the <b>rhachis</b> are absent or weak. The segments are shown by differences in relief of the <b>rhachis.</b> There is a large median node, and a postaxial furrow is present, but usually very short.|$|E
5000|$|Trinodus {{is derived}} from the Latin tri (three) and nodus (node).Arthrorhachis {{is derived from}} the Greek ἄρθρον (árthron, [...] "joint") and ῥάχις (<b>rháchis,</b> meaning axis, spine, ridge or backbone).|$|E
50|$|Like all Agnostida, Lotagnostus is diminutive, {{with the}} headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) of {{approximately}} the same size (or isopygous) and outline. Like all Agnostina, Lotagnostus has only two thorax segments. The species are characterized by variable stages of effacement, more so on the outer/dorsal surface compared to the inner/ventral surface. This may complicate distinction from effaced species in other genera. The frontal lobe the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is long at about ⅓ {{or more of the}} length of the glabella. The basal lobes {{at the rear of the}} glabella are narrow triangular and equal in length to the frontal lobe. The central part of the glabella has two side lobes. Opposite the tip of the side lobes there is a node on the midline. There is a furrow at midline connecting the glabella with the border furrow. The axis of the pygidium (or <b>rhachis)</b> has three sections. The frontal section is split into three parts. Both lateral parts are defined by furrows on all sides: those with the central section directed backward and very slightly outward, those with the middle section outward and slightly backward, and those with the pleural zone backward and slightly inward. The middle part is merged with the central section. The middle part carries a node. The furrow between the central and rear parts is transverse, and those with the pleural zone backward and slightly inward. The rear part is about twice as long as the frontal and central parts individually. The surrounding axial furrow is directed outward, than strongly bends backward and than curves regularly ever more inward. Over the posterior ⅔ of the rear part a strip about as wide as the node on the central part may be discernible, which ends in a node that at the very rear of the <b>rhachis.</b> The distance between the <b>rhachis</b> and the border furrow (or post axial length) is about equal to ¼ of the <b>rhachis.</b> The pygidial border is about ⅛ of the <b>rhachis.</b> Opposite to the rear of the <b>rhachis</b> the border may carry a small spine at each side.|$|E

50|$|Inflorescence {{composed}} of racemes. Racemes borne along a central axis; unilateral. <b>Rhachis</b> flattened (2), or angular (2). Spikelet packing adaxial; 2 -rowed (1/1). Spikelets appressed (1), or ascending (3); solitary. Fertile spikelets sessile.|$|E
50|$|Like all Agnostida, Toragnostus is diminutive, {{with the}} headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) of {{approximately}} the same size (or isopygous) and outline. Like all Agnostina, Toragnostus has only two thorax segments. The cephalon and pygidium are almost completely effaced, lacking a cephalic border and with wide pygidial border. The cephalon is strongly convex. The central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is outlined at the rear, narrow and tapering forward. It carries an elongated median node, clearly in the front half of the cephalon. The pygidial axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> is very broad, with the frontal lobe (M1) defined by a furrow crossing the axis. There is a weak elongated node on the <b>rhachis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The headshield (or cephalon) is convex, and axial furrow that {{surrounds}} the central area (or glabella) almost obsolete, particularly on the external surface. The glabella has no transvers furrows. The border furrow is distinct and wide anteriorly, and the border distinct and narrow. The eye lobe (or palpebral lobe) is poorly defined. The free cheeks (or librigenae) are long. The thorax has three segments. The tailshield (or pygidium) has a long axis of 10 almost indiscernible rings. The furrow that defines the axis in the pygidium (or <b>rhachis)</b> is almost obsolete. The area outside the <b>rhachis</b> (or pleural zone) is usually smooth, and like on the cephalon, the border and border furrow are very narrow but distinct.|$|E
50|$|C. bella flowers between September and January and {{produces}} axillary, or rarely terminal, inflorescences with an expanded <b>rhachis</b> and perfumed creamy-white flowers. It then fruits between January and December producing pedicellate, cupular to barrel-shaped fruit that is 0.8 to 1.1 cm long and 0.6 to 1.1 cm wide.|$|E
50|$|Upper {{surface of}} leaf petiole usually with 2 narrow glands; <b>rhachis</b> puberulous; 4-11 pinna pairs; 11-17 pinnule pairs, oblong, rounded at apex, asymmetrically rounded or subtruncate at base, {{averaging}} 1.2-3.2 cm. long, 5-12 mm. wide, glabrous but slightly puberulous near base, 2 longitudinal nerves more distinct than the others.|$|E
50|$|This agnostoid is {{strongly}} effaced. The cephalon lacks a border furrow. The glabella and small basal lobes are weakly defined.

50|$|Thoracocare is a {{very small}} to minute {{trilobite}} (1.7 - 3.6 mm long in adulthood), with an elliptical body outline. The headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) are of approximately same size (or isopygous) with 2 thoracic segments between them. The central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is broad, subrectangular, tapering slightly to the back in larger specimens and touching the frontal border, and without transverse furrows. Fixed cheeks are subtriangular. Free cheeks are rarely present. Dorsal sutures are proparian. The pygidium is subcircular, about 1⅔× as wide as long. The segmentation of the pygidial axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> and pleura is indiscernible or very weak. The <b>rhachis</b> is about ⅓ of the pygidial width anteriorly, tapering evenly backwards. There is no pygidial border. There may be small spines extending from the frontal corners of the pygidium.|$|E

50|$|Geragnostus is {{very similar}} to Trinodus and may in future be {{included}} in that genus. In Trinodus the posterior lobe (M3) of the pygidial axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> is clearly shorter than the anterior and middle lobes (M1+M2) combined, while in Geragnostus it is equal or greater in length. Geragnostus is not closely related to Micragnostus, because its glabella is structurally different.|$|E
50|$|The pygidial axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> is - {{times as}} long as the pygidium, almost parallel-sided, very {{slightly}} constricted at the middle lobe (M2), broadly rounded, and - {{times as long}} as wide. It has three distinct pairs of lobes, and is defined by shallow furrows. The forward lobe of the <b>rhachis</b> (M1) is a bit shorter and wider than the middle lobe (M2) and separated from it by a furrow (F1) which is directed outward and slightly backward from the dorsal furrow, and then curved strongly forward adaxially. The rear lobe (M3) is - longer than both others together, and the furrow is directed outward and slightly forward from the dorsal furrow. The middle lobe has a prominent tubercle, which extends backwards above the anterior portion of rear lobe. It is the highest point of the pygidium. The border is moderately wide, gently convex, defined by a shallow furrow, and widest at the rear corners which carry a pair of strong, backwardly directed spines.|$|E
50|$|Like all Agnostida, {{members of}} the Condylopygidae are diminutive, with the headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) of {{approximately}} the same size (or isopygous) and outline, and only two thorax segments. The characteristic sidewise expansion of the frontal lobe of the glabella, occipital structures instead of basal lobes, and a <b>rhachis</b> with three pairs of side lobes and a rear lobe differentiate Condylopygoidea from Agnostoidea.|$|E
50|$|The headshield (or cephalon) of Globampyx is densely {{covered with}} very small granules. The central raised {{area of the}} cephalon (or glabella) has an {{inverted}} flask-shape. It lacks the rapier-like glabellar spine of many other raphiophorids, but only has a tubercle. The thorax has five segments. The short but wide triangular pygidium, with a rather low axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> of up to six indistinct rings that reaches the faint border furrow.|$|E
50|$|Phalagnostus is a genus {{of small}} trilobites, {{in the order}} Agnostida. It lived during the Middle Cambrian, in what are now Canada (Newfoundland and Northwest Territories), China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, England, France, the Russian Federation (Bennett Island, Yakutia), Wales, Sweden, and {{possibly}} the United States (Vermont). The headshield (or cephalon) is almost entirely effaced and wider than the tailshield (or pygidium). The pygidium is also very effaced, but the ovate pygidial axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> is well defined and a border furrow is also present.|$|E
50|$|Ovatoryctocara is a genus {{of small}} corynexochid trilobites from the Cambrian, {{that lived in}} what now are Siberia, China, Greenland and Canada (Newfoundland). Ovatoryctocara can be {{recognised}} by {{the combination of the}} following characters: the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is approximately cylindrical and has two rows of four triangular or round pits. The thorax only has 5 or 6 segments. The tailshield (or pygidium) has an axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> of 6 to 12 rings, the pleural furrows are well developed and the border is absent or narrow as a hair.|$|E
50|$|Trinodus, Arthrorhachis and Geragnostus {{are closely}} related {{and it may be}} {{appropriate}} to assign their species to just one genus. All species in these three genera have virtually identical cephalons, but of T. agnostiformes, the type species of Trinodus only one poorly preserved cephalon was known. However, relatively recent, pygidia assignable to T. agnostiformes were found. Although this material is distorted or incompletely preserved, it is very similar to the pygidium of Arthrorhachis tarda. Species with a rear <b>rhachis</b> lobe longer than the postaxial region are henceforth combined in Geragnostus, all others are assigned to Trinodus.|$|E
50|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins {{are normally}} carried horizontally, perhaps helping the fish attain {{the profile of}} a shark. The first dorsal fin has six to 9 independent, short, stout, sharp spines. The family name Rachycentridae, from the Greek words <b>rhachis</b> ("spine") and kentron ("sting"), was inspired by these dorsal spines. The mature cobia has a forked, slightly lunated tail, which is usually dark brown. The fish lacks a swim bladder. The juvenile cobia is patterned with conspicuous bands of black and white and has a rounded tail. The largest cobia taken on rod and reel came from Shark Bay, Australia, and weighed 60 kg (135 lb).|$|E

Stems are solid, usually less than 2 m tall. These stems or young twigs are glabrous or sparsely glabrous and sparsely to densely hairy. This species has compound leaves with pinnate veination. There are approximately 4-6 leaflets per leaf, which are arranged spirally and alternately. The leaflets are elliptical, and shortly hairy on both sides. There is a small reddish gland between each leaflet pair on the <b>rhachis</b> of arachoides subspecies. The stipules are usually have lanceolate-triangular shape. They are approximately 3-9 mm long and early spreading -deflexed.|$|E
5000|$|Ceroxylon vogelianum is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} palm with a stem of 3-17 meters tall and 12-25 cm in diameter. The crown can have 6 to 18 leaves, most of them almost upright or horizontally arranged. Leaf blades are made of 46-129 leaflets in a <b>rhachis</b> of 38-210 cm long; petiole 15-75 cm long.

5000|$|The trunk {{is often}} subterranean, and can {{grow up to}} a meter in length. Its roots {{contract}} due {{to the collapse of}} transverse sheets of cells in the cortex. It is thought that this contraction can help prevent seedlings from desiccation as they develop.The leaves are pinnately compound and can grow up to two meters long. They are typically hard-textured, and green. [...] Young leaves are described as being hairy, and ranging from dark green to coppery brown in color. [...] Each leaflet is about 15 cm long and about 3.5 to 5 cm wide. The leaflets can be flat or twisted, and are usually broad with spine-tipped lobes. [...] They are inserted at about 70° on the <b>rhachis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cnemidopyge is a genus of trilobites {{that lived}} during the Ordovician. Like all Raphiophorids it is blind, with a headshield (or cephalon) that is subtriangular to subsemicircular, {{carrying}} genal spines and a forward directed rapier-like spine {{on the central}} raised area (or glabella), with {{the front of the}} glabella inflated and the natural fracture lines (or sutures) of the cephalon coinciding with its margin. It may be easily distinguished from other raphiophorids by the rectangular thorax with 6 segments, where other genera have a different number of segments and segments change in width over the length of the thorax. Uniquely in this genus, the inner pleural region of the frontal segment is enlarged. Also the axis (or <b>rhachis)</b> and pleural fields of the pygidium are strongly segmented.|$|E
