5|$|Human Entertainment's Dance Aerobics was {{an early}} rhythm-based video game {{released}} in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo's Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and {{as one of the}} first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed the core of future rhythm games. The success of PaRappa the Rapper sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game Beatmania in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> that emulates a vinyl record. Beatmania was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami's Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include GuitarFreaks, which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998's Pop'n Music, a game similar to Beatmania in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the GuitarFreaks franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red Octane and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero. In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad because of the cost of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title DrumMania featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game Rock Band.|$|E
25|$|Inmates {{who were}} in the SCU for {{disciplinary}} or administrative reasons would be confined to their cells for 23.5 hours per day. They would be given half an hour of exercise, which consisted of walking alone in the corridor between cells in the SCU. A <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> and blanket would be delivered in the evening and collected each morning. The inmates would not have any opportunity to see the outdoors. Inmates {{who were in}} the SCU for protective custody would be allowed to retain the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> and blanket throughout the day, and would sometimes be permitted to exercise outdoors for half an hour per day. Inmates were not permitted to speak to one another, work, attend school, visit the library, watch TV, or engage in any other interactive activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{was found}} to be due to a broken rail at a rail joint, where a fatigue crack through the first bolt hole in a running-on rail had progressively developed and a triangular piece of rail had broken out. The sleeper at the joint had previously failed and been replaced with a shallower timber replacement. This replacement had not been well packed, was on a shallow layer of clean ballast and the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> supporting the rail on the adjacent concrete sleeper was missing.|$|E
50|$|Round <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> were {{introduced}} with the TD-7 drum module in 1992 (previous Roland pads were polygonal) and were universally used as trigger pads for drums and cymbals. Since {{the introduction of}} mesh-head drum pads and cymbal-shaped trigger <b>pads,</b> standard <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> are only used as tom-tom and (until recently) bass drum trigger pads on Roland's less expensive drum kits. More expensive kits don't include any <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> at all any more.|$|R

25|$|The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. The only {{difference}} was {{the presence of}} the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated {{to the center of the}} rear panel over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The 258 six included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170hp. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller <b>rubber</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{well known}} {{use of the}} High-Low System was by the U.S. Army with the {{introduction}} of the M79 grenade launcher shortly before the Vietnam War. [...] The M79 fired a 40-mm shell which contained a standard fragmentation grenade with a modified fuze. [...] The cartridge casing contained a heavy cup-shaped [...] "High Pressure Chamber" [...] in the bottom. [...] On firing, the propellant builds up pressure until it breaks through the copper cover, venting out to the [...] "Low Pressure Chamber". [...] The U.S. Army referred to their high-low system as the High-Low Propulsion System. [...] Along with a heavy <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> on the M79 butt stock, the High-Low system kept recoil forces manageable for the infantryman using the weapon.|$|E

2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E
2500|$|The endpin or spike {{is made of}} wood, {{metal or}} rigid carbon fibre and {{supports}} the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them. [...] In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was [...] "introduced by Adrien Servais [...] 1845 to give the instrument greater stability". Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word [...] "endpin" [...] sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called [...] "tailpin".) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.|$|E
60|$|Sitting low {{among the}} cases now, Dane made careful {{preparations}} {{for his own}} share in the approaching tragedy. That it would prove one he felt certain. He cleaned Maxwell's gun with a loving care, polishing {{the inside of the}} barrel until it glistened, and touching each part of the action with oil. The weapon was a heavy, single eight-bore, with a <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> on the heel; part of this Dane cut away, leaving the steel bare, because he knew that at close quarters the butt of a heavy gun may prove as deadly as the muzzle. It was with a curious stirring of recollections that he saw the dead man's initials cut into the elevated rib, and because of them his face was the sterner as he laid down the weapon. At short range in the darkness it was likely to prove more formidable than any rifle, and--for Dane was wholly {{under the influence of the}} monomania--his own safety counted for little if he could use it with due effect.|$|E

50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> by a blank holder, through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the ram slides down, then the blank holder moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> {{forming process}} only a milled lower die is {{required}} {{on which a}} metal plate is placed. Afterwards, {{the shape of the}} lower die is pressed in the plate with the rubber mold. In most cases, the contour, hole patterns and the like will be cut with a 3D laser cutter.The simplicity of the rubber press tool causes tooling costs to be around 85 to 90% lower than those of regular deep drawing while the variable costs are higher. This combination makes <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> pressing very suitable for smaller and medium-sized series (up to 5,000-10,000 pieces per year), even though traditional cutting, lace, welding, finishing etc. is used more due to the unfamiliarity with <b>rubber</b> <b>pad</b> forming.|$|E

40|$|A seismic {{isolator}} has {{the main}} function {{to be extremely}} deformable for horizontal forces, but at same time sufficiently stiff when loaded with vertical actions. These properties may be strongly influenced by both the isolator geometry (i. e. overall dimensions, number and thickness of <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> and steel laminas) and the mechanical properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>pads.</b> Mechanical properties of the pads, especially Young modulus, may be evaluated {{as a function of}} hardness, by means of consolidated empirical formulas. In this work, the influence of <b>rubber</b> <b>pads</b> thickness and hardness on both vertical and horizontal stiffness of realistic seismic isolators is discussed. Three full 3 D Finite Element models referred to three different seismic isolators having different slenderness are analysed in detail in both vertical compression (elastic analysis) and simple shear in large deformations. Uniaxial and shear response of the seismic devices obtained numerically are finally critically compared, with the aim of evaluating the best compound to be used in practice...|$|R
