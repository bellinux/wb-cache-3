5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The {{long jump}} {{is one of}} the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
5|$|The multifidus muscles <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{down along}} the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E

25|$|A double mini-trampoline {{is smaller}} than a {{regulation}} competition trampoline. It has a sloped end and a flat bed. The gymnasts <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> jump onto the sloping end and then jump onto the flat part before dismounting onto a mat. Skills are performed during the jumps or as they dismount.|$|E
25|$|This led Johnson and Smith to {{note that}} Bavetta, a {{physically}} fit referee whose job required him to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the court on a nightly basis, would likely beat Barkley in a race. Bavetta challenged Barkley to a footrace, which was then scheduled for the upcoming All-Star Weekend.|$|E
25|$|Law 20: Dead ball. The ball {{comes into}} play when the bowler begins his <b>run</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> becomes dead when all the action from that ball is over. Once the ball is dead, no runs can be scored and no batsmen can be dismissed. The ball becomes dead {{for a number of}} reasons, most {{commonly}} when a batsman is dismissed, when a boundary is hit, or when the ball has finally settled with the bowler or wicketkeeper.|$|E

25|$|Another main {{factor is}} the tension placed on the ligaments that support the navicular bone. Some experts believe that the {{degenerative}} process begins with excess tension placed on these ligaments, causing strain and inflammation. Inflammation from strain of the impar ligament can decrease blood flow {{to and from the}} navicular bone, as the major blood vessels supplying the bone <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down this area. If the ligament continues to be strained, it can thicken and permanently reduce blood flow to the navicular bone.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1864, in the Battle of Lynchburg, Early's {{combined}} forces, though outnumbered, repelled Union General Hunter's troops. Lynchburg's defenders {{had taken}} pains {{to create a}} false impression that the Confederate forces within the city were much larger. For example, a train was continuously <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the tracks while drummers played and Lynchburg citizens cheered as if reinforcements were disembarking. Local prostitutes {{took part in the}} deception, misinforming their Union clients of the large number of Confederate reinforcements. Narcissa Owen, wife of the President of the Lynchburg and Tennessee Railroad, later wrote about her similar deception of Union spies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} three tests of the 2006–07 Ashes series, he only took eight wickets and was fined for {{excessive}} appealing in the Third Test in Adelaide when a LBW decision was not in his favour. However, during the week period between the Adelaide and Melbourne tests, he worked with Troy Cooley, Australia's bowling coach, to adjust his <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> came back in the 4th and final tests with more wickets. He finished the series 20 wickets, with his best bowling figures being 4 for 47 {{at an average of}} 33.20, including 6 in the final test. His tally was only bettered by his teammates Stuart Clark, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath as the quartet claimed more wickets than the entire England bowling attack combined.|$|E

25|$|After {{cutting down}} his <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{increasing}} his pace through work with Hampshire team mates Shane Warne and Stuart Clark, Tremlett {{came back into}} Test contention in 2007 after a rash of injuries to established bowlers. He played for the England Lions against India in their final warm up game before the first Test and finally made his Test début at Lords against India on 19 July 2007 after Matthew Hoggard was ruled out with a back complaint. His grandfather having played Test cricket, Chris Tremlett became the fourth grandson of a Test cricketer to make a Test debut without his father having also played Tests. He is also the first Hampshire born Hampshire county cricketer to play a Test in England. He made a pair on debut, but took 4 wickets and during his second match, he took 3 wickets in each innings, and finished with figures of 3/12 as India cruised to a 7-wicket victory needing just 73 to win.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} {{arrived in}} Fremantle on 7 October and Cowdrey learnt by telegram {{that his father}} had died, but he decided to continue the tour. Four days later played their first match of a long tour against a local Country XI on a small, sandy ground 20 yards from the beach. The A.C.B. liked these games as they encouraged grassroots cricket. They were less popular with the tourists as they involved travelling to distant grounds to play in front of small crowds. However, one or two of these games were useful {{at the beginning of the}} tour to allow the players to warm up and Bunbury was close enough to Fremantle and Perth for hundreds to come and see the game. The Country teams could sometime surprise the opposition, and this team included three first-class players, including spinners Morgan Herbert and Eric James, both players for Tambellup–Cranbrook. Hutton won the toss and the MCC belted 344/5 in less than a day with Hutton (59), Edrich (129), Graveney (58) and Cowdrey (48 not out) entertaining the crowd. A declaration before stumps saw no Country wickets fall and 51 was added for the first wicket, but then Big Jim McConnon's off-spin worked its way through the middle order as he took 5/30 after Peter Loader (4/35) and Tyson (1/35) removed the openers and the home side were all out for 116. Put back in again they survived the day, and the match, at 128/6 with Colin Cowdrey's good natured leg-spin taking 4/35. Tyson ploughed up the sand on his long <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> could not bowl at full pace and was described by one reporter as a zephyr rather than a typhoon.|$|E
25|$|Doug Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball {{fiercely}} and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.|$|E

The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch. The cap edge, or margin, is rolled inward in young specimens. The crowded gills are [...] and white to cream in colour initially, brownish-cream or pinkish brown in maturity, and sometimes with yellow or rust-coloured marks close to the margins. The stem is central (that is, it joins the cap in the centre) and is up to [...] long by [...] thick. It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex, sometimes almost bulb-like. The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down its length. It has a floppy yellow wool-like ring which may develop irregular, jagged edges with time. The flesh is white, and in the stem has a woolly or stringy consistency. Although it has a hot-bitter taste, Armillaria luteobubalina is edible, and cooking removes the bitterness.|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|The club's first-ever Football League game {{took place}} on 5 September 1896, at Lincoln City.
