40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{alternative approaches}} to building sound financial structures in emerging market economies. The foremost task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> resolve the bad loan problem and to recapitalize insolvent state banks. By restoring {{an incentive for}} banks to price accurately the risks of new lending, this effort would be {{an important first step}} in strengthening financial control. However, we argue that this endeavor {{is only part of the}} task at hand; the <b>remainder</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>financing</b> that facilitates the economic restructuring of SOEs. A comprehensive strategy may involve combining discipline derived from enforcing existing loans to SOEs with adequate funding for new forms of ownership, including financing for enterprise sell-offs and leasing. ...|$|R
2500|$|In February 2006, Mayor Williams resubmitted to {{the city}} council his three-year-old {{proposal}} for public financing the convention headquarters hotel. With the likely cost of the hotel now at $650 million, Williams asked the city to sell $187 million in TIF bonds to WCSA, which in turn would sell WCSA bonds based on its own revenues {{as well as those}} of the TIF. WCSA would use its own bond sales to pay $187 million of the hotel's construction costs, with the <b>remainder</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> privately <b>financed</b> by Marriott and RLJ Development. The Williams proposal also leased the publicly owned land to Marriott and its partners for 99 years at a cost of $37 million. The deal permitted Marriott to build a 1,434-room hotel with [...] of meeting space and 600 parking spaces. Additionally, Marriott would permit WCSA to build a [...] meeting center on the site. (WCSA said it would finance this center separately from the WCSA bond sale.) Although city chief financial officer Natwar Gandhi doubted the hotel would generate enough tax revenue to meet TIF needs, Marriott consultant MuniCap estimated the hotel would generate $44.2 million in tax revenue three years after its completion. To ensure that construction began by 2008, the legislation also contained eminent domain language allowing the city to obtain title to two small properties within the parcel which it had not yet acquired.|$|R
