5|$|Hazen's {{objective}} was to extend a road in a northwest direction following the general path of an old Cohâssiac Indian trail from Lower Coös to St. Johns, Quebec.

5|$|Route371 {{originates}} as a <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> in1791 {{and later}} {{used for the}} Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike in1806. The new turnpike was finished in1811 and renamed as the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike in accordance for the extension to Great Bend, Pennsylvania. The turnpike was abandoned in1853. Route371 was originally designated along the turnpike route in1936 by the Department of Highways from Great Bend to Damascus. The route remained intact until1954, when the route was truncated back to Route171 in Herrick Center. The route was replaced by Route374 and Route848 in 1961.|$|E

5|$|The hill {{also has}} two disused quarries, one quarry {{listed on the}} North West side on an 1911 map, and another one listed as an old quarry on the West side in 1885–1900. It was {{acquired}} by the National Trust in 1930. People protesting against the building of an A46 bypass <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> a small turf maze into the hill, during {{the construction of the}} bypass in the mid-1990s. In one day of protests, 11 people, including George Monbiot, were hospitalised as a result of beatings by the security guards.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias had {{organized}} {{an assault on}} the new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region. Caxias had a <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side of}} the Paraguayan River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The Allied forces outflanked the Paraguayan lines and attacked from the rear. The combined allied forces annihilated the Paraguayan army and on 1 January 1869 Asunción was occupied.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{arguments}} in favor of the construction of I-68 was that the freeway would improve the poor economic conditions in western Maryland. The economy of the surrounding area has improved since the construction of the freeway, especially in Garrett County, where the freeway opened up the county to tourism from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Correspondingly, Garrett County saw a sharp increase in population and employment during and after the construction of the road, with full- and part-time employment increasing from 8,868 in 1976 to 15,334 in 1991. However, economic difficulties remain in Allegany and Garrett counties. There were concerns over loss of customers to businesses that have been cut off from the main highway due to the construction of the new alignment in the 1980s, leading to protests when then-Governor Harry Hughes visited the Sideling Hill <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> when it was opened.|$|E

5|$|The first road {{along the}} {{corridor}} of MD 30 was a wagon <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> along an existing Indian trail in 1736 and 1737 to connect the Conewago Settlement, which later became Hanover, with Baltimore Town, which served as a much closer port for farmers and merchants in York County and Adams County, Pennsylvania, than Philadelphia. This road {{became known as the}} Conewago Road, Pack Horse Road, or the Wheelbarrow Road, the last due to the namesake implements being used to haul stones to widen the road by order of Maryland in 1793. The highway became a toll road with the 1805 incorporation of the Baltimore and Reisterstown Turnpike Company, which operated between the two towns and split into Westminster and Hanover branches in Reisterstown. The latter branch became known as the Hanover Turnpike or the Baltimore and Hanover Turnpike and had ceased to collect tolls by 1899.|$|E
25|$|Several {{options were}} considered, {{including}} dualization of the tunnels, addition of two lanes {{through a large}} <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> in the mountain, leaving the other two lanes in the tunnel, and replacement of the entire tunnel with an open cut to the north. Citing the high maintenance costs of a tunnel, the replacement option was ultimately chosen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} basic methods of {{blasting}} {{in the construction}} of the (one-sided and double sided) <b>road</b> <b>cuts</b> in hilly terrain with different inclinations. By applying of these methods we get stable slopes of manufactured <b>road</b> <b>cuts,</b> minimal (or no) damage of the rest solid rocks. It is important to emphasize that the stable and undeformed slopes of the <b>road</b> <b>cuts,</b> to avoid the additional work of restoration and protection of slopes from landslides on the road. The application of these methods has a practical contribution in reducing the cost of building roads, and more importantly it will contribute to the increased safety in road traffic due to the substantially eliminated landslides...|$|R
25|$|After three years, {{during which}} {{surveyors}} sometimes had to rappel down the mountain's cliffs {{to mark the}} route, construction began in 1916. The original idea to build a tunnel was changed to a <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> into the side as lighting {{it would have been}} too expensive and it would have missed the most scenic aspects of the road. Accordingly, the specifications for the project were changed. The planned road was widened from , with a three-foot (1 m) concrete gutter.|$|E
25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} {{has recently}} been a hindrance to {{the completion of the}} construction of Interstate 99 near State College, Pennsylvania. However, this acid rock drainage didn't come from a mine; rather, it was produced by oxidation of pyrite-rich rock which was unearthed during a <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> and then used as filler material in the I-99 construction. A similar situation developed at the Halifax airport in Canada. It is from these and similar experiences that the term acid rock drainage has emerged as being preferable to acid mine drainage, thereby emphasizing the general nature of the problem.|$|E

25|$|To the west, Hill {{drove in}} the French {{outposts}} but {{the fighting was}} not serious. His forces suffered about 80 casualties. Exceeding his orders, Thomas Picton mounted a full-scale attack on the Pont Jumeaux with his 3rd Division and was repulsed with 400 casualties. Meanwhile, Beresford's men encountered muddy fields and fell behind schedule. Unable to move his artillery, he ordered the cannons {{to take a position}} near the northern end of the Heights and open fire. Freire, thinking this was the signal for the combined attack, sent his men to assault the Heights. The Spanish infantry forged uphill and gained a momentary foothold in a <b>road</b> <b>cut,</b> but they were counter-attacked by a cloud of French skirmishers and soon sent fleeing. Covered by the Light Division, the Spanish foot soldiers rallied, then attacked and were defeated a second time.|$|E

500|$|Interstate 68 (I-68) is a [...] Interstate Highway in the U.S. {{states of}} West Virginia and Maryland, {{connecting}} I-79 in Morgantown, West Virginia, to I-70 in Hancock, Maryland. I-68 is also Corridor E of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From 1965 until the freeway's construction {{was completed in}} 1991, it was designated as U.S. Route48 (US48). In Maryland, the highway {{is known as the}} National Freeway, an homage to the historic National Road, which I-68 parallels between Keysers Ridge and Hancock. The freeway mainly spans rural areas and crosses numerous mountain ridges along its route. A <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> at Sideling Hill exposed geological features of the mountain and has become a tourist attraction.|$|E
500|$|Pressing his advantage, {{the marquis}} began {{organizing}} {{an assault on}} the new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region, both considered to be nearly impassable by a large force. Rather than making a frontal attack on López's line, Caxias had a <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> through the Chaco. The road was finished by early December, allowing the allied forces to outflank the Paraguayan lines and attack from the rear. In three successive battles (Ytororó, Avay and Lomas Valentinas) which became known as Dezembrada (Deed of December), the combined allied forces annihilated the Paraguayan army. López barely managed to escape with a few followers, and on 1 January 1869, the Brazilians occupied Asunción. According to historian Ronaldo Vainfas, Caxias' [...] "performance ahead of the allied forces contributed in an unquestionable way to the final triumph over the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|I-676 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76 and US 30) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{heading to the}} east on the six-lane Vine Street Expressway concurrent with US 30.

From this point, the Vine Street Expressway enters a depressed <b>road</b> <b>cut</b> and passes under several streets, running along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia. [...] Vine Street serves as a frontage road to the freeway at street level. Within this alignment, there is an exit for PA 611 (Broad Street). After passing under 10th Street in Chinatown, the last street the depressed alignment passes under, the highway rises up and reaches a split between the Vine Street Expressway, which continues to I-95, [...] and I-676/US 30. At this split, there is also an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for 8th Street. After exiting the Vine Street Expressway, eastbound I-676/US 30 has a brief at-grade portion along southbound 6th Street to the Ben Franklin Bridge approach, an example of a non–limited access section of Interstate Highway. Westbound I-676/US 30 has a ramp from the bridge to the Vine Street Expressway that intersects 7th Street and 8th Street at-grade. From this point, I-676/US 30 crosses over the Delaware River on the seven-lane Ben Franklin Bridge, which also carries pedestrians and the PATCO Speedline. This bridge and its approaches are maintained by the Delaware River Port Authority.|$|E
