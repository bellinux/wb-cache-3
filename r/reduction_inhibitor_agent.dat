Universidade do PortoThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of various factors on the inhibition of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) related to wine. The bacteria chosen were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus mali, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Oenococcus oeni. The choice fell on their importance in the wine world both as agents of malolactic fermentation as for production of microbiological changes in wine. In the first perspective growths of LAB were performed in wine. However, the absence of growth led to carry out tests on synthetic medium MRS. In this context, the work involved the construction of a central composite design by response surface method using three factors: glucose (2 - 10 g/L), ethanol (10 - 15 % (v/v)) and carbon dioxide sulfur (0 - 40 mg/L), chosen because of its importance in wine. The results showed that ethanol was dominant as an <b>inhibitor</b> <b>agent,</b> above 14 %, and with a slow growth of 12. 5 % as opposed to sulfur dioxide, which, in the tested concentrations did not manifest itself as an <b>inhibitor</b> <b>agent.</b> Glucose did not show a stimulating effect on growth which contradicted inhibition by ethanol...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo entrap a {{corrosion}} <b>inhibitor</b> <b>agent</b> into a host matrix {{and avoid}} its possible weakening/plasticizing toward an organic coating {{as well as}} in enabling its progressive release under stimuli, Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) framework is here selected as its role as a coating filler to provide a barrier effect due to its associated aspect ratio. To protect aluminum alloy AA 2024 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was chosen because of its interaction with copper rich intermetallic phases. Characterization of the inorganic-organic (I/O) hybrid phase confirms the formation of LDH-type sheets with an unusual high charge density. LDH/EDTA is evaluated as corrosion <b>inhibitor</b> <b>agent</b> in the presence of aggressive chloride anions and compared to chromate, carbonate and chloride interleaved LDH anions. The mechanism of inhibitor release from the inorganic LDH container is studied by X-ray diffraction and its efficiency when embarked into an epoxy-based coating is characterized by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and DC-Polarization experiments using Tafel plot refinements. The possible corrosion mechanisms are discussed {{as a function of the}} EDTA/LDH action under such particular conditions and the associated protection is scrutinized evolving diadochy, buffering and possible complexing reaction against electrolyte salt concentration versus exposure time.

40|$|AbstractPlatelets {{interact}} with the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in the maintenance of hemostasis. However, these physiologic mechanisms may become pathologic, requiring prevention and treatment. In this review, the following clinical developments are analyzed: 1) the role of platelets in thrombogenesis; 2) the pharmacology of platelet inhibitory agents; and, most important, 3) the results of recent randomized trials of platelet <b>inhibitor</b> <b>agents</b> in different cardiovascular disorders. Aspirin reduces mortality and infarction rates in unstable angina and significantly decreases vascular mortality in acute myocardial infarction. Platelet inhibitors decrease mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events in the chronic phase after myocardial infarction. They also decrease vein graft occlusion rates after coronary bypass surgery. Although platelet inhibitors are beneficial in preventing acute vessel occlusion during coronary angioplasty, they are ineffective in preventing chronic restenosis. Antiplatelet agents, combined with warfarin, reduce thromboembolic events in patients with a mechanical prosthesis. Platelet inhibitors are also effective in secondary prevention of vascular events in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Finally, the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is still evolving, particularly in individuals at high risk. In conclusion, platelet inhibitors are effective in patients {{with a variety of}} cardiovascular disorders. The best studied, most inexpensive and least toxic agent is aspirin at a daily dose of 160 to 325 mg. Studies using new platelet <b>inhibitor</b> <b>agents</b> with different mechanisms of action are currently underway...|$|R

Reversible Acetylcholinesterase <b>inhibitor</b> <b>agents</b> such as physostigmine {{can be used as}} an antidote in life-threatening cases. Wider use is discouraged due to the significant side effects related to cholinergic excess including: seizures, muscle weakness, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, lacrimation, salivation, bronchorrhea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Even in documented cases of anticholinergic toxicity, seizures have been reported after the rapid administration of physostigmine. Asystole has occurred after physostigmine administration for tricyclic antidepressant overdose, so a conduction delay (QRS > 0.10 second) or suggestion of tricyclic antidepressant ingestion is generally considered a contraindication to physostigmine administration.|$|R
