5|$|Nansouty's {{division}} {{suffered a}} very high casualty rate at the Battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost {{than the other two}} heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, despite the fact that only the carabiniers-à-cheval <b>really</b> <b>came</b> into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly battered two carabiniers-à-cheval regiments had no more than 300 horses standing between themselves {{by the end of the}} day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent, with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties. Bessières's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle.|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} <b>really</b> <b>came,</b> I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

Thenceforth, a refurbishment program was undertaken, including the addition of large roof windows, which admitted more light into the centre. USS also created the Sherwood Square area and added the popular Frog Clock.|$|E
25|$|Chadwick’s work <b>really</b> <b>came</b> to {{prominence}} with Of Mutability (1986-87), a large installation involving sculpture and photography at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. This exhibition that toured {{a number of}} venues in England, Scotland and Switzerland resulted in her nomination for the Turner Prize in 1987. This was the first year that women were nominated for Britain’s most prestigious contemporary art award.|$|E
25|$|Late 1791, a {{group of}} Assembly members who {{propagated}} war against Austria and Prussia was, after some remark of politician Maximilien Robespierre, henceforth indicated as the 'Girondins', although {{not all of them}} <b>really</b> <b>came</b> from the southern province of Gironde. A group around Robespierre – later indicated as 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' – pleaded against that war; this opposition between those groups would harden and embitter in the next 1½ years.|$|E

25|$|Tensor {{calculus}} <b>really</b> <b>came</b> to life, however, {{with the}} advent of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1915. A few years after this, Levi-Civita formalized the unique connection associated to a Riemannian metric, now known as the Levi-Civita connection. More general affine connections were then studied around 1920, by Hermann Weyl, who developed a detailed mathematical foundation for general relativity, and Élie Cartan, who made the link with the geometrical ideas coming from surface theory.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, Yardley played {{regularly}} in that county's second eleven {{for two years}} before making his first-class debut against Nottinghamshire in August 1967; he made 3 and 4. Despite one further appearance that season, his first-class career only really took off in 1968, when he was a fixture in the first team from late July onwards, despite a modest top score of 43 not out from his 17 innings. 1969 was another mediocre season, but in 1970 Yardley <b>really</b> <b>came</b> good, making 762 first-class runs and averaging over 40.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{produced}} a few punk bands of note, such as The Exploited, The Rezillos, The Skids, The Fire Engines, and the Scars. However, {{it was not}} until the post-punk era of the early 1980s, that Scotland <b>really</b> <b>came</b> into its own, with bands like Cocteau Twins, Orange Juice, The Associates, Simple Minds, Maggie Reilly, Annie Lennox (Eurythmics), Hue and Cry, Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Wet Wet Wet, Big Country, The Proclaimers and Josef K. Since the 1980s Scotland has produced several popular rock and alternative rock acts.|$|E

25|$|Hartley was a solid, {{defensive}} right-handed opening batsman {{from the}} West Indies {{who had a}} fairly brief career in English county cricket. He made his first-class debut in 1907, made 1,000 runs at a respectable average in both 1908 and 1909, but only <b>really</b> <b>came</b> to the fore in 1910 when, with 1,585 runs {{at an average of}} nearly 37 runs per innings, he was selected for the Gentlemen v Players matches at The Oval and Lord's. He did little in the first match, but in the second, though scoring only 24 and 35, he impressed the editor of Wisden sufficiently to be named in the 1911 edition as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His big innings of the season was 234 for Lancashire against the very weak Somerset team at Old Trafford, and he also scored a century in the return fixture at Bath.|$|E
500|$|Geri Halliwell {{described}} the single as a [...] "big love song" [...] and [...] "a Spice Girl classic". Chisholm, in her 2008 appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, commented {{that she thought}} the song was not good at all, and that {{at least she was}} against the release of any new material when the record company was trying to market the Greatest Hits release. She would later say [...] "Headlines grew on me, it <b>really</b> <b>came</b> in to its own when we toured it, and it really felt lovely on stage".|$|E

500|$|The writing staff {{contributed a}} rough outline for the episode, and Meyer and Scully went {{into one of}} the writer's room and “basically, kind of locked [...] in for five days” writing the episode. Meyer and Scully both {{thoroughly}} enjoyed the writing process of the episode; “It <b>really</b> <b>came</b> together easily”, stated Meyer, “...because we had known each other so long and were comfortable with each other's style”. Ian Maxtone-Graham, one of the writers for The Simpsons, commented that the draft Meyer and Scully had written was “awfully good”.|$|E
500|$|Soon, Minogue {{began working}} on her {{eleventh}} studio album Aphrodite. Grammy award-winning British electronic music producer Stuart Price was enlisted as {{the executive producer of}} the album. [...] "All the Lovers" [...] {{was one of the last}} tracks to be written for Aphrodite and [...] "only <b>really</b> <b>came</b> up" [...] during the last three weeks of the recording sessions. It was written by Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell, known collectively as British electropop group Kish Mauve. The duo had previously collaborated with Minogue on [...] "2 Hearts", the lead single from X. Eliot produced the track and Price handled additional production and mixing. Minogue also recorded a Spanish-language version of the song entitled [...] "Los Amores".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} two new {{characters in}} Gibson Praise, played by Jeff Gulka, and Diana Fowley, portrayed by Mimi Rogers. Kim Manners later said of Gulka, [...] "There {{was something about}} that kid's personality that <b>really</b> <b>came</b> off on screen. He really exuded an intelligence that was pretty special. Chris saw what Bob Goodwin did {{with him and he}} knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X-Files". Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully. Gillian Anderson said, [...] "She didn't make it easy on Scully. I think she was aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation." ...|$|E

500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy <b>really</b> <b>came</b> across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Bell's {{influence}} on Anna, director Chris Buck said her personality {{was just so}} fun and energetic. [...] "We had an Anna character but Kristen <b>really</b> <b>came</b> in and pushed it and made it even funnier and even sweeter I think, and more believable as a three-dimensional character," [...] he said. He also admitted that he [...] "fell in love with 's voice and 's spirit". Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that girls could be funny. [...] "So she was a fantastic collaborator," [...] Lee added. [...] Songwriting duo Kristen-Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez later commented that they had written a lot of first songs for Kristen, for Anna but, [...] "The more we were working with Kristen Bell, the more, the more she influenced." [...] They quickly understand who Anna was because Anna's Kristen Bell.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Smith {{released}} his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. Of the album, Smith stated, [...] "It was the crack era, [...] and that's where all that <b>really</b> <b>came</b> from. It was all an expression about [...] Young Boys Incorporated, Mayor Coleman Young, the city we lived in and just the turmoil that our city was going through at the time. We referred {{to the streets of}} Detroit as 'Hell' on that record. So that's where my ideas came from." [...] In 1990, Esham and James H. Smith founded the independent record label Reel Life Productions, which reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his heavy metal influences.|$|E
