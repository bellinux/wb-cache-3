5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer</b> that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E

After a metallic <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer</b> (usually aluminium, but sometimes gold or other metal) {{is applied to the}} clear blank substrate, the disc goes under a UV light for curing and it is ready to go to press. To prepare to press a CD, a glass master is made, using a high-powered laser on a device similar to a CD writer. The glass master is a positive image of the desired CD surface (with the desired microscopic pits and lands). After testing, it is used to make a die by pressing it against a metal disc.|$|E

Herein, multilayer shielding structures are studied, with both absorbing and <b>reflecting</b> composite <b>layers.</b> In this paper, fiber-filled composites are considered. For modeling absorbing composites with low concentration of conducting cylindrical inclusions (below the percolation threshold), the Maxwell Garnett theory is used. For <b>reflecting</b> <b>layers,</b> when concentration of inclusions is close to or above the percolation threshold, the McLachlan formulation is used. Frequency dependencies for an effective permittivity are approximated by the Debye curves using a curve-fitting procedure, in particular, a genetic algorithm. Corresponding author: M. Y.

50|$|DVDs have a {{different}} structure from CDs, using a plastic disc over the <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer.</b> This means that a scratch on either surface of a DVD is not as likely to reach the reflective layer and expose it to environmental contamination and perhaps to cause corrosion, perhaps progressive corrosion. Each type of optical disc thus has different susceptibility to contamination and corrosion of its reflecting layer; furthermore, the writable and re-writable versions of each optical disc type are somewhat different as well. Finally, discs made with gold as the <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer</b> are considerably less vulnerable to corrosion problems, though no less susceptible to physical damage to that layer. Because they are less expensive, the industry has adopted aluminium reflecting layers as the standard for factory pressed optical discs.|$|E

50|$|The {{embossing}} {{process can}} be carried out with a simple heated press. The bottom layer of the duplicating film (the thermoplastic layer) is heated above its softening point and pressed against the stamper, so that it takes up its shape. This shape is retained when the film is cooled and removed from the press. In order to permit the viewing of embossed holograms in reflection, an additional <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer</b> of aluminum is usually added on the hologram recording layer. This method is particularly suited to mass production.|$|E

50|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) {{opened in}} 1923. After E.O. Hulburt (1890-1982) arrived there in 1924 he studied {{physical}} optics. The NRL was {{conducting research on}} {{the properties of the}} ionosphere (Earth's <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer)</b> because of interest in short wave radio communications. Hubert (Hulburt ?) produced a series of mathematical descriptions of the ionosphere during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927, at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Hulburt, Gregory Breit and Merle Tuve explored the possibility of equipping Robert Goddard's rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. In 1929 Hulburt proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere. This proposal included detection of ultraviolet radiation and X rays at high altitudes.|$|E

5000|$|While this {{technique}} {{can be very}} useful in the analysis there are several situations in which the process will not work. Semblance analysis will not work properly when the offset from the shot {{is greater than the}} depth of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>layers</b> because the data no longer has a hyperbolic pattern. To correct this it is necessary to use more complex equations that model non-hyperbolic moveout. Also in situations where there is large offset there can also be polarity reverses with moveout then the data will be heavily distorted. To make moveout analysis suitable for data with polarity reversals a method known as AK semblance developed. This method first worked only for 2D models but has since been further refined for 3D as well.|$|R

The principal <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer</b> {{during the}} summer for paths of 2,000 to 3,500 km is the F1 layer. However, this depends upon the frequency of a propagating signal. The E layer electron density and resultant MUF, maximum usable frequency, during high solar activity periods can refract and thus block signals of up to about 15 MHz from reaching the F1 and F2 regions, {{with the result that}} distances are much shorter than possible with refractions from the F1 and F2 regions. But extremely low radiation-angle signals (<6 degrees or so) can reach distances of 3000 km via E region refractions.|$|E
50|$|Appleton {{thought the}} best place to look for {{evidence}} of the ionosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions. It was sensible to suggest these variations were due to the interference of two waves but an extra step to show that the second wave causing the interference (the first being the ground wave) was coming down from the ionosphere. The experiment he designed had two methods to show ionospheric influence and both allowed the height of the lower boundary of reflection (thus the lower boundary of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer)</b> to be determined. The first method was called frequency modulation and the second was to calculate the angle of arrival of the reflected signal at the receiving aerial.|$|E

50|$|In CDs, the {{reflective}} layer is immediately beneath a thin protective layer of lacquer, {{and is also}} exposed {{at the edge of}} the disc. The lacquer protecting the edge of an optical disc can usually be seen without magnification. It is rarely uniformly thick; thickness variations are usually visible. The reflective layer is typically aluminium, which reacts easily with several commonly encountered chemicals such as oxygen, sulphur, and certain ions carried by condensed water. In ordinary use, a surface layer of aluminium oxide is formed very quickly when an aluminium surface is exposed to the atmosphere; it serves as passivation for the bulk aluminium with regard to many, but not all, contaminants. CD reflective layers are so thin that this passivation is less effective. In the case of CD-R and CD-RW media, the materials used in the <b>reflecting</b> <b>layer</b> are more complex than a simple aluminium layer, but also can present problems if contaminated.
