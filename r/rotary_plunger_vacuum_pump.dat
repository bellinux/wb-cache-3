The validity of the developed mathematical modelling is demonstrated by performing an experiment on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> with elliptical profile. The performance of the elliptical profile is also {{compared with that of}} the circular profile chamber of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> It is shown that the evacuation time of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> with an elliptical chamber is lower than with a circular profile. Various parametric studies are also performed to investigate the effect of rotor eccentricity, ratio of minor and major axes of the elliptical profiles, air tank capacity on evacuation time of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{diagnosis}} of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> system for the semiconductor manufacturing {{is directly related to}} the failure rate of wafer. Pumping speed is the volume flow rate per unit time by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> and represents the performance of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> directly. Unfortunately, it is impossible to measure the pumping speed in situation. We proposed an alternative method to infer pumping speed indirectly in situ. The Pumping speed indicator (PSI) is based on similarity of the pump-down method and the semiconductor manufacturing processes, estimates the exhaust capacity of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> Keywords-vacuum pump system; system diagnosis; pumping speed indicator I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Twin screw <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> is an {{important}} kind of dry <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> which is widely used in the oil-free vacuum system. The design of the screw rotor profile directly influences the working performance and manufacture cost of the screw pumps. In this paper, a new rotor profile for twin screw <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> is introduced which is comprised of the cycloid curve, the dedendum circle arc, the involute curve and the addendum circle arc. The processes of three-dimensional modeling, motion simulation, interference checking and structural optimization for twin screw <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> are studied by means of Solidworks software. The works provide theoretical basis for optimal designing and reference for test prototype manufacturing. The results showed {{the performance of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> according with the designer’s intention...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a project funded by Regione Toscana aimed at {{reducing}} the power absorption of auxiliary devices in vehicles are presented. In particular the design, testing and application of a magnetorheological clutch (MR) is proposed, aimed at disengaging the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> which draws in air from the power-brake booster chamber, {{in order to reduce the}} device power absorption. Several clutch preliminary studies done to choose the clutch geometry and the magnetic field supply are illustrated. The final choice consisted in an MR clutch with permanent magnet, which satisfied size, torque and fail-safe specifications. The clutch characteristics, in terms of torque versus slip, were obtained experimentally for three different clutch prototypes on an ad-hoc developed test bench. As result of a preliminary simulation, a comparison between the power absorption of a current production <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> an innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> and both <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> coupled with the MR clutch is presented. The New European Driving Cycle is considered for simulating the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> operation both in urban and highway driving. Results show that the use of the innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> reduces the device consumption of about 35 %, whereas the use of MR clutch coupled with the innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> reduces it up to about 44 % in urban driving and 50 % in highway driving...|$|R

50|$|A vacuum is {{initially}} created by connecting a closed container to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> {{can be left}} running. Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain a vacuum {{for a long time}}. This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases {{for a long time after}} the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced. Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher <b>vacuum</b> than the <b>pump</b> could achieve alone. Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

This is a process that until now was performed with liquid ring <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> using water as a liquid sealant and that after 10 years of continuous work have lost their capacity to generate the vacuum required by the system and must be replaced necessarily.
