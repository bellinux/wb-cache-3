40|$|Background: Despite {{good results}} of primary total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA), {{the number of}} revision total knee arthroplasties (rTKAs) is rising. Proper implant position is essential, since malposition leads to worse clinical outcome. In rTKA most anatomical landmarks have disappeared because of extensive bone loss, {{making it more difficult}} to adequately implant the knee prosthesis. In primary TKA, computer-assisted surgery (CAS) leads to better prosthetic alignment than mechanical navigation guides. Literature about the use of CAS in rTKA is scarce though, and the effect on <b>rotational</b> prosthetic <b>alignment</b> has not been investigated yet. Hence the primary objective {{of this study is to}} compare <b>rotational</b> prosthetic <b>alignment</b> when using CAS in rTKA compared to a mechanical navigation guide. Secondary objectives are to compare prosthetic alignment in the coronal and sagittal planes. It is hypothesized that CAS leads to better rotational, coronal and sagittal prosthetic alignment when used during rTKA. Methods/Design: A prospective clinical intervention study with use of a historical control group will be conducted. Forty-four patients with a minimum age of 18 to be admitted for CAS-rTKA between September 2012 and September 2015 will be included in the intervention group. Forty-four patients with a minimum age of 18 who underwent rTKA with the use of a mechanical navigation guide between January 2002 and April 2012 will form the historical control group.

40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{consequences}} of alignment errors in total knee replacement (TKR) {{have led to}} the rigorous evaluation of surgical alignment techniques. <b>Rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> in the transverse plane has proven particularly problematic, with errors due to component malalignment relative to bone anatomic landmarks and an overall mismatch between the femoral and tibial components’ relative positions. Ranges of nominal <b>rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> are not well defined, especially for the tibial component and for relative rotational mismatch, and some studies advocate the use of mobile-bearing TKR to accommodate the resulting small rotation errors. However, the relationships between prosthesis <b>rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> and mobile-bearing polyethylene insert motion are poorly understood. This prospective, in vivo study evaluates whether component malalignment and mismatch affect axial rotation motions during passive knee flexion after TKR. Methods Eighty patients were implanted with mobile-bearing TKR. <b>Rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> of the femoral and tibial components was measured from postoperative CT scans. All TKR were categorized into nominal or outlier groups based on defined norms for surgical <b>rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> relative to bone anatomic landmarks and relative rotational mismatch between the femoral and tibial components. Axial rotation motion of the femoral, tibial and polyethylene bearing components was measured from fluoroscopic images acquired during passive knee flexion. Results Axial rotation motion was generally accomplished in two phases, dominated by polyethylene bearing rotation on the tibial component in early to mid-flexion and then femoral component rotation on the polyethylene articular surface in later flexion. Opposite rotations of the femur-bearing and bearing-baseplate articulations were evident at flexion greater than 80 °. Knees with outlier alignment had lower magnitudes of axial rotation and distinct transitions from external to internal rotation during mid-flexion. Knees with femoral-tibial rotational mismatch had significantly lower total axial rotation compared to knees with nominal alignment. Conclusions Maintaining relative rotational mismatch within ± 5 ° during TKR provided for controlled knee axial rotation during flexion. TKR with <b>rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> outside of defined surgical norms, with either positive or negative mismatch, experienced measurable kinematic differences and presented different patterns of axial rotation motions during passive knee flexion compared to TKR with nominal mismatch. These findings support previous studies linking prosthesis <b>rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> with inferior clinical and functional outcomes.

Most offline verification schemes till date have required perfect alignment of the signature to the specified axes.

This study was undertaken to test whether specimen-matched cutting blocks based on computed axial tomography (CT) scans could provide accurate <b>rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> of the femoral component. MethodsCT scans of five fresh frozen full leg cadaver specimens, equipped with infrared reflective markers, were used to produce a specimen-matched femoral cutting block. Using those blocks, the bone cuts were made to implant a bi-compartmental femoral component. <b>Rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> of the components in the horizontal plane was determined using an optical measurement system and compared with all relevant rotational reference axes identified on the CT scans. ResultsAverage <b>rotational</b> <b>alignment</b> for the bi-compartmental component in the horizontal plane was 1. 9 ° (range 0 °– 6. 3 °; standard deviation 2. 6 °).
