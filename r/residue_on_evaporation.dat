40|$|The {{disposal}} of different residues containing {{high concentrations of}} heavy metals causes environmental problems. To understand the effects of various properties of the <b>residues</b> <b>on</b> the <b>evaporation</b> and leaching rates of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, and Cu) by thermal treatment, three types of residues (including bottom ash, spray dryer ash, and baghouse ash) generated from various incineration conditions including spray dryer additives (SiO 2, CaCl 2, and NaHCO 3), and feedstock additives [polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and NaCl] were investigated in the present study. The {{results indicated that the}} evaporation rate of Cd and Pb in the spray dryer ash and in the baghouse ash was higher than that in the bottom ash. The leaching rate of heavy metals in the spray dryer ash was less than 20 % before the thermal treatment when Ca(OH) (2) was used in the spray dryer. The addition of PVC could increase the evaporation rate of Zn in the spray dryer ash, whereas the addition of NaCl could decrease the leaching rate of Zn and Cu in the baghouse ash after the thermal treatment...|$|R

In this study, distribution device was installed to ensure uniform flow distribution in the refrigerant flow passage, which enhances heat transfer performance of plate type heat exchanger. Tests were conducted for three evaporation temperature; 33 ℃, 37 ℃, and 41 ℃ and several oil circulation conditions. The nominal conditions of refrigerant are as follows: inlet vapor quality at evaporator is 0. 2, and degree of superheat at the evaporator outlet is maintained by 5 ℃. The heat transfer correlation of water-side was developed by modifed Wilson plot method.

We quantified evaporation of saline solutions from heterogeneous sand columns under constant hydraulic boundary conditions to focus on effects of salt precipitation <b>on</b> <b>evaporation</b> dynamics. Mass loss measurements and infrared thermography were used to quantify evaporation rates. The latter method enables quantification of spatial and temporal variability of salt precipitation to identify its dynamic effects <b>on</b> <b>evaporation.</b> Evaporation from columns filled with texturally-contrasting sand using different salt solutions revealed preferential salt precipitation within the fine textured domains. Salt precipitation reduced evaporation rates from the fine textured regions by nearly an order of magnitude. In contrast, low evaporation rates from coarse-textured regions (due to low capillary drive) exhibited less salt precipitation and consequently less evaporation rate suppression. Experiments provided insights into two new phenomena: (1) a distinct increase in evaporation rate at the onset of evaporation; and (2) a vapor pumping mechanism related to the presence of a salt crust over semidry media. Both phenomena are related to local vapor pressure gradients established between pore water and the surface salt crust. Comparison of two salts: NaCl and NaI, which tend to precipitate above the matrix surface and within matrix pores, respectively, shows a much stronger influence of NaCl <b>on</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate suppression. This disparity reflects the limited effect of NaI precipitation on matrix resistivity for solution and vapor flows...|$|R
