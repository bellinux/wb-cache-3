In order to supply the generators, 24,000gallons (91,000L) of diesel fuel were stored below ground level. Diesel fuel distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor. After the World Trade Center bombings of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor <b>Rudy</b> <b>Giuliani</b> decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7World Trade Center. Although this decision was criticized {{in light of the}} events of 9/11, the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and <b>Rudy</b> <b>Giuliani.</b>|$|E

5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City <b>Rudy</b> <b>Giuliani</b> in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E

Mrs. Reagan, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Fred Ryan, chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation were among those in attendance.

5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face <b>Rudy</b> <b>Giuliani</b> (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E

5|$|While Governor Pataki {{supported}} this revised, $1.5 billion people mover plan, Mayor <b>Rudy</b> <b>Giuliani</b> voiced his opposition {{over the fact}} that it was not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable because of the need to transfer from Jamaica. Additionally, Giuliani did not like that the city had to effectively pay $300 million toward the new light rail system. The Port Authority was originally planning to pay for only $1.2 billion of the project, with the other $300 million to be used to pay the rent at the airport instead. In order to give his agreement, Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study the possibility of extending the Astoria elevated to LaGuardia Airport, as well as make the light-rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. In late 1997, Giuliani agreed to the plan under the condition that the state reimburse the city $300 million of the system's cost, with the city paying the $300 million for the line from 2002 through 2017. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar train link to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E
5|$|Because a Hurricane Watch {{existed for}} the New York City {{metropolitan}} area, New York Mayor <b>Rudy</b> <b>Giuliani</b> urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials {{set up a}} hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas. Near New Bedford, Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters {{in case of a}} direct hit. New Bedford Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city. However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage. On Cape Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29km) traffic backup. As a result, many beach resorts lost millions in potential revenue. Of those who remained on Cape Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety. Many sailors removed their boats from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of one every eight minutes. In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed their boats, and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane.|$|E
