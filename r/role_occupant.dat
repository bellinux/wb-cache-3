40|$|In this thesis, I {{examined}} (a) {{how social}} group prototypicality influences {{the degree to}} which a role aspirant identifies a <b>role</b> <b>occupant</b> as a role model and (b) how role models subsequently affect aspirants’ level of self-efficacy and goal elaboration. I expected that (a) the <b>role</b> <b>occupant</b> would be identified as more of a role model when she was more (versus) less prototypical of the aspirants’ social group, (b) this effect would be weakened when the aspirant perceived themselves as less (versus more) prototypical of their social group and (c) aspirants would be higher in self-efficacy and goal elaboration when the occupant was more (versus less) prototypical of the group, and these effects would be mediated by increased role model identification. A total of 130 first-year female undergraduates from the University of Queensland (UQ) listened to Kate, a high achieving fourth year student, discuss first-year studies. Participants were randomly assigned to a condition where Kate was either prototypical or aprototypical of UQ students. After listening to Kate speak, they completed measures of role model identification, self-efficacy and goal elaboration. As expected, participants identified Kate as more of a role model when she was more rather than less prototypical. However, contrary to hypotheses, participants’ own prototypicality did not moderate this effect. Participants reported higher self-efficacy in the prototypical condition and this effect was fully mediated by increased role model identification. However, this effect dissipated under incentivised behavioural conditions. Furthermore, participants did not demonstrate increased role model identification in either condition, nor when they identified Kate as a role model. These findings demonstrate that <b>role</b> <b>occupant</b> prototypicality influences people’s choice of role models. However, they raise questions over the ability of role models to increase self-efficacy and goal elaboration in aspirants. I explain these findings further and discuss theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research directions...|$|E

This paper identifies the requirements of SRBM and recognises the need for: distributed key shares, fast membership revocation, mandatory security controls and detection of identity spoofing. A shared RSA scheme is constructed. RSA keys are shared and distributed to role occupants and role gate keepers. Role occupants and role gate keepers must cooperate together to use the key shares to sign and decrypt the messages. <b>Role</b> <b>occupant</b> signatures can be verified by an audit service.

Building on this perspective, the present study investigates the relationship between social role occupancy and health status over time in a sample of employed Canadian men and women who vary by family role occupancy, life stage, and income adequacy. Results indicated that compared to triple role women (defined as those who are married, have children living at home and are in the workforce), single and double <b>role</b> <b>occupants</b> in 1994 / 95 {{were significantly more likely to}} report poorer self-rated health and the presence of a chronic health condition in 1996 / 97.

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that the death rate due to traffic fatalities at first increases as countries develop and motorization increases, but eventually declines as incomes grow and fatalities per vehicle decrease (Kopits and Cropper, 2005). This paper examines whether the relationship between traffic fatalities and income is the same for different classes of road users and investigates the factors underlying the decline in fatalities per vehicle kilometer traveled (VKT) observed in high-income countries over recent decades. Formal models of traffic fatalities are developed for vehicle occupants and pedestrians. Reduced-form approximations to these models are estimated using panel data for 32 high-income countries over 1964 - 2002. The results suggest that the downward-sloping portion of the curve relating traffic fatalities per capita to per capita income is due primarily to improved pedestrian safety. Our more detailed models shed light on some factors influencing pedestrian fatalities per VKT but much of the reduction in pedestrian fatalities remains unexplained; however, increased motorization and a reduction in the proportion of young drivers in the population clearly played a <b>role.</b> <b>Occupant</b> fatalities, however, do not show a significant decline with income. What does explain declines in occupant fatalities per distance traveled are reductions in alcohol abuse and improved medical services, and a reduction in young drivers. The importance of demographic factors suggests that in countries where young persons (between 15 and 24 years of age) comprise an increasing share of the driving population, adopting policies to improve young driver education and reduce speeds will be crucial. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} {{of modern life}} {{is reflected in the}} multiplicity of roles that man has to perform in society. The major problem that confronts man today is that of managing the multiple roles effectively by achieving an integration of the self with the various roles that he occupies. Such integration is not only necessary for the mental well-being and personal effectiveness of individuals, but also important for the organization in making the best use of an individual’s creativity and maximizing it through the process of synergy. It is only through the role that an individual gets linked with the system (of which he is a member). The integration of the two (the person and the role) that ensure a person’s effectiveness in the organization. The integration of a person and the role comes about when the role is able to fulfill the needs of the individual and the individual in turn is able to contribute to the evolution of the role. The closer that role taking (responding to the expectations of various other people) moves to role making (taking the initiative and designing the role creatively so that the expectations of others {{as well as of the}} <b>role</b> <b>occupant</b> are integrated), the more the role is likely to be effective. Effectiveness of a person in a role in an organization will depend on his own potential effectiveness, the potential effectiveness of the role and the organizational climate. The potential effectiveness can be called ‘efficacy’. Role efficacy would mean the potential effectiveness of an individual occupying a particular role in an organization. It can be increased through a joint effort of the role occupants, their managers and the organization (top management) ...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the Third World, {{a notable}} trend {{has been the}} {{proliferation}} of parallel health care systems in which cosmopolitan medical services co-exist {{with a variety of}} indigenous health care services, and client populations must make decisions regarding the preferred choice among the existing alternatives. Correspondingly, Bariba women in People's Republic of Benin, West Africa, who seek obstetrical care have an increasing number of available options from which to select, including government hospitals, maternity clinics, private clinics, and a variety of indigenous practitioners. An examination of the factors influencing choices of birth assistance among Bariba women suggests that attributes of indigenous midwives such as status characteristics and type of training serve as significant considerations for clientele selecting obstetrical care. Characteristics discussed as salient features of the midwife include religion, age, marital status, education, apprenticeship, and certain personal qualities such as courage and lack of modesty. In addition, features of the midwifery role are delineated; for instance, the role of indigenous midwife involves a great deal of variability in contrast to that of the government nurse-midwife, which appears as a more narrow specialization. In order to fulfill role expectations, the indigenous midwife must demonstrate attributes which fall within an acceptable range to the client population, thus rendering her reasonably homophilous. Homophily is defined as 'the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar in certain attributes such as beliefs, values, education, social status'. The data suggest that a healer, in this instance an indigenous midwife, is selected in order to accomplish a particular task. A client assumes certain characteristics of the <b>role</b> <b>occupant</b> are requisite for the healer to be effective and competent. Clients and midwives are found to be homophilous in that they share concepts of causation, beliefs, values and role expectations. Where the healer is not homophilous with the client, the absence of homophily operates to deter prospective clients from utilizing obstetrical services. Thus {{in the case of the}} rural client/government midwife relationship, the respective role occupants are shown not to be homophilous. In contrast to the indigenous midwife, the government midwife does not share significant attributes, values and expectations with her client and this lack of homophily deters prospective clients from selecting the government midwife as an option for birth assistance. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess gender {{differences}} in the posture and muscular activity of occupants in response to pretension from motorized seatbelts. Male and female vehicle occupants were tested in both front seat positions during normal driving and autonomous braking. This data is useful for the development of human body models (HBM), and increases the understanding of the effects of motorized belts. Kinematics and electromyography (EMG) were analyzed for 18 volunteers (9 male, 9 female) subjected to autonomous braking (11 m/s 2 deceleration) during real driving on rural roads. Two restraint configurations were tested: a standard belt and a motorized belt, activated 240 ms before the initiation of braking. Statistical comparison of volunteers’ posture and normalized EMG amplitudes was performed to understand differences incurred by the motorized belts, as well as to compare response across gender and <b>role</b> (<b>occupant</b> position within the vehicle). Data was analyzed both prior to and at vehicle deceleration, which occurred 240 ms after motorized belt onset. Motorized belts significantly affected all postural metrics, and significantly elevated the activity of all muscles compared to typical riding. Though increases in muscle activity were small at deceleration onset compared with typical riding for male occupants and female passengers, female drivers demonstrated significantly larger increases in muscular activity: between 5 and 13 % of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). At deceleration onset, standard belts showed little change in posture or muscle activation, with the median changes being well within the ranges exhibited during typical riding for all groups (i. e. not distinguishable from typical riding). Typical riding postures of males and females were similar, as were muscular activation levels—generally less than 5 % of the MVC. However, drivers exhibited significantly higher muscular activity in the arm and shoulder muscles than passengers. Limitations include the repeated nature of the testing, as prior work has shown that habituation across trials alters occupant response compared to that of unaware occupants. However, randomization of the trial order helped mitigate potential habituation effects. Another limitation is the sample size of 18 volunteers. An important finding of this study is that the increase in occupant muscular activation seen with motorized belts was gender-specific: at deceleration, the change in activation of most muscles was significantly different across gender and belt type, with female drivers exhibiting larger increases in muscular activation than male drivers or passengers of either gender, particularly in the arm muscles. These activations appeared to be startle responses, and may have implications for interactions with the steering wheel and motion during a braking or crash event. This warrants further studies and stresses the importance of quantifying male and female subjects separately in future studies of pre-crash systems...|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} Statistics Canada's National Population Health Survey, {{the present study}} {{investigated}} the psychosocial determinants of health status among employed Canadian adults. The results are presented in three interrelated papers. The first paper highlights the patterning of health among Canadians occupying different role configurations who also vary in terms of gender, socioeconomic status, and life stage. Results indicated that compared to triple role women, women occupying a single role or two roles in 1994 / 95 reported poorer health status in 1996 / 97. This relationship held true for women in varying life stage and economic circumstances. While family role occupancies {{in the present study were}} not as strongly related to the health status of men as women, one exception emerged: for older men, single and double <b>role</b> <b>occupants</b> reported significantly poorer self-rated and functional health status than triple role men. The second paper delved deeper into the quality of the role experience, examining how the demands and resources associated with one specific role configuration (i. e., paid worker, parent, and partner) influenced physical health outcomes over time, and whether gender and life stage influenced the nature of that relationship. Compared to Canadians with lower family demands, those with high levels of family demands in 1994 / 95 generally reported poorer health in 1996 / 97. Contrary to predictions however, few significant associations were found between work variables and health status. Associations between health status and family resources, operationalized as a combination of income adequacy and home ownership, were also weaker than previous research has suggested. The purpose of the third paper was to test the tenability of a psychosocial model of health status incorporating both proximate and distal health determinants. Using path analysis, the results suggest that qualitative aspects of triple-role Canadian women's work and family roles, along with a sense of mastery, are important intermediary links in the relationship between socioeconomic status and health. These findings highlight the need to address the broader economic factors which impinge on the well being of women through their everyday work and domestic experiences.

40|$|Over {{a quarter}} of all UK energy is used within the housing stock, while carbon {{emissions}} from all sectors of the economy are required to be reduced by 80 % by 2050. There is increasing recognition that eco-renovation of the existing housing stock will be vital, but many questions about achieving this remain. This paper focuses on the time dimensions of eco-renovation of housing. Firstly, various current definitions of eco-renovation are outlined and compared. Then, two distinct types of eco-renovation, which differ primarily in their time profile, are discussed. Eco-renovation activity is considered within the context of other housing-related time scales, including: frequency and timing of repairs and home improvements; the life time of energy efficiency measures; and patterns of home ownership. The characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of an „over-time‟ approach to eco-renovation are contrasted with the „one-off ‟ approach. Amendments to the current definitions of eco-renovation are proposed, linking the definition of ecorenovation more closely with an over-time approach and explicitly integrating the <b>role</b> of <b>occupants.</b> Specific topics which require additional research are identified. In conclusion, preliminary research suggests that „over-time ‟ eco-renovation could 1 make a significant contribution to national carbon savings targets, if appropriate measurement and evaluation tools were in place...|$|R

Injuries to head, spine, chest, hip and pelvis, and lower extremities were parsed and compared between crash types. MAIS 3 + occupants in NASS/CDS and CIREN demonstrated increased incidence of head, chest, spine, and hip/pelvis injuries in SOI compared to LOI. In NASS/CDS, subgaleal hematoma represented 48. 6 % of SOI head injury codes but 27. 6 % in LOI. Cervical spine posterior element fractures also represented greater proportions of SOI spine injuries (e. g., facet fractures: 27. 8 vs. 14. 0 %), and proximal femur fractures represented a greater proportion of hip/pelvis injuries (e. g., intertrochanteric fracture: 32. 5 vs. 11. 8 %).

Relatively little research has examined the direct <b>role</b> of <b>occupant</b> emissions, even though this source clearly contributes to indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and influences indoor chemistry. In this work, we quantify occupant-related gaseous VOC emissions in a university classroom using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Time-resolved concentrations of VOCs in room air and supply air were measured continuously during occupied and unoccupied periods. The emission factor for each human-emitted VOC was determined by dividing the occupant-associated source rate by the corresponding occupancy. Among the most abundant species detected were compounds associated with personal care products. Also prominent were human metabolic emissions, such as isoprene, methanol, acetone, and acetic acid. Additional sources included human skin oil oxidation by ozone, producing compounds such as 4 -oxopentanal (4 -OPA) and 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one (6 -MHO).

For the PMV the most influential parameters were found to be metabolic activity and clothing, while the thermostat had secondary impact. OTBArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Air-conditioning {{plays an}} {{essential}} <b>role</b> in ensuring <b>occupants</b> thermal comfort. However, building’s electricity bills have become unaffordable. Yet the commercially dominant cooling systems are intensively power-consuming ones, i. e. vapor compression systems. This paper aims {{to review the}} recent developments concerning evaporative cooling technologies that could potentially provide sufficient cooling comfort, reduce environmental impact and lower energy consumption in buildings. An extensive literature review has been conducted and mapped out the state-of-the-art evaporative cooling systems. The review covers direct evaporative cooling, indirect evaporative cooling and combined direct-indirect cooling systems. The indirect evaporative coolers include both wet-bulb temperature evaporative coolers and dew point evaporative coolers have been of particular interest because of high thermal performance. The dew point evaporative coolers have shown great potential of development and research opportunity for their improved efficiency and low energy use. Index Terms—Evaporative cooling, effectiveness, dew point, dry bulb temperature. I...|$|R

The data of study was obtained through questionnaire involved a sum of 868 occupants using convenience sampling. The collected data was analyzed using quantitative approaches, including frequency analysis and relative important index (RII). The study reveals that physical environment elements were {{the crucial role}} in every housing unit. However, safety, security and health, utilities, privacy and location were mainly the highest concern amongst occupants towrads the physical environment. In fact, physical environment elements plays crucial <b>role</b> in developing <b>occupant’s</b> comfort and satisfaction. Nevertheless, a few physical elements show least preferable amongst occupant such as temperature and humidity, aesthetic and noise, yet it also need to give much attention in order to form {{a better quality of}} environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{developments}} {{of what is}} likely to be the greenest urban office buildings in the world, Seattle’s Bullitt Center. Currently under construction, it is designed to operate on just the sunlight and rainwater landing on it each year along with the heat source and sink of the ground beneath it, contain no materials harmful to people or the environment, provide its users a healthy and delightful place to work, and be built to last 250 years. It will set a new standard for performance-based design and increase awareness of integrated approaches to energy efficient design and construction. This report focuses on the role of integrated design (ID) in achieving the performance goals for this building. Part one is an assessment of how effectively integrated design informed the design process of the Bullitt Center. Interviews with project team members were used to identify the ID principles and implementation tools employed during the design and construction process, along with their predicted outcomes for the building’s performance and realized outcomes in the design and construction process. Part two identifies the integrated design strategies aimed at energy efficiency and the energy savings achieved by each inter-connected system. Measured in terms of PV panels displaced, this analysis illustrates the imperative to match energy demand with supply. A critical element of this equation is the <b>role</b> of <b>occupant</b> engagement in managing the plug loads, predicted to account for nearly half of the building’s energy use...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} <b>role</b> of <b>occupant</b> {{behaviour}} {{in relation to}} natural ventilation {{and its effects on}} summer thermal performance of naturally ventillated buildings. We develop a behavioural algorithm (the Yun algorithm) representing probablistic occupant behaviour and implement this within a dynamic energy simulation tool. A core of this algorithm is the use of Markov chain and Monte Carlo methods in order to integrate probablistic window use models into dynamic energy simulation procedures. The comparison between predicted and monitored window use patterns shows good agreement. Performance of the Yn algorithm is demonstrated for active, medium and passive window users and a range of office constructions. Results indicate, for example, that in some cases, the temperature of an office occupied by the active window user in summer is up to 2. 6 ºC lower than that for the passive window user. A comparison is made with results from an alernative bahavioural algorithm developed by Humphreys [H. B. Rijal, P. Tuohy, M. A. Humphreys, J. F. Nicol, A. Samual, J. Clarke, Using results from field surveys to predict the effect of open windows on thermal comfort and energy use in buildings, Energy and Buildings 39 (7) (2007) 823 - 836. ]. In general, the two algorithms lead to similar predictions, but the results suggest that the Yun algorithm better reflects the observed time of day effects on window use (i. e. the increased probability of action on arrival) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: The {{elements}} {{that contribute to}} a healthy building are multifactorial and can be discussed from different perspectives. Objectives: We present three viewpoints of designing a healthy building: the importance of sustainable development, the <b>role</b> of <b>occupants</b> for ensuring indoor air quality, and ongoing developments related to indoor finishes with low chemical emissions and good fungal resistance. Discussion: Sustainable design rediscovers the social, environmental, and technical values of pedestrian and mixed-use communities, using existing infrastructures including 2 ̆ 2 main streets 2 ̆ 2 and small-town planning principles and recapturing indoor–outdoor relationships. This type of design introduces nonpolluting materials and assemblies with lower energy requirements and higher durability and recyclability. Building occupants {{play a major role}} in maintaining healthy indoor environments, especially in residences. Contributors to indoor air quality include cleaning habits and other behaviors; consumer products, furnishings, and appliances purchases, as well as where and how the occupants use them. Certification of consumer products and building materials as low-emitting products is a primary control measure for achieving good indoor air quality. Key products in this respect are office furniture, flooring, paints and coatings, adhesives and sealants, wall coverings, wood products, textiles, insulation, and cleaning products. Finishing materials {{play a major role in}} the quality of indoor air as related to moisture retention and mold growth. Conclusions: Sustainable design emphasizes the needs of infrastructure, lower energy consumption, durability, and recyclability. To ensure good indoor air quality, the product development for household use should aim to reduce material susceptibility to contaminants such as mold and should adopt consumer-oriented product labeling...|$|R
