5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing <b>really</b> <b>and</b> I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs <b>really</b> <b>and</b> I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on <b>really,</b> <b>and</b> being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E

Interpretations of his verses range from the [...] "most overtly phallic song since Blind Lemon Jefferson's [...] 'Black Snake Moan'" [...] to an innocuous farm ditty. Although Dixon described it in the latter terms, he added, [...] "I wrote it as a barnyard song <b>really,</b> <b>and</b> some people even take it that way!"

Her seventh studio album, Ray of Light, (1998) reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and {{wanted to create a}} sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit [...] "was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave was happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, <b>really.</b> <b>And</b> William Orbit provided her with that." ...|$|E

500|$|All {{band members}} of Bloc Party {{conceived}} A Weekend in the City during 2005 while on tour {{in support of}} their critically acclaimed debut album Silent Alarm. Despite missing their home city of London, the quartet became increasingly disillusioned with the culture in the area each time they sporadically returned. Band member Gordon Moakes has noted, [...] "The contrast we saw between being away on tour and being home... we would see that London wasn't changing <b>really</b> <b>and</b> that the people we'd grown up with were part of that." [...] Okereke wrote many songs in 2005 and early 2006 and used a concept he called [...] "Urbanite Relaxation" [...] to expand upon the themes of life and leisure in the metropolis.

[...] "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. [...] "He <b>really</b> <b>and</b> truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," [...] she said.

[...] At Syfy.co.uk, the episode was listed as the seventh best episode in their list of the top 10 Buffy episodes, saying [...] "This surreal episode marks the show's turning point, as it moved from a very well-executed urban fantasy drama series to something more creative, more thoughtful, and more surprising than pretty much anything else on television." [...] In The Futon Critic's list of the 20 best episodes of 2000, the episode was placed at #1, with the author calling it an even more daring episode than [...] "Hush", another acclaimed episode from the fourth season.|$|E
500|$|In 1974 Ayers Rock began {{recording}} {{their debut}} album, Big Red Rock, at Festival Records' 24-track studio in Sydney. They were {{dissatisfied with the}} sound, which failed to capture their music's [...] "live" [...] essence, and recorded it live-in-the-studio at Armstrong's in Melbourne that September. Kennedy told Margaret MacIntyre of Rolling Stone Australia, [...] "Doing the album live was an experiment <b>really</b> <b>and</b> it seemed to work." [...] Big Red Rock, released in November, peaked at number 32 on the Kent Music Report album chart. The album had [...] "a more jazz-rock edge" [...] and its single, [...] "Lady Montego" [...] (written by McGuire), was {{a new version of}} a song originally performed by Leo de Castro and Friends. According to Juke Magazine, [...] "the single lifted to push the album, 'Lady Montego'... received three weeks airplay and was then dumped." [...] "Lady Montego" [...] was Ayers Rock's most-aired single in Australia, and Kennedy said: [...] "Without AM radio support you can't sell too well in this country." [...] Juke called their songs [...] "lyrically banal" [...] but said the group compensated with [...] "sheer talent", instrumentally and electronically.|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{received}} mixed critical reviews. TV Guide Kate Stanhope gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, opining that [...] "the episode moved a little slow for what was the last season premiere." [...] She praised the sequence in which Bree and Gabrielle attempt {{to get rid of}} Alejandro's car, writing, [...] "I always love the Bree-Gaby scenes because they contradict each other in such an interesting way." [...] She enjoyed that the Bree character was [...] "turning back into the controlling perfectionist we grew to love rather than the carefree woman she became" [...] in the seventh season. Stanhope was critical of the Lynette and Tom storyline, opining: [...] "it's annoying that their relationship has been reduced to this gimmick... I was never on board with the whole Tom and Lynette split simply because it felt less honest and more of a last-ditch effort to cause conflict. But if they're going to go through with separating the formerly stable couple, at least go through with it all the way and show Lynette <b>really</b> <b>and</b> truly on her own." [...] She also believed the Renee storyline to be a waste of Vanessa Williams's talents. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly called the episode's overall storyline [...] "too juicy a landmine to not have the repercussions play out deliciously on this, the show’s last season." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{her first}} {{performance}} since the Uh Huh Her tour at the Hay Festival of Literature & Arts on 26 May 2006, Harvey revealed that her next studio album {{would be almost}} entirely piano-based. Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991–2004, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November, together with Flood, John Parish, and Eric Drew Feldman in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked {{a radical departure from}} her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing [...] "pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds." [...] Harvey herself said of the album: [...] "when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, <b>really,</b> <b>and</b> I'm not sure whether it's in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, that's what I like—it doesn't feel of this time right now, but I'm not sure whether it's 100 years ago or 100 years in the future", summing up the album's sound as [...] "really weird." [...] During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk.|$|E

Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling.

[...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, <b>really,</b> <b>and</b> the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E
