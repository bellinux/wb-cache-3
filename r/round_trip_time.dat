Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked {{in less than a}} day (<b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>time,</b> trailhead): Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5–6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes.

At first there were semiweekly services, {{but by the end}} of 1947, these had increased to weekly. In June, Braathens SAFE bought a Douglas DC-3, LN-PAS Norse Carrier, and in August another DC-4, LN-PAW Norse Commander, both from KLM. In 1947, Braathens SAFE flew twenty-five trips to Hong Kong, five to New York and one to Johannesburg, South Africa, making a profit of NOK750,000. The following year, Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America. The first flight was made on 23 August from Stavanger via Reykjavík, Gander and Bermuda to Caracas, where the plane landed on 26 August. In October, the airline flew to Panama, but neither route gave sufficient contracts to commence regular services. In 1948, the airline made fifty trips to Hong Kong, eight to Johannesburg, two to the United States, three to Venezuela and two to Panama.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present an {{algorithm}} that measures the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> of IEEE 802. 11 MAC packets {{in order to}} trilaterate WLAN nodes. We show that if we use packet sequences (e. g., RTS, CTS, DATA and ACK) instead of packet pairs (e. g., DATA and ACK), the TOA measurements can be implemented more easily and a higher observation rate can be achieved. In addition, the receiver and any listening third node can measure the <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>times.</b> We present the open source software “Goodtry ” that implements this algorithm and overcomes the low clock resolution and other implementation constraints of off-the-shelf IEEE 802. 11 cards.

Expressions exist for these values only in the homogenous case and heuristics for the general case give uncertain results. In this paper we first derive an exact expression (in the setting of fluid models) for the window evolu-tion of TCP connections with different <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> delays. We next apply this result in a particular context to derive expressions for the maximum window sizes and the throughputs of TCP connec-tions as well the idle periods and the utilization of the shared link. We show a bias in favor of connections with short <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> delays persists even for large buffer sizes. First and second order approximations in buffer size are given respectively for small and large buffers. These expressions show that for small buffers small <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> predominate in global performances while {{the opposite is true}} for large buffers. I...|$|R
