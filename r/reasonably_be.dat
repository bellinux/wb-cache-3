5|$|The archaeologists {{discovered}} several bronze {{objects that}} were excavated {{with the hand}} cannon. The excavated objects were a bronze vase, a bronze mirror, and a bronze cooking pan. All the bronze artifacts were manufactured {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin dynasty. The Jin dynasty collapsed after the Mongols besieged and captured Caizhou in 1234, which suggests that the Heilongjiang hand-gun can <b>reasonably</b> <b>be</b> dated to the 13th century at the latest.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort of situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could <b>reasonably</b> <b>be</b> expected to be harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely {{has the right to}} repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources do {{not give}} {{reliable}} data on the size and composition of Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree {{on a range of}} between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a mix of the fyrd (militia mainly composed of foot soldiers) and the housecarls, or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. The main difference between the two types was in their armour; the housecarls used better protecting armour than that of the fyrd. The English army {{does not appear to have}} had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine. About 18 other named individuals can <b>reasonably</b> <b>be</b> assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{soldiers}} in Harold's army is unknown. The contemporary records {{do not give}} reliable figures; some Norman sources give 400,000 to 1,200,000 men on Harold's side. The English sources generally give very low figures for Harold's army, perhaps to make the English defeat seem less devastating. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5,000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, and most modern historians argue for a figure of 7,000â€“8,000 English troops. These men {{would have been a}} mix of the fyrd and housecarls. Few individual Englishmen are known to have been at Hastings; about 20 named individuals can <b>reasonably</b> <b>be</b> assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine and two other relatives.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could <b>reasonably</b> <b>be</b> raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} reduction in the Jellyfish Lake medusa population had also been noted in 1987.
