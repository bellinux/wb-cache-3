The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
5|$|Eddy {{believed}} that with military {{assistance from the}} Thirteen Colonies, {{he might be able}} to bring down the strongly Loyalist administration of Nova Scotia. Early in 1776, Eddy went to Massachusetts in an attempt to interest political and military leaders there in supporting action in Nova Scotia, while Allan worked to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> in Nova Scotia. Allan's work was made more difficult by the arrival of Colonel Goreham and his troops to refortify Fort Cumberland, and by the activities of Michael Francklin, a former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and a vocal Loyalist. Eddy returned empty-handed to Nova Scotia in June 1776, only to learn that Goreham had put a price on his head. The activities of Goreham's Fencibles in the Cumberland area were successful enough that Patriot activities there were effectively forced underground; the center of these activities was shifted to Maugerville in part as a consequence of this. Goreham, a veteran of the French and Indian War, was also able to blunt Patriot inroads in the native communities, where the Mi'kmaq refused to take sides, and the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy, at first supportive of the Patriots, ultimately did not turn out in the numbers Eddy had hoped for or been promised.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression, {{every major}} {{currency}} abandoned {{the gold standard}}. Among the earliest, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard in 1931 as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency, threatening the solvency of the British monetary system. This pattern repeated throughout Europe and North America. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> rates {{in order to protect}} the gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.|$|E
25|$|The {{worldwide}} {{recession of}} the early 1990s significantly damaged the government's financial situation. Mulroney's inability to improve the government's finances, {{as well as his}} use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base â€“ this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his 'pro-business' plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the Bank of Canada began to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> rates in order to meet a zero inflation target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100% of GDP, further weakening the Canadian dollar and damaging Canada's international credit rating.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the price}} of gold is closely related to interest rates. As interest rates rise, the general tendency is for the gold price, which earns no interest, to fall, and vice versa. As a result, the gold price can be closely correlated to central banks via their monetary policy decisions on interest rates. For example, if market signals indicate the possibility of prolonged inflation, central banks may decide to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> rates, which could reduce the price of gold. But this does not always happen: after the European Central Bank raised its interest rate slightly on April 7, 2011, {{for the first time since}} 2008, the price of gold drove higher, and hit a new high one day later. Similarly, in August 2011 when interest rates in India were at their highest in two years, the gold prices peaked as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{transgressive}} {{nature of}} cult films {{can lead to}} their censorship. [...] During the 1970s and early 1980s, a wave of explicit, graphic exploitation films caused controversy. [...] Called [...] "video nasties" [...] within the UK, they ignited calls for censorship and stricter laws on home video releases, which were largely unregulated. [...] Consequently, the British Board of Film Classification banned many popular cult films due to issues of sex, violence, and incitement to crime. [...] Released during the cannibal boom, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) was banned in dozens of countries and caused the director to be briefly jailed over fears {{that it was a}} real snuff film. [...] Although opposed to censorship, director Ruggero Deodato would later agree with cuts made by the BBFC which removed unsimulated animal killings, which limited the film's distribution. [...] Frequently banned films may introduce questions of authenticity as fans question whether they have seen a truly uncensored cut. [...] Cult films have been falsely claimed to have been banned to increase their transgressive reputation and explain their lack of mainstream penetration. [...] Marketing campaigns have also used such claims to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> among curious audiences. [...] Home video has allowed cult film fans to import rare or banned films, finally giving them a chance to complete their collection with imports and bootlegs. [...] Cult films previously banned are sometimes released with much fanfare and the fans assumed to be already familiar with the controversy. [...] Personal responsibility is often highlighted, and a strong anti-censorship message may be present. [...] Previously lost scenes cut by studios can be re-added and restore a director's original vision, which draws similar fanfare and acclaim from fans. [...] Imports are sometimes censored to remove elements that would be controversial, such as references to Islamic spirituality in Indonesian cult films.|$|E
500|$|... 1988 was the bicentenary of {{non-indigenous}} {{settlement in}} Australia and, as such, there was {{renewed interest in}} the 'lost' second Sydney punchbowl. The bowl eventually turned up in a catalogue for a Chinese export porcelain exhibition at Newark Museum, New Jersey, United States, titled Chinese Export Porcelain: A Loan Exhibition from New Jersey Collections. The bowl had been lent by Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a former United States Congressman (in office 1953â€“1975). The discovery was made by Terry Ingram, a Sydney journalist specialising in antiques and art, who wrote about it in his Saleroom column, titled Newark Museum packs Aussie punch, in The Australian Financial Review on 25August 1988. It transpired {{that in the early}} 1930s, the bowl was acquired by Frelinghuysen's parents in a private negotiation with the owner at the time the National Art Collections Fund was attempting to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> from Sydney's cultural institutions. This discovery drew the attention of Paul Hundley, senior curator of the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM)'s USA Gallery, the Gallery itself a bicentennial gift of the American people to Australia. In May 2006, the ANMM announced it had acquired the bowl as a part gift from Frelinghuysen through the American Friends of the ANMM, a charitable organisation recognised by the US Internal Revenue Service which enabled Frelinghuysen to receive appropriate taxation benefits. The Australian Financial Review reported the acquisition in its Saleroom column, titled Museum bowled over, on 18May 2006. The punchbowl has been on display in the Museum's USA Gallery ever since. It also features as one of the 100 Stories from the ANMM, has digitised images in the ANMM catalogue and can be viewed on YouTube. At the time the ANMM acquired the punchbowl in 2006, the bowl was valued at $A330,000.|$|E

2500|$|Currency {{speculation}} {{is considered a}} highly suspect activity in many countries. [...] While investment in traditional financial instruments like bonds or stocks often is considered to contribute positively to economic growth by providing capital, currency speculation does not; according to this view, it is simply gambling that often interferes with economic policy. For example, in 1992, currency speculation forced the Swedish National Bank (the central bank of Sweden) to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> rates {{for a few days}} to 500% per annum, and later to devalue the krona. Mahathir Mohamad, one of the former Prime Ministers of Malaysia, is one well-known proponent of this view.
