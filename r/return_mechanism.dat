25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} buttstock assembly, bolt carrier group with bolt and the <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> and guide rod.

2500|$|The compact SG 552 Commando (full {{designation}} as the 552-2P) carbine {{was released}} in July 1998. It has a shorter [...] barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. The <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been moved {{to the rear of}} the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod (later models feature a polymer guide rod) resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed recoil spring. Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the kinematic analysis of a quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> there is a dynamic analysis present. At certain lengths and attachments, {{the arm of the}} mechanism can be evaluated and then adjusted to certain preferences. For example, the differences in the forces acting upon the system at an instant can be represented by D'Alembert's principle. Depending on the structural design of the quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the law of cosines can be used to determine the angles and displacements of the arm.

5000|$|Two {{servicing}} {{missions to}} the Hubble Space Telescope have replaced a reaction wheel. In February 1997, the Second Servicing Mission (STS-82) replaced one after electrical anomalies, {{rather than any}} mechanical problem. Study of the <b>returned</b> <b>mechanism</b> provided {{a rare opportunity to}} study equipment that had undergone long-term service (7 years) in space, particularly for the effects of vacuum on lubricants. This was found to be in excellent condition. In 2002, Servicing Mission 3B (STS-109), astronauts from the shuttle Columbia replaced another reaction wheel. Neither of these wheels had failed and Hubble was designed with four redundant wheels, and maintained pointing ability so long as three were functional.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a supply chain}} consisting of one supplier selling through one retailer who faces a newsvendor problem. There is a positive probability that the retailer is capable of gaining improved demand information through costly forecasting. The supplier would like to induce the retailer to forecast and share that information. Restricting the retailer’s ability to return unsold product would intuitively {{appear to be a}} viable way by which to provide the desired incentives. However, {{it is well known that}} a generous returns policy increases the supplier’s profit. We explore this tension between providing incentives to forecast and capturing channel profits. We examine both price-based <b>returns</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (buy backs) and quantity-based <b>returns</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (quantity flexibility contracts). Thus, a second goal is to compare the relative performance of these two schemes. We show that under either contract, inducing forecasting retailers to take a different contract from non-forecasting retailers requires restricting returns. The forecaster is charged a lower price than the non-forecaster but has less flexibility in returning product. Using buy backs, the supplier must sacrifice some channel profit to differentiate between forecasting and non-forecasting retailers. With quantity flexibility contracts, reducing channel efficiency is not required to distinguish between the types of retailers. It is consequently some what surprising that buy backs generally result in greater supplier profit than quantity flexibility contracts unless forecasting is very expensive.

50|$|The {{circulating}} balls travel {{inside the}} thread {{form of the}} screw and nut, and balls are recirculated through various types of return mechanisms.

50|$|In {{addition}} to installing the new instruments, astronauts replaced other existing hardware with upgrades and spares. Hubble received a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor, an optical device {{used to provide}} pointing information for the telescope and as a scientific instrument for astrometric science. The Solid State Recorder (SSR) replaced one of HST's reel-to-reel tape recorders. The SSR provides much more flexibility than a reel-to-reel recorder and can store ten times more data. One of Hubble's four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) -- part of the telescope's Pointing Control Subsystem—was replaced with a refurbished spare. The RWAs use angular momentum to move and maintain the telescope in a desired position. The wheel axes are oriented so that the telescope can provide science with only three wheels operating, if required.

30|$|Systems {{with one}} fast and two slow {{variables}} may generate a robust mechanism for MMOs. The critical manifolds of such systems are typically two-dimensional folded surfaces. Attracting and repelling sheets of a folded critical manifold meet at fold curves. According to well-established results from Fenichel [11, 12], normally hyperbolic sheets {{of the critical}} manifold persist as two-dimensional slow manifolds, provided ε is sufficiently small. Intersections of attracting and repelling slow manifolds in this setting correspond to canard orbits. They provide a mechanism for SAOs in that canard orbits form boundaries between regions of different numbers of SAOs [32 – 34]. Global <b>return</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and canard-induced SAOs together generate MMOs {{for a wide range}} of mathematical and applied three-dimensional models [1, 9, 20, 35 – 44]. In support of theoretical work, numerical methods were developed to reveal the geometry of two-dimensional attracting and repelling slow manifolds, as well as canard orbits. These methods were employed to investigate numerous three-dimensional examples [35, 36, 41, 43, 45 – 48]. For a more detailed survey of MMOs in slow–fast systems see [10].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the main mechanisms of institutional change influencing {{the transformation of}} Central and Eastern European (CEE) welfare states. It starts by providing {{a brief description of}} their main characteristics and continues by offering some empirical evidence specifically tailored to the CEE case. It adopts a mechanisms-based explanation approach. Here, the analysis is focused not merely on the identification of correlations existent between variables, but rather on the mechanisms and the causal chains that influencing the actions of actors lead to a determined outcome. The relational character of institutional change will be emphasized here. In fact, not only existing welfare institutions are altered during the process of institutional change, but also the existing institutional relations and organizational features of the welfare state. In the discussion, it will be argued that several mechanisms of institutional change, complementary to each other, have influenced the transformation in three different, but interconnected domains. In the domain of ideas, these mechanisms have taken the form of ideational, communicative and coordinative mechanisms, in the domain of institutions of transformative adaptive mechanisms and, finally, in the domain of interests of increasing <b>returns</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Four specifi...|$|R

40|$|Many {{neuronal}} {{systems and}} models display a certain class of mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) consisting of periods of small amplitude oscillations interspersed with spikes. Various models with different underlying mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to generate this type of behavior. Stochastic versions of these models can produce similarly looking time series, often with noise-driven mechanisms {{different from those of}} the deterministic models. We present a suite of measures which, when applied to the time series, serves to distinguish models and classify routes to producing MMOs, such as noise-induced oscillations or delay bifurcation. By focusing on the subthreshold oscillations, we analyze the interspike interval density, trends in the amplitude and a coherence measure. We develop these measures on a biophysical model for stellate cells and a phenomenological FitzHugh-Nagumo-type model and apply them on related models. The analysis highlights the influence of model parameters and reset and <b>return</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the context of a novel approach using noise level to distinguish model types and MMO mechanisms. Ultimately, we indicate how the suite of measures can be applied to experimental time series to reveal the underlying dynamical structure, while exploiting either the intrinsic noise of the system or tunable extrinsic noise.
