40|$|The {{imaginary}} journey on the Volga - cruise {{through time}} and spaces : a semiotic {{analysis of the}} Soviet and post-Soviet travel guides of <b>river</b> <b>cruises</b> The case study of this master’s thesis is analysis of Russian cultural representation through the <b>river</b> <b>cruise</b> on the Volga. From {{the very beginning of}} formation of the Soviet Union <b>river</b> <b>cruise</b> has took one of the central places among different forms of tourism. <b>River</b> <b>cruise</b> was propagated as a tool of increasing level of cultural education and knowing industrial progress of the country. Gradually, during tourism development tourist guides were created, the main aim of which was to attract attention of the widest social group, proletariat to the tourist sphere and especially <b>river</b> <b>cruises.</b> Since 1960 s <b>river</b> <b>cruises</b> have become the most popular form of spending vocations. The situation has changed after dissolution of the Soviet Union, when <b>river</b> <b>cruise</b> was replaced by travels abroad. The material of this study are travel guides of <b>river</b> <b>cruises</b> on the Volga, which were published in 1933, 1954 and 1983 during the Soviet Union and in 2002 and 2008 in post-Soviet period. The texts of travel guides introduce descriptions of Volga cruise routes and locations often expressed by metaphor, which presents verbal basis for analytical chapter. The theoretical base of this study includes general theory of cultural semiotics and in particular a study about semiosphere, which constitutes principal view on <b>river</b> <b>cruises</b> as the part of cultural representation and becomes fundamental background for method of semiotic analysis. The other theoretical concept is geographic imaginary space, which is used in this research as personalized cultural impression of texts descriptions in travel guides of <b>river</b> <b>cruises.</b> The additional theoretic aspect is heterotopia theory and its spatial characteristics of some places in <b>river</b> <b>cruise.</b> The analytical chapter is aimed at multi-structured analysis of semiosphere of <b>river</b> <b>cruise</b> and its internal elements and processes. In the center of geographic imaginary representation is not only cruise itself, but also the Volga, whose perception changes and develops during historical and cultural shifts. One more part of analytical chapter illustrates the manner of dynamic intersection through semiotic boarders by signs and following change of their meanings position in the semiosphere. In this study the main purpose of heterotopia is to consider “teplohod” as heterotopian phenomenon in cultural semiotic space. This study is aimed to interpret <b>river</b> <b>cruise</b> as semiotic space, to prove its connection with cultural representation and explain process of changing perception of <b>river</b> <b>cruise</b> in the Soviet and post-Soviet times.
