40|$|Persons {{interested}} in developing virtue will find attending to, {{and attempting to}} act on, the <b>right</b> <b>reason</b> for action a rich resource for developing virtue. In this paper I consider the role of self-knowledge in intentional moral development. I begin by making a general case that because improving one’s moral character requires intimate knowledge of its components and their relation to <b>right</b> <b>reason,</b> the aim of developing virtue typically requires the development of self-knowledge. I next turn to Kant’s ethics for an account which explains the reflexivity involved in moral reasoning generally, and the significance of self-knowledge to morality. I then take up Robert Audi’s interesting notion of the harnessing and unharnessing of reasons as a potential way of strengthening the agent’s connection to <b>right</b> <b>reason,</b> and his concerns about our limited and indirect resources for becoming virtuous. I argue that harnessing and unharnessing are not plausibly characterized as activities to be accomplished by an exertion of will, rather they involve a dynamic, cognitive, reflective attempt to gain self-knowledge and align oneself with one’s moral reasons for action...|$|R

2500|$|According to Kierkegaard, {{the human}} self desires {{that which is}} beyond reason. Desire itself {{appears to be a}} desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, {{according}} to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals {{in the name of a}} higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the <b>right</b> <b>reasons,</b> and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion.|$|E
