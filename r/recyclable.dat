5|$|Like aluminium, copper is <b>recyclable</b> {{without any}} loss of quality, both from raw state and from {{manufactured}} products. In volume, copper {{is the third}} most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. An estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still in use today. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is 35–55kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (140–300kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–40kg per capita).|$|E

50|$|Another {{controversial}} {{issue in the}} uk is {{the frequency of the}} waste collections. To save money, many councils are cutting the frequency of both general waste and <b>recyclables</b> collections. This has led to problems from larger families, and has led to overflowing and fly tipping. For example, previously, Bury Council collected general waste once a week and <b>recyclables</b> fortnightly. This has now changed to fortnightly for general waste and monthly (every 4 weeks) collection of <b>recyclables.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{an effort}} to {{increase}} recycling in the United States, local Governments adopted the single-stream recycling system, in which different recycling materials are mixed during its initial collection. Although this resulted {{in an increase in}} the volume of <b>recyclables</b> deposited by individuals, it has also exponentially increased the contamination of <b>recyclables.</b> This affects the value of <b>recyclables</b> when they are sold to recycling companies.

5|$|The {{recycling}} {{facility and}} museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and opened in 1993. Funding for the museum was provided through a group of 19 local municipalities, known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee, which transported recyclables to the facility for processing. The museum {{was part of an}} active recycling operation that allows visitors to follow the <b>recyclable</b> materials through the sorting processes to the crushing and baling process before they are shipped to processors to be recycled into new products. The museum was overseen and operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority.|$|E
5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a <b>recyclable</b> oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more <b>recyclable</b> or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E
5000|$|The company's {{web site}} {{can also be}} used by households, {{institutions}} or businesses that do have curb-side recycling but want to have their <b>recyclables</b> picked up when and where they desire.

5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is <b>recyclable.</b> All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E

25|$|Environmental {{considerations}} of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass {{used to make}} bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely <b>recyclable,</b> whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New York Times editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly <b>recyclable,</b> can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is <b>recyclable,</b> its plastic bladder most likely is not.|$|E

25|$|Since August 1993, {{in order}} to promote <b>recyclable</b> {{household}} garbage through sorting, the residents of Minamata City have planned (before any other city in Japan) a detailed garbage classification system; garbage was divided into 21 categories in the fiscal year 1999, and has now reached 24 categories. The City has set up 300 garbage collection stations around the City. Each area's assigned recycling volunteers take turn in groups of two or three to assist the residents who bring in garbage for sorting out <b>recyclable</b> materials by themselves. Once a month the residents work together to classify garbage, an activity which revives the community spirit, and creates a place for residents to get together. Profits from the sale of <b>recyclable</b> garbage are distributed to each district according to the weight of each district's <b>recyclable</b> garbage; large districts receive up to 600,000 yen a year and smaller districts about 70,000-80,000 yen. Besides classification, the Recycling Volunteers Committee promotes Taking-Back-Home- Garbage Campaign, Recycling Campaign, and organizes recycling fairs such as flea markets where reusable goods are sold.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{evaluation}} of utilization of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for solving the residential <b>recyclables</b> collection routing problems. ^ <b>Recyclables</b> collection is {{considered as a}} part of reverse logistics to which a specific routing problem is connected. Rise of recycling rate in recent years, and always high transportation costs are the main drivers for looking for the new methods how to optimize routing in residential <b>recyclables</b> collection. Geospatial relation of data by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software can be used to design and analyze the routing strategy. In this thesis ArcGIS and its Network Analyst extension is used to analyze potential routing improvement in one selected <b>recyclables</b> collection shift in El Paso, Texas. Equation describing the time requirements for the process of <b>recyclables</b> collection with the consideration of effects of set-out rate and turns was established. Despite that the Network Analyst was not designed for solving high density routing tasks of this kind, an approach to obtain acceptable routing solution by this ArcGIS extension was developed. By applying this approach on the selected <b>recyclables</b> collection shift it was found that comparable, routing solution can be obtained. In the end, possible ways how to improve this approach to make the Network Analyst to perform even better in high density routing task is presented together with suggested changes in the investigated collection shift. ...|$|R

25|$|In statistics, 60% of the wastes {{collected}} in the city are collected, hauled and dumped in controlled dumpsites while 5% are retrieved and recycled and 35% are thrown everywhere in the city. Half of all these wastes are non-biodegradable wastes which include plastics, Styrofoams and rubbers alike, while the remaining are biodegradable wastes which is 70% food and kitchen wastes, 20% plant wastes and 10% animal wastes. In 2002, there are about 30 small and big junkshops that collect <b>recyclable</b> materials and 20 schools that require their students to bring <b>recyclable</b> stuff as school project.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{challenge to the}} recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes, making it labor-intensive. Typically, workers sort the plastic {{by looking at the}} resin identification code, although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically, the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not <b>recyclable,</b> which presents additional problems for the sorting process. Other <b>recyclable</b> materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically. However, new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase the capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling.|$|E
25|$|At {{one end of}} the {{spectrum}} is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in {{with the rest of the}} waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of <b>recyclable</b> waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are <b>recyclable</b> is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.|$|E
