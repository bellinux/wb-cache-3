While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he <b>retorted</b> by saying {{that it would not}} affect him at all. He added that not only did his storytelling technique improve, but past mistakes had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities.|$|E
40|$|This paper mainly {{describes}} the world’s commercial oil shale <b>retorting</b> technologies, including lump oil shale and particulate oil shale <b>retorting</b> technologies. Fushun Type <b>Retorting,</b> Petrosix <b>Retorting,</b> and Kiviter <b>Retorting</b> are illustrated as {{the examples of}} lump oil shale retorting; Galoter <b>Retorting</b> and Alberta Taciuk Processing(ATP) are as the particulate oil shale <b>retorting.</b> Comparison of different <b>retorting</b> technologies are discussed. I. Underground <b>Retorting</b> Underground <b>retorting,</b> also called in-situ <b>retorting,</b> is the technology for processing oil shale in-situ underground; it is usually carried out by introducing air to burn and pyrolyze the underground oil shale layer to obtain shale oil. This process obviates the problems of mining, handling, and disposing of large quantity of material, which occurs for aboveground <b>retorting.</b> In-situ <b>retorting</b> offers the potential of recovering the deep buried oil shale. The true in-situ method is not successful, because oil shale lacks permeability, thus hindering the inflow of air and outflow of produced oil and gases, also lowering the heat transfer into the oil shale deposit. Modified in-situ <b>retorting</b> is a better approach, to solve the permeability problem: an uppe...|$|R
5000|$|The Pumpherston <b>retort</b> (also {{known as}} the Bryson <b>retort)</b> was a type of oil-shale <b>retort</b> used in Scotland {{at the end of}} 19th and {{beginning}} of 20th century. It marked separation of the oil-shale industry from the coal industry as it was designed specifically for oil-shale <b>retorting.</b> [...] The <b>retort</b> is named after Pumpherston town in Scotland, {{which was one of the}} major Scottish oil shale areas. The <b>retort</b> was commercialized by Pumpherston Oil Company.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{combustion}} <b>retort</b> process (also {{referred as}} gas-combustion <b>retorting</b> process) was an above-ground <b>retorting</b> technology for shale oil extraction. It was a predecessor of the Paraho and Petrosix processes, and modern directly heated oil shale <b>retorting</b> technologies in general.|$|R
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew.

5|$|Revithi {{arrived at}} the race location, the small village of Marathon, on Thursday, 9April , where the athletes had already {{assembled}} for the following day's race. She {{attracted the attention of}} the reporters and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered her in his house. She answered the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri teased her, predicting that when she entered the Stadium, there would be no crowds left. Revithi <b>retorted</b> that he should not insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a personal {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot {{would be in the}} same vein during the following years. Larsson <b>retorted</b> that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{advanced}} retort-house appliances {{were introduced}} for improved efficiency and convenience. The compressed-air or steam-driven clinkering pick {{was found to}} be especially useful in removing clinker from the primary combustion area of the indirectly fired benches - previously clinkering was an arduous and time-consuming process that used large amounts of <b>retort</b> house labor. Another class of appliances introduced were apparatuses - and ultimately, machines - for <b>retort</b> loading and unloading. <b>Retorts</b> were generally loaded by using an elongated scoop, into which the coal was loaded - a gang of men would then lift the scoop and ram it into the <b>retort.</b> The coal would then be raked by the men into a layer of even thickness and the <b>retort</b> sealed. Gas production would then ensue - and from 8 - 12 hours later, the <b>retort</b> would be opened, and the coal would be either pulled (in the case of [...] "stop-ended" [...] <b>retorts)</b> or pushed (in the case of [...] "through" [...] <b>retorts)</b> out of the <b>retort.</b> Thus, the <b>retort</b> house had heavy manpower requirements - as many men were often required to bear the coal-containing scoop and load the <b>retort.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Retorts</b> are {{operated}} in sets {{and have a}} heat carrier preparation unit and rotating water seals designed for the whole set instead of a single <b>retort</b> as in case of the Kiviter <b>retort.</b> Regenerative furnaces are located next to the <b>retorts</b> and they are operating in two cycles - the combustion cycle and the gas heating cycle. During the combustion cycle, a furnace is heated up to [...] by combustion gases. After the combustion cycle, <b>retort</b> gases from the condensation system is inserted into a furnace for their heating. [...] By alternating furnaces, one furnace is always available for heating <b>retort</b> gas. Twenty <b>retorts</b> typically share one condensation system {{and a set of}} heating furnaces.|$|R
500|$|By <b>retort</b> orientation: [...] "Ex-situ" [...] {{technologies}} are sometimes classified as vertical or horizontal. Vertical <b>retorts</b> are usually shaft kilns where {{a bed of}} shale moves {{from top to bottom}} by gravity. [...] Horizontal <b>retorts</b> are usually horizontal rotating drums or screws where shale moves {{from one end to the}} other. [...] As a general rule, vertical <b>retorts</b> process lumps using a gas heat carrier, while horizontal <b>retorts</b> process fines using solid heat carrier.|$|R
5|$|The expedition's next {{destination}} was Sarawak, {{on the island}} of Borneo. By the time they left Sarawak, the conflict between Beebe and Horsfall had grown {{to such a degree that}} Beebe decided Horsfall was endangering the expedition and must be sent home. In response to Beebe's dismissal, Horsfall <b>retorted</b> that he had been ill-treated by Beebe from the beginning of the expedition, and that his subsequent actions had been for the express purpose of revenge. Continuing without Horsfall, Beebe and Blair traveled to Batavia in Java, to the island of Madura just to the north, and to Belitung between Borneo and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{convened in}} June 1564, an {{argument}} broke out between Knox and Maitland over {{the authority of}} the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from Martin Luther and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers. Knox <b>retorted</b> that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.|$|E
5|$|Many Greek Orthodox populations, {{particularly}} {{those outside the}} newly independent modern Greek state, continued to refer to themselves as Romioi (i.e. Romans, Byzantines) well into the 20th century. Peter Charanis, born {{on the island of}} Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island was taken from the Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‘‘What are you looking at?’’ one of the soldiers asked. ‘‘At Hellenes,’’ the children replied. ‘‘Are you not Hellenes yourselves?’’ the soldier <b>retorted.</b> ‘‘No, we are Romans,’’ the children replied.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{increases}} in efficiency and safety were {{seen with the}} introduction of the [...] "through" [...] <b>retort,</b> which had a door at front and rear. This provided for greater efficiency and safety in loading and unloading the <b>retorts,</b> which was a labor-intensive and often dangerous process. Coal could now be pushed out of the <b>retort</b> - rather than pulled out of the <b>retort.</b> One interesting modification of the [...] "through" [...] <b>retort</b> was the [...] "inclined" [...] <b>retort</b> - coming into its heyday in the 1880s - a <b>retort</b> set on a moderate incline, where coal was poured in at one end, and the <b>retort</b> sealed; following pyrolysis, the bottom was opened and the coke poured out by gravity. This was adopted in some gas-works, but the savings in labor were often offset by the uneven distribution and pyrolysis of the coal as well as clumping problems leading to failure of the coal to pour out of the bottom following pyrolysis that were exacerbated in certain coal types. As such, inclined <b>retorts</b> were rendered obsolescent by later advances, including the retort-handling machine and the vertical <b>retort</b> system.|$|R
25|$|Coldharbour Mill {{generated}} its own {{coal gas}} on site for lighting the mill (and thus enabling the machinery {{to be run}} all night). Although the <b>retorts</b> have been removed and disposed of, the Gas <b>Retort</b> house which housed the <b>retort</b> bench is still standing. In fact, the original gas <b>retorts</b> have been discovered in the leat, where they served as weir components. English Heritage classifies the late 19th century Gas <b>Retort</b> House as a very rare survival of gas-making facilities.|$|R
5000|$|These two {{advances}} {{turned the}} old, [...] "directly fired" [...] <b>retort</b> bench into the advanced, [...] "indirectly fired", [...] "regenerative" [...] or [...] "generative" [...] <b>retort</b> bench, and lead coke usage within the <b>retort</b> benches (in the larger works) to drop from upwards of 40% of the coke {{made by the}} <b>retorts</b> to factors as low as 15% of the coke made by the <b>retorts,</b> leading to an improvement in efficiency of an order of magnitude. These improvements imparted an additional capital cost to the <b>retort</b> bench, which caused them to be slowly incorporated in the smaller gas-works, if they were incorporated at all.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} charge, Manekshaw reached the {{conclusion}} that poor leadership had been {{a significant factor in}} IV Corps' failure in the war with China. He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralized soldiers, and issued orders to advance to the positions lost in the war, which kept morale up. Just five days into his command, Nehru visited the headquarters with his daughter Indira Gandhi and the COAS, and found the troops advancing. Nehru stated {{that he did not want}} any more men to die. The COAS assured him that he would get the orders rescinded. Manekshaw <b>retorted</b> that the COAS should allow him to command his troops the way he wished or send him to a staff appointment. Gandhi intervened and told Manekshaw to go ahead. Though Gandhi had no official position, she had great influence in the government. The next task Manekshaw took-up was to reorganize the troops in North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). He took measures to overcome the shortages of equipment, accommodation, and clothing.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Major Generals Shmuel Gonen and Chaim Bar-Lev, {{the heads}} of Israeli Southern Command and Sharon's superiors, {{continued}} to press Sharon to send forces to the east bank to widen the corridor to the Israeli bridgehead, while Sharon ignored these commands repeatedly, claiming that the attacks were unnecessary. Gonen finally issued a peremptory order to Sharon to transfer troops to the east bank and conduct a full-scale attack to widen the corridor. Sharon only sent five tanks as reinforcement to the armored brigade on the east bank tasked with launching the attack. Consequently, the Israelis suffered heavy losses and the assault was repulsed. Gonen and Bar-Lev were now joined by Lieutenant General David Elazar, and ordered Sharon to renew the attack, this time transferring Reshef's brigade. Sharon opposed this however, and argued that if he succeeded in his mission, the Egyptian Second Army would collapse, thereby eliminating any Egyptian threat to the Israeli corridor and bridgehead. He <b>retorted</b> with the claim that {{had it not been}} for Southern Command's hesitation, he could have encircled Ismailia by now. When his superiors remained adamant, Sharon bypassed the chain of command and contacted the Minister of Defense, Moshe Dayan, who called off any further attacks on the east bank. As a result, Sharon would be able to concentrate his attention and the efforts of his three brigades in the final push to capture Ismailia.|$|E

40|$|This project {{which deals}} with the {{demonstration}} of a full size commercial coking <b>retort</b> using Calderon's proprietary technology for making metallurgical coke ran into a commercialization problem by virtue that the designed <b>retort</b> for two (2) tons of coke/hour necessitates thirty-two (32) <b>retorts</b> to produce the 500, 000 tons of coke per year for a commercial plant. Bechtel Mining and Metals prepared a cost estimate of the commercial plant which indicated the commercial plant would not be economically feasible. The activity during this reporting period was directed to making changes {{to the design of}} the coking <b>retort</b> {{in order to reduce the}} number of <b>retorts</b> required for a 500, 000 ton/year commercial coke facility. The result of this activity resulted in the drastic reduction of the number of <b>retorts</b> to eight (8) with each <b>retort</b> projected to produce 8. 17 tons of coke/hour.
