25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve <b>regeneration</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair.</b> Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them.

Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E
25|$|Nervous system {{injuries}} affect over 90,000 {{people every}} year. It {{is estimated that}} spinal cord injuries alone affect 10,000 each year. As {{a result of this}} high incidence of neurological injuries, nerve <b>regeneration</b> <b>and</b> <b>repair,</b> a subfield of neural tissue engineering, is becoming a rapidly growing field dedicated to the discovery of new ways to recover nerve functionality after injury. The nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which consists of cranial and spinal nerves along with their associated ganglia. While the peripheral nervous system has an intrinsic ability for repair and regeneration, the central nervous system is, for the most part, incapable of self-repair and regeneration. There is currently no treatment for recovering human nerve function after injury to the central nervous system. In addition, multiple attempts at nerve re-growth across the PNS-CNS transition have not been successful. There is simply not enough knowledge about regeneration in the central nervous system. In addition, although the peripheral nervous system has the capability for regeneration, much research still {{needs to be done to}} optimize the environment for maximum regrowth potential. Neuroregeneration is important clinically, as it is part of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including multiple sclerosis.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to mammals, salamanders can regenerate complex structures after injury, including entire limbs. A central {{question is whether}} the generation of progenitor cells during limb <b>regeneration</b> <b>and</b> mammalian tissue <b>repair</b> occur via separate or overlapping mechanisms. Limb regeneration depends on the formation of a blastema, from which the new appendage develops. Dedifferentiation of stump tissues, such as skeletal muscle, precedes blastema formation, but it was not known whether dedifferentiation involves stem cell activation. We describe a multipotent Pax 7 + satellite cell population located within the skeletal muscle of the salamander limb. We demonstrate that skeletal muscle dedifferentiation involves satellite cell activation and that these cells can contribute to new limb tissues. Activation of salamander satellite cells occurs in an analogous manner to how the mammalian myofiber mobilizes stem cells during skeletal muscle tissue <b>repair.</b> Thus, limb <b>regeneration</b> <b>and</b> mammalian tissue <b>repair</b> share common cellular and molecular programs.

Recent {{development}} of tissue engineering has been emphasized on tissue <b>regeneration</b> <b>and</b> <b>repairing</b> {{in order to}} solve the limitation of organ and tissue transplantation issues. Biomaterial scaffold, which {{plays an important role}} in this development, not only provides a promising alternative in order to improve the efficiency of cell transplantation in tissue engineering but also to deliver cells with growth factors and drugs into injured tissue to increase the survival of cell via drug delivery system. In this study, nanofibers were fabricated through blending of a synthetic polymer, polycaprolactone (PCL) and a natural polymer, Gelatin (Ge) using electrospinning technique. Processing parameters were optimized to determine the most suitable properties of PCL/Ge nanofibers. The surface morphology of PCL/Ge nanofibers were then characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Six samples of nanofibers from different amount of gelatin mixed with 10 % PCL (w/v) were successfully fabricated. Experimental results showed that 18 kV of high voltage provided more homogenous and less beaded nanofibers.

40|$|Successful axonal {{outgrowth}} in {{the adult}} central nervous system (CNS) {{is central to the}} process of nerve <b>regeneration</b> <b>and</b> brain <b>repair.</b> To date, much of the knowledge on axonal guidance and outgrowth comes from studies on neuritogenesis and patterning during development where distal growth cones constantly sample the local environment and respond to specific physical and trophic influences. Opposing permissive (e. g., growth factors) and hostile signals (e. g., repulsive cues) are processed, leading to growth cone remodelling, and a concomitant restructuring of the cytoskeleton, thereby permitting pioneering extension and a potential for establishing synaptic connections. Repulsive cues, such as semaphorins, ephrins and myelin-secreted inhibitory glycoproteins, act through their respective receptors to affect the collapsing or turning of growth cones via several pathways, such as the Rho GTPases signalling which precipitates the cytoskeletal changes. One of the direct modulators of microtubules is the family of brain-specific proteins, collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP). Exciting evidence emerged recently that cleavage of CRMPs in response to injury-activated proteases, such as calpain, signals axonal retraction and neuronal death in adult post-mitotic neurons, while blocking this signal transduction prevents axonal retraction and death following excitotoxic insult <b>and</b> cerebral ischemia. <b>Regeneration</b> is minimal in injured postnatal CNS, albeit the occurrence of some limited remodelling in areas where synaptic plasticity is prevalent. Frequently in the absence of axonal regeneration, there is not only an inevitable loss of functional connections, but also a loss of neurons, such as through the actions of dependence receptors. Deciphering the cues and signalling pathways of axonal guidance and outgrowth may hold the key to fully understanding nerve <b>regeneration</b> <b>and</b> brain <b>repair,</b> thereby opening the way for developing potential therapeutic...|$|R

We screened a peptoid combinatorial library to search for semaphorin 3 A inhibitors, and identified a peptoid (SICHI: semaphorin Induced chemorepulsion inhibitor) that blocks semaphorin 3 A-chemorepulsion and growth-cone collapse in axons at millimolar concentrations. SICHI inhibits the binding of semaphorin 3 A to its receptor complex (neuropilin 1 /plexin A 1) and semaphorin 3 A-induced phosphorylation of GSK 3. Chemorepulsion induced by semaphorin 3 F or netrin 1 is not blocked by SICHI. We also show that SICHI promotes neural regeneration of damaged axons.
