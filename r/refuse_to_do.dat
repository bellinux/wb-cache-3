5|$|Only then, in April 879, did Ibn Tulun {{return to}} Egypt. Abbas fled west with his supporters, and from Barqa {{tried to take}} over Ifriqiya. Defeated by the Ifriqiyans (probably {{in the winter of}} 880–881), he retreated back east to Alexandria, where he was finally confronted and {{captured}} by Ibn Tulun's forces. After being publicly paraded seated on a mule, Ibn Tulun ordered his son to execute or mutilate his companions, who had driven him to rebel. Ibn Tulun reportedly secretly hoped that his son would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> such a dishonourable act, but he agreed. Weeping, Ibn Tulun had Abbas whipped and imprisoned. He then named his second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir-apparent.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{differs from}} the other {{institutions}} in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed {{in the field of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects. However, the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions. Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is not binding.|$|E

25|$|A related {{case is that}} of a {{woman whose}} husband has died childless: in such a situation, the husband's brother is {{required}} by Jewish law to enter into a levirate marriage with the widow so as to have children with her {{in the name of the}} deceased. The brother can <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> yibbum and instead perform a ceremony known as chalitza to release her from her bond to him (in modern times chalitza is nearly always performed instead of yibbum). If the brother is missing, or if he is still a child, the woman is required to wait until he is located or has reached adolescence so that he can perform the chalitza ceremony. There have been recorded cases of the husband's brother trying to blackmail the widow by delaying the chalitza ceremony, effectively leaving her as an agunah.|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was {{generally}} negative about the film, stating, [...] "The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen {{holes in the}} plot {{as well as by}} reams of exposition" [...] and that it was [...] "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." [...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review.

500|$|Upset by the {{national}} attention, Mayor McDaniels wants to resolve the situation, and the boys suggest getting the official dictionary definition updated. The town invites the English Dictionary Officiates, led by the head editor, former child actor Emmanuel Lewis, to review the proposal and consider making the definition change official. As the town celebrates the arrival of Lewis and the Officiates, the bikers suddenly crash the event and begin to riot. After inflicting damage to the town and scaring off the citizens, they corner the boys in an alley.

500|$|Duvall was {{the only}} American actor {{nominated}} for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 The Eagle Has Landed), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about [...] "the Limey syndrome," [...] claiming [...] "the attitude {{with a lot of}} people in Hollywood is that what they do in England is somehow better than what we do here." [...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 May 1945, Germany {{surrendered}} unconditionally to the Allied powers, {{marking the}} practical end of World War II in Europe. The German Instrument of Surrender applied to German Wehrmacht forces in Yugoslavia {{as well as}} those armed forces under German command such as the Croatian Armed Forces. This would ordinarily have meant that they too had to cease their activities on 8 May and stay where they found themselves. The Ustaše military, however, came under the command of Pavelić, because as they were about to surrender, General Alexander Löhr, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group E handed command of the Croatian forces to Pavelić on 8 May. Pavelić issued an order from Rogaška Slatina for his troops not to surrender to the Partisans, but to escape to Austria, to implement the Croatian government's decision of 3 May to flee to Austria. Following the capitulation of Germany on 8 May, Tito issued an address via Radio Belgrade on 9 May calling upon all armed collaborators to surrender, threatening [...] "merciless response" [...] from the people and the army should they <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
2500|$|The Islamic prophet, Muhammad's first {{interaction}} {{with the people of}} Egypt occurred in 628, during the Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma).

But if you <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the Copts". During this expedition one of Muhammad's envoys Dihyah bin Khalifa Kalbi was attacked, Muhammad sent Zayd ibn Haritha to help him. Dihya approached the Banu Dubayb (a tribe which converted to Islam and had good relations with Muslims) for help. When the news reached Muhammad, he immediately dispatched Zayd ibn Haritha with 500 men to battle. The Muslim army fought with Banu Judham, killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties), including their chief, Al-Hunayd ibn Arid and his son, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and 100 women and boys. The new chief of the Banu Judham who had embraced Islam appealed to Muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen, and Muhammad released them.|$|E

The Ninth Circuit stayed the appeal pending a response from the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court heard oral argument on the certified question on September 6, 2011, and on November 17 ruled that the non-governmental proponents of Proposition 8 have the legal standing to defend it. Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye wrote in a unanimous opinion, [...] "n the past official proponents of initiative measures in California have uniformly been permitted to participate ... in numerous lawsuits in California courts challenging the validity of the initiative measure the proponents sponsored" [...] and a concurring opinion was written by Justice Joyce L.

In 2013, The Guardian reported that some 85,000 cancer patients required forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that had become scarce. Western governments have built waivers into the sanctions regime to ensure that essential medicines get through, but those waivers conflict with blanket restrictions on banking, as well as bans on [...] "dual-use" [...] chemicals that might have a military as well as a medical application. An estimated 40,000 haemophiliacs cannot get blood-clotting medicines, and operations on haemophiliacs have been virtually suspended because of the risks created by the shortages.

The society representing the 8,000 Iranians suffering from thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder, has said its members are beginning to die because of a lack of an essential drug, deferoxamine, used to control the iron content in the blood. Further, Iran can no longer buy medical equipment such as autoclaves, essential for the production of many drugs, because some of the biggest Western pharmaceutical companies <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business with the country.|$|E
2500|$|In this context, Ornea {{came to be}} {{regarded}} with suspicion by the establishment. His views were criticized by the nationalist magazine Săptămîna, whose contributor Constantin Sorescu depicted him as a [...] "dogmatist" [...] of Marxism. In 1974-1975, Ornea's name was invoked by high-ranking Romanian Communist Party activists such as Ion Dodu Bălan in a matter involving the censorship of literary historian Gelu Ionescu. Ionescu had intended to publish Anatomia unei negații ("The Anatomy of a Negation"), {{a book about the}} self-exiled writer Eugène Ionesco (whose own work had only been selectively published at home); the volume was positively reviewed for publication by Ornea and various of his colleagues (Ion Ianoși and Paul Cornea among them), but was rejected by both Dodu Bălan and novelist Marin Preda, who cited Eugène Ionesco's anti-communist views. As a result, Ornea was pressured into submitting a [...] "self-criticism" [...] statement. In a 2000 interview, Ornea recalled that the Ceaușescu years had brought renewed pressures for him to leave the country for Israel: [...] "I constantly enjoyed the friendship of Romanian and Jewish democratic writers, which provided me with resilience and courage. It was extremely annoying for the Ceaușist nationalists that, as a Jew, I would not leave for Israel and would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.
