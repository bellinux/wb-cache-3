25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually <b>reverse-biased</b> (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E

25|$|All {{solenoids}} and coils used on microprocessor games {{include a}} special <b>reverse-biased</b> diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{types of}} BJT {{function}} by letting a small current input {{to the base}} control an amplified output from the collector. The {{result is that the}} transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the NPN transistor in what is called active mode, the base–emitter voltage [...] and collector–base voltage [...] are positive, forward biasing the emitter–base junction and reverse-biasing the collector–base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the <b>reverse-biased</b> n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the <b>reverse-biased</b> collector–base junction. For a figure describing forward and reverse bias, see semiconductor diodes.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{these regions}} are well defined for {{sufficiently}} large applied voltage, they overlap somewhat for small (less {{than a few}} hundred millivolts) biases. For example, in the typical grounded-emitter configuration of an NPN BJT used as a pulldown switch in digital logic, the [...] "off" [...] state never involves a <b>reverse-biased</b> junction because the base voltage never goes below ground; nevertheless the forward bias is close enough to zero that essentially no current flows, so {{this end of the}} forward active region can be regarded as the cutoff region.|$|E

2500|$|To {{minimize}} {{the percentage of}} carriers that recombine before reaching the collector–base junction, the transistor's base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's minority carrier lifetime. In particular, {{the thickness of the}} base must be much less than the [...] of the electrons. The collector–base junction is <b>reverse-biased,</b> and so little electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but electrons that diffuse through the base towards the collector are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region of the collector–base junction. The thin shared base and asymmetric collectoremitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two separate and oppositely biased diodes connected in series.|$|E
2500|$|Higher {{subthreshold}} conduction: As MOSFET geometries shrink, {{the voltage}} {{that can be}} applied to the gate must be reduced to maintain reliability. To maintain performance, the threshold voltage of the MOSFET has to be reduced as well. As threshold voltage is reduced, the transistor cannot be switched from complete turn-off to complete turn-on with the limited voltage swing available; the circuit design is a compromise between strong current in the [...] "on" [...] case and low current in the [...] "off" [...] case, and the application determines whether to favor one over the other. Subthreshold leakage (including subthreshold conduction, gate-oxide leakage and <b>reverse-biased</b> junction leakage), which was ignored in the past, now can consume upwards of half of the total power consumption of modern high-performance VLSI chips.|$|E

40|$|This letter reports an {{extensive}} {{analysis of the}} degradation mechanisms of InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) submitted to <b>reverse-bias</b> electrostatic discharge (ESD). The results of this analysis indicate that two different failure modes, namely, “soft” and “hard” degradations, can be induced by ESD pulses. The “soft” failure mode takes place {{as a consequence of}} ESD events with moderate voltage/current levels and consists in a decrease in the <b>reverse-bias</b> leakage current of LEDs. This effect is due to the annihilation of some of the defective paths responsible for leakage-current conduction, possibly triggered by the injection of relatively high <b>reverse-bias</b> current densities. “Hard” failure takes place when high-voltage/current ESD pulses are applied to an LED. After hard failure, LEDs behave as short circuits. This process is due to the high voltage levels reached by the junction during an ESD event (with subsequent dielectric rupture) or to the injection of extremely high current densities through one of the localized paths responsible for reverse-current conduction...|$|R
50|$|Leakage {{current is}} {{generally}} measured in microamperes. For a <b>reverse-biased</b> diode it is temperature sensitive. Leakage current {{must be carefully}} examined for applications that work in wide temperature ranges.|$|E
50|$|Newer CMOS {{output buffers}} using lightly doped {{silicide}} drains are more ESD sensitive; the N-channel driver usually suffers {{damage in the}} oxide layer or n+/p well junction. This is caused by current crowding during the snapback of the parasitic NPN transistor. In P/NMOS totem-pole structures, the NMOS transistor is almost always the one damaged. The structure of the junction influences its ESD sensitivity; corners and defects can lead to current crowding, reducing the damage threshold. Forward-biased junctions are less sensitive than <b>reverse-biased</b> ones because the Joule heat of forward-biased junctions is dissipated through a thicker layer of the material, {{as compared to the}} narrow depletion region in <b>reverse-biased</b> junction.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a deep {{investigation of the}} degradation mechanisms induced by off-state and on-state stress in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Concerning <b>reverse-bias</b> degradation, results underline that the exposure to <b>reverse-bias</b> stress can induce (i) a recoverable change in the gate current due to the accumulation of negative charges under the gate, (ii) and a permanent degradation of gate characteristics due to the generation of vertical parasitic leakage paths through the AlGaN layer. Further analysis of the kinetics of this degradation mechanism, correlated with time-resolved Electroluminescence (EL) measurements, allowed to define a model that explains the time-dependence of the phenomenon {{and the role of}} gate voltage as accelerating factor, providing an interpretation for both recoverable and permanent modifications of the main device characteristics induced by <b>reverse-bias</b> stress. On the other hand, on devices that have shown an improved robustness against the <b>reverse-bias</b> gate degradation, we investigated the origin of the degradation under on-state stress. In this case, results obtained with a combined electrical and optical analysis, showed that on-state stress may induce a significant decrease in drain saturation current and Electroluminescence (EL) signal, with a degradation rate that strongly depends on the EL intensity measured before stress, which is representative of the presence of hot-electrons in the channel. On-state degradation can be ascribed to a decrease in the electric-field, due to the trapping of electrons within the barrier or at the surface induced by hot-electrons. Therefore, by using the EL signal as measure of the stress accelerating factor, it was possible to derive an acceleration law for hot-electron degradation on GaN HEMTs...|$|R
