25|$|At {{absolute}} zero temperature, {{a crystal lattice}} lies in its ground state, and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero temperature has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates randomly about some mean value. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which {{can be viewed as}} a gas of phonons. (The <b>random</b> <b>motion</b> of the atoms in the lattice is what we usually think of as heat.) Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.|$|E
25|$|If {{one could}} observe a gas under a {{powerful}} microscope, one {{would see a}} collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc.) without any definite shape or volume that are in more or less <b>random</b> <b>motion.</b> These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with another particle or with {{the sides of the}} container. In an ideal gas, these collisions are perfectly elastic. This particle or microscopic view of a gas is described by the Kinetic-molecular theory. The assumptions behind this theory {{can be found in the}} postulates section of Kinetic Theory.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} mechanics all particles can {{be thought}} of as having some energy made up of their potential energy and kinetic energy. Temperature, for example, arises from the intensity of random particle motion caused by kinetic energy (known as brownian motion). As temperature is reduced to absolute zero, it might be thought that all motion ceases and particles come completely to rest. In fact, however, kinetic energy is retained by particles even at the lowest possible temperature. The <b>random</b> <b>motion</b> corresponding to this zero-point energy never vanishes as a consequence of the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.|$|E

40|$|An {{elementary}} psychophysical {{model to}} predict ride comfort was developed using flight and simulator data where subjects {{were exposed to}} six degrees of freedom. The model presumes that the comfort response {{is proportional to the}} logarithm of the stimulus above some threshold stimulus. In order to verify this concept of comfort modeling, it was necessary to obtain ride comfort data for single degree of freedom <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> and for combinations of <b>random</b> <b>motions.</b> Accordingly, a simulator program was performed at the NASA Langley Research Center to measure subjective comfort response ratings using one degree of freedom, two degrees of freedom, three degrees of freedom, and six degrees of freedom. An analysis of the single degree of freedom and two degrees of freedom data is presented. Preliminary models of ride comfort response for single degree of freedom <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> and for certain combinations of two degrees of freedom <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> were developed...|$|R
40|$|A {{particle}} in a uniformly accelerated <b>motion</b> exhibits Brownian <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> {{around the}} classical trajectory {{due to the}} coupling to the field vacuum fluctuations. Previous works show that the Brownian <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> satisfy the energy equipartition relation. This thermal property is understood as the consequence of the Unruh effect. In the present work, we investigate the radiation from the thermal <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> of an accelerated particle coupled to vacuum fluctuations. The energy flux of this radiation is negative of the order smaller than the classical radiation by the factor a/m, where a is the acceleration constant and m is the mass of a particle.

25|$|Boltzmann {{accomplished}} the feat of {{showing that the}} second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy {{is analogous to the}} disordering of an initially ordered pack of cards under repeated shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.) The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to understand {{from the standpoint of the}} theory of probability. Consider two ordinary dice, with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the <b>random</b> <b>motion</b> (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system must move to one of the more probable states. However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between internal and kinetic energy {{is hard to}} make in the presence of turbulent motion within the system, as friction gradually dissipates macroscopic kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into molecular <b>random</b> <b>motion</b> of molecules that is classified as internal energy. [...] The rate of dissipation by friction of kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into internal energy, whether in turbulent or in streamlined flow, is an important quantity in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This is a serious difficulty for attempts to define entropy for time-varying spatially inhomogeneous systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{large-scale}} {{structure of}} the Universe also looks different if one only uses redshift to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be {{if there were no}} cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some <b>random</b> <b>motion</b> around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a [...] "finger of God" [...] the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.|$|E

2500|$|Heat is {{the amount}} of energy that flows spontaneously from a warmer object to a cooler one. [...] More generally, heat arises from many microscopic-scale changes to the objects, and can be defined as the amount of {{transferred}} energy excluding both macroscopic work and transfer of part of the object itself. [...] The process of heat, also called heating, can occur via contact between the source and the destination body, as in conduction; or by radiation between remote bodies; or by way of an intermediate fluid body, as in convective circulation; or by a combination of these. [...] In thermodynamics, heat is often contrasted with work: heat applies to individual particles (such as atoms or molecules), work applies to objects (or a system as a whole). [...] Heat involves stochastic (or <b>random)</b> <b>motion</b> equally distributed among all degrees of freedom, while work is directional, confined to one or more specific degrees of freedom.|$|E

40|$|The current {{paper is}} aimed in getting more insight on three main points {{concerning}} large-scale astrophysical systems, namely: (i) formulation of tensor virial equations {{from the standpoint}} of analytical mechanics; (ii) investigation on the role of systematic and <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> with respect to virial equilibrium configurations; (iii) extent to which systematic and <b>random</b> <b>motions</b> are equivalent in flattening or elongating the shape of a mass distribution. The tensor virial equations are formulated regardless from the nature of the system and its constituents, by generalizing and extending a procedure used for the scalar virial equations, in presence of discrete subunits (Landau & Lifchitz 1966). In particular, the self potential-energy tensor is shown to be symmetric with respect to the exchange of the indices, (Epot) pq = (Epot) qp.
