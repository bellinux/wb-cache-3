2500|$|On 23 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council {{discussed}} Campbell's {{appointment as}} Registrar of Deeds.

6000|$|Sir William Herschel has {{presented}} me {{with one of}} the two original [...] "Contracts" [...] in Bengali, dated 1858, which suggested to his mind the idea of using this method of identification. It was so difficult to obtain credence to the signatures of the natives, that he thought he would use the signature of the hand itself, chiefly with the intention of frightening the man who made it from afterwards denying his formal act; however, the impression proved so good that Sir W. Herschel became convinced that the same method might be further utilised. He finally introduced the use of finger prints in several departments at Hooghly in 1877, after seventeen years' experience {{of the value of the}} evidence they afforded. A too brief account of his work was given by him in Nature, xxiii. p. 23 (Nov. 25, 1880). He mentions there that he had been taking finger marks as sign-manuals for more than twenty years, and had introduced them for practical purposes in several ways in India with marked benefit. They rendered attempts to repudiate signatures quite hopeless. Finger prints were taken of Pensioners to prevent their personation by others after their death; they were used in the office for <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deeds,</b> and at a gaol where each prisoner had to sign with his finger. By comparing the prints of persons then living, with their prints taken twenty years previously, he considered he had proved that the lapse of at least that period made no change sufficient to affect the utility of the plan. He informs me that he submitted, in 1877, a report in semi-official form to the Inspector-General of Gaols, asking to be allowed to extend the process; but no result followed. In 1881, at the request of the Governor of the gaol at Greenwich (Sydney), he sent a description of the method, but no further steps appear to have been taken there.|$|E

50|$|In {{questions}} concerning labor law and social justice, Makasiar's opinions for the Court reflected sympathies {{to the common}} man, and would sometimes resort in rebuke to injustices as reflected by {{the facts of the}} case.

Her good faith subsisted and continued to exist when she recorded her adverse claim four (4) days prior to the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> Infante's <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> sale. Carbonell's good faith did not cease after Poncio told her on January 31, 1955 of his second sale of the same lot to Infante, Because of that information, Carbonell wanted an audience with Infante, which desire underscores Carbonell's good faith. With an aristocratic disdain unworthy of the good breeding of a good Christian and good neighbor, Infante snubbed Carbonell like a leper and refused to see her. So Carbonell did {{the next best thing to}} protect her right — she registered her adverse claim on February 8, 1955.

2500|$|At least 20 U.S. {{states have}} experimented with Torrens title or other title {{registration}} systems {{at one time}} or another, but most have retreated to title recording under pressure from title insurers or from lack of interest. [...] According to Karl Llewellyn, one Torrens title on one lot in New York City can render the entire block unavailable for large-scale improvement (i.e., skyscrapers); no lender will finance the purchase of such a lot because no New York title insurer will guarantee a Torrens title. The U.S. title insurance industry has successfully opposed land registration systems by saying that they are vulnerable to fraud (a severe problem in most land registration jurisdictions) and that an inherently contingent property system more effectively protects property rights. While it is possible to fortify land registration systems to prevent the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> forged <b>deeds,</b> the necessary countermeasures are complex and expensive.

5000|$|Registration of Land {{transactions}} - Under British rule, {{there were}} significant changes to land ownership policies. During {{the early part of}} British rule, the policies concentrated on the provision of larger tracts of land, for plantations of cinnamon, coffee, tea, rubber and coconuts. This influenced to a large extent the changes to the traditional policies and attitudes to land. In 1840, enactment of the Crown Lands (Encroachment) Ordinance was a landmark event. Under that ordinance all waste lands in the country such as forests and chena (shifting cultivation), uncultivated and unoccupied lands were presumed to be property of the crown, unless proved otherwise. This ensured the availability of crown lands for the British investors for plantations. The first significant legislation to attempt introduction of title registration in Sri Lanka was enacted in 1863. It did not lead to the full registration of titles as envisaged by the government of the day. Unfortunately, as a temporary measure, the government allowed the adoption of the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>deeds,</b> which is still in place today and is entrenched in the laws of Sri Lanka.|$|E

Knowing that an assurance fund must increase or perish, the decision was taken to extend the business remit by introducing elements such as Passenger life assurance and Baggage insurance. The main focus was the extension of the Society’s operations into the field of ‘general’ (as opposed to ‘marine’) life assurance. In 1862, in order to remove any possible misapprehension that the Society was solely concerned with life risks, the name ‘Marine Life and Casualty Mutual Assurance Society’ was abandoned and the present full name of the Society adopted.The change of name was followed by a change of address from 137 Leadenhall Street via 60 Fenchurch Street (now the Fenchurch Street Post Office) to 14 Leadenhall Street - the home of the Society for the next sixty years.|$|R

In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto pieces of parchment called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and {{a description of the}} property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.|$|R
