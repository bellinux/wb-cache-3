25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as <b>rotating</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R

40|$|A 1 / 12 scale {{tank was}} {{constructed}} to physically simulate the metallurgical skimming process {{in order to}} gain a better insight of the skimming of fluid slag from copper anode furnaces. 1 -decanol and water were used to represent the slag and the underlying liquid metal respectively. It was observed that slag skimming was comprised of two steps, a transportation step to carry slag to the skimming lip, and a removal step to move the slag across the lip. The efficiency of the transportation by bath surface circulation was strongly affected by the method of creation of the surface movement. Submerged gas injection failed to carry slag to the lip effectively because of the uncontrollable circulation pattern generated on the bath surface. On the other hand, three impinging gas jets in glancing contact with the bath surface were able to carry slag to the lip effectively. The Re of the jets (I. D. 0. 01 m) inclined 50 ° to the horizontal was 6100. The jet configuration was two of the jets were placed close and parallel to the rear wall of the model and faced each other.

40|$|Throughout {{the industrialized}} era, fossil fuels {{have been used}} {{extensively}} in combustion processes to generate heat and electricity. However, the combustion of such fuels creates {{emissions of greenhouse gases}}, mainly carbon dioxide, and other hazardous products. As these gases are released to the atmosphere, they contribute to global warming, which is a global issue of concern. It is therefore of great importance to study combustion processes and explore new ways to reduce their environmental impacts. One way of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is to replace the energy source: from fossil to renewable. To attain {{a better understanding of the}} combustion process experimental and modeling work is needed. Such work can be undertaken to increase the efficiency and demonstrate the possible effects of fuel substitution. The first half of this thesis focuses on the rotary kiln process, which is used in iron ore pellet production, and studies the associated <b>rotating</b> <b>furnace</b> and the radiative heat transfer process. The experimental work was performed during a measurement campaign in a down-scaled version of the furnace, and the results are compared and modeled using a discrete transfer model for different fuels. The focus is on comparing a reference coal with co-firing cases that employ a combination of 70 % reference coal and 30 % biomass for two different types of biomass. The results reveal the possibility of using co-firing in a full-scale rotary kiln, which is not expected to have any significant impact on the radiative heat transfer within the process. Measurements from a similar but earlier campaign were used together with a radiative model, using the discrete ordinates method to study the process in three dimensions.

40|$|During the {{refining}} {{of steel}} by basic processes, {{a multitude of}} mineralogical reactions {{take place in the}} refractories with which the furnace is lined. The reactions are caused by an influx of material from the slag and are a function of the composition of the slag and of the refractory. The flow of material from the slag into the refractory resembles the process of metasomatism encountered in nature. The reactions between slags of different composition and magnesiteand chromite-containing refractories could be studied systematically {{as a result of a}} series of four experiments. During each of the experiments four different refractories were subjected to the influence of a slag having a specific composition for a considerable length of time. The experiments were conducted in a <b>rotating</b> <b>furnace</b> at 1700 ° 0 ~ Mineralogical reactions in the refractories used in these experiments can be divided into two main categories, viz. reactions involving the oxides and reactions involving the silicates. The relevant oxides are periclase, the sesquioxides and spinel. Periclase is found to Mndergo reactions like grain growth, resorption and elongation normal to the hot face of the refractory. These reactions are dependent on the composition of the refractory and of the metasomatised components. Reaction between periclase and sesquioxides yield spinel, provided there is no excess of lime. Exsolution of bodies of spinel from periclase is governed by the crystal-chemistry of both minerals. At elevated temperature, spinel, and more specifically chromite, acts as a source of sesquioxides in general, and of ferric oxide in particular. The stability of chromite depends on the molecular ratio between lime and silica of both the refractory and the slag. This ratio determines the amount of sesquioxides present, but not in spinel or in periclase, i. e. in the matrix of the refractory. The postulation of the reactions involving the silicates is possible because of the tendency of the refractory to reach equilibrium with the composition of the slag. The silicates present in acid slags are not in equilibrium with magnesia in the refractory, and consequent reaction yields the minerals monticellite and merwinite. These minerals are not in equilibrium with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories which have high molecular lime/silica ratios and also not with the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories having ver. y low molecular lime/silica ratios. Reaction between metasomatic and autochthonous silicates result in a new set of silicates. The silicates present in basic slags are in equilibrium with magnesia of the refractories as well as with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios. Consequently, no reaction results. Reaction does, however, take place between the silicates supplied by basic slags and the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories. Ultrabasic slags react mildly with magnesite and drastically with chrome-magnesite bricks. The reason is that in the former reaction, only monticellite and merwinite are not in equilibrium with the composition of the melt, but these minerals have a relatively high mobility, and migrate de~per into the refractory. In chromite-containing refractories, however, neither of the minerals chromite, monticellite or forsterite are in equilibrium with the composition of the slag. Reaction results in the formation of an association of minerals in the area of contact between the slag and the refractory which differs completely from the original minerals of the refractory. The conclusion arrived at is that chromite has a beneficial influence on refractories used in contact with less basic slags, because of the textural superiority of chromite-containing refractories over magnesite refractories. In contact with basic slags, however, metasomatism leads to the formation of components which have low melting points and low viscosities. During the refining of steel by basic processes, ultrabasic slags are preferred and magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios are better suited for use in contact with the liquid slag.
