5|$|Bruce's chosen {{life as an}} explorer, his {{unreliable}} {{sources of}} income and his frequent extended absences, all placed severe strains on the marriage, and the couple became estranged around 1916. However, they continued {{to live in the}} same house until Bruce's death. Eillium became a Merchant Navy officer, eventually captaining a Fisheries <b>Research</b> <b>Ship</b> which, by chance, bore the name Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the crew of a Starfleet starship, the USS Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise {{encounters}} a <b>research</b> <b>ship</b> where all personnel are found dead. The Enterprise crew quickly become infected with the same affliction, one {{that is similar to}} that suffered by the crew of James T. Kirk's USS Enterprise decades before.|$|E
5|$|Blencathra sailed for Spitsbergen, but {{was stopped}} by ice, so she {{returned}} to Tromsø. Here she encountered the <b>research</b> <b>ship</b> Princesse Alice, purpose-built for Prince Albert I of Monaco, a leading oceanographer. Bruce was delighted when the Prince invited him to join Princesse Alice on a hydrographic survey around Spitsbergen. The ship sailed up {{the west coast of}} the main island of the Spitsbergen group, and visited Adventfjorden and Smeerenburg in the north. During the latter stages of the voyage Bruce was placed in charge of the voyage's scientific observations.|$|E

5|$|Only nine quagga {{catshark}} specimens {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled from off the eastern Somalian coast by the <b>research</b> <b>ship</b> RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, two male and two female, were found amongst {{the contents of}} commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a speckled catshark (H. boesemani).|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{ship was}} built by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company as a {{specialist}} research vessel designed for work in Antarctic waters, {{and was one of}} the last three-masted wooden sailing ships built in Britain. The construction cost was £34,050 (2009 = £2.7 million), plus £10,322 (£830,000) for the engines, and the final cost after all modifications was £51,000 (£4.1 m). The name had historic naval associations, most recently as one of the ships used in the Nares expedition, and certain features of this older vessel were incorporated into the design of the new ship. She was launched by Lady Markham on 21 March 1901 as S.Y. Discovery (the Royal <b>Research</b> <b>Ship</b> designation was acquired in the 1920s).|$|E
5|$|The Federation fleet try {{to destroy}} the Kukai base as {{it appears to be}} the source of the Song, but Wilhelm—who has been {{secretly}} observing events—arrives with a private fleet that destroys the Gnosis and protects the base. KOS-MOS then uses an advanced weapon to detect the Song's source in a cloaked spaceship. Boarding the spaceship, the group rescue MOMO and fight Albedo, but are stopped by a blue-cloaked man who allows Albedo to escape with a piece of data extracted from MOMO that could grant access to Miltia. Albedo then summons Proto Merkebah, a <b>research</b> <b>ship</b> created by Mizrahi to summon U-DO, and destroys the Federation fleet before aiming Proto Merkebah's weapons at Second Miltia's capital. The blue-cloaked man—revealed to be a resurrected Virgil—observes events before being summoned away. Shion's group infiltrates Proto Markebah and destroys its core while Albedo flees. Escaping Proto Merkebah as it self-destructs, KOS-MOS shields the damaged Elsa as it enters Second Miltia's atmosphere.|$|E
