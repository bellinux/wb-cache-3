5000|$|The Brother Assassin, {{written by}} Fred Saberhagen in 1969, {{introduced}} the complete concept for a telepresence master-slave humanoid system. In the novel, {{the concept is}} described as follows: [...] "And a moment later it seemed to all his senses {{that he had been}} transported from the master down into the body of the slave-unit standing beneath it on the floor. As the control of its movements passed over to him, the slave started gradually to lean to one side, and he moved its foot to maintain balance as naturally as he moved his own. Tilting back his head, he could look up through the slave's eyes to see the master-unit, with himself inside, maintaining the same attitude on its complex suspension."The term telepresence was coined in a 1980 article by Minsky, who outlined his vision for an adapted version of the older concept of teleoperation that focused on giving a <b>remote</b> <b>participant</b> a feeling of actually being present at a different location. [...] One of the first systems to create a fully immersive illusion of presence in a remote location was the Virtual Fixtures platform developed in 1992 at the U.S. Air Force, Armstrong Labs by inventor Louis Rosenberg. The system included stereoscopic image display from the remote environment as well as immersive touch feedback using a full upper-body exoskeleton.|$|E
5000|$|A speaker {{providing}} a U.S. business perspective stated that his company, {{in common with}} other ICT companies effected by government requests to access and monitor user data, did not accept blanket requests for access. However, they were subject {{to the rule of}} law and treated each individual request from the government on its merits. He also commented that surveillance revelations were a major problem for the Internet industry; if users didn't trust a company's products they would go elsewhere. A comment from a <b>remote</b> <b>participant</b> referred to reports that U.S. cloud companies can expect to lose business from non-U.S. customers to the tune of many billions of dollars, with the overall negative impact on the IT industry even greater because of this loss of trust. A speaker from the Internet technical community echoed these concerns about the loss of trust in Internet products and services. He pointed out that there was an understanding that intelligence activities targeted individuals and groups, but the very large scale of the alleged monitoring shocked and surprised many. This observation about the massive scale of the monitoring was shared by many, and led to questions about the central role of a single country in many aspects of the Internet; from the control of infrastructure and the success and global spread of commercial services, to positions of oversight over critical Internet functions. Concern over these issues was one of the motivations behind the proposed Internet governance summit to be held in Brazil in May 2014. A commenter noted that Brazil intends for the meeting to be a [...] "Summit" [...] in the sense that it will be high level and will have authority enough to make decisions.|$|E

Extending prior work, we also show that local participants exhibited significantly more overlapping speech with <b>remote</b> <b>participants</b> who used an embodied proxy, than with <b>remote</b> <b>participants</b> in basic-video conferencing (and at a rate similar to overlapping speech for co-located groups).

This paper describes a videoconferencing system for participation in hybrid meetings. The system has been developed as a research vehicle to see how technology based on automatic real-time recognition of conversational behavior in meetings can be used to improve engagement and floor control by <b>remote</b> <b>participants.</b> The system uses modules for online speech recognition, real-time visual focus of attention as well as a module that signals who is being addressed by the speaker.

40|$|A {{significance}} of engagement in face-to-face has {{been pointed out}} in computer mediated communication area. In order to create such a coexisting situation, mainly two approaches can be available; visual interaction and tangible interaction. However, each approach is insufficient to create a virtual co-existing space. Therefore we devise a complementary approach to integrate visual interaction and tangible interaction. This is not an approach just to combine two interactions. Our unique point is a physical object, which we can interact with, is concurrently represented as a virtual physical object in a shared virtual space where we can interact by virtual avatar. Based on this concept, we implemented networked &quot;Lazy Susan &quot; communication system. We can rotate the disk with each other, the rotation of which is synchronized with remote disk, then the disk is represented as a virtual physical disk in a shared virtual space where we can interact with <b>remote</b> <b>participant</b> by virtual avatar of our own and the <b>remote</b> <b>participant.</b> Then the preliminary results of communication experiments indicate that our “dual ” interaction design is significant to enhance a sense of “being co-located”. ...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activity}} analysis {{is an essential}} task in ambient intelligence and computer vision. The main focus lies in the automatic analysis of ongoing activities from a multi-camera network. One possible application is meeting analysis which explores the dynamics in meetings using low-level data and inferring high-level activities. However, the detection of such activities is still very challenging due to the often corrupted or imprecise low-level data. In this paper, we present an approach to understand the dynamics in meetings using a multi-camera network, consisting of fixed ambient and portable close-up cameras. As a particular application we are aiming {{to find the most}} informative video stream, for example as a representative view for a <b>remote</b> <b>participant.</b> Our contribution is threefold: at first, we estimate the extrinsic parameters of the portable close-up cameras based on head positions. Secondly, we find common overlapping areas based on the consensus of people’s orientation. And thirdly, the most informative view for a <b>remote</b> <b>participant</b> is estimated using common overlapping areas. We evaluated our proposed approach and compared it to a motion estimation method. Experimental results show that we can reach an accuracy of 74 % compared to manually selected views...|$|E

40|$|A {{lightweight}} collaborative web browsing system, that targets casual (non-technical) web users, is presented. This {{system allows}} <b>remote</b> <b>participants</b> to easily synchronize pointing, scrolling and browsing of uploaded content in their web browsers. Since instant messenging systems {{have become a}} very popular method for <b>remote</b> <b>participants</b> to engage in real-time text chat sessions, it is conjectured that this simple co-browsing system which allows <b>remote</b> <b>participants</b> to share and point at their pictures and web content (instead of just sharing text) could prove useful and fun, too. The collaboratively viewed web content could either pre-exist on a host web server or, in a more typical scenario, be dynamically uploaded by the <b>remote</b> <b>participants</b> themselves. A specific goal of this system {{is to keep the}} interactions extremely simple and safe. Any user should be able to use it intuitively with a single click; there are no pre-installation or pre-registration requirements. This system is based on simple polling-based scripting techniques that avoid intrusive mechanisms based on proxies or events. Most significantly, there is no reliance on any controls, applets, plug-ins or binary executables, since these would require the trust of participants and are virus-prone. It is the reliance upon such inconvenient helper programs, along with any pre-installation or pre-registration requirements, that makes existing co-browsing offerings more "heavyweight", and limits their appeal for casual collaboration.
