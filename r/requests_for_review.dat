50|$|Meyer v.

After suffering severe injuries in an accidental fall, Maurice Eugene Meyer applied for Social Security Disability insurance benefits.

When Meyer requested review of his claim by the Appeals Council, he submitted a letter from his treating physician detailing the injuries and recommending significant restrictions on Meyer’s activity. The Appeals Council made this letter part of the record but summarily denied Meyer’s request for review; thus, the ALJ’s decision denying benefits became the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Continuous {{integration}} is a software engineering practice of frequently merging all developer working copies with a shared main branch, e. g., {{several times a}} day. With the advent of GITHUB, a platform well known for its “social coding ” features that aid collaboration and sharing, and currently the largest code host in the open source world, collab-orative software development {{has never been more}} prominent. In GITHUB development one can distinguish between two types of developer contributions to a project: direct ones, coming from a typically small group of developers with write access to the main project repository, and indirect ones, coming from developers who fork the main repository, update their copies locally, and submit pull <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>review</b> and merger. In this paper we explore how GITHUB developers use contin-uous integration as well as whether the contribution type (direct versus indirect) and different project characteristics (e. g., main programming language, or project age) are associated with the success of the automatic builds.
