40|$|The use of adhesively-bonded joints {{instead of}} the {{traditional}} types of joining can give reduced weight and increased stiffness in a structure. However, most industries have concerns {{about the use of}} adhesive joints in anything other than secondary structures, due to uncertainties over the long-term service life. This thesis discusses the prediction of the lifetime of adhesively-bonded composite structures. A fracture mechanics approach was used to characterise the fracture behaviour of an epoxy film adhesive, Cytec FM- 300 M, mainly using composite substrates prepared using wet peel ply, removing the need for any additional surface treatment. Aluminium alloy substrates were also used for some tests. Tapered double cantilever beam and double cantilever beam specimens were used to determine the mode I critical strain energy release <b>rate,</b> GIC, and <b>end</b> <b>loaded</b> split specimens were tested to obtain the mode II critical strain energy release rate, GIIC. Lastly, fixed ratio mixed mode specimens were used to obtain the relationship between GIC and GIIC when a joint undergoes mixed mode failure. For validation purposes, single lap joint and double scarf joint specimens were also tested. These data were then applied in finite element models using Abaqus. Two different modelling techniques were used, the virtual crack closure technique and cohesive zone modelling, CZM. Simulations of the tests performed were executed, in the process obtaining the CZM fitting parameters. Good agreement with the experimental data was verified for each of the models tested. Fatigue tests were also performed in order to obtain the mode I and mode II threshold values of the fracture energy below which crack growth did not occur, by executing double cantilever beam and <b>end</b> <b>loaded</b> split tests, respectively. For validation purposes, single lap joint fatigue tests were also performed to determine the threshold maximum load the joint could withstand without failure. Finally, using the CZM fitting parameters obtained in the quasi-static tests and the experimentally obtained threshold values of the fracture energy, modelling of single lap and double scarf joints was performed in order to predict the maximum load value for which no failure would occur when subject to cyclic loading. These predictions showed excellent agreement with the experimental results, showing that this simpler model can obtain good results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Three exact {{solutions}} are considered, {{within the context}} of the linear mathematical theory of elasticity, pertaining to the decay of self-equilibrated <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> for a class of geometries based upon polar coordinates. For a curved plane beam, an eigen-equation is derived, whose roots determine the rates of decay and degenerate to the Papkovitch-Fadle solution for the plane strain strip when the beam centre-line radius of curvature approaches infinity; this shows that the decay rates are largely insensitive to the beam curvature except for very small inner radius. For the plane and anti-plane elastic wedge, subjected to self-equilibrated loading on the inner or outer arcs, radial variation of stress is affected by a combination of free-edge stress interference and the convergent or divergent geometry. When the load is applied to the inner arc, the two effects act in concert in which case decay is assured; when the load is applied to the outer arc, the two effects act in opposition, and Saint-Venant’s principle (S. V. P) ceases to be applicable for wedge angles 2 ? > ? for symmetric loading and anti-plane deformation, and 2 ? > 257 º for asymmetric loading. It is concluded that the crack tip stress singularity, which is at the heart of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics, is attributable to the failure of S. V. P. for just one particular eigenmode for the wedge angle 2 ? = 2 ?. A Finite Element-Transfer Matrix Method is developed for determination of decay <b>rates</b> of self-equilibrated <b>end</b> <b>loading</b> for frameworks and continuum prismatic beam of arbitrary cross-section. Nodal displacements and forces on either side of a repeating cell are considered as state variables and are related by a cell transfer matrix. Assuming consecutive state vectors to be related by a constant multiple ? leads directly to an eigenvalue problem; the decay factors, ?, are the eigenvalues of the symplectic transfer matrix. Eigenvalues occurs as reciprocal pairs (that is, if ?i is an eigenvalue then so is 1 / ?i) according to whether decay is from left to right or vice-versa. The multiple eigenvalues ?i = 1 / ?i = 1 are associated with the rigid body eigenvectors and their related principal vectors which describe the force transmission modes. The matrix of eigen-and principal vectors then forms a similarity matrix which transforms the original transfer matrix into Jordan canonical form. Both bi-orthogonality and symplectic adjoint orthogonality properties of the eigenvectors allow modal decomposition of an arbitrary <b>end</b> <b>load.</b> As a by-product of the method, it is possible to determine exact ‘continuum’ beam properties of the framework, which is useful in preliminary design work. The method is applied to the important case of a beam of rectangular cross-section for a wide range of aspect ratios. The Transfer Matrix Method is modified to become the Force or Displacement Transfer Matrix Method, which has the advantage of reducing in size the original transfer matrix by one half, and overcomes numerical ill-conditioning. Accuracies of all the developed methods are found to be very good when compared with available exact solutions...|$|R

External face and interface conditions are used to obtain the characteristic; equation for the eigenvalues governing the decay <b>rate</b> of <b>end</b> effects along the strip. For orthotropic and strongly orthotropic sandwich strips the transcendental eigenvalue equation is explicitly given. The case of laminated strips with periodic layout is finally considered. Making use of the homogenization method, both effective elastic constants and expressions for the local stress variation at the layer level are obtained. Numerical calculations confirm that the eigenvalues of the homogenized material are the asymptotic values of those of periodically laminated strips when the number of layers increases. Moreover, homogenization method is shown to be very powerful also in the calculation of local stress distributions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the spatial behaviour ofthe steady state and transient elastic processes in an anisotropic elastic body subject to nonzero boundary conditions {{only on a}} plane nd.
