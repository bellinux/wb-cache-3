5|$|The {{decision}} not to restart on-alert bomber missions was also a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategic decline of manned nuclear weapon delivery in favor of unmanned delivery via ICBMs, which had already eclipsed the number of bombers in the United States by April 1964.|$|E

5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon and starlight off the water's surface.|$|E
5|$|As sweet {{a little}} nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward. Though merely a small bay, {{about a mile}} in breadth, and curving inland for {{a mile and a}} half, it is quite {{sheltered}} from all winds save the east, being flanked to the south and west by Haskeval and Hondeval, and guarded on the northern side by a low range of heathery slopes. In this sunny time, the sheep are bleating from the shores, the yacht lies double, yacht and shadow, and the bay is painted richly with the clear <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains.|$|E

5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an analogy of {{the invasion of the}} Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5|$|At 1211 North LaSalle Street on the city's Near North Side, a 16-story {{apartment}} hotel {{built in}} 1929 and converted {{into an apartment}} building in 1981 was used by muralist Richard Haas for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to Chicago School architecture. One of the building's sides features the Chicago Board of Trade Building, intended as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual building two miles (3km) south.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the 7th century, the {{quayside}} settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians {{developed}} {{the idea that}} the grammars of all languages were a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics. The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.|$|E
5|$|New Amerykah Part One is an esoteric concept album titled as a pun on Badu's {{first name}} and a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record's {{political}} leanings. It features social commentary and themes related {{to the plight of}} the African-American community, including poverty, urban violence, complacency, and cultural identity. The record's densely produced music incorporates funk, R, hip hop, soul, jazz, and electronica styles.|$|E

On June 15, 1994, Major League Soccer selected Washington, D.C. out of twenty-two applicants to host one of the first seven teams, with three more added before the league's launch. The team's name was chosen as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> names of European clubs, such as Manchester United or Leeds United.|$|E

The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making it Girls Aloud's first album to do so. It also peaked at number nine on the Irish Albums Chart. In 2009, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) recognised The Sound of Girls Aloud {{as one of}} the nine albums that year to sell at least 1 million units in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of}} the tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
5|$|Transits of Venus {{are among}} the rarest of {{predictable}} astronomical phenomena. They occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years. The periodicity is a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that the orbital periods of Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities.|$|E

5|$|Unanimity was {{required}} for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members. This requirement was a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, {{the consent of the}} parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.|$|E
5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.|$|E
