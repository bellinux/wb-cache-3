5|$|In biology, {{coevolution}} {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} species <b>reciprocally</b> affect each other's evolution.|$|E
5|$|Co{{evolution}} is {{the evolution}} {{of two or more}} species which <b>reciprocally</b> affect each other, sometimes creating a mutualistic relationship between the species. Such relationships can be of many different types.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{literature}} of antiquity and {{the form of the}} ancient book <b>reciprocally</b> conditioned each other. The context of publication enveloped and modified literary creativity. The dividends of these investigations will thereby far exceed the satisfaction of merely antiquarian pleasures.|$|E
5|$|In normal untransformed cells, EFS {{acts as a}} SRC family kinase {{substrate}} in neurite outgrowth, {{a process}} that is dependent on activity of SRC kinases. <b>Reciprocally,</b> EFS activates SRC signaling through c-CRK and RAP1. Further, SRC directly phosphorylates residues Y576 and Y577 tyrosine sites on the EFS, enhancing targeting FAK, and eventually the solubility and/or stability of the complex. Through SRC, EFS may also negatively regulate expression of E-cadherin at adherens junctions, a function that has been reported for other CAS proteins (NEDD9 and BCAR1); however, this point has not been directly established for EFS.|$|E
5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations {{may have contributed}} to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although <b>reciprocally</b> state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and <b>reciprocally</b> connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or <b>reciprocally</b> beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include <b>reciprocally</b> beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. <b>Reciprocally,</b> the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{amendment}} to the Tripartite Pact was not yet in force, Hitler chose to declare war on the United States and ordered the Reichstag, along with Italy, to do so on 11 December 1941, {{three days after the}} United States' declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. His hopes that, despite the previous rejections, Japan would <b>reciprocally</b> attack the Soviet Union, were not realized, as Japan stuck to its Nanshin strategy of going south, not north, and would continue to maintain an uneasy peace with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, Germany's declaration of war further solidified German–Japanese relations and showed Germany's solidarity with Japan, which was now encouraged to cooperate against the British. To some degree, Japan's actions in South-East Asia and the Pacific in the months after Pearl Harbor, including the sinking of the HMS Prince of Wales and the HMS Repulse, the occupation of the Crown Colonies of Singapore, Hong Kong, and British Burma, and the air raids on Australia, were a tremendous blow to the United Kingdom's war effort and preoccupied the Allies, shifting British (including Australian) and American assets away from the Battle of the Atlantic and the North African Campaign against Germany to Asia and the Pacific against Japan. In this context, sizeable forces of the British Empire were withdrawn from North Africa to the Pacific theatre with their replacements being only relatively inexperienced and thinly spread divisions. Taking advantage of this situation, Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps successfully attacked only six weeks after Pearl Harbor, eventually pushing the allied lines as far east as El Alamein.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that <b>reciprocally</b> link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

25|$|Japanese Buddhism {{incorporated}} numerous Shintō deities in its pantheon and <b>reciprocally.</b> Japanese Shingon {{also has}} other categories, {{such as the}} Thirteen Buddhas. Zen Buddhism however clearly rejected the strong polytheistic conceptions of orthodox Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|In toxicology, Harley made {{researches}} {{into the}} action of strychnine, and on Calabar bean; and in 1864 read a paper to the British Association poisoned arrows. He demonstrated that strychnia and wourali have the property of <b>reciprocally</b> neutralising the toxic effects of one another.|$|E
25|$|The undersigned, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs, and the Ambassador Extraordinary of His Majesty the King of the French, at the Court of London, being {{furnished}} {{with the necessary}} powers, hereby declare, in consequence, that their said Majesties take <b>reciprocally</b> that engagement.|$|E
25|$|During {{discharging}} {{the internal}} {{construction of the}} capacitor reverses the internal polarity. The cathode (-) gets an anode (+), and changes the current flow direction. Two voltages arise over these electrode. In principle the voltage distribution over both electrodes behaves as the <b>reciprocally</b> CV product of each electrode.|$|E
25|$|A year later, on 17 October 1921, {{the unknown}} warrior {{was given the}} United States' highest award for valour, the Medal of Honor, from the hand of General John Pershing; it hangs on a pillar close to the tomb. On 11 November 1921, the American Unknown Soldier was <b>reciprocally</b> awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
25|$|The first {{imprinted}} genetic disorders to {{be described}} in humans were the <b>reciprocally</b> inherited Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Both syndromes are associated with loss of the chromosomal region 15q11-13 (band 11 of the long arm of chromosome 15). This region contains the paternally expressed genes SNRPN and NDN and the maternally expressed gene UBE3A.|$|E
25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are <b>reciprocally</b> limitative. As reason has apprehended these two {{simultaneous}} phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and <b>reciprocally</b> finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} insula connects <b>reciprocally</b> {{with the}} secondary somatosensory cortex and receives input from spinothalamically activated ventral posterior inferior thalamic nuclei. It {{has also been}} shown that this region receives inputs from the ventromedial nucleus (posterior part) of the thalamus that are highly specialized to convey homeostatic information such as pain, temperature, itch, local oxygen status, and sensual touch.|$|E
25|$|Using a PET scan, {{researchers}} found that activity in the left medial and lateral prefrontal cortex was <b>reciprocally</b> associated with decrease activity in the amygdala. These findings imply that the prefrontal cortex modulates the amygdala activity. The left prefronatal cortex {{plays a role in}} approach behaviors (positively valenced emotions), while the amygdala plays a role in withdrawal behaviors (negatively valenced emotions).|$|E
25|$|The allies {{guarantee}} to {{each other}} <b>reciprocally</b> the faithful fulfilment of the agreements, arrangements, and Treaties {{that are to be}} celebrated with the government that shall be established in Paraguay, in virtue of what is agreed upon by the present Treaty of Alliance, which shall always remain in its full force and vigour to the effect that these stipulations be respected and executed by the Republic of Paraguay.|$|E
25|$|In the 1770s, the British East India Company {{instructed}} Francis Light to form {{trade relations}} in the Malay Peninsula. Light subsequently landed in Kedah, a Siamese vassal state threatened by both Siam and Burma, {{as well as an}} internal Bugis revolt. Aware of this situation, Light formed friendly relations with the then Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah, and promised British military protection, while the Sultan <b>reciprocally</b> offered Penang Island, then part of Kedah.|$|E
25|$|This {{engagement}} {{is situated}} {{in a kind of}} middle ground of relationality, a space that is neither purely objective, because it is <b>reciprocally</b> constituted by a diversity of lived experiences motivating the movements of countless organisms, nor purely subjective, because it is nonetheless a field of material relationships between bodies. It is governed exclusively neither by causality, nor by intentionality. In this space of in-betweenness phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{predicts that}} cotton-top tamarins engage with this young-rearing paradigm, {{and in turn}} naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior. These monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups in caring for infants, vocalizing alarm calls, and in sharing food. Though some studies indicate that cotton-top tamarins have the psychological capacity to participate in <b>reciprocally</b> mediated altruism, {{it is unclear whether}} the cotton-top tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.|$|E
25|$|Gevurah is {{necessary}} for Creation to exist as it counterposes Chesed ("loving-kindness"), restricting the unlimited divine bounty within suitable vessels, so forming the Worlds. However, if man sins (actualising impure judgement within his soul), the supernal Judgement is <b>reciprocally</b> empowered over the Kindness, introducing disharmony among the Sephirot in the divine realm and exile from God throughout Creation. The demonic realm, though illusory in its holy origin, becomes the real apparent realm of impurity in lower Creation.|$|E
25|$|Bestiality {{is seen by}} the {{government}} of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK Home Office review on sexual offences in 2002). Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be <b>reciprocally</b> pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.|$|E
25|$|Places or {{backgrounds}} hence require, and <b>reciprocally</b> impose, order (often {{deriving from}} the spatial {{characteristics of the}} physical location memorized, in cases where an actual physical structure {{provided the basis for}} the 'places'). This order itself organizes the images, preventing confusion during recall. The anonymous author also advises that places should be well lit, with orderly intervals, and distinct from one another. He recommends a virtual 'viewing distance' sufficient to allow the viewer to encompass the space and the images it contains with a single glance.|$|E
25|$|When {{the parties}} have <b>reciprocally</b> {{declared}} their concordant intent, either expressly or impliedly, a contract shall be constituted. If the parties agree on all the essential elements of the contract but have expressed no intent as to the non-essential elements, the contract shall be presumed to be constituted. In {{the absence of an}} agreement on the above-mentioned non-essential elements, the court shall decide them according {{to the nature of the}} affair. When one of the parties to a contract receives earnest money from the other, the contract is presumed to be constituted.|$|E
25|$|Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the King of the French, {{taking into}} {{consideration}} the existence in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) of a government capable of providing for the regularity of its relations with foreign nations, have thought it right to engage, <b>reciprocally,</b> to consider the Sandwich Islands as an Independent State, and never to take possession, neither directly or under the title of Protectorate, or under any other form, of {{any part of the}} territory of which they are composed.|$|E
25|$|Modern mail is {{organized}} by national and privatized services, which are <b>reciprocally</b> interconnected by international regulations, organizations and international agreements. Paper letters and parcels {{can be sent}} to almost any country in the world relatively easily and cheaply. The Internet has made the process of sending letter-like messages nearly instantaneous, and in many cases and situations correspondents use electronic mail where previously they would have used letters. The volume of paper mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service has declined by more than 15% since its peak at 213 billion pieces per annum in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Soft (also {{known as}} softsubs or closed subtitles) are {{separate}} instructions, usually a specially marked up text with time stamps to be displayed during playback. It requires player support and, moreover, {{there are multiple}} incompatible (but usually <b>reciprocally</b> convertible) subtitle file formats. Softsubs are relatively easy to create and change, and thus are frequently used for fansubs. Text rendering quality can {{vary depending on the}} player, but is generally higher than prerendered subtitles. Also, some formats introduce text encoding troubles for the end-user, especially if different languages are used simultaneously (for example, Latin and Asian scripts).|$|E
25|$|The Enigma machine worked <b>reciprocally</b> so that an {{identical}} machine with identical settings would, if fed the enciphered letters, show the deciphered {{letters on the}} lampboard. Hut 6 had Enigma replica machines that were logically identical to the machines that the Germans were using. To decipher the intercepted messages required that the selection of rotors, the ring settings and the plugboard connections were known. At this time, the first three letters of the prelude to the message were used as an indicator to tell the receiving operator the letters that should appear in the windows for this particular message.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and it is precisely the unity that here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment <b>reciprocally</b> determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E
25|$|Greece {{returned}} {{the island to}} Turkey in 1922. The inhabitants, substantially Greek Orthodox, were exempt from compulsory expulsion per the Lausanne Treaty's article 14, paragraph 2. Despite the treaty, the state of international relations between Greece and Turkey, wider world issues, and domestic pressures influenced how the Greek minority of Tenedos was treated. Acting <b>reciprocally</b> with Greece, Turkey made systematic attempts to evacuate the Greeks on the isle. Turkey never implemented either the Article 14 guarantee of some independence for the place in local rules, or the Article 39 guarantee to Turkish citizens, of all ethnicities, of {{the freedom to choose}} the language they wanted to use in their daily lives.|$|E
