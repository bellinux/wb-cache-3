A {{feature of the}} price clustering in Swiss National Bank (SNB) transactions is market dependency. Evidence of clustering in the broker market is considerably smaller than in the dealer market. The empirical analysis for Swiss interventions uses a disaggregate approach {{to test the hypothesis}} whether intervention strategy matters. The most important determinants of price clustering are bank size and transaction volume. While the regression evidence for customer transactions is consistent with the effciency hypothesis, the clustering results for intervention trades are not influenced by the SNB’s intervention tactics. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> multifunctions plays {{a crucial}} role in modern variational {{analysis}} and optimization. This property is a key to study the stability of solutions of generalized equations. Many practical problems lead to generalized equations associated to the sum of multifunctions. This paper is devoted to study the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of multifunctions. As the sum of closed multifunctions is not necessarily closed, almost all known results in the literature on the metric regularity for one multifunction (which is assumed usually to be closed) fail to imply <b>regularity</b> properties <b>of</b> the sum of multifunctions. To avoid this difficulty, we use an approach based on the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> so-called epigraphical multifunctions and the theory of error bounds to study the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of two multifunctions, as well as some related important properties of variational systems. Firstly, we establish the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of a regular multifunction and a pseudo-Lipschitz multifunction with a suitable Lipschitz modulus. These results subsume some recent results by Durea and Strugariu. Secondly, we derive coderivative characterizations <b>of</b> the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> epigraphical multifunctions associated with the sum of multifunctions.
