40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis "Contract of sale under {{business}} law" is to compare changes of the contract of sale, which occurred {{as a result of}} the newly adopted Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., Civil Code. The aim of this thesis is to simultaneously take into account the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a Common European Sales Law (Common European Sales Law, CESL). The thesis also focuses on selected provisions of the purchase - especially <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> <b>acquisition</b> of ownership from unauthorized (and the related principle of good faith) under the new Civil Code. <b>Rules</b> <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> <b>acquisition</b> of ownership were significantly changed. Thesis attepmts to specify rules which are applied in the case one of the contracting parties is in the possition of a consumer. Specific features of contracting process must be taken in consideration due to the protection of consumers and or small and medium- sized enterprises. The thesis is focused on selected aspects of the contract of sale, thus the purchase of property, asset deal or liability for defects are mentioned only in passing.

40|$|Forward {{blocking}} {{is one of}} the best-documented {{phenomena in}} Pavlovian animal conditioning. According to contemporary associative learning theories, forward blocking arises directly from the hardwired basic learning <b>rules</b> that <b>govern</b> <b>the</b> <b>acquisition</b> or expression of associations. Contrary to this view, here the authors demonstrate that blocking in rats is flexible and sensitive to constraints of causal inference, such as violation of additivity and ceiling considerations. This suggests that complex cognitive processes akin to causal inferential reasoning are involved in a well-established Pavlovian animal conditioning phenomenon commonly attributed to the operation of basic associative processes. status: publishe...|$|R

These {{regulations}} revise <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> <b>acquisition,</b> use, {{and retention}} of quota share established for captains and crew, known as crew quota share or C shares, under the Crab Rationalization Program (CR Program). Regulations implementing Amendment 31 temporarily expand the eligibility requirements for individuals wishing to acquire C share Quota Share (QS) by transfer; establish minimum participation requirements for C share QS holders to be eligible to receive an annual allocation of Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ); establish minimum participation requirements for C share QS holders to be eligible to retain their C share QS and an administrative process for revocation of an individual’s C share QS {{if he or she}} fails to satisfy the minimum participation requirements; establish a regulatory mechanism to ensure that three percent of the total allowable catch (TAC) for each CR Program crab fishery is allocated as IFQ to holders of C share QS; and remove the prohibition on leasing C share IFQ. In addition, this final rule implements a regulatory amendment to the CR Program that: Establishes an earlier deadline for filing annual IFQ, individual processing quota (IPQ), and crab harvesting cooperative IFQ applications, which increases the amount of time during which NMFS will suspend the processing of IFQ and IPQ transfer applications; shortens the amount of time in which to appeal an initial administrative determination to withhold issuance of IFQ or IPQ; and provides that an applicant’s proof of timely filing for IFQ, IPQ, or cooperative IFQ creates a presumption of timely filing. Finally, this final rule revises the reporting period and due date for CR Program registered crab receiver (RCR...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{political}} economy of mining laws and regulation in Namibia from 1884 to 1986. Mining laws and regulations have {{played an important role in}} the exploitation of Namibia's mineral resources since the colonial period. They have also played an important role in the exploitations by foreign mining companies of Namibia's mineral resources. The study shows how this process has evolved. Chapter I discusses the link between colonialism and exploitation. It also shows the special interest of the colonial administration in mineral development. The formal and substantive <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> <b>acquisition</b> of mineral rights are discussed in detail in Chapter II. An important element in the exploitation of Namibia's mineral resources is the international market. Chapter III examines the marketing of Namibia's minerals. It shows that the colonial administration is unable and unwilling to exercise control in this area. Special attention is paid to the marketing of diamonds as it illustrates very well the dominant position of the mining companies. Marketing of minerals is closely linked with taxation. This is examined in Chapter IV. The chapter reveals that the inadequacies of the legislation enables mining companies to achieve their objective, maximisation of profits without corresponding benefits to Namibia. The exploitation of Namibia's mineral resources has a direct effect on the environment. Chapter V shows that the spread of multinational mining companies and their operations have a direct effect on the environment, health and safety of mine employees and the community in surrounding areas. It also shows that mining laws and regulations are inadequate to cope with this problem. South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia since the termination of the mandate in 1966 has important legal consequences. The legal status of the mining concessions granted by South Africa before and after the termination of the mandate are examined in Chapter VI in the light of the United Nations action in this respect. In order to clarify the options for independent Namibia, Chapter VII discusses the experience of other developing countries in mineral development and their relationship with multinational companies. In Chapter VII, we recommend that mining laws and regulations of an independent Namibia should reflect the needs of the Namibian population...|$|R
