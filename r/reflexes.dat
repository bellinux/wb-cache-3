50|$|Another {{significant}} difference between Hoffmann's <b>reflex</b> and the Babinski sign are their mechanism of <b>reflex.</b> Hoffman's <b>reflex</b> is a deep tendon <b>reflex</b> (spindle fibre) with a monosynaptic <b>reflex</b> pathway in Rexed lamina IX of the spinal cord. On the other hand, the plantar <b>reflex</b> is not a deep tendon <b>reflex,</b> and its pathway is both more complicated and not fully understood.|$|R
50|$|The {{acoustic}} <b>reflex</b> (also {{known as}} the stapedius <b>reflex,</b> middle-ear-muscles (MEM) <b>reflex,</b> attenuation <b>reflex,</b> or auditory <b>reflex)</b> is an involuntary muscle contraction that occurs in the middle ear in response to high-intensity sound stimuli or when the person starts to vocalize.|$|R
5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block the ball with either their hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage. Sports {{involving}} quick reactions may be helpful, as these help the goalkeeper's <b>reflexes</b> which is a crucial skill.|$|E
5|$|The game's story {{revolves}} around a supernatural phenomenon, which F.E.A.R.—a fictional special forces team—is called to contain.

5|$|To aid with {{navigation}} and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These {{provide information on}} the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink <b>reflexes</b> to protect the eyes from damage.|$|E
5000|$|The righting <b>reflex</b> {{is another}} type of <b>reflex.</b> This <b>reflex</b> {{positions}} the head or body back into its [...] "normal" [...] position, {{in response to a}} change in head or body position. A common example of this <b>reflex</b> is the cat righting <b>reflex,</b> which allows them to orient themselves in order to land on their feet. This <b>reflex</b> is initiated by sensory information from the vestibular, visual, and the somatosensory systems and is therefore not only a vestibulospinal <b>reflex.</b>|$|R

5|$|Where <b>reflexes</b> of the Old Irish fortis sonorants {{appear in}} syllable-final {{position}} (in some cases, only in word-final position), they trigger a lengthening or diphthongization {{of the preceding}} vowel in most dialects of Irish. The details vary from dialect to dialect.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot <b>reflexes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep <b>reflexes,</b> paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E

50|$|A two-component <b>reflex</b> is {{triggered}} when a weak or moderate stimulus {{is applied}} to the siphon or the mantle shelf. These two components consist of two <b>reflex</b> acts, the siphon-withdrawal <b>reflex</b> and the gill-withdrawal <b>reflex.</b> Together they form a <b>reflex</b> pattern with short latency which protects the animals gill and siphon to potentially threatening stimuli.|$|R
5000|$|The bulbocavernosus <b>reflex</b> (BCR), bulbospongiosus <b>reflex</b> (BSR) or [...] "Osinski reflex" [...] is a polysynaptic <b>reflex</b> that {{is useful}} in testing for spinal shock and gaining {{information}} {{about the state of}} spinal cord injuries (SCI). [...] Bulbocavernosus is an older term for bulbospongiosus, thus this <b>reflex</b> may also be referred to as the bulbospongiosus <b>reflex.</b>|$|R
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon <b>reflexes</b> may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1957, a B-52 {{returning}} to Loring Air Force Base from a routine instrument training mission broke apart in midair and crashed near Morrell, New Brunswick, Canada, killing {{eight of the}} nine crew on board. Co-pilot Captain Joseph L. Church parachuted to safety. The crash was {{believed to have been}} caused by overstressing the wings and/or airframe during an exercise designed to test the pilot's <b>reflexes.</b> This was the fourth crash involving a B-52 in 11 months.|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of <b>reflexes</b> in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
50|$|For normal pupillary light <b>reflex,</b> both pupils constrict {{simultaneously}} when {{light is}} shone into either eye. For example, if light is shone into left eye only, left pupil constriction {{is a direct}} pupillary light <b>reflex,</b> and simultaneous right pupil constriction is a consensual pupillary light <b>reflex.</b> Therefore, light shone into one eye causes ipsilateral direct pupillary light <b>reflex</b> and contralateral consensual pupillary light <b>reflex.</b> On testing light <b>reflex</b> for each eye, several patterns are possible.|$|R
50|$|In medicine, Hoffmann's <b>reflex,</b> {{named after}} Johann Hoffmann, is a finding {{elicited}} by a <b>reflex</b> test which verifies {{the presence or}} absence of problems in the corticospinal tract. It is also known as the finger flexor <b>reflex.</b> The Hoffman <b>reflex</b> has also been used as a measure of spinal <b>reflex</b> processing (adaptation) in response to exercise training.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>reflex,</b> or <b>reflex</b> action, is an {{involuntary}} and nearly instantaneous movement {{in response to}} a stimulus. [...] A <b>reflex</b> is made possible by neural pathways called <b>reflex</b> arcs which can act on an impulse before that impulse reaches the brain. The <b>reflex</b> is then an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought.|$|R

At school, he finds that his body can produce webs, and his quickened <b>reflexes</b> let him avoid injury during a {{confrontation}} with Flash Thompson. Peter discovers he has developed superhuman speed, strength, the ability to stick to surfaces, and a heightened ability to sense danger.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective <b>reflexes</b> such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
5|$|When {{brain death}} is suspected, {{reversible}} differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression {{need to be}} excluded. Testing for <b>reflexes</b> can be of help in the decision, as can the absence of response and breathing. Clinical observations, including a total lack of responsiveness, a known diagnosis, and neural imaging evidence, may all {{play a role in}} the decision to pronounce brain death.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A normal {{spinal cord}} <b>reflex</b> arc, whereas the axon <b>reflex</b> would bypass the interneuron. This {{distinction}} {{is important because}} early researchers had to differentiate between the spinal cord <b>reflex</b> and the axon <b>reflex</b> to understand the body's response to stimuli.|$|R
50|$|The Golgi tendon <b>reflex</b> is {{a normal}} {{component}} of the <b>reflex</b> arc of the peripheral nervous system. In a Golgi tendon <b>reflex,</b> skeletal muscle contraction causes the antagonist muscle to simultaneously lengthen and relax. This <b>reflex</b> is also called the inverse myotatic <b>reflex,</b> {{because it is the}} inverse of the stretch <b>reflex.</b> Though muscle tension is increasing during the contraction, alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord supplying the muscle are inhibited. However, antagonistic muscles are activated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Reflex</b> blink {{occurs in}} {{response}} to an external stimulus, such as contact with the cornea or objects that appear rapidly in front of the eye. A <b>reflex</b> blink is not necessarily a conscious blink either; however it does happen faster than a spontaneous blink. <b>Reflex</b> blink may occur {{in response to}} tactile stimuli (e.g. corneal, eyelash, skin of eyelid, contact with eyebrow), optical stimuli (e.g. dazzle <b>reflex,</b> or menace <b>reflex)</b> or auditory stimuli (e.g., menace <b>reflex)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to <b>reflexes</b> that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of <b>reflexes,</b> and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted. In some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome of brainstem death. Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick <b>reflexes,</b> sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

40|$|Presentation of a weak {{stimulus}}, a prepulse, {{before a}} reflexevoking stimulus decreases the amplitude of the <b>reflex</b> response relative to <b>reflex</b> amplitude evoked without a preceding prepulse. For example, presenting a brief tone before a trigeminal blink-eliciting stimulus significantly reduces <b>reflex</b> blink amplitude. A common explanation of such data are that sensory processing of the prepulse modifies <b>reflex</b> circuit behavior. The current study investigates the converse {{hypothesis that the}} intrinsic characteristics of the <b>reflex</b> circuit rather than prepulse processing determine prepulse modification of trigeminal and acoustic <b>reflex</b> blinks. Unilateral lesions of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons created rats with hyperexcitable trigeminal <b>reflex</b> blinks but normally excitable acoustic <b>reflex</b> blinks. In control rats, presentation of a prepulse reduced the amplitude of both trigemina...|$|R
