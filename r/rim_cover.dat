30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to confirm objectively by an {{instrumental}} measurement if there is less eye fatigue in VDT work when using a wood <b>rim</b> <b>covered</b> display than when using a plastic housing display. The subjects were 26 graduate and undergraduate university students. Each subject did the same 60 -min VDT activity with both a plastic housing and wood-covered display. Before and after VDT activity, each subject’s near-point accommodation distance was measured by a near-point ruler. As a result, it was confirmed that variation rate of the near-point accommodation distance by the VDT work with the wood-covered display was smaller than with the plastic housing display. From sensory tests, progression of subjective symptoms such as eye pain and headache was less with the wood-covered display than with the plastic housing display.|$|R

40|$|Wheels {{are one of}} {{the major}} noise sources of landing gears. Accurate {{numerical}} predictions of wheel noise can provide an insight into the physical mechanism of landing gear noise generation and can aid in the design of noise control devices. The major noise sources of a 33 % scaled isolated landing gear wheel are investigated by simulating three different wheel configurations using high-order numerical simulations to compute the flow field and the FW-H equation to obtain the far-field acoustic pressures. The baseline configuration is a wheel with a hub cavity and two rim cavities. Two additional simulations are performed; one with the hub cavity covered (NHC) and the other with both the hub cavity and <b>rim</b> cavities <b>covered</b> (NHCRC). These simulations isolate the effects of the hub cavity and rim cavities on the overall wheel noise. The surface flow patterns are visualised by shear stress lines and show that the flow separations and attachments {{on the side of the}} wheel, in both the baseline and the configuration with only the hub cavity covered, are significantly reduced by covering both the hub and rim cavities. A frequency-domain FW-H equation is used to identify the noise source regions on the surface of the wheel. The tyre is the main low frequency noise source and shows a lift dipole and side force dipole pattern depending on the frequency. The hub cavity is identified as the dominant middle frequency noise source and radiates in a frequency range centered around the first and second depth modes of the cylindrical hub cavity. The rim cavities are the main high-frequency noise sources. With the hub cavity and <b>rim</b> cavities <b>covered,</b> the largest reduction in Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) is achieved in the hub side direction. In the other directivities, there is also a reduction in the radiated sound...|$|R

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{membrane}} interactions were studied in three exocrine systems (the acinar {{cells of the}} rat parotid, rat lacrimal gland, and guinea pig pancreas) by freeze-fracture and thin-section electron microscopy: exocytosis, induced in vivo by specific pharmacological stimulations; the mutual apposition of secretory granule membranes in the intact cell; membrane appositions induced in vitro by centrifugation ofthe isolated granules. In all three glandular cells, the distribution of intramembrane particles (IMP) on the fracture faces of the lumenal plasmalemma appeared random before stimulation. However, after injection of secretagogues, IMP were rapidly cleared from the areas of granule-plasmalemma apposition in the parotid cells and, especially, in lacrimocytes. In the latter, the cleared areas appeared as large bulges toward the lumen, whereas in the parotid they were less pronounced. Exocytotic openings were usually large and the fracture faces of their <b>rims</b> were <b>covered</b> with IMP. In contrast, in stimulated pancreatic acinar cells, the IMP distribution remained apparently random after stimulation...|$|R

30|$|A barred-olivine (BO) {{chondrule}} {{usually has}} an olivine <b>rim</b> that <b>covers</b> the chondrule surface. Numerous experiments {{have been carried}} out to reproduce the BO texture. However, the rim structure could be reproduced only in a few studies reported in the literature. The difficulty in reproducing the rim structure {{lies in the fact that}} its formation condition has not been constrained experimentally or theoretically. In the present paper, we have carried out numerical simulations of crystal growth of a highly-supercooled melt droplet of pure forsteritic composition (Mg 2 SiO 4), and succeeded in reproducing the double structure, i.e. the rim and the dendrite. The droplet cools from the surface, the temperature of which should be cooler than the center of the droplet. Since a crystal grows faster along the cooler surface than across the hotter center, the rim was found to be formed when the temperature difference between the center of the droplet and its surface is large enough. From our results, both from numerical simulations and analytical consideration, we found that the double structure of rim and the dendrite could be formed only when the cooling rate is within a narrow range, which depends upon the degree of supercooling. Our results, for the first time, could explain why the formation of rim of BO texture was hardly reproduced in the previous experiments reported in the literature to date.|$|R

40|$|Wheel and {{underbody}} aerodynamics {{become increasingly}} important as the demand on road vehicles increases. With limitations in allowable CO 2 emissions, reducing fuel consumption on passenger cars is essential {{in order to stay}} competitive. One important feature of wheel aerodynamics is the rim design which has been investigated in detail in this study. In order to explore wheel aerodynamics, a module-based prototype rim system was designed and implemented on full scale passenger cars. The module based system consists of a slimmed down basic aluminum rim with add-on modules manufactured by SLS rapid prototyping. Stationary rim shields similar to what are used in Grand Prix racing was also studied in the research. Comprehensive investigations were performed in the Volvo Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel on a Volvo V 70 and S 80 respectively. Global force measurements were performed on all configurations along with base pressure measurements. A probe rake with two Omniprobes was used for local flow field investigations around the front right wheel. Results show that rim parameters such as location and size of rim openings have large influence on the aerodynamic performance of passenger cars. Good indications of important areas of the <b>rim</b> to <b>cover</b> for low drag were achieved. Stationary rim shields showed good potential in further reducing drag for passenger cars. Opening positions and shield gaps towards the rotating rims were found to have noticeable influence on aerodynamics. The local flow field investigation showed that the front wheel wake structures were significantly affected by different rim designs. A qualitative agreement between reduced ground wake and lower overall aerodynamic drag was observed. Additional possible mechanisms for aerodynamic drag reduction due to rim design and stationary rim shields are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Barred-olivine (BO) chondrules are {{characterized}} by parallel set(s) of olivine bars in a thin section (Weisberg, 1987). It has been considered that olivine bar crystals are actually platy in three-dimensions (Tsuchiyama et al., 2000; Noguchi, 2002). A BO chondrule usually has an olivine <b>rim</b> that <b>covers</b> the chondrule surface. This olivine rim has the same crystallographic orientation as inner olivine platelets. The olivine rim has not been reproduced in early dynamic crystallization experiments except in {{a limited number of}} runs (Lofgren and Lanier, 1990; Radomsky and Hewins, 1990). Tsukamoto et al. (1999, 2001) succeeded in reproducing the rim structure from a forsterite melt droplet in a container-less crystallization experiment using an aero-acoustic levitation technique. They found from their in-situ observation that the droplet cooled very rapidly at a rate of Rcool ≈ 100 − 1000 K s− 1, and then crystallized at a large supercooling of Δ T ≈ 600 K within {{a very short period of}} time (less than 1 s). However, they reproduced the rim structure only in a few cases, so the formation condition was not constrained from their experiments. On the other hand, Tsuchiyama et al. (2004) also succeeded in reproducing the rim structure by evaporation in vacuum. The cooling rate was Rcool = 1000 K hr− 1, which is much slower than that of the container-less experiments by about three orders of magnitude. They did not observe the solidification process of the sample in-situ, so detailed information such as the timing of nucleation, the solidification timescale, and crystal growth pattern were not available. They considered that the rim was formed by the rapid crystal growth along the droplet surface, which should become cooler than the interior because of the latent heat of evaporation. However, their hypothesis has not been verified yet.|$|R
40|$|Idiomorphic {{crystals}} (up to 3. 5 mm) of ferroan platinum, cooperite and mertieite-II {{were found}} in a heavy-mineral concentrate from stream sediments of the Darya river in the Aldan Shield, Russia. Pt-Fe crystals display cubic and thin platy habits; occasionally they are twinned. The chemical composition ranges from Pt 2. 64 Fe 1. 00 to Pt 2. 88 Fe 1. 00 with Os, Ru, Ir, Rh and Pd below the analytical detection limit of the electron microprobe. X-ray diffractometry of Pt-Fe crystals suggests a F-centred cubic lattice, characteristic of ferroan platinum. Some of the ferroan platinum crystals have large (about 100 mm wide) cooperite overgrowth <b>rims</b> or are <b>covered</b> by a Au-Ag alloy. Cooperite also occurs as large euhedral crystals (up to 3 mm across, partly twinned).
