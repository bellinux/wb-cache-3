In total of 313 dairy cows information were collected from 33 Artificial Insemination Sub-centres or Points under the District AI centre, Rajshahi at greater Rajshahi district over a period from 1993 to 2002. The reproductive parameters were such as age at puberty, age at first service, age at first calving, gestation length, post-partum heat period, days open, wastage day, service per conception and caving intervals. The information of the reproductive parameters were analysed from questionnaires answered by 33 FA (AI) and dairy cows owner?s in respective AI Sub-centre or Points as well as from reading the AI and 100 % progeny collection registers. In general, the mean age at puberty, age at first service, age at first calving, gestation length, post-partum heat period, days open, wastage day, service per conception and caving intervals were 27. 9 month, 29. 2 month, 38. 7 months, 278. 7 days, 20. 7 kg, 139 days, 160 days, 20. 3 days, 1. 62 and 438 days, respectively.

40|$|International audienceA major {{interest}} has recently emerged in understanding how telomere shortening, mechanism triggering cell senescence, {{is linked to}} organism ageing and life history traits in wild species. However, the links between telomere length and key history traits such as <b>reproductive</b> <b>performances</b> have received little attention and remain unclear to date. The leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea is a long-lived species showing rapid growth at early stages of life, {{one of the highest}} reproductive outputs observed in vertebrates and a dichotomised reproductive pattern related to migrations lasting 2 or 3 years, supposedly associated with different environmental conditions. Here we tested the prediction of blood telomere shortening with age in this species and investigated the relationship between blood telomere length and <b>reproductive</b> <b>performances</b> in leatherback turtles nesting in French Guiana. We found that blood telomere length did not differ between hatchlings and adults. The absence of blood telomere shortening with age may be related to an early high telomerase activity. This telomere-restoring enzyme was formerly suggested to be involved in preventing early telomere attrition in early fastgrowing and long-lived species, including squamate reptiles. We found that within one nesting cycle, adult females having performed shorter migrations prior to the considered nesting season had shorter blood telomeres and lower reproductive output. We propose that shorter blood telomeres may result from higher oxidative stress in individuals breeding more frequently (i. e., higher costs of reproduction) and/or restoring more quickly their body reserves in cooler feeding areas during preceding migration (i. e., higher foraging costs). This first study on telomeres in the giant leatherback turtle suggests that blood telomere length predicts not only survival chances, but also <b>reproductive</b> <b>performances.</b> Telomeres may therefore be a promising new tool to evaluate individual reproductive quality which could be useful in such species of conservation concern...|$|R

The trial was carried out on 124 lactating buffaloes (69 ± 84 days in milk) equally divided in two experimental groups (group 1 and group 2) with different space availability (15 vs 20 m 2 / head). Daily milk production was recorded in each group and a sample of milk was monthly analysed for fat and protein contents. Furthermore, fertility and intercalving and start trial-conception (number of days {{from the beginning of}} the trial until conception) intervals were also evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with repeated measures for productive parameters and by Student’s t Test for intercalving and start trial-conception intervals. Buffaloes in Group 2 showed higher (P< 0. 05) milk production in both the initial (74 to 104 days in milk) and final (around 230 days in milk) phases of the lactation curve compared to animals in Group 1. No differences emerged for qualitative characteristics of milk and reproductive parameters.
