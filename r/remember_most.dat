5|$|I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> of {{the video}} you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five {{different}} cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
25|$|A {{permalink}} {{or permanent}} link is a URL that {{is intended to}} remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding a hyperlink that is less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, {{so as to be}} easy for people to type and <b>remember.</b> <b>Most</b> modern blogging and content-syndication software systems support such links. Sometimes URL shortening is used to create them.|$|E
500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went in like a rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{colony of}} Upper Senegal and Niger is perhaps <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> often by philatelists, since it issued {{a number of}} postage stamps during its existence.|$|R

2500|$|... "I {{remember}} seeing TV coverage of Fitzmorris' stunning {{defeat in the}} 1969 mayor's race. What I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> was a very gracious concession speech.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Navy's all-time leading ace, Captain David McCampbell USN (Ret), scored all his 34victories in the Hellcat. He once {{described}} the F6F as [...] "... an outstanding fighter plane. It performed well, {{was easy to}} fly and was a stable gun platform. But what I really <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> {{was that it was}} rugged and easy to maintain." ...|$|E
60|$|People {{lived on}} figures of this sort, {{and the man}} who could <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> of them stood out as a born leader.|$|E
5000|$|Mark Sidran (born July 7, 1951) is {{a former}} Seattle City Attorney, serving three terms from 1990 to 2002. He is <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> for his {{controversial}} [...] "civility" [...] laws.|$|R

6000|$|... "I can <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> {{clearly that}} only the fear of seeing you arrested for {{manslaughter}} induced a certain young lady to agree to it." ...|$|E
60|$|Many of the {{particulars}} of my journey to Ireland have faded {{out of my mind}} altogether. I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> distinctly my mood of grim elation that at last I had to deal with accessible persons again....|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{generally}} {{finds it}} useful {{to have a}} good memory, and I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> clearly that, although they had very little reason for it, most of them afterwards trusted me. That made, and still makes, a great difference to me." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{scarcely}} so long, for time was precious, but, though few men unused to the wilderness {{would have understood}} or <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> of what he said, it was quite plain to Tomlinson, who nodded.|$|R
50|$|Budd {{has worked}} with Hall of Fame stuntmen Hal Needham, Ronnie Rondell, Glenn Wilder, Roger Creed and Bill Hickman who is <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> for the {{landmark}} car chase alongside Steve McQueen in the 1968 film Bullitt.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{am not in}} {{the least}} inconsistent, and should not be if every moment were thrice as precious," [...] I said. [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> plainly that you gave me all this. Strange as it may seem, it is, nevertheless, {{perfectly}} true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> of it," [...] said Bartley. [...] "Well, I want {{to thank}} you, Halleck. You've saved me from disgrace,--from ruin, for all I know. Whew! how my head aches!" [...] he said, making an appeal to Halleck's pity, with closed eyes. [...] "Halleck," [...] he murmured, feebly, [...] "I wish you would do me a favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahuh! That's too bad. You oughtn't to hate work. Hard work {{makes for}} what I reckon you {{like in a}} man, but don't understand. As I look back over my life--an' let me say, young fellar, it's been a tough one--what I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> an' feel best over are the hardest jobs I ever did, an' those that cost the most sweat an' blood." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leon Eisenberg is {{credited}} by numerous colleagues with [...] "simple and direct" [...] prose (Arthur Kleinman, Norma Ware, etc.). He will be <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> for his writings in these areas, though his encyclopedic comprehension reached much more broadly: ...|$|R
50|$|Although his {{four-year}} {{tenure as}} Kansas State’s head coach produced one NCAA Tournament appearance, Dana Altman will be <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> {{for his ability}} to win close ball games, and for pulling off some of the biggest upsets in school history.|$|R

[...] "What I shall <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> clearly is how much you risked to warn me, and that the safe {{completion}} of the work I have set my heart on is due to you. We will forget all the unpleasant {{things that have happened}} in the past and meet as good friends next time, Millicent." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I gnawed bitter bark {{from young}} trees. I {{remember}} vaguely the eating of many green nuts, with soft shells and milky kernels. And I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> distinctly {{suffering from a}} stomach-ache. It may {{have been caused by}} the green nuts, and maybe by the lizards. I do not know. But I do know that I was fortunate in not being devoured during the several hours I was knotted up on the ground with the colic.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just the}} good, the {{exquisite}} things in life, {{that make me}} rebel against this life we are leading. It's because I've seen the streaks of gold that I know the rest for dirt. When I go cheating and scheming to my office, {{and come back to}} find you squandering yourself upon a horde of chattering, overdressed women, when I think that that is our substance and everyday and what we are, then it is I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> the deep and beautiful things.... It is impossible, dear, it is intolerable that life was made beautiful for us--just for these vulgarities." ...|$|E
5000|$|The pair {{retired from}} {{performing}} in 1975 after Emi married fellow Nabepro star Kenji Sawada. The duo is <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> for its versions of European songs {{and for a}} handful of Japanese pop songs, such as [...] "Furimukanaide" [...] ("Don't Turn Around").|$|R

50|$|Dyer is <b>remembered</b> <b>most</b> for {{his goal}} in the 88th minute in the home leg against the Dominican Republic on 19 March 2000. The match was played in Port of Spain, Trinidad as the only pitch in Montserrat was {{unusable}} due to volcanic activity.|$|R
60|$|It {{struck me}} as a {{singular}} coincidence--and to a mind of so primitive a type as the writer's there is more {{in the fact that the}} word implies--that, just as I had quitted London, to seek for just such a spot as I so speedily found, with the passionately exclaimed words of a young London girl ringing in my ears, so now I went back with this village girl's melody sounding and following me no less clearly and insistently. For it was not merely remembered, as we <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> things, but vividly and often reproduced, together with the various melodies of the birds I had listened to; a greater and principal voice in that choir, yet in no wise lessening their first value, nor ever out of harmony with them.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I am now,’ said Somerset, ‘a barrister; but Providence and the {{attorneys}} have hitherto denied {{me the opportunity}} to shine. A select society at the Cheshire Cheese engaged my evenings; my afternoons, as Mr. Godall could testify, have been generally passed in this divan; and my mornings, I have taken the precaution to abbreviate by not rising before twelve. At this rate, my little patrimony was very rapidly, and I am proud to <b>remember,</b> <b>most</b> agreeably expended. Since then a gentleman, who has really nothing else to recommend him beyond the fact of being my maternal uncle, deals me the small sum of ten shillings a week; and if you behold me once more revisiting the glimpses of the street lamps in my favourite quarter, you will readily divine that I have come into a fortune.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Away {{across the}} road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and there were more people about here, though none could give us news. For {{the most part they}} were like ourselves, taking {{advantage}} of a lull to shift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for flight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road. I <b>remember</b> <b>most</b> vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses, some many feet across. I did not know what these were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heap near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.|$|E
