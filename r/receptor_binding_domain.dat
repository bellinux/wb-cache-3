25|$|Plasmin is inactivated by {{proteins}} such as α2-macroglobulin and α2-antiplasmin. The {{mechanism of}} plasmin inactivation involves the cleavage of an α2-macroglobulin at the bait region (a {{segment of the}} aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage) by plasmin. This initiates a conformational change such that the α2-macroglobulin collapses about the plasmin.

40|$|We {{have used}} mean {{hydrophobicity}} and hydrophobic moment calculations {{to predict the}} <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domains</b> in apolipoprotein E and in the low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B-E receptor. In apolipoprotein E, two <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domains,</b> residues 136 - 160 and 214 - 236, having a high hydrophilicity and a high mean helical hydrophobic moment, were identified. The first domain has been located experimentally and mutations influencing the hydrophobicity parameters of the binding site {{have been shown to}} affect the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding.</b> The second <b>domain</b> is probably, either separately or in combination with the first <b>domain,</b> involved in <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> or in heparin binding. In the low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B-E receptor, six protein domains were identified. In the first domain (residues 1 - 371), eight hydrophilic maxima, organized in pairs through disulfide bonds, form the four experimentally observed <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> sites. These sites consist of repeats of 26 amino acids but differ from those reported by others [Yamamoto, T. Davis, C. G. Brown, M. S. Schneider, W. J. Casey, M. L. Goldstein, J. W. & Russell, D. W. (1984) Cell 39, 27 - 38]. The second, more hydrophobic, domain (residues 372 - 640) forms the core of the receptor, explaining its homology with the precursor of mouse epidermal growth factor, while the cysteine residues in the third domain (residues 641 - 699), interacting with those of the first domain, further stabilize the molecule. Beyond the fourth hydrophilic domain (residues 700 - 767), to which carbohydrates are linked, a very hydrophobic membrane spanning region (residues 768 - 789) could be detected easily. The last domain (residues 790 - 839), situated in the cytoplasma, contains hydrophilic maxima, as this region might interact with clathrin-related proteins. These data suggest that hydrophobicity analysis can detect and predict protein domains: hydrophilic receptor sites as well as hydrophobic core-forming and membrane-spanning regions.

This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|R

Syncytin-1 can also recognize ASCT1 or SLC1A4, but this receptor is not a receptor for the RDR interference group. Mutation studies of syncytin-1 and of ASCT2 have provided insight into potential receptor binding domains and determinants. A putative <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domain</b> was identified in syncytin-1 at residues 117-144.

Furthermore, ectopic expression of GLUT- 1, but not the related transporter GLUT- 3, restores HTLV infection abrogated by either GLUT- 1 siRNAs or interfering HTLV envelope glycoproteins. Therefore, GLUT- 1 is a receptor for HTLV.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} classes of PERVs, PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C. PERV-A and PERV-B are polytropic and can infect human cells in vitro, while PERV-C is ecotropic {{and does not}} replicate on human cells. The major differences between the classes is in the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domain</b> of the env protein and the long terminal repeats (LTRs) that influence the replication of each class. PERV-A and PERV-B display LTRs that have repeats in the U3 region. However, PERV-A and PERV-C show repeatless LTRs. Researchers found that PERVs in culture actively adapted to the repeat structure of their LTR in order to match the best replication performance a host cell could perform. At {{the end of their}} study, researchers concluded that repeatless PERV LTR evolved from the repeat-harboring LTR. This was likely to have occurred from insertional mutation and was proven through use of data on LTR and env/Env. It is thought that the generation of repeatless LTRs could be reflective of an adaptation process of the virus, changing from an exogenous to an endogenous lifestyle.|$|E
50|$|Flaviviridae is {{a family}} of viruses that {{encompasses}} well known viruses such as West Nile virus and Dengue virus. The genus Flavivirus has a prototypical envelope protein (E-protein) on its surface which serves as the target for virus neutralizing antibodies. E protein {{plays a role in}} binding to receptor and could play a role in evading the host immune system. It has three major antigenic domains namely A, B and C that correspond to the three structural domains II, III and I. Structural domain III is a putative <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domain</b> and antibodies against it neutralize the infectivity of flaviviruses. Mutations that lead to antigenic differences {{can be traced to the}} biochemical nature of the amino acid substitutions as well as the location of the mutation in the domain III. For example substitutions at different amino acids results in varying levels of neutralization by antibodies. If mutation in a critical amino acid can dramatically alter neutralization by antibodies then WNV vaccines and diagnostic assays becomes difficult to rely on. Other flaviviruses that cause dengue, louping ill and yellow fever escape antibody neutralization via mutations in the domain III of the E protein.|$|E
5000|$|The alpha-macroglobulin (aM) {{family of}} {{proteins}} includes protease inhibitors, typified {{by the human}} tetrameric alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2M); they belong to the MEROPS proteinase inhibitor family I39, clan IL. These protease inhibitors share several defining properties, which include (i) the ability to inhibit proteases from all catalytic classes, (ii) {{the presence of a}} 'bait region' (aka. a sequence of amino acids in an α2-macroglobulin molecule, or a homologous protein, that contains scissile peptide bonds for those proteinases that it inhibits) and a thiol ester, (iii) a similar protease inhibitory mechanism and (iv) the inactivation of the inhibitory capacity by reaction of the thiol ester with small primary amines. aM protease inhibitors inhibit by steric hindrance. The mechanism involves protease cleavage of the bait region, a segment of the aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, which initiates a conformational change such that the aM collapses about the protease. In the resulting aM-protease complex, the active site of the protease is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur as a consequence of bait region cleavage, namely (i) the h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester becomes highly reactive and (ii) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domain</b> [...] (RBD). RBD exposure allows the aM protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation.

40|$|Paramyxoviruses, {{including}} the human pathogenmeasles virus (MV) and the avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV), enter host cells through fusion of the viral envelope with the target cell membrane. This fusion {{is driven by}} the concerted action of two viral envelope glycoproteins: the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> protein and the fusion protein (F). TheMV <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> protein (hemagglutinin [H]) attaches to proteinaceous receptors onhost cells, while the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> protein ofNDV (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase [HN]) interactswith sialic acid-containing receptors. The receptor-boundHN/H triggers F to undergo conformational changes that render it competent tomediate fusion of the viral and cellularmembranes. Themechanismof fusion activation has been proposed to be different for sialic acid-binding viruses and proteinaceous receptor-binding viruses. We report that a chimeric protein containing theNDVHNreceptor binding region and theMVHstalk domain can activateMVF to fuse, suggesting that the signal to the stalk of a protein-binding receptor bindingmolecule can be transmitted froma sialic acid <b>binding</b> <b>domain.</b> By engineering theNDVHNglobu-lar domain to interactwith a proteinaceous receptor, the fusion activation signalwas preserved. Our findings are consistentwith a uni-fiedmechanismof fusion activation, at least for theParamyxovirinae subfamily, inwhich the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domains</b> of the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> proteins are interchangeable and the stalk determines the specificity of F activation.

The presence of a few key residues in the amino-terminal alpha-helix of each ligand is sufficient to confer specificity to the interaction. Comparison with other cytokines suggests that the amino-terminal helix of many of these proteins may contain the recognition element for the formation of high affinity binding sites with the alpha subunit of their multi-component receptors...|$|R

To evaluate the cell surface display of these FedF-PrtP fusions, they were further combined with different lengths of PrtP spacers fused with either the L. lactis AcmA anchor or the PrtP cell wall binding domain. An HtrA-defective L. lactis NZ 9000 mutant was constructed to determine {{its effect on the}} level of secreted or anchored fusion proteins. Recombinant L. lactis clones secreting the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>domain</b> of F 18 fimbriae as a fusion with the H domains of L. lactis protein PrtP were first constructed by using two different signal peptides. FedF-PrtP fusions, directed by the signal sequence of L. brevis SlpA, were throughout found to be secreted at significantly higher quantities than corresponding fusions with the signal peptide of L. lactis Usp 45. In the surface display systems tested, the L. lactis AcmA anchor performed significantly better, particularly in the L. lactis NZ 9000 ΔhtrA strain, compared to the L. lactis PrtP anchor region.
