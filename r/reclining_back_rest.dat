5000|$|Although the {{mechanical}} components came from earlier models, body construction involved floor sections welded {{together with the}} other body panels, resulting in a monocoque structure. The approach had by then become mainstream among many European automakers, but represented an advance on {{the mechanical}}ly similar Renault 4 and Renault 6 both of which used a separate platform. The monocoque structure reduced the car's weight, but required investment in new production processes.The Renault 5 was targeted at cost conscious customers, and the entry level [...] "L" [...] version came with the same 782 cc power plant as the cheaper Renault 4 and drum brakes on all four wheels. In 1972, it was priced in France at below 10,000 francs. However, for many export markets the entry level version was excluded from the range and front wheel disc brakes were offered on the more powerful 956 cc [...] "Renault 5TL" [...] along with such attractions under the bonnet/hood as an alternator, and in the cabin <b>reclining</b> <b>back</b> <b>rests</b> for the front seats. From outside the [...] "TL" [...] was differentiated from the [...] "L" [...] by a thin chrome strip below the doors.|$|R

The characteristic feature of a Morris chair is a hinged back, set between two un-upholstered arms, with the reclining angle adjusted through {{a row of}} pegs, holes or notches in each arm. In other instances, the <b>reclining</b> of the <b>back</b> is controlled by a metal bar set in hooked back racks. The original Morris chair had dark stained woodwork, turned spindles and heavily decorated upholstery, in typical Victorian style.|$|R

40|$|Seated {{work has}} been shown to be a risk factor for low-back pain. This is {{attributed}} to the prolonged and monotonous low-level mechanical load imposed by a seated posture. To evaluate the potential health effects with respect to the low back of office chairs with a movable seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest,</b> trunk kinematics, erector spinae EMG, spinal shrinkage and local discomfort were assessed in 10 subjects performing simulated office work (word processing, computer-aided design and reading). Three chairs were used, one with a fixed seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> and two dynamic chairs, one with a seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> movable in a fixed ratio with respect to each other, and one with a freely movable seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest.</b> Spinal shrinkage measurements showed a larger stature gain when working on the two dynamic chairs as compared with working on the chair with fixed seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest.</b> Trunk kinematics and erector spinae EMG were strongly affected by the task performed but not by the chair type. The results imply that dynamic office chairs offer a potential advantage over fixed chairs, but the effects of the task on the indicators of trunk load investigated were more pronounced than the effects of the chair...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} two seats {{were used by}} workers having shared and workers having owned work spaces. 51 {{subjects}} (22 female, 29 male) participated in a six week experiment in a naturalistic setting. The chairs were different with respect to adjustability options, design of controls and external design. Most of the subjects adjusted the office chairs {{the first time for}} seat height, arm <b>rest</b> height and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> inclination. Adjustment times of seat height and armrest height were shorter for chair A. <b>Back</b> <b>rest</b> pressure adjustment takes much time {{and it is difficult to}} adjust this without instruction. The workers having shared desks adjust their chair more often and are faster in the adjustment of the backrest pressure compared with workers with an owned work space. The quality of adjustments of seat height, arm <b>rest</b> and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> pressure was improved by an instruction for 32 % of the subjects...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of the distance between the position of the rotation axis of the back support and hip joint on the changes in the shear force applied to the buttocks. STUDY DESIGN: Repeated-measures design. METHODS: The subjects were 11 healthy adult men without leg and/or trunk diseases. The shear force applied to the buttocks was measured using a force plate. This study had three experimental conditions: the position of hip joint was taken as the 3 cm, 6 cm, and 9 cm forward from the standard sitting position. RESULTS: In returning to an upright position of back support, the shear force was 15. 0 ± 2. 9 %BW in the 3 cm forward condition, 16. 7 ± 3. 6 %BW in the 6 cm forward condition, and 19. 5 ± 5. 3 %BW in the 9 cm forward condition. Significant differences appeared between the 9 cm and the other conditions (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that the shear force applied to the buttocks changed in <b>reclining</b> <b>back</b> support and an increase in the distance between the axis of rotation of the back support and hip joint led to an increase in the remaining shear force after <b>reclining</b> the <b>back</b> support...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} types of economy seats. The Standard Economy seats (blue in colour) have a 31 in (79 cm) seat pitch. Passengers can pick their own seats for a fee. The Super seats (yellow in colour) in the economy cabin have a 35 in (89 cm) seat pitch. Passengers can book the Super Seats for a fee. The S-t-r-e-t-c-h seats (also yellow in colour) have a 36 in (91 cm) seat pitch, are located {{at the front of}} each section of the economy cabin. As these are {{bulkhead}} and exit row seats, there are no seats in front of them to <b>recline</b> <b>back</b> to invade their space, giving them the most legroom in the economy cabin.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of four methods of {{stabilization}} on maximal reciprocal isokinetic knee extension and flexion. Left knee extension/flexion was tested at 60 °/s in 20 subjects. Warm-up consisted of five submaximal and one maximal effort followed by three maximal efforts in each of four randomized stabilization conditions: 1) Hands and back stabilization; the trunk was strapped to the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> and the hands grasped the seat. 2) Back stabilization; the trunk was strapped to the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> and the hands were folded across the chest. 3) Hand stabilization; the hands grasped the seat and the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> was removed. 4) No stabilization; the hands were folded across the chest and the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> was removed. One-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of stabilization for knee extension (F(3, 57) = 17. 44, p=. 0001) and knee flexion (F(3, 57) = 5. 37, p=. 002). Paired, two-tailed student's t-tests with Bonferroni correction showed that, in knee extension, no stabilization was significantly less than all others, p<. 001. In addition, back stabilization was less than hands and back stabilization, p<. 005. In knee flexion, no stabilization was significantly less than all others, p<. 01. In conclusion, the method of trunk stabilization significantly affected maximal reciprocal isokinetic knee extension/flexion strength measurements. Maximal knee extension/flexion torque production was achieved when the trunk was strapped to the back support and when the hands grasped the seat...|$|R
