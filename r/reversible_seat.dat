50|$|The {{patent for}} the first <b>reversible</b> <b>seat</b> was {{developed}} at Wain-Roy by Carroll Arnold and Vaino Holopainen and then filed by Vaino under patent #2,784,768, and in June 1954, Vaino filed patent # 2,781,927 for individually controlled outriggers. John S. Pilch of Ware Machine Works, Ware, MA, developed the first 4-bar linkage to achieve greater bucket digging and dumping rotation. Pilch filed for patent #2,678,741 in September 1950. The 4-bar linkages were also used on the Wain-Roy backhoes after 1954.|$|E

50|$|The G sets {{differed}} from the T sets in having yellow front panels, round green door buttons, high-backed <b>reversible</b> <b>seats,</b> toilets, fresh water dispensers and luggage racks.|$|R
50|$|Car 1003 {{featured}} 2nd class flip-over <b>reversible</b> <b>seating,</b> 2+3 abreast with a seating {{pitch of}} 950 mm. This was the design ultimately {{used on the}} first production 0 series sets.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the cars}} feature flip-over <b>reversible</b> <b>seating</b> {{arranged}} 2+1 abreast. Toilets in {{both types of}} train are wheelchair-accessible, and the step between the passenger compartment and station platform has been eliminated.|$|R
50|$|Car 1004 {{featured}} 2nd class flip-over <b>reversible</b> <b>seating,</b> 2+3 abreast with a seating {{pitch of}} 950 mm. The design differed from that used in car 1003 {{in that the}} seat backs were single-sided.|$|R

50|$|In 1935 Stanley Hillsdon founded Cycle Components Manufacturing Company (CCMC) in Guildford, {{having been}} {{involved}} in manufacture of bicycles since 1911. In 1946 the company won the contract to manufacture <b>reversible</b> <b>seats</b> for Sydney's tram system.|$|R
5000|$|Each of {{the four}} Siemens motors had an effect of [...] There were two compartments, both with four-abreast <b>seating,</b> with <b>reversible</b> <b>seats.</b> Despite running in part in city streets, the trams were 2.6 m wide. They had seating for 40 passengers.|$|R
50|$|On tramways of {{the horse}} and early {{electric}} age, toastrack cars - usually with roofs and often <b>reversible</b> <b>seats</b> - were common in warm climates or for summer use. On electric tramways, such cars were usually trailers, but motor toastracks did occur.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{accommodation}} {{consists of}} longitudinal bench seating at the ends, and 2+2 abreast transverse <b>reversible</b> <b>seating</b> in {{the centre of}} the cars. The first two batches of cars (KuMoHa 125-1 - 12) were delivered with 1+2 abreast seating, but this was increased to 2+2 seating during 2003 and 2004.|$|R
50|$|Their {{coaches were}} semi-trailers, with <b>reversible</b> <b>seats</b> for 48 {{passengers}} and electric lighting. There {{were also a}} luggage compartment and a driving compartment for use in reverse. Folding steps were provided {{at each of the}} two doors on each side. They were built by Bristol Carriage & Wagon Co..|$|R

5000|$|CRH6A with a {{designed}} {{top speed}} 250 km/h, top operating speed 220 km/h {{to be used}} on regional non-stop or express services. It uses a 2+2 transverse <b>seating</b> layout using <b>reversible</b> <b>seats</b> that have a similar level of comfort and space to that of intercity trains. Some cars on the train will have toilets on board.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent orders {{saw another}} 154 power cars, 67 trailer cars and 85 driving trailer cars built by Comeng. These were all built to the Series 2 design with Budd type {{polished}} inserts on the carriage sides, flat rather than tapered number 2 ends, throw-over rather than sliding <b>reversible</b> <b>seats,</b> upgraded interior lights and a natural stainless steel finish.|$|R
50|$|While the Millennium train {{concept is}} an {{evolution}} of the Tangara concept (manufactured by A Goninan & Co), the Millennium train introduced new features such as internal electronic destination indicators, automated digital voice announcements for upcoming stops, a return to <b>reversible</b> <b>seating,</b> surveillance cameras, wider stairways, a new safety yellow colour scheme, and push-button opened internal doors. The Millennium Train also introduced crumple zones to absorb impact in a collision. Interiors were designed by Transport Design International.|$|R
5000|$|The Museum {{consists}} of twenty properties; some are interpretive history sites. They include stores for toys, leather goods, hardware and music, a print shop, a gas station, and a tram. The print shop contains {{one of the}} most complete collections of antique printing presses and type in the Southeast. The trolley has <b>reversible</b> <b>seats,</b> as it cannot turn around. The conductor takes his steering wheel to the other end, and runs the trolley in that direction.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the second}} batch of cars {{delivered}} to the railway for its opening as far as Laxey Station in 1894. Referred to as [...] "tunnel cars" [...] because their seating was originally parallel to the sides with just one large passenger saloon, typical of early trams, {{as opposed to the}} more usual <b>reversible</b> <b>seating</b> common in tramcar layout. They are still in regular use today except for Nos. 4 and 8 which were destroyed by the Laxey Car Shed fire in 1930. Some cars were later modified; car 5, for instance, now has <b>reversible</b> plush <b>seating</b> and car 6 did until recently retain its joint front windows but now has the central pillar removed from the driver's window to increase visibility. In 1993, car 9 was selected as the illuminated tram, adorned with modern rope lights giving rise to controversy among the M.E.R. faithful.|$|R
50|$|Eighty G set cars {{featuring}} toilets, high-backed <b>reversible</b> <b>seating</b> {{and passenger}} door opening controls were built between 1994 and 1996. These generally operated on outer-suburban runs, typically to Wollongong, Springwood and Gosford, though they also sometimes operated in suburban service. These outer-suburban sets allowed {{the retirement of}} the last remaining single-deck U sets in 1996. One set, G7, was experimentally fitted with dual-voltage A/C traction. This set was extensively damaged in the Waterfall rail accident in January 2003 and scrapped after completion of the coronial inquiry into the accident.|$|R
50|$|FP13 {{was built}} {{at the same time}} as FP7 - FP12 but unlike FP7-12 it was built purely as a rail bus, with FP13 being {{designed}} to carry 18 passengers in nine 2 <b>seat</b> throw over <b>reversible</b> <b>seats.</b> FP13 was used as a rail bus on the Cooma-Bombala service. It entered service in February 1970. It suffered a seized engine in February 1974 which coupled with a fuel strike saw the withdrawal of the rail bus service. FP13 was stored until March 1980 when it entered Eveleigh Carriage Workshops for conversion to a pay bus.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Yale Puppeteers Harry Burnett and Richard Brandon (Brown's lifelong lover), Brown {{launched}} Turnabout Theatre in 1941 as [...] "a {{vehicle for}} performing both puppet plays and revues for adults." [...] Turnabout Theatre {{was a highly}} popular puppetry venue until its dissolution in 1956. <b>Reversible</b> <b>seats</b> were installed in the theatre so that after the puppet shows were performed {{at one end of}} the auditorium, the puppeteers asked the audience to [...] "turnabout" [...] their seats for the Turnabout revue staged at the opposite end of the auditorium.|$|R
5000|$|The short horse-drawn tramway {{service from}} Pwllheli railway station to Victoria Parade {{operated}} a summer service. It opened on 24 July 1899 when over 1,000 tickets were purchased. The tramway {{was built by}} the workmen of the Corporation and consisted of a single line with a passing loop at the centre. It was built to a gauge of 2ft 6in. The Corporation provided open and covered cars. The open one had <b>reversible</b> <b>seats</b> for 24 passengers, and the closed one could accommodate 16 passengers. The fare was 1d. (...) , with special workmenâ€™s fares of 1/2 d.|$|R
5000|$|New <b>reversible</b> 3x2 <b>seats,</b> {{as found}} on the Hunter railcars and H sets, the seat covers are made of woollen {{moquette}} farbric which is more durable and vandal proof ...|$|R
50|$|In 1990-91, BREL built twelve 3-car units {{based on}} the Class 158 for State Railway of Thailand. These differ from the British units in being fitted to Thailand's metre gauge, {{featuring}} differently styled outer-end gangways, manually operated inward-opening hinged doors (as opposed to the British plug doors), <b>reversible</b> <b>seating</b> and additional air-conditioning. They originally retained the original white, blue and black 'Regional Railways Express' livery. All units of Class 158 of State Railway of Thailand were refurbished in 2011. The refurbishment involved the repainting of the trains into a new livery and the lengthening of the trains to 4 coaches.|$|R
50|$|The last 80 {{carriages}} {{were built}} as G sets in 1994/95. These ran on shorter interurban services to Springwood, Port Kembla and Wyong. The G sets had baggage storage in each carriage, <b>reversible</b> <b>seats,</b> a toilet and a selective door opening capability {{for use with}} shorter platforms in outer suburban areas. These trains also operated on suburban runs, especially outside of peak hours. Following {{the introduction of the}} H sets (OSCARs), the G Sets were converted into purely suburban trains and reclassified as T Sets. The toilets were removed during the conversion process but many of the other unique features remain.|$|R
50|$|H sets (OSCARs, for outer-suburban CARs), were {{launched}} on 24 April 2006. The H sets were principally built {{to replace the}} G set Tangaras on outer-suburban services and the original order of V sets. They feature identical <b>reversible</b> <b>seating</b> to Hunter railcars, and one disabled toilet per four-car set, whilst the vestibules feature longitudinal seating and ceiling hand-grips. They run to Newcastle, Springwood and Kiama/Port Kembla. These cars were built by UGL Rail. When new Intercity trains are introduced in 2019 to replace V sets, some H sets will also be displaced and moved onto the Sydney Trains suburban network to replace remaining S sets.|$|R
50|$|All 117 series {{cars were}} {{originally}} equipped with <b>reversible</b> transverse <b>seats,</b> but lacked strap hangers. The interior had wood trim intended {{to set the}} 117 apart from other suburban trains. The cars feature flat ceilings joined to the walls and an angled panel above the luggage rack.|$|R
25|$|The {{four sets}} allowed for daily {{services}} {{in both directions}} to Trondheim, but only one direction each day to Bergen. NSB therefore decided in 1956 to order two more units, allowing for daily services also on the Bergen Line. NSB initially intended to order the new units with <b>reversible</b> <b>seating</b> and the kitchen in the center car, but chose to retain the former layout in able to retain a universally interchangeable fleet to avoid complicating the booking process. However, the new units were delivered with doors {{on both sides of}} the train, compensated through and overall longer length and a tighter seat pitch. The two units were delivered in 1958 and first ran on 13 May. They were handed over to NSB on 31 May and 15 June, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Hunter Railcars {{is derived from the}} Transwa Prospector - the major {{difference}} being the driving cars are each single-engined instead of dual-engined, due to the lower top speed requirement for the Hunter line. <b>Reversible</b> <b>seating</b> is covered with durable, vandal proof woollen moquette farbric in 3x2 formation, and have retractable footrests. CCTV is installed. The cars have been fitted with Dellner SP couplers. They are able to absorb the impact of a collision, and the anti-climbers will also reduce the force of impact. They also have a different body design. Instead of the entire body being of the same design, such as the Tangara, the driver's cab is built as a protective cage, made of fibreglass, which stretches {{to the end of the}} guard's door. The stainless steel paneling starts at the guard's door. The guard's door is designed to operate separately from the passenger doors.|$|R
50|$|The A set is {{the first}} {{passenger}} train {{in the world to}} use LED lamps for all lighting (except headlights) In doing so the designers managed to remove almost 800kg in reflectors and ballasts associated with fluorescent units, as well as reducing power consumption to around a quarter of that used by fluorescents.. Woollen moquette fabric, a durable, vandal-resistant material first used in the OSCAR trains, Hunter Railcars, and later adopted in the refurbishments of both the Tangara and Endeavour railcars, is used to cover the train's seats. The seats were a groundbreaking design, using specially developed shock absorbers such that the reversing feature is damped (try reversing the seats quickly and then slowly) - this was a safety feature added to allow <b>reversible</b> <b>seats</b> which would contain passengers {{in the event of an}} accident. Detailed design of the train was completed in July 2009.|$|R
50|$|The {{passengers}} {{carried in the}} first season (1947) were obliged to sit in freight wagons - scale model 7-plank open wagons, with crude cross-bar seats fitted. However, for the 1948 season the railway acquired two bogie passenger coaches with <b>reversible</b> <b>seats</b> whose backs could be tipped to allow the passenger to face the direction of travel. In 1953 the railway took delivery of four new passenger coaches, each seating 16 passengers (in 4 compartments of 4 seats each); at a subsequent, but unknown, date the two earlier coaches were withdrawn. When the current operators took over the line they made temporary use {{of the last two}} serviceable coaches of 1953 vintage, though these have since been withdrawn. There are now four passenger coaches, all of modern build and metal construction. Three are enclosed, and one is open. Three of these coaches have exterior platforms for a guard or guards to travel upon.|$|R
50|$|The fleet {{consists}} of six standard cars, numbered ET122-1 to ET122-6, and two special-event cars, numbered ET122-7 to ET122-8. The former have <b>reversible</b> transverse <b>seating</b> arranged 2+1 abreast with longitudinal bench seating {{at one end}} (total seating capacity 33), and the latter have fixed 4-person seating bays with tables (total seating capacity 40). Both types have a wheelchair space {{at one end and}} a universal access toilet.|$|R
