40|$|Many {{metals and}} metalloids, jointly termed metal(loid) s, are toxic to plants even at low levels. This has limited {{the study of}} their uptake, distribution, and modes of action in plant roots grown at physiologically {{relevant}} concentrations. Synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy {{was used to examine}} metal(loid) s in hydrated cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) roots exposed to Zn(II), Ni(II) Mn(II), Cu(II), Hg(II), Se(IV), Se(VI), As(III), or As(V). Development of a mathematical model enabled in situ quantitative determination of their distribution in root tissues. The binding strength of metals influenced the extent of their movement through the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which influenced the toxic effects exerted metals (e. g. Cu, Hg) that bind more strongly to hard ligands had high concentrations in the rhizodermis and caused this tissue to rupture, while other metals (e. g. Ni, Zn) moved further into the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder</b> and did not cause ruptures. When longitudinal distributions were examined, the highest Se concentration in roots exposed to Se(VI) was in the more proximal root tissues, suggesting that Se(VI) is readily loaded into the stele. This contrasted with other metal(loid) s (e. g. Mn, As), which accumulated in the apex. These differences in metal(loid) spatial distribution provide valuable quantitative data on metal(loid) physiology, including uptake, transport, and toxicity in plant roots. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{effects of}} soil bulk density (ρ) and water content on root extension, {{phosphorus}} (P) uptake and plant growth were studied with ryegrass in pot experiments with a sandy loam soil. Uptake was considered {{in terms of}} a <b>root</b> <b>cylinder</b> model with parameters of root length and uptake per unit length. Increasing ρ (from 1. 0 to 1. 54 g cm) slightly increased root diameter and reduced root hair length, but the main effect on uptake per unit length of root was related to the increased mass of soil and hence the increased mass of P within the root hair cylinder. The effect of ρ on diffusion {{to the surface of the}} cylinder appeared to be small. Increasing ρ also increased soil strength, causing a reduction in root length which was linearly related to P uptake. Thus the effect of ρ on total P uptake was a product of the opposing effects on uptake per unit length and root length. The importance of these two effects was confirmed by calculating potential P uptake using a simple <b>root</b> <b>cylinder</b> model in which ρ was a variable. Predicted and observed values were highly correlated (r = 0. 94). Drying the soil reduced P uptake per unit length of root, but, in compacted soil, this effect was small compared with the effect of drying on root extension. It appears that, when this soil type is not cultivated, drying will reduce P uptake mainly because mechanical resistance reduced root extension, and root extension ceased well within the available water range in intact soil cores...|$|E

Twenty maxillary central incisors were subjected to biomechanical preparation (# 80 hand file) and sectioned transversally 2 mm short of the apex and 4 mm coronally to this point. The <b>root</b> <b>cylinders</b> were embedded in acrylic resin and positioned at 45 &# 176; to the horizontal plane for preparation of root-end cavities with a diamond ultrasonic retrotip. Two groups (n= 10) were formed according to the root-end filling material: MTA and Super EBA. A gutta-percha cone (# 80) was tug-backed at the limit between the canal and the root-end cavity. The cavity was filled and the gutta-percha cone was removed after complete setting of the sealer. The specimens were placed in an Instron machine with the root-end filling turned downwards. The push-out shaft was inserted in the space previously occupied by the gutta-percha cone and run at a crosshead speed of 1. 0 mm/min for pushing out the root-end filling material.

40|$|A root {{pressure}} probe {{was employed}} to measure hydraulic properties of primary roots of maize (Zea mays L.). The hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) of intact root segments was determined by applying gradients of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure across the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In hydrostatic experiments, Lpr was constant along the segment except for an apical zone of approximately 20 millimeters in length which was hydraulically isolated due to a high axial resistance. In osmotic experiments, Lpr decreased toward {{the base of the}} roots. Lpr (osmotic) was significantly smaller than Lpr (hydrostatic). At various distances from the root tip, the axial hydraulic resistance per unit root length (Rx) was measured either by perfusing excised root segments or was estimated according to Poiseuille's law from cross-sections. The calculated Rx was smaller than the measured Rx by a factor of 2 to 5. Axial resistance varied with the distance from the apex due to the differentiation of early metaxylem vessels. Except for the apical 20 millimeters, radial water movement was limiting water uptake into the root. This is important for the evaluation of Lpr of roots from root pressure relaxations. Stationary water uptake into the roots was modeled using measured values of axial and radial hydraulic resistances in order to work out profiles of axial water flow and xylem water potentials...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the biopolymers lignin and suberin was investigated with hypodermal (HCW) and endodermal cell walls (ECW) and xylem vessels (XV) isolated from Clivia miniata Reg. roots. Both biopolymers were detected in HCW and ECW, whereas in XV, typical aliphatic suberin monomers were missing and only representative lignin monomers such as guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units could be detected. The absolute amounts of lignin were about one order of magnitude higher compared with suberin in both HCW and ECW. The ratios of the two aromatic lignin units (G/S) decreased from 39 in XV and 10 in HCW to about 1 in ECW, indicating significant differences in lignin structure and function between the three investigated samples. Additionally, compared with the detectable lignin-derived aromatic units G and S, significantly higher amounts of esterified p-coumaric acid-derived aromatic monomers were obtained with HCW, but not with ECW. This is interpreted as a functional adaption of HCW toward pathogen defense at the root/soil interface. The final {{aim of this study}} was to provide a thorough chemical characterization of the composition of HCW, ECW, and XV, which in turn will form the basis for a better understanding of the relevant barriers toward the passive, radial, and apoplastic diffusion of solutes from the soil across the root cortex into the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder...</b>|$|E

Eight weeks after inoculation of soil-grown plants, between 0. 1 and 1 % of the total bacterial population in the rhizospheres of all inoculated plants were identified as R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii R 39. To characterize the associative colonization of the nonleguminous plants by R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii R 39 in more detail, a time course study was performed with inoculated roots of Z. mays.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} model describing {{the course of}} drying curve of single parsley root particles under conditions of natural convection was formulated {{on the basis of}} the general theory of heat and mass transfer laws. The course of the drying curve was described in two ways: using the linear model of the first drying period (without shrinkage) and then using the models of second drying period and the models of first drying period taking into account shrinkage and finally the models of second drying period. The second drying period was described in both cases by the same models which approximated the shape of dried particles as follows: infinite plane (slices cut crosswise and along the <b>root,</b> axial <b>cylinder</b> slices), finite cylinder (slices cut crosswise the <b>root,</b> axial <b>cylinder</b> slices), finite in two dimensions plane (bark rings), infinite cylinder (bark rings). The verification confirmed that the following {{mathematical model}}s describe the course of drying curve with satisfactory accuracy: for crosswise and lengthwise slices and axial cylinder slices – the linear model or models with shrinkage in the first drying period and the model of infinite plane in the second drying period, for bark rings – the linear model or models with shrinkage in the first drying period and the model of finite plane in the second drying period. The values of relative error were not higher than: 1 % for linear model, 4 % for models with shrinkage, 29 % for models of the infinite and finite plane drying.

Three groups were established (n= 7) : in group 1, <b>root</b> <b>cylinders</b> obtained from human canines were embedded in acrylic resin and had their canals prepared and filled with sealer; in group 2, longitudinal sections of dentin cylinders were embedded in resin with the canal surface smoothed and turned upwards; in group 3, gutta-percha cylinders were embedded in resin. Polyethylene tubes filled with sealer were positioned on the polished surface of the specimens (groups 2 and 3). The push-out test (group 1) and the SBS test (groups 2 and 3) were performed in an Instron universal testing machine running at crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Means (±SD) in MPa were: G 1 (8. 8 ± 1. 13), G 2 (5. 9 ± 1. 05) and G 3 (3. 8 ± 0. 55).

The tested surface affected significantly the results with the sealer reaching higher bond strength to dentin than to gutta-percha with the SBS test. The comparison of the employed methodologies showed that the SBS test produced significantly lower bond strength values than the push-out test, was skilful in determining the adhesion of AH Plus sealer to dentin and gutta-percha, and required specimens that could be easily prepared for SEM, presenting as a viable alternative for further experiments...|$|R

Using synchrotron-based fluorescence X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) imaging to provide laterally resolved data, the speciation of Se in fresh roots and leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) supplied with 1 mu M of either selenate or selenite was investigated. For plant roots exposed to selenate, the majority of the Se was efficiently converted to C-Se-C compounds (i. e. methylselenocysteine or selenomethionine) as selenate was transported radially through the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Indeed, even in the rhizodermis which is exposed directly to the bulk solution, only 12 - 31 % of the Se was present as uncomplexed selenate. The C-Se-C compounds were probably sequestered within the roots, whilst much of the remaining uncomplexed Se was translocated to the leaves-selenate accounting for 52 - 56 % of the total Se in the leaves. In a similar manner, for plants exposed to selenite, the Se was efficiently converted to C-Se-C compounds within the roots, with only a small proportion of uncomplexed selenite observed within the outer root tissues. This resulted in a substantial decrease in translocation of Se from the roots to leaves of selenite-exposed plants.

The growth of the two strains on the root surface and the colonization of the root was cuantitatively similar although the highly virulent strain was more efficient reaching the central <b>root</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The main differences between both strains {{were found in the}} temporal and spatial {{dynamics of}} crown root and hypocotyl colonization. The increase of fungal biomass in the crown root was considerably larger for the highly virulent strain, which, after an initial stage of global colonization of both the vascular cylinder and the parenchymal cells, restricted its growth to the newly differentiated xylem vessels. The weakly virulent strain was a much slower and less efficient colonizer of the xylem vessels, showing also growth in the intercellular spaces of the parenchyma. Most of the virulence genes analyzed showed similar expression patterns in both strains, except SIX 1, SIX 6 and the gene encoding the transcription factor FTF 1, which were highly upregulated in root crown and hypocotyl. The response induced in the infected plant showed interesting differences for both strains.

40|$|Mechanisms whereby metal cations are {{toxic to}} plant roots remain largely unknown. Aluminum, for example, has been {{recognized}} as rhizotoxic for approximately 100 yr, {{but there is no}} consensus on its mode of action. The authors contend that the primary mechanism of rhizotoxicity of many metal cations is nonspecific and that the magnitude of toxic effects is positively related to the strength with which they bind to hard ligands, especially carboxylate ligands of the cell-wall pectic matrix. Specifically, the authors propose that metal cations have a common toxic mechanism through inhibiting the controlled relaxation of the cell wall as required for elongation. Metal cations such as Al 3 + and Hg 2 +, which bind strongly to hard ligands, are toxic at relatively low concentrations because they bind strongly to the walls of cells in the rhizodermis and outer cortex of the root elongation zone with little movement into the inner tissues. In contrast, metal cations such as Ca 2 +, Na+, Mn 2 +, and Zn 2 +, which bind weakly to hard ligands, bind only weakly to the cell wall and move farther into the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Only at high concentrations is their weak binding sufficient to inhibit the relaxation of the cell wall. Finally, different mechanisms would explain why certain metal cations (for example, Tl+, Ag+, Cs+, and Cu 2 +) are sometimes more toxic than expected through binding to hard ligands. The data presented in the present study demonstrate the importance of strength of binding to hard ligands in influencing a range of important physiological processes within roots through nonspecific mechanisms. ...|$|E

Here, a combination of radioactive techniques, metabolic inhibitors, and fluorescence imaging was used to contrast Cd uptake and translocation between a hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) and a non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) of S. alfredii. The Km of 109 Cd influx into roots was similar in both ecotypes, while the Vmax was 2 -fold higher in the HE. Significant inhibition of Cd uptake by low temperature or metabolic inhibitors was observed in the HE, whereas the effect was less pronounced in the NHE. 109 Cd influx into roots was also significantly decreased by high Ca in both ecotypes. The rate of root-to-shoot translocation of 109 Cd in the HE was > 10 times higher when compared with the NHE, and shoots of the HE accumulated dramatically higher 109 Cd concentrations those of the NHE. The addition of the metabolic inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) resulted in a significant reduction in Cd contents in the shoots of the HE, and in the roots of the NHE. Cd was distributed preferentially to the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder</b> of the HE but not the NHE, and there was a 3 – 5 times higher Cd concentration in xylem sap of the HE in contrast to the NHE.

40|$|A root {{pressure}} probe {{has been}} used to measure the root pressure (Pr) exerted by excised main roots of young maize plants (Zea Mays L.). Defined gradients of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure could be set up between root xylem and medium to induce radial water flows across the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder</b> in both directions. The hydraulic conductivity of the root (Lpr) was evaluated from root pressure relaxations. When permeating solutes were added to the medium, biphasic root pressure relaxations were observed with water and solute phases and root pressure minima (maxima) which allowed the estimation of permeability (PSr) and reflection coefficients (σsr) of roots. Reflection coefficients were: ethanol, 0. 27; mannitol, 0. 74; sucrose, 0. 54; PEG 1000, 0. 82; NaCl, 0. 64; KNO 3, 0. 67, and permeability coefficients (in 10 − 8 meters per second) : ethanol, 4. 7; sucrose, 1. 6; and NaCl, 5. 7. Lpr was very different for osmotic and hydrostatic gradients. For hydrostatic gradients Lpr was 1 · 10 − 7 meters per second per megapascal, whereas in osmotic experiments the hydraulic conductivity was found to be an order of magnitude lower. For hydrostatic gradients, the exosmotic Lpr was about 15 % larger than the endosmotic, whereas in osmotic experiments the polarity in the water movement was reversed. These results either suggest effects of unstirred layers at the osmotic barrier in the root, an asymmetrical barrier, and/or mechanical effects. Measurements of the hydraulic conductivity of individual root cortex cells revealed an Lp similar to Lpr (hydrostatic). It is concluded that, in the presence of external hydrostatic gradients, water moves primarily in the apoplast, whereas in the presence of osmotic gradients this component is much smaller in relation to the cell-to-cell component (symplasmic plus transcellular transport) ...|$|E

The hydraulic conductivities (Lpr) of primary root segments were determined by applying gradients of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure across the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Exosmotic hydrostatic Lpr for the different treatments were 2. 8, 1. 7, 2. 8, and 3. 4 · 10 − 7 meters per second per megapascals and the endosmotic hydrostatic Lpr were 2. 4, 1. 5, 2. 7, and 2. 3 · 10 − 7 meters per second per megapascals, respectively. Exosmotic Lpr of the osmotic experiments were 0. 55, 0. 38, 0. 68, and 0. 60 · 10 − 7 meters per second per megapascals and the endosmotic Lpr were 0. 53, 0. 21, 0. 56, and 0. 54 · 10 − 7 meters per second per megapascals, respectively. The osmotic Lpr was significantly smaller (4 - 5 times) than hydrostatic Lpr. However, both hydrostatic and osmotic Lpr experiments showed that salinization of the growth media at regular (0. 5 millimolar) calcium levels decreased the Lpr significantly (30 - 60 %). Addition of extra calcium (10 millimolar) to the salinized media caused ameliorative effects on Lpr. The low Lpr values may partially explain the reduction in root growth rates caused by salinity. High calcium levels in the salinized media increased the relative availability of water needed for growth. The mean reflection coefficients of the roots using NaCl were between 0. 64 and 0. 73 and were not significantly different for the different treatments. The mean values of the root permeability coefficients to NaCl of the different treatments were between 2. 2 and 3. 5 · 10 − 9 meters per second and were significantly different only in one of four treatments. Cutting the roots successively from the tip and measuring the changes in the hydraulic resistance of the root as well as staining of root cross-sections obtained at various distances from the root tip revealed that salinized roots had mature xylem elements closer to the tip (5 - 10 millimeters) compared with the controls (30 millimeters).

O objetivo do presente estudo foi avaliar a adesividade do cimento Epiphany à dentina radicular previamente tratada com hipoclorito de sódio a 1 % e EDTA a 17 %, em comparação ao cimento AH Plus, pelo método do "push-out". Foram preparados sessenta cilindros de raízes de caninos superiores humanos que foram distribuídos em 3 grupos (n= 20) de acordo com o tratamento da dentina: GI água destilada (controle), GII hipoclorito de sódio 1 % e GIII EDTA 17 %. Esses grupos de corpos-de-prova foram distribuídos em 2 subgrupos para receber os cimentos obturadores a serem testados: Ephiphany e AH Plus. Foi realizado o teste do "push-out" e os resultados (em kN) foram analisados estatisticamente por ANOVA e o teste "post-hoc" de Tukey. A análise demonstrou diferença estatisticamente significativa entre os cimentos (AH Plus: 0, 78 ± 0, 13; Epiphany: 0, 61 ± 0, 19; p < 0, 01) e entre as soluções testadas (água destilada: 0, 58 ± 0, 19; NaOCl: 0, 71 ± 0, 12; EDTA: 0, 80 ± 0, 17; p< 0, 05). Conclui-se que o cimento AH Plus apresentou valores de adesividade superiores aos obtidos pelo cimento Epiphany, independente do tratamento realizado nas paredes dos canais radiculares...|$|R
40|$|A pea cDNA clone {{homologous}} to the soybean early nodulin clone pGmENOD 2 {{that most}} probably encodes a cell wall protein was isolated. The derived {{amino acid sequence}} of the pea ENOD 2 protein shows that it contains the same repeating pentapeptides, ProProHisGluLys and ProProGluTyrGln, as the soybean ENOD 2 protein. By in situ hybridization {{the expression of the}} ENOD 2 gene was shown to occur only in the inner cortex of the indeterminate pea nodule. The transcription of the pea ENOD 2 gene starts when the inner cortical cells develop from the nodule meristem. In the determinate soybean nodule the ENOD 2 gene is expressed in the inner cortex as well as in cells surrounding the vascular bundle that connects the nodule with the <b>root</b> central <b>cylinder.</b> The term 'nodule inner cortex' is misleading, as there is no direct homology with the root inner cortex. Therefore, we propose to consider this tissue as nodule parenchyma.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{salinity}} and calcium levels on water flows and on hydraulic parameters of individual cortical cells of excised roots of young maize (Zea mays L. cv Halamish) {{plants have been}} measured using the cell pressure probe. Maize seedlings were grown in one-third strength Hoagland solution modified by additions of NaCl and/or extra calcium so that the seedlings received one of four treatments: control; + 100 millimolar NaCl; + 10 millimolar CaCl 2; + 100 millimolar NaCl + 10 millimolar CaCl 2. From the hydrostatic and osmotic relaxations of turgor, the hydraulic conductivity (Lp) and the reflection coefficient (σs) of cortical cells of different root layers were determined. Mean Lp values in the different layers (first to third, fourth to sixth, seventh to ninth) of the four different treatments ranged from 11. 8 to 14. 5 (Control), 2. 5 to 3. 8 (+NaCl), 6. 9 to 8. 7 (+CaCl 2), and 6. 6 to 7. 2 · 10 − 7 meter per second per megapascal (+NaCl + CaCl 2). These results indicate that salinization of the growth media at regular calcium levels (0. 5 millimolar) decreased Lp significantly (three to six times). The addition of extra calcium (10 millimolar) to the salinized media produced compensating effects. Mean cell σs values of NaCl ranged from 1. 08 to 1. 16, 1. 15 to 1. 22, 0. 94 to 1. 00, and 1. 32 to 1. 46 in different root cell layers of the four different treatments, respectively. Some of these σs values were probably overestimated due to an underestimation of the elastic modulus of cells, σs values of close to unity were {{in line with the}} fact that root cell membranes were practically not permeable to NaCl. However, the <b>root</b> <b>cylinder</b> exhibited some permeability to NaCl as was demonstrated by the root pressure probe measurements that resulted in σsr of less than unity. Compared with the controls, salinity and calcium increased the root cell diameter. Salinized seedlings grown at regular calcium levels resulted in shorter cell length compared with control (by a factor of 2). The results demonstrate that NaCl has adverse effects on water transport parameters of root cells. Extra calcium could, in part, compensate for these effects. The data suggest a considerable apoplasmic water flow in the root cortex. However, the cell-to-cell path also contributed to the overall water transport in maize roots and appeared to be responsible for the decrease in root hydraulic conductivity reported earlier (Azaizeh H, Steudle E [1991] Plant Physiol 97 : 1136 - 1145). Accordingly, the effect of high salinity on the cell Lp was much larger than that on root Lpr...|$|E
30|$|The maize {{scutellum}} shows phenol {{peroxidase activity}} (PODa) in the basal {{area of the}} surface of the scutellum, in the <b>root</b> vascular <b>cylinder,</b> and in the aleurone layer (García-Lara et al. 2007). Class III plant peroxidases (EC 1.11. 1.7) are a group of apoplastic and plasma membrane-bound enzymes that are monomeric, N-glycosylated, and contain a heme group that catalyzes the reduction of H 2 O 2. Peroxidases receive electrons from various reducing donors that accumulate in most seeds, including phenolic groups, such as lignin precursors and flavonoids (Hiraga et al. 2001; Passardi et al. 2005; Winkel-Shirley 2002). These compounds act as antioxidants and are involved in latency, germination, and viability (Pourcel et al. 2007; Winkel-Shirley 2002). A wide range of physiological functions have been assigned to peroxidases, such as the cross-linking of phenolic compounds to proteins and polysaccharides (Fry 2004; Hollmann and Arends 2012), the deposit of polyphenols (Lagrimini 1991), and suberization (Bernards and Lewis 1998). Peroxidases play a dual role, functioning either as antioxidants, in which they consume H 2 O 2 using a reduced molecule, or as pro-oxidants, in which they produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as O 2.- or °OH, via oxidative and hydroxylic cycles, respectively (Liszkay et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|For {{salinity}} {{stress tolerance}} in plants, the vacuolar type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is of prime importance in energizing sodium sequestration {{into the central}} vacuole and it is known to respond to salt stress with increased expression and enzyme activity. In this work we provide information that the expressional response to salinity of the V-ATPase is regulated tissue and cell specifically under developmental control in the facultative halophyte common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum). By transcript analysis of subunit E of the V-ATPase, amounts did not change in response to salinity stress in juvenile plants that are not salt-tolerant. In a converse manner, in halotolerant mature plants the transcript levels increased in leaves, but not in roots when salt stressed for 72 h. By in situ hybridizations and immunocytological protein analysis, subunit E was shown to be synthesized in all cell types. During salt stress, signal intensity declined in root cortex cells and in {{the cells of the}} <b>root</b> vascular <b>cylinder.</b> In salt-stressed leaves of mature plants, the strongest signals were localized surrounding the vasculature. Within control cells and with highest abundance in mesophyll cells of salt-treated leaves, accumulation of subunit E protein was observed in the cytoplasm, indicating its presence not only in the tonoplast, but also in other endoplasmic compartments...|$|R

Plant root simulator probes {{were used to}} measure nutrient supply (inside) and bioavailability (outside) of <b>root</b> exclusion <b>cylinders.</b> Measurements were made in September 2008 and May, August, and October of 2009. Soil moisture content (θd) and foliar nutrient concentrations were also determined. The BC treatments increased soil P supply more than CF and CT 0. The supply of NH 4 + and K in the soil increased in August but their bioavailability increased in May and October. Soil NO 3 - and P supply and bioavailability were both high in May. Foliar N and K concentrations were significantly high in May and low in August which {{could be due to}} dilution effect caused by increased soil moisture foliar dry weight. Foliar P concentrations increased in September and October.

Cross sections at sequential positions were observed along tbe roots axis from the apex up to 18 cm from the root tip at intervals of 3 cm. An index was established to facilitate development comparisons. Complete transition to secondary growth was found closer to the apex in the roots grown in dry soil (at 9 cm) than in the roots grown in watered soil (at 12 cm). Up to 5 cm from the root tip, the cortical tissue was wider in the roots grown in dry soil than in watered soil. Based on maturity stage, both total <b>root</b> and central <b>cylinder</b> radii were greater for the dry than the irrigated treatment.

40|$|The frd 3 mutant of Arabidopsis {{exhibits}} constitutive {{expression of}} its iron uptake responses and is chlorotic. These phenotypes {{are consistent with}} defects either in iron deficiency signaling or in iron translocation and localization. Here we present several experiments demonstrating that a functional FRD 3 gene is necessary for correct iron localization in both the root and shoot of Arabidopsis plants. Reciprocal grafting experiments with frd 3 and wild-type Arabidopsis plants reveal that the phenotype of a grafted plant {{is determined by the}} genotype of the root, not by the genotype of the shoot. This indicates that FRD 3 function is root-specific and points to a role for FRD 3 in delivering iron to the shoot in a usable form. When grown under certain conditions, frd 3 mutant plants overaccumulate iron in their shoot tissues. However, we demonstrate by direct measurement of iron levels in shoot protoplasts that intracellular iron levels in frd 3 are only about one-half the levels in wild type. Histochemical staining for iron reveals that frd 3 mutants accumulate high levels of ferric iron in their <b>root</b> vascular <b>cylinder,</b> the same tissues in which the FRD 3 gene is expressed. Taken together, these results clearly indicate a role for FRD 3 in iron localization in Arabidopsis. Specifically, FRD 3 is likely to function in root xylem loading of an iron chelator or other factor necessary for efficient iron uptake out of the xylem or apoplastic space and into leaf cells...|$|R
40|$|In plants, MADS-box {{transcription}} {{factors are}} key regulators of floral and fruit development, organ dehiscence and stress responses. Nevertheless, {{the functions of}} {{most of them are}} still unknown. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the AGL 17 -like clade of MADS-box transcription factors comprises four members. AGL 17 is involved in floral induction, whereas AGL 44 /ANR 1 is involved in the adaptive development of roots in response to nitrate. AGL 21 is primarily expressed in the roots and AGL 16 in the leaves, suggesting that these transcription factors may be involved in the control of vegetative development. In Oryza sativa, the AGL 17 -like clade comprises five members, OsMADS 23, OsMADS 25, OsMADS 27, OsMADS 57 and OsMADS 61. In a first attempt to characterize their functions, we used promoter::Gus reporter gene fusions and RT-qPCR to study the expression patterns of these genes and their regulation by different external stimuli. The OsMADS 23, OsMADS 25, OsMADS 27 and OsMADS 57 promoters were active in the <b>root's</b> central <b>cylinder.</b> In addition, the OsMADS 57 promoter was active in leaves, whereas the OsMADS 61 promoter was only active in the leaf tips and the stem base. OsMADS 25 and OsMADS 27 transcripts accumulated in response to osmotic stress, whereas the expression levels of OsMADS 25, OsMADS 27 and OsMADS 57 were slightly induced by nitrate. Each of these five genes was responsive to various hormonal treatments. These distinct expression patterns indicate that these five genes have specific and non-redundant functions that likely differs from those of their A. thaliana homologs. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between zinc (Zn) and {{phosphate}} (Pi) nutrition {{in plants}} {{have long been}} recognized, but little information is available on their molecular bases and biological significance. This work aimed at examining the effects of Zn deficiency on Pi accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana and uncovering genes involved in the Zn-Pi synergy. Wild-type plants as well as mutants affected in Pi signalling and transport genes, namely the transcription factor PHR 1, the E 2 -conjugase PHO 2, and the Pi exporter PHO 1, were examined. Zn deficiency caused an increase in shoot Pi content in the wild type {{as well as in}} the pho 2 mutant, but not in the phr 1 or pho 1 mutants. This indicated that PHR 1 and PHO 1 participate in the coregulation of Zn and Pi homeostasis. Zn deprivation had a very limited effect on transcript levels of Pi-starvation-responsive genes such as AT 4, IPS 1, and microRNA 399, or on of members of the high-affinity Pi transporter family PHT 1. Interestingly, one of the PHO 1 homologues, PHO 1;H 3, was upregulated in response to Zn deficiency. The expression pattern of PHO 1 and PHO 1;H 3 were similar, both being expressed in cells of the <b>root</b> vascular <b>cylinder</b> and both localized to the Golgi when expressed transiently in tobacco cells. When grown in Zn-free medium, pho 1;h 3 mutant plants displayed higher Pi contents in the shoots than wild-type plants. This was, however, not observed in a pho 1 pho 1;h 3 double mutant, suggesting that PHO 1;H 3 restricts root-to-shoot Pi transfer requiring PHO 1 function for Pi homeostasis in response to Zn deficiency...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims Orobanche species {{represent}} major constraints to {{crop production}} {{in many parts}} of the world as they reduce yield and alter root/shoot allometry. Although much is known about the histology and effect of Orobanche spp. on susceptible hosts, less is known about the basis of host resistance to these parasites. In this work, histological aspects related to the resistance of some legumes to Orobanche crenata have been investigated in order to determine which types of resistance responses are involved in the unsuccessful penetration of O. crenata. - Methods Samples of resistance reactions against O. crenata on different genotypes of resistant legumes were collected. The samples were fixed, sectioned and stained using different procedures. Sections were observed using a transmission light microscope and by epi-fluorescence. - Key Results Lignification of endodermal and pericycle host cells seems to prevent parasite intrusion into the <b>root</b> vascular <b>cylinder</b> at early infection stages. But in other cases, established tubercles became necrotic and died. Contrary to some previous studies, it was found that darkening at the infection site in these latter cases does not correspond to death of host tissues, but to the secretion of substances that fill the apoplast in the host–parasite interface and in much of the infected host tissues. The secretions block neighbouring host vessels. This may interfere with the nutrient flux between host and parasite, and may lead to necrosis and death of the developing parasite. - Conclusions The unsuccessful penetration of O. crenata seedlings into legume roots cannot be attributed to cell death in the host. It seems to be associated with lignification of host endodermis and pericycle cells at the penetration site. The accumulation of secretions at the infection site, may lead to the activation of xylem occlusion, another defence mechanism, which may cause further necrosis of established tubercles. 8 pages, 3 figuresPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Chlordecone, one of {{the most}} {{persistent}} organochlorine pesticides, was applied between 1972 and 1993 in banana fields in the French West Indies, which results in long-term pollution of soils and contamination of waters, aquatic biota, and crops. As human exposure to chlordecone is mainly due to food contamination, early research was focused on chlordecone transfer to crops. Field trials were conducted to investigate chlordecone contamination of yam, sweet potato, turnip, and radish grown on a Ferralic Nitisol polluted by chlordecone. We also carried out trials on yam, courgette, and tomato under greenhouse conditions with homogenized Andosol and Nitisol, polluted by chlordecone to various extents. Our results indicated that i) all tubers were contaminated in accordance with the chlordecone content of the soils; ii) the plant contamination capacity of the Nitisol was greater than that of the Andosol; and iii) whatever the soil type, tuber contamination was related to the soil volumetric content of dissolved chlordecone. Nevertheless, no tubers showed sufficient chlordecone uptake for efficient soil decontamination by means of plant extraction. Soil contact accounted for most of the root crop contamination, which was inversely proportional to the tuber size. Internal transfer might also increase root crop contamination when the <b>root</b> central <b>cylinder</b> contained raw sap flow, {{as in the case of}} turnip or radish. Courgette fruits showed high contamination without soil contact. Thus, further research is needed to explore the pattern of both below- and aboveground plant chlordecone contamination and assess the hypothesis of its correlation with sap flow. Finally, we used our results to build a decisionmaking tool for farmers, relating soil pollution with the maximal contamination of the harvested organs to predict crop contamination and thus assisting farmers in making crop choices at planting in order to conform with the European Union's regulations.

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana PHO 1 is {{primarily}} {{expressed in the}} <b>root</b> vascular <b>cylinder</b> and {{is involved in the}} transfer of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from roots to shoots. To analyze the role of PHO 1 in transport of Pi, we have generated transgenic plants expressing PHO 1 in ectopic A. thaliana tissues using an estradiol-inducible promoter. Leaves treated with estradiol showed strong PHO 1 expression, leading to detectable accumulation of PHO 1 protein. Estradiol-mediated induction of PHO 1 in leaves from soil-grown plants, in leaves and roots of plants grown in liquid culture, or in leaf mesophyll protoplasts, was all accompanied by the specific release of Pi to the extracellular medium as early as 2 – 3 h after addition of estradiol. Net Pi export triggered by PHO 1 induction was enhanced by high extracellular Pi and weakly inhibited by the proton-ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Expression of a PHO 1 -GFP construct complementing the pho 1 mutant revealed GFP expression in punctate structures in the pericycle cells but no fluorescence at the plasma membrane. When expressed in onion epidermal cells or in tobacco mesophyll cells, PHO 1 -GFP was associated with similar punctate structures that co-localized with the Golgi/trans-Golgi network and uncharacterized vesicles. However, PHO 1 -GFP could be partially relocated to the plasma membrane in leaves infiltrated with a high-phosphate solution. Together, these results show that PHO 1 can trigger Pi export in ectopic plant cells, strongly indicating that PHO 1 is itself a Pi exporter. Interestingly, PHO 1 -mediated Pi export was associated with its localization to the Golgi and trans-Golgi networks, revealing a role for these organelles in Pi transport. A.
