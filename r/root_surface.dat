5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the <b>root</b> <b>surface</b> and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E

We examined seed and soil fungi, their sensitivity to methanol extracts of theseeds, the fungi on <b>root</b> <b>surfaces</b> of seedlings grown in Kanuma pumice (a model mineralsoil) and nursery soil, {{and the frequency}} at which each fungus was detected on the seedlingroot surface. We calculated correlation coefficients between fungal detection frequency onroot surfaces and fungal sensitivity to seed extracts. We also isolated from the seeds theantifungal compound totarol that selected for fungi on <b>root</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Species of Alternaria,Cladosporium, Pestalotiopsis, and Phomopsis were the most frequently isolated fungi fromseeds. Mortierella and Mucor were the dominant fungi isolated from Kanuma pumice,whereas Umbelopsis and Trichoderma were the main fungi isolated from nursery soil. Alternaria, Cladosporium, Mortierella, Pestalotiopsis, and Phomopsis were the dominantfungi isolated from <b>root</b> <b>surfaces</b> of seedlings grown in Kanuma pumice, and Alternaria,Cladosporium, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, and Trichoderma were the main root-surfacefungi isolated from seedlings grown in nursery soil.

25|$|Acellular {{cementum}} forms first. The cementoblasts {{differentiate from}} follicular cells, {{which can only}} reach {{the surface of the}} tooth's root once Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath (HERS) has begun to deteriorate. The cementoblasts secrete fine collagen fibrils along the <b>root</b> <b>surface</b> at right angles before migrating away from the tooth. As the cementoblasts move, more collagen is deposited to lengthen and thicken the bundles of fibers. Noncollagenous proteins, such as bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, are also secreted. Acellular cementum contains a secreted matrix of proteins and fibers. As mineralization takes place, the cementoblasts move away from the cementum, and the fibers left along the surface eventually join the forming periodontal ligaments.|$|E

These polyps are made of cementum in both species, but in human teeth, the protrusions are {{located on the}} outside of the root, while in whales the nodule is located on the inside of the pulp chamber. While the roots of human teeth are made of cementum on the outer surface, whales have cementum on the entire surface of the tooth with a very small layer of enamel at the tip. This small enamel layer is only seen in older whales where the cementum has been worn away to show the underlying enamel.|$|E
2500|$|The carious {{process can}} begin {{within days of}} a tooth's erupting into the mouth if the diet is {{sufficiently}} rich in suitable carbohydrates. Evidence suggests that the introduction of fluoride treatments has slowed the process. [...] Proximal caries take an average of four years to pass through enamel in permanent teeth. [...] Because the cementum enveloping the <b>root</b> <b>surface</b> {{is not nearly as}} durable as the enamel encasing the crown, root caries tends to progress much more rapidly than decay on other surfaces. [...] The progression and loss of mineralization on the <b>root</b> <b>surface</b> is 2.5 times faster than caries in enamel. [...] In very severe cases where oral hygiene is very poor and where the diet is very rich in fermentable carbohydrates, caries may cause cavities within months of tooth eruption.

2500|$|The use {{of tobacco}} may also {{increase}} the risk for caries formation. Some brands of smokeless tobacco contain high sugar content, increasing susceptibility to caries. [...] Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for periodontal disease, which can cause the gingiva to recede. [...] As the gingiva loses attachment to the teeth due to gingival recession, the <b>root</b> <b>surface</b> becomes more visible in the mouth. [...] If this occurs, root caries is a concern since the cementum covering the roots of teeth is more easily demineralized by acids than enamel.

Aims: To evaluate the neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) lasers effects on <b>root</b> <b>surfaces</b> affected by periodontal disease and compare this treatment with scaling and root planning (SRP) in terms of fibroblast attachment. Materials and Methods: A sample of 30 single-rooted human teeth extracted because of advanced periodontal disease was used in this study. Sixty specimens obtained by longitudinal sectioning were randomly divided in three groups. Group A control (untreated); Group B SRP; Group C laser (Nd: YAG) and ultrasonic scaling. All specimens were incubated with fibroblast suspension and then fixed and observed under scanning electron microscope. Results: With a median of 8, the control group (Group A) exhibited the least number of total fibroblasts among all the three groups. The laser and scaling - treated group (Group C) showed the highest number of fibroblasts (median = 49, mean ± standard deviation [SD] = 48. 28 ± 17. 18), followed by SRP only (Group B, median = 22, mean ± SD = 22. 24 ± 8. 67).

2500|$|The {{treatment}} for permanent teeth consists of replantation, immediately if possible. Deciduous teeth {{should not be}} replanted due {{to the risk of}} damaging the permanent tooth germ. Immediate replantation ensures the best possible prognosis but is not always possible since more serious injuries may be present. Studies have shown that teeth that are protected in a physiologically ideal media can be replanted within 15 minutes to one hour after the accident with good prognosis. The success of delayed replantation depends on the vitality of the cells remaining on the <b>root</b> <b>surface.</b> In normal conditions, a tooth is connected to the socket by means of the periodontal ligament. When a tooth is knocked out, that ligament stretches and splits in half. Maintaining the vitality of the cells that remain attached to the <b>root</b> <b>surface</b> is the key to success following replantation. Years ago, it was thought that the key to maintaining root cell vitality was keeping the knocked-out tooth wet, thus giving rise to storage media recommendations such as water, the mouth and milk. Recent research has shown that one of the key elements for maintaining vitality is storing the tooth in an environment that closely resembles the original socket environment. This environment is one that has the proper [...] osmolality (cell pressure), pH, nutritional metabolites and glucose. There are scientifically designed storage media that provide this environment. These storage media are now available in retail products. Use of devices that incorporate the ideal storage media and protective apparatuses have increased the success rate of replanted knocked-out teeth to over 90% when used within sixty minutes of the accident.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rhizosphere}} is a zone immediately {{next to the}} <b>root</b> <b>surface</b> {{with its}} neighboring soil. In this zone there is a close interaction between the plant and microorganisms. Roots continuously release substances, or exudates, into the soil. These exudates include sugars, amino acids, vitamins, long chain carbohydrates, enzymes and lysates which are released when roots cells break. The amount of carbon lost as exudates varies considerably between plant species. It has been demonstrated that up to 20% of carbon acquired by photosynthesis is released into the soil as root exudates. These exudates are decomposed primarily by bacteria. These bacteria will respire the carbon compounds through the TCA cycle; however, fermentation is also present. This {{is due to the}} lack of oxygen due to greater oxygen consumption by the root as compared to the bulk soil, soil at a greater distance from the root. [...] Another important organism in the rhizosphere are root-infecting fungi or mycorrhizae. These fungi increase the surface area of the plant root and allow the root to encounter and acquire a greater amount of soil nutrients necessary for plant growth. In return for this benefit, the plant will transfer sugars to the fungi. The fungi will respire these sugars for energy thereby increasing soil respiration. Fungi, along with bacteria and soil animals, also play a large role in the decomposition of litter and soil organic matter.|$|E
