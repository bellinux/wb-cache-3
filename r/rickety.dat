5|$|Traditional dances {{revolve around}} stylized {{courtship}} between {{a male and}} female dancer, known as the kavalyé and danm respectively. The bélé song-dances include the bélé soté, bélé priòrité, bélé djouba, bélé contredanse, bélé <b>rickety</b> and bélé pitjé.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} are interconnected through steps and stairways made in rocks. There are a few <b>rickety</b> wooden bridges along the paths and stairways also to cross over. The temple {{at the highest level}} has a frieze of Buddha. Each building has a balcony, which provides lovely views of the scenic Paro valley down below. The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|E
5|$|Following Kahaanis success, Kolkata {{became a}} {{preferred}} destination for Bollywood filmmakers. They felt the landscapes of Mumbai and Delhi were overused for several decades, while Kolkata retained its unique visuals such as metro trains, <b>rickety</b> trams, hand-pulled rickshaws, dingy bylanes, palatial mansions, dilapidated houses of North Kolkata, roadside eateries, ghats of river Ganga, British-era buildings, restaurants and iconic structures and areas including Howrah Bridge, Kalighat Temple, Nakhoda Mosque, Kumortuli idol-making district and Victoria Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as <b>rickety</b> and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, {{while the rest}} stayed with family or friends. Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in <b>rickety</b> houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights. The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E
5|$|The family finds {{work in a}} fish-gutting {{factory in}} Osaka, where they notice a TV game show called The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show. They go on it, telling the host Wink that they wish for plane tickets to Springfield. In order to get them, they go through {{physical}} torture (particularly Homer), then must pick them up from a <b>rickety</b> bridge over an active volcano. Lisa is {{able to get the}} tickets, but Wink breaks the bridge and the whole family falls into the volcano, which is actually orangeade with lots of wasabi added. As the Simpsons leave Japan, their plane is briefly confronted by four giant monsters – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and Rodan before it flies off on the journey to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two <b>rickety</b> jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E
5|$|Many more {{hotels and}} {{restaurants}} were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle, and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a <b>rickety</b> and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides {{to make way for}} a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations, and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died on July 24, 1931 from uremia. His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the G.A. Boeckling steamboat were lowered to half mast.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} shed was a <b>rickety</b> wooden {{structure with}} walls of Kentish weatherboarding and a tin roof. It fell into hopeless disrepair {{and was replaced}} in stages with a more substantial structure in corrugated asbestos with five brick smoke vents which was finished in 1937. This was pulled down by British Railways at an unknown date by 1953.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon after 1799 {{paid for}} his {{expensive}} wars by multiple means, starting with the modernisation of the <b>rickety</b> financial system. He conscripted soldiers at low wages, raised taxes, placed large-scale loans, sold lands formerly owned by the Catholic Church, sold Louisiana to the United States, plundered conquered areas and seized food supplies, and levied requisitions on countries he controlled, such as Italy.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{is said to}} have disliked {{his younger}} brother, Charles, and to have teased him, {{although}} this derives from only one anecdote: when Charles was nine years of age, Henry snatched the hat off a bishop {{and put it on the}} younger child's head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly <b>rickety</b> legs. Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.|$|E
25|$|After Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's command left Lookout Mountain {{at about}} 10 a.m. and moved east, they {{encountered}} a significant obstacle. The bridges across Chattanooga Creek, {{about a mile}} from Rossville Gap, had been burned by the Confederates as they withdrew the night before and the creek was running high. Brig. Gen. Peter Joseph Osterhaus assigned a 70-man pioneer unit to start rebuilding one bridge while men of the 27th Missouri created a <b>rickety</b> footbridge and began crossing one by one. Hooker decided to leave his guns and wagons behind so that all of his infantry could cross first, but his advance was delayed about three hours and the bulk of his force did not reach Rossville Gap until 3:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by <b>rickety</b> bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} {{emerges from}} the passage and teeters {{on the edge of}} a vast pit of lava. Another transport is seen attempting to cross a <b>rickety</b> rope bridge which spans the pit under a crumbling ceiling. On the far side of the cavern, there is a 45-foot-tall stone face of Mara, that periodically shoots green rays at both transports, causing flames to erupt from where the beam hits. Formerly, there was an effect in place within this scene where the light beams would hit the ceiling, causing dyed ice cubes to rain down, simulating the rubble of the caving temple, but it was removed. The light beams have now been redirected away from the former effect, however, the sound effect for the rubble still plays upon entering the room. The transport turns left and enters catacombs of false pathways lined with skeletons, some of which pop out toward the guests.|$|E
25|$|A {{field marshal}} {{in the service}} of Portugal, Beresford had {{available}} the 2nd Division, the 4th Division, Major General John Hamilton's Portuguese Division, and General Robert Ballard Long's cavalry. If he could have invested Badajoz at the end of March, Beresford might have found the defenses of the fortress in poor shape. However, problems arose to delay the operation until the French effected repairs. First, the 4th Division was immobilized by a lack of shoes and had to wait for a new shipment from Lisbon. Next, ample bridging material was supposed to be available at the Portuguese fortress of Elvas, but the number of pontoons proved inadequate to span the Guadiana River. The military engineers improvised a bridge, but it was immediately washed out by a flood on 4 April. A battalion was ferried across on the 5th, and starting on 6 April, the Allied corps began slowly filing across the Guadiana on a <b>rickety</b> structure. Luckily, for the Allies, the French did not contest the crossing. Mortier had been recalled and his replacement Latour-Maubourg lacked his strategic insight.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after setting}} off, the group {{camp for the}} night. Johann decides to take first watch. When Debelzaq comes to relieve him of the watch, Johann says how much she remind him of his dead daughter, {{then goes on to}} speak of the {{politics}} of her trial, and how the Church cannot have her not be guilty. Johann decides to give up the mission and goes to convince the others to do the same, leaving Anna alone with Debelzaq. Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with Debelzaq. She attacks him and grabs his key to the cage, then escapes, fleeing toward a nearby village. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Eckhart has visions of his dead daughter. Chasing the visions, he impales himself on Kay's sword and dies. When they recapture her, the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzaq. However the group gradually becomes less trusting of her. They cross a <b>rickety</b> rope bridge, where Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand, showing unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest called Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so that the group can go home, only to be stopped by the others. Anna appears to summon monstrous wolves, which chase the group and kill Hagamar. An enraged Behmen tries to kill Anna, but is stopped by Debelzaq and Felson, who point out that the monastery is in sight.|$|E
500|$|The river {{front was}} {{important}} {{in the development of}} the Great Fire. The Thames offered water for firefighting and the chance of escape by boat, but the poorer districts along the riverfront had stores and cellars of combustibles which increased the fire risk. All along the wharves, the <b>rickety</b> wooden tenements and tar paper shacks of the poor were shoehorned amongst [...] "old paper buildings and the most combustible matter of tarr, pitch, hemp, rosen, and flax which was all layd up thereabouts." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{documentary}} film, Moscow Strikes Back, ( [...] , [...] "Rout of the German Troops near Moscow"), {{was made}} during the battle and rapidly released in the Soviet Union. It was taken to America and shown at the Globe in New York in August 1942. The New York Times reviewer commented that [...] "The savagery of that retreat is a spectacle to stun the mind." [...] As well as the Moscow parade and battle scenes, the film included images of German atrocities committed during the occupation, [...] "the naked and slaughtered children stretched out in ghastly rows, the youths dangling limply in the cold from gallows that were <b>rickety,</b> but strong enough." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ellen's mother, {{upon the}} girl's return {{home on a}} <b>rickety</b> cart, {{she began to feel}} drowsy and had several seizures. Hayman states that it was two days after her {{discharge}} that the seizures occurred. He visited Ellen at her home, where he was told that the previous night, March17, Ellen had endured a series of such attacks, after which she turned to lie [...] "on her left side, with her hand under her head, and the lower extremities drawn upwards". It was in this position that—her mother maintained—Ellen remained for the duration of her sleep. Hayman visited Ellen many times {{over the next few years}} and he later said that he [...] "never found her otherwise".|$|E
500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reviewed}} {{a host of}} Westerns from 1992 and 1993 {{and said}} that Brisco was [...] "the most sheer fun of the bunch", calling it [...] "a period piece with slick production values and a mix of drama and humor, fast pace and high camp". In {{an article on the}} 1993 television season, the Toronto Stars Greg Quill wrote that Brisco was a program that represented [...] "American TV craft at the top of its form". In contrast, Elvis Mitchell of Spin magazine gave Brisco a scathing review, calling the show's premise a [...] "tedious... <b>rickety</b> gimmick". Mitchell acknowledged the show's [...] "quick reflexes", but said the humor was [...] "uncomfortable" [...] with a [...] "cynical quickness". He added, [...] "Brisco County relieves us of the burden of laughing. It spends too much time looking at itself in the mirror, admiring its own adorable dimpled half-smile." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode 8 out of 10, praising Gatiss's script which [...] "moved the drama and horror {{straight}} into the miniaturised heart of a <b>rickety</b> creepy dolls house, {{with a set of}} villains that— while never as memorable or scary as their look may suggest— used sound design to its most effective". He said that the main story [...] "soared", though the sidelined Amy and Rory left [...] "little impact" [...] in relation to the Doctor, George, and Alex. Russell Lewin of SFX gave [...] "Night Terrors" [...] three and a half out of five stars, saying that it had [...] "many great things going for it but perhaps hasn't quite got that little extra something that would have turned it into a classic" [...] and that nothing seemed especially unexpected. However, he praised the shots of the doll house and apartment buildings, the sound, dolls, the acting of Matt Smith and Daniel Mays, and the idea of George being alien who created the reality.|$|E
500|$|The Know Nothing {{convention}} in October 1854 chose Gardner as its gubernatorial candidate, {{in part because}} his stand on slavery was not as radical as that of Republican candidate Henry Wilson, who was also seeking Know Nothing support. [...] Wilson eventually {{made a deal with}} the Know Nothings, withdrawing from the race at the last moment in exchange for Know Nothing support in a United States Senate bid. [...] The campaign was relatively sedate, because both the Whigs and Democrats did not organize large-scale events. The larger parties may have been concerned that rallies would be poorly attended due to defections to the Know Nothings. [...] The aristocratic Whigs fielded incumbent governor Emory Washburn to stand for reelection. [...] They were particularly dismissive of the Know Nothings: one commentator described the Know Nothing ticket as [...] " [...] ministers, lying toothpullers, and buggering priests" [...] who were led by [...] "that <b>rickety</b> vermin of a Henry J. Gardner." [...] Gardner was, however, optimistic, warning one journalist that he would win by a large majority. [...] The election was a landslide: Gardner won 79% of the vote, and the state legislature and Congressional delegation were almost entirely populated by Know Nothings.|$|E
500|$|Michael Sragow of Orange County Register {{gave the}} film grade C, {{saying that the}} film is [...] "a coarse, <b>rickety</b> comedy." [...] Richard Corliss wrote for Time {{magazine}} that [...] "All three women are less watchable and amusing than Nicki Minaj as Carly's legal assistant Lydia." [...] Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that the film is [...] "so dumb, lazy, clumsily assembled and unoriginal, it could crush any actor forced to execute its leaden slapstick gags and mouth its crude, humorless dialogue." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews wondered, [...] "Has it come to this for director Nick Cassavetes?", comparing his career negatively to that of his father, John Cassavetes. Berardinelli elaborated, [...] "what a comedown to find him in charge of such an unfocused, unfunny, scatologically-obsessed 'comedy.'" [...] Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.Com gave the film two out of four stars and said, [...] "While [...] "The Other Woman" [...] raises some thoughtful questions about independence, identity {{and the importance of}} sisterhood, ultimately it would rather poop on them and then throw them through a window in hopes of the getting the big laugh." [...] Wesley Morris of Grantland said, [...] "No one knows which takes are funny and which aren't. More than once, all three women, especially poor Upton, are caught looking like they don't know what they're doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Behind Yuhuatai the 88th Division had {{stationed}} its barely trained {{new recruits}} atop Nanking's Zhonghua Gate. The Japanese had already tried {{the previous night}} to infiltrate a [...] "suicide squadron" [...] bearing explosive picric acid up to this gate to blow a hole in it, but it {{got lost in the}} morning fog and failed to reach the wall. At noon on December 12 a team of just six Japanese soldiers made it across the moat in a small boat and succeeded in scaling the wall at Zhonghua Gate on a shaky bamboo ladder and raising the Japanese flag there. Five of them were killed by gunfire but the last man grabbed a Chinese machine gun and held the position singlehandedly. Soon after another Japanese team set a fire in front of the gate to create a smokescreen. By 5:00 pm more and more Japanese troops were crossing the moat and swarming Zhonghua Gate by fording makeshift bridges so <b>rickety</b> their engineers had to hold them aloft with their own bodies, {{and with the help of}} some well aimed Japanese artillery fire from atop Yuhuatai parts of the wall finally crumbled. Meanwhile, just west of Zhonghua Gate, other soldiers also of Japan's 10th Army had punched a hole through Chinese lines in the wetlands south of Shuixi Gate and were launching a violent drive on that gate with the support of a fleet of tanks.|$|E
500|$|Rick Massimo, {{reviewing}} the concert for The Providence Journal, wrote {{that as a}} musical theater, the Monster Ball was not that exciting, but [...] "that leaves the music, and when you lay two hours of her songs end-to-end, it's easy to see the vision, the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work." [...] Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise {{was impressed with the}} show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but [...] "always danceable". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir." [...] Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga [...] "may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart." [...] The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as [...] "one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [...] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul." [...] The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that [...] "it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to open your show doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on a <b>rickety</b> metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier." ...|$|E

[...] She asks Doc to help prevent Mickey's wife and her lover from having Mickey abducted and committed to an insane asylum.|$|E
2500|$|One visible {{effect of}} the {{depression}} was the advent of Hoovervilles, [...] which were ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small <b>rickety</b> wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in the shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens.The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the Democratic National Committee, who referred sardonically to President Herbert Hoover whose policies he blamed for the depression.|$|E
2500|$|According to British {{historian}} A. J. P. Taylor, {{writing in}} 1954, [...] "If {{the treaty of}} San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for [...] in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote {{at the end of}} 1878 'We shall set up a <b>rickety</b> sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Publishers Weekly {{commented that}} [...] "Poor grammar, weak imagery and <b>rickety</b> old plots {{dressed up as}} Matters of Import doom this series of novellas [...] Action focuses on uninspired tales of Caramon Majere's son Palin's quest to be a wizard and political unrest among the Elves, which threatens the possibility of hegemony. There's hardly any suspense since contrivances {{make it clear that}} the eventual victory will be by authorial fiat. Descriptions are repeated three or four times, often within paragraphs of each other--and little of it deserves close attention. For Dragon Lance game players, there is, of course, an appendix with game statistics and the like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there had}} been some missteps in Edwin Earhart's career up to that point, in 1907 his job as a claims officer for the Rock Island Railroad led to a {{transfer}} to Des Moines, Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10, Earhart saw her first aircraft at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Her father tried to interest her and her sister in taking a flight. One look at the <b>rickety</b> [...] "flivver" [...] was enough for Earhart, who promptly asked if they could go back to the merry-go-round. She later described the biplane as [...] "a thing of rusty wire and wood and not at all interesting".|$|E
2500|$|An {{unknown number}} of Palestinians, {{estimated}} in the hundreds or thousands, have tried to flee to Europe due to the conflict. The Palestinian rights group Adamir collected the names of 400 missing persons. In what was described by International Organization for Migration as the [...] "worst shipwreck in years", a boat carrying refugees was rammed by smugglers and capsized {{off the coast of}} Malta, resulting in the deaths of about 400 people. According to interviews with survivors, they paid smugglers between $2,000-$5,000 or used legal travel permits, to get to Egypt. One refugee who died had considered the boat to be <b>rickety</b> but told his father [...] "I have no life in Gaza anyway".|$|E
2500|$|The bridge {{spans the}} Duluth Ship Canal, which was put through the miles-long sand spit named Minnesota Point (commonly {{referred}} to as Park Point by locals) in 1870–71. [...] The natural mouth of the Saint Louis River is about seven miles (11km) farther southeast, and is split between Minnesota and Wisconsin. [...] Creating this gap in the tiny peninsula meant that residents {{who lived on the}} new island needed to have a way to get across. [...] Several transportation methods were tried, though they were complicated by the weather. [...] Ferries could work in the summer, but ice caused problems in colder months. [...] A swinging footbridge was used, but was considered rather <b>rickety</b> and unsafe.|$|E
