25|$|The Opatas are {{location}} {{in a number}} of communities in the center and northwest of the state, but have been disappearing as a distinct ethnicity. This group has lost its traditional rituals, and the language died out in the 1950s.

They were especially hostile to the Tohono O’odham, who they depreciatingly <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Papawi O’otham, or “bean people.” Today’s Opatas have completely adopted the Catholic religion with Isidore the Laboror as the ethnicity’s patron saint.|$|E
25|$|Brian did {{not free}} Ireland from a Norse (Viking) occupation, {{simply because it}} was never conquered by the Vikings. In {{the last decade of}} the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, {{beginning}} in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, and Cork. Within only a few generations, the Norse citizens of these cities had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Hiberno-Norse.|$|E

500|$|While {{the near}} lifelike {{appearance}} {{of the characters in}} the film was well received, some commentators felt the character renderings fell into the trap that many robotics scientists <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] "uncanny valley".

John Mangan from The Age cited the film as an example of this phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|On April 21, 2017 it was {{announced}} that a second engrossed copy had been discovered in an archive in Sussex, England. [...] Named by its finders the [...] "Sussex Declaration", it differs from the National Archives copy (which the finders <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Matlack Declaration") in that the signatures on it are not grouped by States. [...] How it came to be in England is not yet known, but the finders believe that the randomness of the signatures points to an origin with signatory James Wilson, who had argued strongly that the Declaration was made not by the States but by the whole people.|$|E

500|$|The album's title {{alludes to}} the doggy style sex {{position}} and is {{a reference to the}} musician's name. The artwork, which was done by artist Joe Cool, represents the themes covered in the album and the style of implementation of those ideas. Some critics believe the artwork portrays a woman merely as a hole to be filled by the man, which they believe adheres to the narcissistic and sexist lyrical themes Snoop Dogg covers. In this interpretation, the cover art and lyrics convey what they <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> self-indulgent [...] "gangsta" [...] lifestyle, drugs, cars, sex, and money. The artwork uses several quotes from the 1982 George Clinton single [...] "Atomic Dog".

[...] and [...] "Nuttin' but da dogg in me".|$|E

She then attends a royal announcement by Tommen in the throne room, but is denied standing by his side by Kevan Lannister, her uncle and Hand of the King. Tommen then announces the date that Cersei and Loras' trials will be held, and that, in consultation with the High Sparrow, he has decided to end the practice of trial by combat as a means of resolving conflicts. The prospect of a trial by seven septons clearly worries Cersei. Qyburn then reports to Cersei about the [...] "rumor" [...] that she ordered him to investigate, and he remarks that it is [...] "more, much more".|$|E
