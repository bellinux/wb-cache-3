5|$|A print from Sheila's right <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> {{was found}} {{on the right side of}} the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> of his left hand. The surgery lasted {{for more than three}} hours and was performed under regional anesthesia. This procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason he had a hand and finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's {{comparatively}} {{low expectations}} when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team {{advanced to the}} finals; Kahn conceded only three goals {{in the course of}} the competition, two of which were in the Final. Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right <b>ring</b> <b>finger,</b> Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to the feet of striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute. Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone and disappointed in his goal; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake.|$|E

5|$|In November 1978, Armstrong {{was working}} at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio. As he jumped off {{of the back of}} his grain truck, his wedding ring got caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's <b>ring</b> <b>finger.</b> He {{collected}} the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. In February 1991, a year after his father had died, and nine months {{after the death of his}} mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, 2016, Gasol {{signed with}} the San Antonio Spurs. On November 11, 2016, he had season highs with 21 points and six assists in a 96–86 win over the Detroit Pistons. On January 19, 2017, he was ruled out indefinitely after {{breaking}} his left <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> during pregame warmups earlier that night. He underwent surgery the following day to repair a fracture of his left fourth metacarpal. On February 24, 2017, in a 105–97 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, Gasol had 17 points and 11 rebounds off the bench in his return from a 15-game absence because of the finger injury. On April 12, 2017, Gasol scored 13 points to reach 20,000 career points in a 101–97 regular-season finale loss against the Utah Jazz, becoming the second European player to reach the mark after Dirk Nowitzki.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's <b>ring</b> <b>finger.</b> Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E

25|$|Gordon {{appeared}} in all 41 {{games for the}} Pelicans to begin the 2015–16 season, starting in 40 of them and logging at least 15 minutes in every game. On January 19, 2016, he sustained a hand injury midway through {{the third quarter of}} New Orleans' 114–99 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Following the game, a fractured bone in the <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> of his shooting hand was found. The next day, he underwent successful surgery to repair his fractured right <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> and was subsequently ruled out for four to six weeks. He returned to action on February 27 against the Minnesota Timberwolves after missing 16 games. In 34 minutes of action, he scored an equal game-high 31 points in a 112–110 loss to the Timberwolves. After re-injuring his right <b>ring</b> <b>finger</b> on March 5, he underwent another round of surgery, which ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|There is {{research}} {{evidence that}} the digit ratio {{of the length of}} the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and <b>ring</b> <b>finger)</b> is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long <b>ring</b> <b>finger)</b> towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.|$|E

25|$|People with CTS {{experience}} numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in {{the thumb}} and fingers, {{in particular the}} index and middle fingers and radial half of the <b>ring</b> <b>finger,</b> because these receive their sensory and motor function (muscle control) from the median nerve.
