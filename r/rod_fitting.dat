40|$|We {{report the}} results of a Surface X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD) study of Fe nanostructured films depositedon c(2 × 2) -N/Cu(100) at room {{temperature}} (RT), with Fe coverage ΘFe= 0. 5 ML and ΘFe= 1 ML. Thec(2 × 2) -N/Cu(100) surface is an example of self-organised system, {{that can be used for}} growth of arraysof metal nano-islands and organic molecules assemblies. We chose two different values of N coverage,ΘN= 0. 3 ML and ΘN= 0. 5 ML, the second value corresponding to N saturation. We monitored the presenceof surface diffraction peaks in hk scans and we performed Crystal Truncation Rods (CTR) analysiswith <b>ROD</b> <b>fitting</b> programme. In the case of ΘN= 0. 5 ML, i. e. at saturation coverage, the CTR could be fittedwith one surface domain with p 4 gm(2 × 2) symmetry. In the surface cell adopted, N atoms occupy fourfoldhollow sites, with Fe (intermixed with Cu) giving rise to a “clock” reconstruction previously observedon iron nitride films obtained by co-deposition and annealing. This result is an indirect confirmation of Nsurface segregation on top of the Fe films, occurring during the growth at RT. When subsaturation N coverage(ΘN= 0. 3 ML) is used as a substrate for Fe deposition, the best results could be obtained with amodel where two surface domains are present: the first one corresponds to a surface cell with Fe sittingin four-fold hollow sites on bare Cu areas, with possible interdiffusion in the second lattice. The seconddomain is assigned to growth of Fe on the N-covered square islands occurring once the bare Cu areasare fully covered. The SXRD analysis on N-covered surface domains shows that the mechanism of reconstructionand of N segregation on top layer is already active at RT for all N-coverage values...|$|E

40|$|The SINQ Target Irradiation Program (STIP) {{has been}} {{developed}} at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) during the last twenty years. It is aimed to analyze the radiation damage induced by spallation reactions in different structural materials. It is also providing relevant data for developing future spallation sources as well as advanced spallation targets. STIP VI was conducted in SINQ Target 9 during 2011 / 2012 receiving a total proton charge of 13. 16 Ah. The Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended code (MCNPX) is used for implementing the model and performing the simulation to obtain the proton and neutron fluences {{as well as the}} energy deposition in the different points of interest. Afterwards, this information is used for calculating the displacement per atom (dpa) plus the Helium and Hydrogen production in atomic parts per million (appm). The results will contribute to understand the irradiation effect in different structural materials. It will also be useful for comparing it with the real radiation damage measurements of the irradiated materials after its cool down period. The target mainly consists of the AlMg 3 inverted semi-sphere Beam Entrance Window (BEW) and the cylindrical Rod Container Box (RCB) which keeps inside 306 <b>rods</b> <b>fitting</b> 36 rows. There is also the Safety Hull Tube (SHT), made of AlMg 3, which consists of a double cylinder walls surrounding the RCB and linked to the inverted BEW at the bottom. The source definition is implemented in the MCNPX input file from the gamma mapping performed at the irradiated Target 9. The material specification of the specimen rods is implemented by taking its average composition, assuming a uniform distribution. The maximum proton flux obtained at the inverted BEW is 1. 75 x 1014 p/(cm 2 ·s·mA). The maximum proton fluence in the target is obtained in Row 0 becoming 8. 33 x 1025 p/m 2. The maximum neutron fluence is obtained in Row 8 with a value of 1. 99 x 1026 n/m 2, which in flux units stands for 4. 19 x 1014 n/(cm 2 ·s·mA). Regarding the SHT, the maximum proton flux escaping from the target is obtained above Row 36 with a value of 5. 99 x 1011 p/(cm 2 ·s·mA) and the maximum neutron flux is escaping around the middle part of the target with a value of 1. 39 x 1014 n/(cm 2 ·s·mA). The maximum energy deposition in Zircaloy- 2 cladding tubes is obtained in the center rod placed in Row 2 with a value of 400. 32 W/(cm 3 ·mA). Page 2 The irradiation parameters have been calculated by multiplying the proton and neutron fluence with its corresponding material cross section data. The results obtained {{at the center of the}} inverted BEW are 8. 85 dpa, 2447 appm He and 4854 appm H. For the SHT, the maximum values of the irradiation parameters are obtained around the middle part of the target with the following values: 3. 14 dpa, 17. 63 appm He and 71. 64 appm H. Finally, the maximum displacement per atom in the specimen rods is obtained for Zircaloy- 2 in Rod 1, placed in Row 2, with a value of 72. 07 dpa and the maximum Helium & Hydrogen concentration are obtained for Tantalum in Rod A, placed in Row 1, with the following values: 3629 appm He and 17418 appm H...|$|R
40|$|The {{case-hardening}} process modifies the near-surface permeability and conductivity of steel, as can {{be observed}} through changes in alternating current potential drop (ACPD) along a rod. In order to evaluate case depth of case hardened steel rods, analytical expressions are derived for the alternating current potential drop {{on the surface of}} a homogeneous rod, a two-layered and a three-layered <b>rod.</b> By <b>fitting</b> model results to multi-frequency ACPD experimental data, estimates of conductivity, permeability and case depth are found. Although the estimated case depth by the two-layer model is in reasonable agreement with the effective case depth from the hardness profile, it is consistently higher than the effective case depth. This {{led to the development of}} the three-layer model. It is anticipated that the new three-layered model will improve the results and thus makes the ACPD method a novel technique in nondestructive measurement of case depth.;Calculations of eddy currents are performed for a two-layer conducting rod of finite length excited by a coaxial circular coil carrying an alternating current. By truncating the solution region to a finite length in the axial direction, the magnetic vector potential can be expressed as a series expansion of orthogonal eigenfunctions instead of as a Fourier integral. Closed-form expressions are derived for the electromagnetic field in the presence of a finite a two-layer rod and conductive tube. The results are in very good agreement with those obtained by using a 2 D finite element code.;A new probe technology is designed which has an enhanced flaw detection capability and can reduce inspection time through the use of multiple magnetic field sensing elements. A preliminary Hall array probe has been built and test with eight individual Hall sensor ICs and a racetrack coil. Electronic hardware is developed to interface the probes to an oscilloscope or an eddy current instrument. To achieve high spatial resolution and to limit the overall probe size, high-sensitivity Hall sensor arrays were fabricated directly on a wafer using photolithography techniques and then mounted in their unencapsulated form. The electronic hardware is updated to interface the new probes to a computer...|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} devoted to the {{development}} of novel insoluble anodes for copper electrowinning and electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) production. The anodes are made of titanium-lead composite material produced by techniques of powder metallurgy, compaction of titanium powder, sintering and subsequent lead infiltration. The titanium-lead anode combines beneficial electrochemical behavior of a lead anode with high mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of a titanium anode. In the titanium-lead anode, the titanium stabilizes the lead, preventing it from spalling, and the lead sheathes the titanium, protecting it from passivation. Interconnections between manufacturing process, structure, composition and properties of the titanium-lead composite material were investigated. The material containing 20 - 30 vol. % of lead had optimal combination of mechanical and electrochemical properties. Optimal process parameters to manufacture the anodes were identified. Prototypes having optimized composition and structure were produced for testing in operating conditions of copper electrowinning and EMD production. Bench-scale, mini-pilot scale and pilot scale tests were performed. The test anodes were of both a plate design and a flow-through cylindrical design. The cylindrical anodes were composed of cylinders containing titanium inner <b>rods</b> and <b>fitting</b> over titanium-lead bushings. The cylindrical design allows the electrolyte to flow through the anode, which enhances diffusion of the electrolyte reactants. The cylindrical anodes demonstrate higher mass transport capabilities and increased electrical efficiency compared to the plate anodes. Copper electrowinning represents the primary target market for the titanium-lead anode. A full-size cylindrical anode performance in copper electrowinning conditions was monitored over a year. The test anode to cathode voltage was stable in the 1. 8 to 2. 0 volt range. Copper cathode morphology was very smooth and uniform. There was no measurable anode weight loss during this time period. Quantitative chemical analysis of the anode surface showed that the lead content after testing remained at its initial level. No lead dissolution or transfer from the anode to the product occurred. A key benefit of the titanium-lead anode design is that cobalt additions to copper electrolyte should be eliminated. Cobalt is added to the electrolyte to help stabilize the lead oxide surface of conventional lead anodes. The presence of the titanium intimately mixed with the lead should eliminate the need for cobalt stabilization of the lead surface. The anode should last twice as long as the conventional lead anode. Energy savings should be achieved due to minimizing and stabilizing the anode-cathode distance in the electrowinning cells. The anode is easily substitutable into existing tankhouses without a rectifier change. The copper electrowinning test data indicate that the titanium-lead anode is a good candidate for further testing as a possible replacement for a conventional lead anode. A key consideration is the cost. Titanium costs have increased. One of the ways to get the anode cost down is manufacturing the anodes with fewer cylinders. Additional prototypes having different number of cylinders were constructed for a long-term commercial testing in a circuit without cobalt. The objective of the testing is to evaluate the need for cobalt, investigate the effect of decreasing the number of cylinders on the anode performance, and to optimize further the anode design {{in order to meet the}} operating requirements, minimize the voltage, maximize the life of the anode, and to balance this against a reasonable cost for the anode. It is anticipated that after testing of the additional prototypes, a whole cell commercial test will be conducted to complete evaluation of the titanium-lead anode costs/benefits...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the life}} span of a {{structure}} it may become necessary to retrofit, or strengthen certain components or elements. This may be due to construction errors, changes in use and occupancy, or changes due to material deterioration or damage. Slab-column connections in flat slab structures might need to be strengthened for punching shear. Using steel shear bolts to strengthen connections for punching shear is a new technique used for retrofit that was developed at the University of Waterloo. If the retrofitted part of the structure is exposed to the atmosphere, or to chemicals such as deicing salts, the steel can corrode, thus furthering to damage the structure. Non-corrosive materials that can replace the steel shear bolts can be a good practical alternative to steel. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the development and use of non-corrosive shear bolts for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections. Externally applied shear reinforcing bolts provide the punching shear reinforcement strength, while allowing the flexibility and ease of installation of an external application after construction. By providing a bearing area against both sides of the slab surface, the formation of punching shear cracks can be restrained, and the connection can become strengthened against punching shear failure. Three different types of non-corrosive shear bolts were developed and tested. The first was an off-the-shelf glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bolt / nut product. The two others used two different GFRP core <b>rods</b> with aluminum <b>fittings</b> crimped to their ends. A total of six specimens were tested, four were tested under an increasing static load, while two were tested with an unbalanced pseudo-dynamic lateral load. All six specimens were designed to fail in punching shear before reaching their flexural capacity. The results are compared against previous test results of specimens both unreinforced and reinforced with steel shear bolts to determine their effectiveness. From the test results {{it was found that the}} GFRP shear bolts did strengthen the connections for punching shear. The GFRP nut and bolt did not strengthen the connection, and, in fact, decreased its overall strength when compared to the unreinforced specimen. The presence of the GFRP shear bolts also increased the connection ductility and the deflection capability. In the pseudo-dynamic tests the GFRP shear bolts significantly increased the amount of energy dissipated by the connection under reverse cyclic loading. The results of the testing appeared to be depended on the proper application of the crimping technique to place the bolts in the slab...|$|R
