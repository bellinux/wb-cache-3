5|$|Triton {{was to be}} {{the lead}} ship of a {{proposed}} class of nuclear-powered <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> submarines. A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> submarines. The total force included two non-nuclear Sailfish class submarines and eight nuclear submarines. With construction costs for Triton escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> submarines for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> submarines each.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before her}} launch, there was {{considerable}} discussion of Tritons role beyond her <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration {{to serve as a}} command ship (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, {{with the exception of the}} command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E
5|$|Maryland was {{assigned}} targets {{on the southern}} coast of Okinawa to support a diversionary landing, which would distract Japanese forces away from the main landing on the west coast. Japanese forces responded with several air raids, with two of Marylands <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> destroyers being struck by kamikaze planes, with Luce sinking. On 3 April, she {{was moved to the}} west coast invasion beaches to assist Minneapolis in destroying several shore batteries. Following the land invasion, she remained with the support force off Bolo Point providing artillery support for the invading troops.|$|E
50|$|Mannert L. Abele was {{the first}} of three <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> hit by an Ohka, but the only ship sunk by one during the Okinawa campaign. Despite the Japanese efforts, the <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> {{successfully}} completed their mission, thus ensuring the success of the campaign for the Americans.|$|R
50|$|In 1957 {{all of the}} Weapon-class Destroyers started {{conversions}} to <b>Radar</b> <b>pickets,</b> {{which involved}} the removal of their torpedo tubes. Scorpion underwent her conversion at Devonport Dockyard. She was fitted with an extra mast to carry a large AKE-1 Antennae. She was the last Weapon-class vessel to re-commission in 1959 and {{was part of the}} 7th Destroyer Squadron until being placed in reserve in April 1963.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, {{the four}} Weapon-class destroyers were {{selected}} for conversion to <b>Radar</b> <b>pickets</b> in 1957, with Battleaxe being converted at Rosyth Dockyard. The ship's torpedo tubes were removed to allow the fitting of an additional lattice mast carrying a Type 965 long-range air-search radar, with deckhouses built to house the radar equipment and operators. Battleaxes Squid mortars were swapped with the aft mounted 4-inch turret, while a more modern fire control system for the ship's guns were fitted.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian {{surrender}} to the Allies in September 1943, Premuda was still docked in Genoa, and was seized by Germany. Plans to convert her into a <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> for night fighters were abandoned. In August 1944, following the replacement of her armament, she was commissioned into the German Navy as a Torpedoboot Ausland (foreign torpedo boat) with the designation TA32. The ship saw action shelling Allied positions on the Italian coast and laying naval mines. In March 1945, she took part in the Battle of the Ligurian Sea against two Royal Navy destroyers, during which she was lightly damaged. She was scuttled the following month as the Germans retreated from Genoa.|$|E
5|$|On Shepard's second cruise with Cogswell, he was {{appointed}} a gunnery officer, responsible for the 20mm and 40mm antiaircraft guns on the ship's bow. They engaged kamikazes in the Battle of Okinawa, where the ship served in the dangerous role of a <b>radar</b> <b>picket.</b> The job of the radar pickets was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes; but because they were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. Cogswell performed this duty from May 27, 1945, until June 26, when it rejoined Task Force 38. The ship also participated in the Allied naval bombardments of Japan, and was present in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender of Japan in September 1945. Shepard returned to the United States later that month.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian-class <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> {{ships were}} based in Rhode Island and San Francisco, and covered picket {{stations}} 400–500 miles off each coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} the nuclear-powered {{submarine}} in the 1950s brought about {{a major change in}} strategic thinking about submarine warfare. These boats could operate faster, deeper and had much longer endurance. They could be larger and so became missile launching platforms. In response to this the attack submarine became more important, particularly in regard to its postulated role as a hunter-killer. The US also used nuclear submarines as <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> for a while. There have also been major advances in sensors and weapons.|$|R
50|$|In 1957 {{all of the}} Weapon {{class were}} taken into refit and {{conversion}} to re-equip them as <b>radar</b> <b>pickets,</b> to supplement the new s. Broadsword was converted at Rosyth. The conversion involved the removal of both sets of torpedo tubes and the erection of an additional lattice mast, which carried a large Type 965 Radar (AKE -1 aerial). She re-commissioned in October 1958 and was then allocated to the 7th Destroyer Squadron serving in Home and Mediterranean waters until paying off in 1963.|$|R
50|$|In 1957 {{all of the}} Weapon {{class were}} taken into refit and {{conversion}} to re-equip them as <b>radar</b> <b>pickets,</b> to supplement the new s. Crossbow was converted at Chatham Dockyard. The conversion involved the removal of both sets of torpedo tubes and the erection of an additional lattice mast, which carried a large Type 965 Radar (AKE -1 aerial). Crossbow re-commissioned in 1959 and was then allocated to the 2nd Destroyer Squadron. She was present at Chatham Navy Days in April 1960.|$|R
25|$|Cuba and Syria ordered used Whiskey-class {{submarines}} {{for use as}} {{battery charging}} hulks. The guided missile and <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> boats were never exported.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{departed}} San Pedro Bay on 5 August 1945, {{and arrived}} at Ulithi, 7 August 1945. She took <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> station some 50miles from Ulithi from 10 to 13 August. Three days later she sailed escorting troopship Admiral Benson (AP-120) to San Pedro Bay; then continued on alone to Subic Bay, Luzon, where she arrived on the 21st.|$|E
25|$|She {{served in}} a {{training}} capacity at New London until 12 February 1947, when she was placed out of commission in reserve. In December 1950, she was towed to Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion to a <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> submarine. Redesignated SSR-271 on 3 January 1951, she was recommissioned 13 August 1952, Lt. Comdr. A. C. Burley in command.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, Agincourt {{and three}} of her sister-ships {{underwent}} conversion to become <b>radar</b> <b>pickets.</b> The conversion included {{the addition of the}} Sea Cat missile and new radar, as well as newer Anti-Aircraft weaponry. In 1962, Agincourt returned to active duty and saw service in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets with a variety of squadrons. In 1966, Agincourt was reduced to Operational Reserve, and was subsequently placed on the disposal list in 1972. She was broken up in Sunderland in 1974.|$|R
50|$|The ships lost {{were smaller}} vessels, {{particularly}} the destroyers of the <b>radar</b> <b>pickets,</b> {{as well as}} destroyer escorts and landing ships. While no major Allied warships were lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based Shin'yō-class suicide motorboats were also used in the Japanese suicide attacks, although Ushijima had disbanded {{the majority of the}} suicide boat battalions prior to the battle due to expected low effectiveness against a superior enemy. The boat crews were re-formed into three additional infantry battalions.|$|R
50|$|The Allies made counter-kamikaze preparations, {{known as}} the Big Blue Blanket. This {{involved}} adding more fighter squadrons to the carriers in place of torpedo and dive bombers, and converting B-17s into airborne <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> {{in a manner similar}} to the modern-day AWACS. Nimitz came up with a plan for a pre-invasion feint, sending a fleet to the invasion beaches a couple of weeks before the real invasion, to lure out the Japanese on their one-way flights, who would then find ships loaded with anti-aircraft guns from bow to stern instead of the valuable, vulnerable transports.|$|R
25|$|During the Okinawa {{campaign}} Marshall operated as advanced <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> for her {{task group}} and escorted damaged ships to safety, 8 April to 9 May. On 9 May, she departed for Ulithi, continuing on to Leyte and finally San Francisco, arriving 6 July for overhaul. Before completion, {{the war ended}} and Marshall inactivated. Decommissioned in December, she {{was placed in the}} Reserve Fleet at San Diego.|$|E
25|$|Turner was {{reclassified}} as a <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> destroyer on 18 March 1949. She departed San Diego on 4 April, steamed via the Panama Canal, {{and arrived}} at Newport, Rhode Island, on 21 April 1949. There, she received additional electronic equipment enabling her to carry out her new duties. Throughout the 1950s, she conducted reserve training cruises, participated in fleet exercises, and frequently made 6th Fleet deployments. On her eighth Mediterranean cruise in 1958, she acted as a picket ship for Task Force 61 during the Lebanon crisis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{role was}} as a mothership. This {{included}} being rigged for carrying the experimental parasite fighter aircraft, such as the McDonnell XF-85 Goblin and Republic F-84 Thunderjets as in flight lock on and offs. It was also used to develop the Airborne Early Warning program; it was the ancestor of various modern <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> aircraft. A B-29 with the original Wright Duplex Cyclone powerplants was used to air-launch the famous Bell X-1 supersonic research rocket aircraft, as well as Cherokee rockets for the testing of ejection seats.|$|E
5000|$|During the Cold War period {{following}} WWII, {{the primary}} [...] "axis" [...] of combat shifted to lie between the United States and the Soviet Union. By 1949, both sides had nuclear weapons carried by bombers. To provide early warning of an attack, both deployed huge radar networks of increasing sophistication at ever-more remote locations. In the West, {{the first such}} system was the Pinetree Line, deployed across Canada in the early 1950s, backed up with <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> on ships and oil platforms off {{the east and west}} coasts.|$|R
5000|$|Iheya Shima and Aguni Shima are {{two small}} islands about 30 miles north and west, respectively, of Okinawa. Because {{of the heavy}} damage {{sustained}} by the U.S. fleet and especially the <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> during kamikaze raids, {{the decision was made}} to capture them for long-range radar and fighter director facilities. [...] On 3 June, PC-598 accompanied the amphibious landing force to Iheya Shima, providing anti-submarine screening en route to the island and during the landing. The Aguni Shima landing followed on 9 June, with PC-598 providing similar services. [...] Both landings were unopposed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{squadron}} was activated on 1 March 1959 as the 26th Air Defense Missile Squadron (BOMARC) {{and stood}} alert during the Cold War, equipped with IM-99 (later CIM-10) BOMARC {{surface to air}} antiaircraft missiles. The squadron was tied into a Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) direction center which could use analog computers to process information from ground <b>radars,</b> <b>picket</b> ships and airborne aircraft to accelerate the display of tracking data at the direction center to quickly direct the missile site to engage hostile aircraft. [...] It was inactivated on 30 April 1972.|$|R
25|$|The Pacific Barrier (BarPac) began {{operations}} with one squadron operating from NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii, and a forward refueling base at Naval Station Midway, on 1 July 1958. Planes flew from Midway Island to Adak Island (in the Aleutian Island chain) and back, non-stop. Its orbits overlapped the <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> {{stations of the}} ships of Escort Squadron Seven (CORTRON SEVEN), from roughly Kodiak Island to Midway and Escort Squadron Five (CORTRON FIVE), from Pearl Harbor to northern Pacific waters. Normally 4 or 5 WV-2s were required at any single time to provide coverage over the entire line.|$|E
25|$|Another brief respite at Ulithi preceded her {{deployment}} for the Okinawa operation, {{for which}} she sailed from Ulithi 22 March 1945. After screening heavy ships in the massive pre-invasion bombardment, Cassin Young moved inshore to support the activities of underwater demolition teams preparing the beaches. On invasion day itself, 1 April, the destroyer offered fire support in the assault areas, then took up <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> duty. On 6 April, Cassin Young endured her first kamikaze attacks with which the Japanese gambled on defeating the Okinawa operation. Cassin Young rescued the survivors of two nearby destroyers that were sunk.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May, {{when she}} arrived at Okinawa, the {{campaign}} had been in progress for almost two months, but the Japanese still hung on tenaciously. The members of the Kamikaze Corps continued to hurl themselves at the ships supporting the troops ashore. Watts {{proved to be a}} lucky ship while on <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> station. Not only did her guns help to shoot down six aerial attackers, but she suffered only one really close call. A suicide plane almost managed to crash into her port side forward, but accurate 20-millimeter fire splashed him at the last possible instant, only 10 yards off the destroyer's port bow.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 the 4th Destroyer Squadron {{was back}} in business. Consisting of Agincourt, Aisne, Jutland and Corunna and {{converted}} to General Service Commissions the squadron deployed between the Home and Mediterranean Fleets {{for the next few}} years. In 1953 Barrosa replaced Jutland and in 1957 Aisne was replaced by Alamein. In March 1959 there was a collision in the Bay of Biscay between Barrosa and Corunna. The following month the 4th Squadron was disbanded. Alamein went into reserve and was broken up at Blyth in 1964. Agincourt, Barrosa and Corunna were placed in dockyard hands for conversion to <b>radar</b> <b>pickets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{squadron}} was activated for {{the third}} time on 1 April 1960 as the 74th Air Defense Missile Squadron at Duluth Municipal Airport. [...] It stood alert during the Cold War, with IM-99A (later CIM-10) BOMARC surface to air antiaircraft missiles. The squadron was tied into a Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) direction center which could use analog computers to process information from ground <b>radars,</b> <b>picket</b> ships and airborne aircraft to accelerate the display of tracking data at the direction center to quickly direct the missile site to engage hostile aircraft. [...] It was inactivated on 30 April 1972.|$|R
5000|$|The 4620th Air Defense Wing was {{established}} to implement the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system, a system of analog computer-equipped direction centers that could process information from ground <b>radars,</b> <b>picket</b> ships and ground observers onto a generated radar scope to create a composite picture of the emerging air battle. [...] The wing was responsible to ensure that SAGE computer systems were based on approved operational concepts for air defense and provided guidance to operational units concerning the implementation, installation, testing, and utilization of SAGE computer programs. [...] Until December 1958, the wing also provided training on the existing manual air defense control systems that were being replaced by SAGE.|$|R
25|$|Early in September, as the Navy {{prepared}} to take the Palaus, TheSullivans supported neutralizing air strikes against Japanese air bases in the Philippines. At dawn on the 7th, she began <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> duty for TG38.2 and continued the task through the strikes of the 9th and 10th. From 18:00 on 12 September, the ships noted an increase in air activity – observing many bogies that merely orbited the formations as snoopers. The carriers conducted further raids on the central Philippines on the 13th and 14th and then shifted course to the north to subject Manila to air attacks commencing on the 21st. Three days later, American planes again hit the central Philippines.|$|E
25|$|She {{returned}} to Majuro, and then Pearl Harbor for further training before reporting to Eniwetok on 11 June {{to join the}} screen of escort carriers assigned to covering duty in the invasion of Saipan four days later. In addition to <b>radar</b> <b>picket</b> and screening duty, she was also called upon for inshore fire support. As the battle for Saipan raged ashore, escort carriers of Cassin Youngs group launched attacks on the island, as well as sorties to neutralize enemy air fields on Tinian, Rota, and Guam. Similar operations supporting the subsequent assaults on Tinian and Guam claimed the services of Cassin Young until 13 August, when she {{returned to}} Eniwetok to replenish.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{supported}} Operation Earnest Will. The Iranians and Iraqis escalated {{their attacks}} against ships sailing in the Persian Gulf during the Persian Gulf War {{between those two}} countries, and the U.S. launched Earnest Will to maintain freedom of navigation in the area. The Americans initially renamed and reflagged eleven Kuwaiti tankers. Klakring patrolled the Persian Gulf between <b>Radar</b> <b>Picket</b> Stations North and South. The ship repeatedly passed outbound through the Strait of Hormuz to refuel from underway replenishment ships, {{and then returned to}} the Persian Gulf. On 10 August, Klakring embarked a detachment of Army helicopters and helped coordinate the efforts of British tugs converted for mine sweeping. Klakring escorted —reflagged tanker Al Rekkah—outbound through the Strait of Hormuz on 30 August. The Iranians mined Bridgeton on 24 July, but the tanker survived.|$|E
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of June, enemy resistance at Okinawa was on the ebb, both {{in the air and}} on the ground. Few planes penetrated the cordon of <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> stationed around the island with any regularity or frequency, and the land defense found itself bottled up in several relatively isolated pockets. On 3 June, Beale helped to eradicate of one of those pockets when she supported the landings on Iheya Retto, one of Okinawas satellite island groups located about 11 miles (20 km) north of the Motobu Peninsula. Organized resistance in the Ryūkyūs ended {{at the start of the}} last week in June, and the campaign for Okinawa closed officially on 2 July.|$|R
50|$|Duty in the {{antisubmarine screen}} {{occupied}} her {{time on the}} day before the invasion. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed the Hagushi beaches on Okinawa, and Staunch settled into the routine of patrols and ASW screening. until 31 May, she came under frequent air attacks, though most were directed at the larger ships, particularly the <b>radar</b> <b>pickets.</b> During the night of 16 and 17 May, she picked up a small surface contact on her radar screen and found a large boat pulling a raft. Staunch opened fire on the strange enemy craft, and {{all but one of the}} Japanese took to the water. The remaining Japanese soldier blew himself up with a hand grenade.|$|R
50|$|From 1943 Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{operated}} several radar-equipped night fighter guide ships (Nachtjagdleitschiffe), including NJL Togo. {{which was}} equipped with a FuMG A1 Freya radar for early warning and a Würzburg-Riese gun laying radar, plus night fighter communications equipment.From October 1943, the NJL Togo cruised the Baltic Sea under the operational control of the Luftwaffe. In March 1944, after the three great Soviet bombing raids on Helsinki, she arrived in the Gulf of Finland to provide night fighter cover for Tallinn and Helsinki. Also, the Imperial Japanese Navy briefly modified two Ha-101 class submarines as dedicated <b>radar</b> <b>pickets</b> {{in the first half}} of 1945, but reconverted them to an even more important role as tanker submarines in June of that year.|$|R
