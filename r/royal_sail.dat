5000|$|A skysail is the {{uppermost}} sail in many old square-rigged sail-plans (though sometimes {{topped by a}} moonsail). It was also on the royal mast above the <b>royal</b> <b>sail.</b> It was typically used in light winds.|$|E
5000|$|Royal sails were {{normally}} {{found only}} on larger ships with masts {{tall enough to}} accommodate the extra canvas. Royals were introduced {{around the turn of}} the 18th century, but were not usually flown on the mizzenmast until the end of that century. [...] It gave its name to a Dutch term for a light breeze—the <b>Royal</b> <b>Sail</b> Breeze or bovenbramzeilskoelte was a Force 2 wind on the Beaufort Scale.|$|E
50|$|All three masts (with lower, top, and {{topgallant}} masts including royal and skysail masts) had {{a course}} sail, a topsail, a topgallant sail, a <b>royal</b> <b>sail,</b> and a skysail. The main-skysail mast has been lengthened and {{fitted with a}} moonsail later on. Her sail suit was made by Messrs. Porter, Mayhew & Co., Boston. Older pictures show the ship with only four square sails on the fore and mizzen masts, and five on the main mast.|$|E

5000|$|During the three-month, {{first-class}} training cruise on the pre-Civil War sloop-of-war , {{before beginning}} his final academic year, Stirling and another cadet were ordered aloft during a severe squall {{to shorten sail}} and send down the topgallant and <b>royal</b> <b>sail</b> yards. [...] "squeezing out tar on every handhold to prevent being blown out into space by the great force {{of the wind and}} the pressure of the solid sheets of rain", Stirling climbed up two vertical shrouds and Jacob's ladders to the top gallant yard, one-hundred and twenty feet above the deck. Succeeding in furling the sails and lowering the yards by [...] "exerting every ounce of strength we could muster and while the gale was at its height", Stirling wrote in his memoirs forty years later, [...] "The physical condition and the confidence acquired that enable you to hang, without batting an eye, by one hand in space with a yawning drop below you are things the modern sailor never attains. That sense of exaltation was well worth the price paid." [...] Having been in the bottom third of his class during the first three years at Annapolis, in his final year of studies, Stirling found the courses more practical to the knowledge and skill he would need as a naval officer. Applying himself to ensure his standing would be high enough to be offered a commission, he improved his academic ranking that year and graduated from the United States Naval Academy on 3 June 1892, twenty-second in a class of forty.|$|E
50|$|Thermopylae {{was built}} for the Aberdeen Line, {{which was founded in}} 1825 by George Thompson. She {{measured}} 212' × 36' × 20.9', with tonnage 991 GRT, 948 NRT and 927 tons under deck.

50|$|She has 1,613 GRT and 1,490 NRT. Rigged {{only with}} double {{topgallant}} sails over double top sails, {{she was not}} equipped with <b>royal</b> <b>sails</b> (baldheader rigging) to save costs concerning gear and seamen. As with many baldheaded sailing ships the square sails were a little wider than the sails of a standard rigging to gain sail area for a better propulsion.|$|R
