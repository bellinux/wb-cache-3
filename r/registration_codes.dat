Since FOF focused exclusively on the passenger and freight charter market. In April and May 1952 the airline experienced two write-off incidents, causing a shortage of aircraft and crew, resulting in the purchase of another DC-3 and a Douglas DC-4. The latter only remained in use for two years. The airline also bought a helicopter, a Hiller 360, bought in 1954 which crashed on its inaugural flight.

5000|$|Some {{software}} that implements online registration extends {{this with a}} process commonly known as [...] "phoning home". In this case, the software, either each time it is used or at some preset interval such as monthly, makes another connection back to the registration server. It does this {{to check in with}} the server to see if the serial number it is using has been determined to be one that is being used to install in many places. Serial numbers that have been identified as [...] "pirated" [...] (illegally distributed) are added to a blacklist on the server, a process referred to as being [...] "burned". Burned serial numbers cannot be used to install or activate the product. Serial number lists are available on the internet that include a large number of valid <b>registration</b> <b>codes</b> for many software titles. It is common for software manufacturers to seek out these lists and invalidate the serial numbers that appear on these lists. This discourages individuals from giving out their <b>registration</b> <b>codes</b> for fear that this code will later be invalidated, disabling the original install of the software the next time that it [...] "phones home".|$|E

So it was still possible, if rare, to see a classic car with <b>registration</b> <b>codes</b> of administrative units that have not existed for over 30 years (e.g. EIN = Einbeck). Since November 2012 some districts allow reissuing on request of these expired prefix codes, e.g. instead of WES- in the district of Wesel, MO- as used for the former district of Moers and DIN- as used for the former district of Dinslaken.|$|E
