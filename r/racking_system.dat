50|$|A remote <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> is {{a system}} that allows an {{operator}} to operate a <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> from a remote location. It offers a safe alternative to manually racking circuit breakers, which reduces the requirement for service personnel to wear a full-body arc flash hazard suit for protection.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{types of}} pallet storage racks are {{available}} with different designs to fulfill specific functions or create specific advantages. To create the ideal pallet <b>racking</b> <b>system,</b> several considerations {{should be taken into}} account: ...|$|E
50|$|Selective {{pallet racking}} {{is a common}} pallet <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> in use today. Selective pallet racking systems {{typically}} come {{in one of two}} configurations: a roll formed, or clip-in configuration, and a structural bolt-together configuration.|$|E
50|$|Structural pallet <b>rack</b> <b>systems</b> {{are very}} similar to roll formed pallet <b>rack</b> <b>systems</b> except the {{horizontal}} load beams are attached to the uprights with bolts and have much greater weight-bearing capacity. The bolt fixings make this a form of adjustable shelving - racks can be constructed, reconfigured, and dismantled and reused as necessary.|$|R

When the remote <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> is {{used in conjunction with}} a remote switch operator, the user can also operate, trip, and release the circuit breaker from a safe distance.|$|E
50|$|The CAMELEON {{storage system}} is a {{multi-story}} <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> developed from the leisure boating industry. Multiple modules can be stacked four high and managed with a high-lift for lift truck thus enabling fleet managers to reduce not only capital outlay but also storage space for vehicles.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} designs of remote racking systems {{on the market}} and most include either a wired or {{wireless}} remote control. The distance at which these can be used varies by which product is chosen. Also the style and size will also be a factor in choosing a remote <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> as some are larger than others.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2009 by Elie Rothschild who had already been in the solar {{industry}} for 7 years. Sollega proposed a cheaper alternative to the conventional metal mounting systems. The company produced its first <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> Instarack 15° followed by the Instarack 10°. These were replaced with the updated Fastrack 5° in 2012. In 2014 this {{was replaced by the}} current system, the Fastrack 510.|$|E
5000|$|The current <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> {{provided}} by Sollega is the Fastrack 510 which is sourced and {{made in the}} US. It can mount both 5° and 10° arrays and {{is designed to be}} anchored using anchors and/or ballast. The individual units are made out of lightweight high density polyethylene plastic (HDPE). The material uses a minimum of 35% recycled content resulting in a lower carbon footprint.|$|E

50|$|MV Ionas {{car deck}} could take {{vehicles}} up to 16.5 {{feet in height}} and 32-ton in weight. She had a bow visor, a stern-and side-ramps with a hoist that could handle 27.5 tons. Traffic for the hoist was marshalled by automatic barriers. Her bow-visor, raised by a <b>racking</b> <b>system,</b> rather than a hinge, was not watertight, limiting her passenger-carrying capacity later in her career. The bow-ramp was in several sections, which coiled back into the vehicle deck, reducing available car spaces.|$|E
