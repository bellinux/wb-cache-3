40|$|In {{order to}} probe the {{formation}} of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing gases during the pyrolysis and combustion of coals and other solid fuels, non-softening model substrates are required. In this respect, phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins are ideal since they readily facilitate the incorporation of individual heteroatomic functions into a highly crosslinked matrix. A series of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing co-resites have been prepared using phenol with, as the second component, thiophene, dibenzothiophene, diphenylsulfide, benzyl phenyl sulfide, thioanisole, 8 -hydroxyquinoline and 2 -hydroxycarbazole. A mole ratio of 3 : 1 (phenol: heteroatom-containing component) was adopted {{in order to ensure}} that a reasonably high degree of crosslinking was achieved. Resoles containing diphenyldisulfide were also prepared but, due to the comparable bond strengths of the S-S and C-O linkages, a curing temperature of only 130 degrees C was used to avoid cleavage of the disulfide bond. The virtually complete elimination of ether and methylol functions from the resoles by curing at 200 degrees C was monitored by solid-state C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (n. m. r.) spectroscopy. The resultant <b>resites</b> were also characterized by sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES.) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (X. p. s.) and differential scanning calorimetry (d. s. c.). Simple air oxidation was found to selectively convert the aliphatic-bound sulfur to a mixture of sulfones and sulfoxides. Applications of the <b>resites</b> in fuel science are described...|$|R

40|$|A {{new group}} of long {{terminal}} repeats (LTR) retrotransposons, termed terminal-repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIM), are described that are present in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant. TRIM elements have terminal direct repeat sequences between ≈ 100 and 250 bp in length that encompass an internal domain of ≈ 100 – 300 bp. The internal domain contains primer binding site and polypurine tract motifs but lacks the coding domains required for mobility. Thus TRIM elements are not capable of autonomous transposition and probably require the help of mobility-related proteins encoded by other retrotransposons. The structural organization of TRIM elements suggests an evolutionary relationship to either LTR retrotransposons or retroviruses. The past mobility of TRIM elements is indicated {{by the presence of}} flanking 5 -bp direct repeats found typically at LTR retrotransposon insertion sites, the high degree of sequence conservation between elements from different genomic locations, and the identification of related to empty sites (<b>RESites).</b> TRIM elements seem to be involved actively in the restructuring of plant genomes, affecting the promoter, coding region and intron-exon structure of genes. In solanaceous species and maize, TRIM elements provided target sites for further retrotransposon insertions. In Arabidopsis, evidence is provided that the TRIM element also can be involved in the transduction of host genes...|$|R
40|$|Transposons are {{a diverse}} {{collection}} of mobile genetic elements and are important components of nearly every genome. Because of their mobile and repetitive nature, transposons can have considerable effects on host gene expression, genome organization and evolution. The recent availability of genomic sequence information has expedited the discovery and study of transposons, as exemplified {{in this thesis}} by the complete genome analysis of the model plant system Arabidopsis thaliana. Data mining in Arabidopsis has revealed a rich diversity of transposons, of which Basho and Terminal-repeat Retrotransposons In Miniature (TRIM) elements were previously unknown types. The identification of Related to Empty Sites (<b>RESites)</b> provide evidence for past transposition events. Examples of elements contributing to coding regions, acquiring cellular sequences, along with in-depth analysis of the insertions, their target sites and their distribution illustrate the impact of transposons on gene and genome structures. Computer-based searches of genomic sequences has also improved our understanding of previously identified transposon families, such as the origin, classification and mobilization of Tourist elements. In addition, information on transposons gathered from in silico analysis of genomic sequences has served to design in vivo experiments. In a whole genome strategy, Transposon Display was used to investigate transposition and regulation of mobility of Tourist-like elements in A. thaliana and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans...|$|R

In 1920, Sister Anne bought the 52 acre Anderson onion farm and skating pond where Resurrection Medical Center now stands. Resurrection High School was established in 1922. In 1922, she opened the doors to Resurrection High School {{in what is now}} the Provincial Home. Four years later, the first graduating class consisted of four young women, one of whom {{went on to become a}} successful attorney as well as a mother and grandmother of future <b>Resites.</b> After 40 years of growth, Resurrection High School opened its doors in 1962 in a new, much larger building.

40|$|Abstract Background Transposable {{elements}} {{constitute a}} significant fraction of plant genomes. The PIF/Harbinger superfamily includes DNA transposons (class II elements) carrying terminal inverted repeats and producing a 3 bp target site duplication upon insertion. The {{presence of an}} ORF coding for the DDE/DDD transposase, required for transposition, is characteristic for the autonomous PIF/Harbinger -like elements. Based on the above features, PIF/Harbinger -like elements were identified in several plant genomes and divided into several evolutionary lineages. Availability of {{a significant portion of}} Medicago truncatula genomic sequence allowed for mining PIF/Harbinger -like elements, starting from a single previously described element MtMaster. Results Twenty two putative autonomous, i. e. carrying an ORF coding for TPase and complete terminal inverted repeats, and 67 non-autonomous PIF/Harbinger -like elements were found in the genome of M. truncatula. They were divided into five families, MtPH-A 5, MtPH-A 6, MtPH-D, MtPH-E, and MtPH-M, corresponding to three previously identified and two new lineages. The largest families, MtPH-A 6 and MtPH-M were further divided into four and three subfamilies, respectively. Non-autonomous elements were usually direct deletion derivatives of the putative autonomous element, however other types of rearrangements, including inversions and nested insertions were also observed. An interesting structural characteristic – the presence of 60 bp tandem repeats – was observed in a group of elements of subfamily MtPH-A 6 - 4. Some families could be related to miniature inverted repeat elements (MITEs). The presence of empty loci (<b>RESites),</b> paralogous to those flanking the identified transposable elements, both autonomous and non-autonomous, as well as the presence of transposon insertion related size polymorphisms, confirmed that some of the mined elements were capable for transposition. Conclusion The population of PIF/Harbinger -like elements in the genome of M. truncatula is diverse. A detailed intra-family comparison of the elements' structure proved that they proliferated in the genome generally following the model of abortive gap repair. However, the presence of tandem repeats facilitated more pronounced rearrangements of the element internal regions. The insertion polymorphism of the MtPH elements and related MITE families in different populations of M. truncatula, if further confirmed experimentally, {{could be used as a}} source of molecular markers complementary to other marker systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Peripheral {{intravenous}} device (IVD) complications were traditionally {{thought to}} be reduced by limiting dwell time. Current recommendations are to <b>resite</b> IVDs by 96 hours {{with the exception of}} children and patients with poor veins. Recent evidence suggests routine <b>resite</b> is unnecessary, at least if devices are inserted by a specialised IV team. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the impact of peripheral IVD 'routine resite' with 'removal on clinical indication' on IVD complications in a general hospital without an IV team. Methods A randomised, controlled trial was conducted in a regional teaching hospital. After ethics approval, 362 patients (603 IVDs) were randomised to have IVDs replaced on clinical indication (185 patients) or routine change every 3 days (177 patients). IVDs were inserted and managed by the general hospital medical and nursing staff; there was no IV team. The primary endpoint was a composite of IVD complications: phlebitis, infiltration, occlusion, accidental removal, local infection, and device-related bloodstream infection. Results IVD complication rates were 68 per 1, 000 IVD days (clinically indicated) and 66 per 1, 000 IVD days (routine replacement) (P = 0. 86; HR 1. 03; 95 % CI, 0. 74 - 1. 43). Time to first complication per patient did not differ between groups (KM with log rank, P = 0. 53). There were no local infections or IVD-related bloodstream infections in either group. IV therapy duration did not differ between groups (P = 0. 22), but more (P = 0. 004) IVDs were placed per patient in the routine replacement (mean, 1. 8) than the clinical indication group (mean, 1. 5), with significantly higher hospital costs per patient (P Conclusions <b>Resite</b> on clinical indication would allow one in two patients to have a single cannula per course of IV treatment, as opposed to one in five patients managed with routine resite; overall complication rates appear similar. Clinically indicated <b>resite</b> would achieve savings in equipment, staff time and patient discomfort. There is growing evidence to support the extended use of peripheral IVDs with removal only on clinical indication.

40|$|In many Australian {{hospitals}} {{a medical}} officer {{is available for}} urgent review of in-patients outside normal working hours. Current practice in nurse-initiated requests for medical officer involvement out of hours may adversely affect patient outcome as well as medical and nursing resource use at these times. Of 10 523 nurse-initiated requests for out-of-hours review recorded by medical officers at our hospital in 2002 - 2003, the most frequent reasons for the requests were medication review, IV fluid orders, IV <b>resite,</b> venesection and pathology review, none of which are related to acute changes in clinical condition. Requests for routine review of medication and fluid orders {{were found to be}} rarely essential and often inappropriate. Medical officer activity was highest before midnight and least after midnight, suggesting most requests are fulfilled in the evening.
