500|$|When {{the trades}} {{indicated}} production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg {{and asked him}} bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where {{he had heard the}} rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was [...] "out to get him" [...] and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.|$|E
500|$|In his prime, Smith {{was widely}} {{recognised}} by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator. Hempstone considered him [...] "a man too principled (or short-sighted) to compromise {{with what he}} regards as wrong", while Welensky compared dealing with him to [...] "trying to nail jelly to a wall". He had an [...] "iron nerve", to quote his RF colleague PK van der Byl, and a reputation for [...] "icy calm"; he almost never got angry or <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> He spoke with [...] "a nasal monologue" [...] as Peter Younghusband described it—"uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards". His open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their Prime Minister was still an [...] "ordinary, decent fellow", which Berlyn cites as {{a major factor in}} his enduring popularity. Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an [...] "almost hypnotic influence" [...] over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win [...] "election after election... hands down". He also had the grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during the Bush War; one, quoted anonymously by People magazine in 1976, asserted that [...] "If we had a leader like Mr Smith, we would have won long ago." [...] Sithole, the long-time ZANU leader, said: [...] "Smith is a fighter. He put up a great fight for his people. We were like two bulls in there, the way we fought. He is a man.

2500|$|In 1945, Brando's agent {{recommended}} he take a co-starring role in The Eagle Has Two Heads with Tallulah Bankhead, {{produced by}} Jack Wilson. Bankhead had {{turned down the}} role of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946-1947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. [...] "I don't care what your grandmother did," [...] Wilson exclaimed, [...] "and that Method stuff, I {{want to know what}} you're going to do!"

Lu Ji was among the scholars. As their seating positions were determined by their ages, Lu Ji took the furthest seat because he was the youngest. When they were talking about using military force to bring about peace, Lu Ji <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and said, [...] "In the past, when Guan Yiwu served as a chancellor under Duke Huan of Qi, the Duke was able to unite the various lords under his control and bring order to the Empire without resorting to military force. Confucius once said, 'If remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so.' Those who are present at this discussion speak of only using military force, and nothing about promoting civil culture and virtue. I, Ji, may be young and ignorant, but I don't feel at ease (after hearing what you've said)." [...] Zhang Zhao and the others were very surprised by Lu Ji's response.|$|E

2500|$|Trotsky {{and several}} other Soviet figures {{promoted}} the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity. This idea gained widespread acceptance outside the Soviet Union but was misleading. According to Montefiore, [...] "it is clear from hostile and friendly witnesses alike that Stalin was always exceptional, even from childhood". Stalin had a complex mind, {{with a great deal}} of self-control. He rarely <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> in anger, although as his health declined in later life he became increasingly unpredictable and bad tempered. A hard worker, he displayed a keen desire to learn, and had an excellent memory. When in power, he scrutinised many details of Soviet life, from film scripts to architectural plans and military hardware. He was a capable actor who could play many different roles to different audiences, and was adept at deception, often lying or deceiving others as to his true motivates and aims. Several historians have seen it appropriate to follow Lazar Kaganovich's description of there being [...] "several Stalins" [...] as a means of understanding his multi-faceted personality. He judged others according to their inner strength, practicality, and cleverness. Despite his short temper and tough-talking attitude, he could be very charming; when relaxed, he cracked jokes and mimicked others.|$|E

His writings in favor of the oppressed were condemned as [...] "rash, scandalous, erroneous, savoring of heresy, and well adapted to pervert the ignorant." [...] After three years of incarceration, he was penanced in the audience-chamber of Coimbra on 23 December 1667. His sympathy for the victims of the Holy Office was sharpened by his experience of its [...] "unwholesome prisons", where he wrote that [...] "five unfortunates were not uncommonly placed in a cell nine feet by eleven, where the only light came from a narrow opening near the ceiling, where the vessels were changed only once a week, and all spiritual consolation was denied." [...] Then, in the safe refuge of Rome, he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> for the relief of the oppressed, in numerous writings in which he characterized the [...] "Holy Office of Portugal as a tribunal which served only to deprive men of their fortunes, their honor, and their lives, while unable to discriminate between guilt and innocence; it was known to be holy only in name, while its works were cruelty and injustice, unworthy of rational beings, although it was always proclaiming its superior piety." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 June 1882, {{the day of}} the {{execution}} of Guiteau for the assassination of President James Garfield, Guiteau announced, after famously dancing his way to the gallows, that he would read a poem that he had written.

After [...] "stubbing his toe {{on the way to the}} gallows", as he put it to {{the execution}}er, Guiteau read [...] and announced that he would now read a prayer of his own composition. After paraphrasing , Guiteau proceeded to read the poem from a piece of paper in a style described as both [...] "sad and doleful" [...] as well as [...] "high pitched" [...] and [...] "childlike". Guiteau had requested an orchestra to play behind him as he recited his poem, but his request was denied. After completing the first verse in song, Guiteau stopped singing and chanted the rest. Multiple times during the reading, Guiteau's voice would fail and he would begin sobbing, even stopping to lay his head on the shoulder of a man standing by him. Right before the completion of the poem, Guiteau <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> even higher into falsetto to deliver the final two lines. As the executioner fitted the hood over Guiteau's head and put the rope around his neck, he held onto the piece of paper on which he had written his poem.
