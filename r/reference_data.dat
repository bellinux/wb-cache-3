5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> in the future research of similar stars. The reason that stars such as Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity in {{children}} and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E

There are no standard drug references systems that can be refer by the doctors and pharmacists. To solve these problems, a system to transform the manual process of finding drug <b>references</b> <b>data</b> into the computerized system is implemented. By transforming the manual drug <b>references</b> <b>data</b> into the management system, the doctors and pharmacists time for searching the drug <b>data</b> for <b>references</b> can be reduced.

25|$|The {{calculation}} of prior probabilities depends on available {{data from the}} genome being studied, {{and the type of}} analysis being performed. For studies where good <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> containing frequencies of known mutations is available (for example, in studying human genome data), these known frequencies of genotypes in the population can be used to estimate priors. Given population wide allele frequencies, prior genotype probabilities can be calculated at each locus according to the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. In the absence of such data, constant priors can be used, independent of the locus. These can be set using heuristically chosen values, possibly informed by the kind of variations being sought by the study. Alternatively, supervised machine-learning procedures have been investigated that seek to learn optimal prior values for individuals in a sample, using supplied NGS data from these individuals.|$|E

25|$|Haygarth {{assisted}} with cricket coaching regularly until 1870, walking to Harrow {{from his home}} in central London. Meanwhile, he preoccupied himself with writing and amassing information on cricket. Initially a hobby, it grew to become a profession as more and more of his works were published. The then-captain of Surrey requested a copy of his collections with the intention to publish them in 1852, however several delays postponed the publication by ten years. The first volume of Frederick Lillywhite's Cricket Scores and Biographies was published 1862, with the next thirteen editions being released at intervals until 1895. It contains all the information obtainable from 1746 to 1878, with a supplement concerning notable players for the next 20 years. The volumes appeared at fairly regular intervals between 1862 and 1879. The first four, bound in purple cloth, were published by Fred Lillywhite, son of William Lillywhite. Volume 1 covering the 1744 to 1826 seasons {{is by far the most}} significant as it is the main source of <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> for late 18th century cricket.|$|E
