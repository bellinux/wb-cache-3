40|$|Although {{the power}} clean test is {{routinely}} {{used to assess}} strength and power performance in adult athletes, the reliability of this measure in younger populations has not been examined. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the reliability of the 1 -repetition maximum (1 <b>RM)</b> <b>power</b> clean in adolescent athletes. Thirty-six male athletes (age 15. 9 ± 1. 1 years, body mass 79. 1 ± 20. 3 kg, height 175. 1 ± 7. 4 cm) who had > 1 year of training experience in weightlifting exercises performed a 1 <b>RM</b> <b>power</b> clean on 2 nonconsecutive days in the afternoon following standardized procedures. All test procedures were supervised by a senior level weightlifting coach and consisted of a systematic progression in test load until the maximum resistance that could be lifted for 1 repetition using proper exercise technique was determined. Data were analyzed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[2,k]), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), repeated measures analysis of variance, Bland-Altman plot, and typical error analyses. Analysis of the data revealed that the test measures were highly reliable demonstrating a test-retest ICC of 0. 98 (95 % confidence interval = 0. 96 - 0. 99). Testing also demonstrated a strong relationship between 1 RM measures in trials 1 and 2 (r = 0. 98, p < 0. 0001) with no significant difference in power clean performance between trials (70. 6 ± 19. 8 vs. 69. 8 ± 19. 8 kg). Bland-Altman plots confirmed no systematic shift in 1 RM between trials 1 and 2. The typical error to be expected between 1 <b>RM</b> <b>power</b> clean trials is 2. 9 kg, and a change of at least 8. 0 kg is indicated to determine a real change in lifting performance between tests in young lifters. No injuries occurred during the study period, and the testing protocol was well tolerated by all the subjects. These findings indicate that 1 <b>RM</b> <b>power</b> clean testing has a high degree of reproducibility in trained male adolescent athletes when standardized testing procedures are followed and qualified instruction is present...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aim was to}} {{determine}} relationships between mechanical variables in the one-repetition maximum (1 RM) traditional bench press (TBP) and close-grip bench press (CGBP). Twenty resistance-trained men completed a TBP and CGBP 1 RM. The TBP was performed with the preferred grip; the CGBP with a grip width of 95 % biacromial distance. A linear position transducer measured: lift distance and duration; work; and peak and mean power, velocity, and force. Paired samples t-tests (p < 0. 05) compared the 1 RM and mechanical variables for the TBP and CGBP; effect sizes (d) were also calculated. Pearson’s correlations (r; p < 0. 05) computed relationships between the TBP and CGBP. 1 RM, lift duration, and mean force were greater in the TBP (d = 0. 30 - 3. 20). Peak power and velocity was greater for the CGBP (d = 0. 50 - 1. 29). The 1 RM TBP correlated with CGBP 1 <b>RM,</b> <b>power,</b> and force (r = 0. 685 - 0. 982). TBP work correlated with CGBP 1 <b>RM,</b> lift distance, <b>power,</b> force, and work (r = 0. 542 - 0. 931). TBP power correlated with CGBP 1 <b>RM,</b> <b>power,</b> force, velocity, and work (r = 0. 484 - 0. 704). TBP peak and mean force related to CGBP 1 <b>RM,</b> <b>power,</b> and force (r = 0. 596 - 0. 980). Due to relationships between the load, work, power, and force for the TBP and CGBP, the CGBP could provide similar strength adaptations to the TBP with long-term use.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish strength, power, and muscular endurance exercises for weight room training, which are strong determinants of success in specific performance measures used to assess elite rowers. Nineteen heavyweight elite males determined their repetition maximum (RM) loads for exercises using a Concept 2 DYNO [5, 30, 60 and 120 RM leg pressing and seated arm pulling (in Joules) ] and free weights [1 <b>RM</b> <b>power</b> clean (in kilograms) and 6 RM bench pull (in kilograms and watts) ]. Rowing performance measures included a 7 -stage blood lactate response ergometer test (aerobic condition), time trials (500, 2000, and 5000 m), a peak stroke power test, and a 60 -minute distance trial. Pearson correlation moments (r + 0. 7) and stepwise multiple linear regression calculations (R 2 + 50 %) were used to establish strong common variances between weight room exercises and rowing ergometer performance (p # 0. 05). Weight room exercises were strong predictors of 2000 -m, 500 -m time (in seconds), and peak stroke power performance measures only.

A 3 <b>RM</b> <b>power</b> clean from the hang was also examined to de-termine if this exercise was related to lower or upper strength and power. The results indicate that maximal strength is highly related to maximal power in all the tests performed (r 5 0. 55 – 0. 89, p # 0. 05). The power clean from the hang is related more to lower-body squat strength and jump squat power (r 5 0. 79) than to upper-body bench press strength or incline bench throw power (r 5 0. 51 – 0. 55).
