40|$|Today’s {{market in}} micro-wind {{turbines}} is in constant development introducing more efficient {{solutions for the}} future. Besides the private use of tower supported turbines, opportunities to integrate wind turbines in the built environment arise. The Integrated Roof Wind Energy System (IRWES) presented in this work is a modular roof structure integrated on top of existing or new buildings. IRWES is build up by an axial array of skewed shaped funnels used for both wind inlet and outlet. This inventive use of shape and geometry leads to a converging air capturing inlet to create high wind mass flow and velocity toward a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) in the center-top of the <b>roof</b> <b>unit</b> for the generation of a relatively high amount of energy. The scope of this research aims to make an optimized structural design of IRWES {{to be placed on}} top of the Vertigo building in Eindhoven; analysis of the structural performance; and impact to the existing structure by means of Finite Element Modeling (FEM). Results show that the obvious impact of wind pressure to the structural design is easily supported in different configurations of fairly simple lightweight structures. In particular, the weight addition to existing buildings remains minimal...|$|E

The nature of the construction is revealed through close inspection of the roof - the <b>roofs</b> of the <b>units</b> don’t join, with the 8 cm gaps covered by glass to prevent water ingress.

40|$|Mine {{planning}} for a new reserve is based on information obtained from exploratory coreholes. A critical component of an exploration program is the geotechnical evaluation. Poor assumptions about roof conditions greatly add to the risks of mining. Rock mechanics testing is central to a geotechnical exploration program. Typically, 3 to 5 uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests are made to characterize a particular <b>roof</b> <b>unit</b> at a given corehole. The average (mean) of these tests is taken as The UCS for that location. Isopach contour maps are then used to show spatial trends in roof strength. Two issues are raised by this traditional approach. The first {{is due to the}} large variability in UCS values that is typical even within a single unit from a single hole. The average UCS might be higher at Corehole A than it is at Corehole B, but the difference may not be statistically significant. The second issue is whether widely spaced coreholes can identify valid spatial trends in rock strength. The answer depends upon whether rock strength changes over distances that are longer or shorter than the corehole spacing. This is a classical geostatistical problem. While geostatics have been used to investigate many coal quality parameters, they have seldom been used to evaluate rock strength. This paper describes an extensive investigation of these issues conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in collaboration with Peabody Energy. The study employed the Peabody Rock Mechanics Data Base which contains more than 10, 000 individual test results. Data from four important roof units were subjected to statistical analysis: Brereton Limestone above the Herrin 6 seam (Illinois) Turner Mine Shale above the No. 9 Seam (Kentucky) Sandstone above the Eagle Coal (West Virginia) Shale above the Eagle Coal (West Virginia) The study did not find significant spatial trends in rock strength in any of the cases. Perhaps there are none, or perhaps the exploration coreholes were just too far apart to see them. These results have valuable implications for the design of geotechical exploration programs...|$|E
40|$|Design {{of timber}} {{structures}} is, in general, based on single-element analyses considering {{the same material}} behaviour for every element (e. g. characteristic strength and stiffness properties). Wood is a material of relatively large variation in strength and stiffness properties. The variation in strength and stiffness can be found between different timber beams as well as within a single beam (Isaksson, 1999). In general, system effects originate from two different mechanisms. The principle of load-sharing effect between beams result in one mechanism, i. e. a weak beam placed beside stronger beams will carry a smaller portion of load due to {{the high degree of}} correlation between stiffness and strength of timber. The type of loading and the distance between the beams influ-ence the extent of load-sharing effect. Another mechanism leading to system effects is the probability of placing the weakest section of a beam in the most stressed position. (Hansson & Isaksson, 2001) carried out a study on the system effect in sheathed parallel-timber-beam structures. Systems are generated using Monte Carlo simulations and the system effects are evaluated by direct comparisons of strengths of single elements and by reliability methods. In this study, system failure was defined as failure of two adjacent beams or failure of any three individual beams in the system. This definition was established in an experimental in-vestigation in Lund (Håkansson and Mauritz, 1999). The purpose of this project is to experi-mentally investigate the system effects of prefabricated roof units. Test methods In principle, evaluation of the results concerning system effects requires information of the strength of each beam placed in the system. Therefore, the strength is determined using non-destructive methods by measuring the bending stiffness of every beam used in the <b>roof</b> <b>unit.</b> A representative selection of 15 beams is tested for bending strength. Assuming a linear relation between bending stiffness and bending strength provides an estimate of the bending strength of the timber material used in the units...|$|E

By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical faces {{at either end of the}} prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' <b>roof</b> <b>units</b> side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the results of}} a study to analyse various longwall operations using the Geophysical Strata rating (GSR) to characterize the strata, assess the likelihood of weighting and then correlate this with the various outputs that can be provided by longwall support monitoring analyses. A significant advantage of integrating GSR and longwall datasets is to allow a 3 D spatial understanding to be developed between strata characteristics and various support loading related parameters. A caving chart has been developed based on a combination of previous experience in longwall support assessment, strata characterisation, leg pressure data analysis and caving behaviour. The chart provides a link between strata conditions, stresses, panel layout and anticipated support loads via design thresholds that are related to roof convergence. The intent is to provide a means to assess the risk of cavities in the immediate roof and/or the risk of heavy weighting from the overlying <b>roof</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} reveals that bending analysis of laminated composite stiffened hypar shells with cutout have not received due attention. Being a doubly ruled surface, a skewed hypar shell fulfils aesthetic as well as ease of casting requirements. Further, this shell allows entry of north light making it suitable as civil engineering <b>roofing</b> <b>units.</b> Hypar shell with cutout subjected to uniformly distributed load exhibits improved performances with stiffeners. Hence relative performances of antisymmetric angle-ply laminated composite stiffened hypar shells in terms of displacements and stress resultants are studied in this paper under static loading. A curved quadratic isoparametric eight noded element and three noded beam elements are used to model the shell surface and the stiffeners respectively. Results obtained {{from the present study}} are compared with established ones to check the correctness of the present approach. A number of additional problems of antisymmetric angle-ply laminated composite stiffened hypar shells are solved for various fibre orientations, number of layers and boundary conditions.

This study considered the behaviour of the PSSDB panel under an out-of plane uniform load to understand the behaviour of the PSSDB panel when it is positioned in a ‘reversed’ position {{in order to make}} it more practical and applicable. In addition, the effect of introducing side timber strips along the edge side of the panel system is also studied. It is found that the timber strips increased the stiffness value from 57. 6 kNm 2 m– 1 to 78. 2 kNm 2 m– 1, i. e., an increase of 35. 8 % compared to panels without timber jointing strips. In fact, the maximum load that can be sustained by the connected panels was increased from 3. 47 kN m– 1 to 6 kN m– 1.
