This tower, along with other parts of Montekristo Estates, was constructed illegally without the necessary permits. It {{was supposed to have}} been demolished in November 2013, but the courts stopped the planning authority MEPA from carrying out the demolition. Since the failed attempt at demolishing the tower and the other illegal structures, new <b>roofing</b> <b>works</b> were carried out on the tower, while more illegal structures were constructed elsewhere in Montekristo Estates. The tower began to be dismantled according to MEPA orders in April 2016.|$|E

50|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>work</b> of {{the choir}} was built in two phases between 1317 and 1323 from east to west, as a rafter roof with collar beam {{position}} and cross strut. The approximately 28 m long roof has a roof pitch of 57°, consists of 24 rafters and includes the polygonal upper fixation {{of the choir}}. The roof turret design was developed in 1496, and the belfry in 1475. Due to the strong inclination of the rafter container of about 97 cm, a pursuit of spruce and fir {{was set up in}} the 17th century. The roof structure was two times repaired what easily is recognizable. The first repair contained, among other things, the installation of the supporting struts, which stabilized the rafter container. Towards {{to the end of the}} 17th century, the second repair was implemented, which concentrated on the eastern chancel. One can note that the inclination of the entire <b>roof</b> <b>work</b> is originated by the pressure of the polygonal choir construction.|$|R

40|$|Problem: Roofs {{receive the}} most intense solar heat load among all {{building}} envelope surfaces in Equatorial-region. Solar heat gain through roof contributes to {{a significant portion of}} building heat load. In tropics where building cooling is needed all-year-round, passive methods to reduce heat gain through roof could provide significant cooling energy-savings. Approach: Currently, the most widely adopted practices to curb the heat flux through roof include using thick building material-layer (30 - 40 cm-thick concrete) or insulation (5 - 10 cm-thick). This study investigates the thermal performance of emerging methods: cool roof and green <b>roof.</b> Cool <b>roof</b> <b>works</b> by applying a coating-layer having high-solar-albedo. Green <b>roof</b> <b>works</b> by adding a soil-layer and vegetation. This study numerically compares the heat curbing performances of these technologies under the tropical climate using an experimentally-calibrated EnergyPlus model. Results and discussion: Cool roof performs best in reducing annual net heat gain in tropical climate of Singapore, which receives abundant irradiation. Cool roof reduces heat gain during day-time and promotes heat loss during night-time. Insulation and green roof are effective in curbing heat gain during day-time but they prevent heat loss during night-time. Research limitations: This paper reports the investigation on a flat concrete roof as the base. Investigations on other roof base materials, e. g., metal roof, will be reported in future. Originality: This is the first study that compares performances of cool roof, green roof and insulation against original concrete roof in tropical climate...|$|R
