50|$|During {{the journey}} {{it became clear}} that repairs had been inadequate. Chains were aded to the {{mainmast}} to help support its topmast, and it was noticed that <b>rivets</b> <b>holding</b> the collar around the mainmast were becoming loose. The ship's carpenter proposed drilling through the mast and inserting a winch handle to ensure the collar stayed in place, but the captain refused. Only the skysail yards were taken down to reduce loading on the masts.|$|R
5000|$|The fleet {{was part}} of the [...] "Super Sprinter" [...] build (the other half of which was the Class 156 fleet) and was built by Leyland with a similar {{construction}} technique to the Pacers, with extensive use of Avdel <b>rivets</b> <b>holding</b> pre-formed panels together in a lightweight body on a welded floor assembly. The large number of windows makes the vehicles look unusually long, although the fact that the vehicles are very long for such a lightly built body has led to a slight sag being apparent in certain coaches.|$|R
50|$|The film {{is based}} on a legend about the Chekavar warriors of present-day north Malabar who {{practise}} the martial art form Kalaripayattu. The film portrays the legend in a different light. According to the legend, Aromal Chekavar, a well-known warrior, lost his life after a duel in which his sword broke off at the hilt during the fight. The metal <b>rivets</b> <b>holding</b> the blade to the hilt had been replaced with wooden ones by his trusted ally and cousin Chandu. Chandu is said to have betrayed his cousin because he was jealous of Aaromal's popularity and abilities.|$|R

5000|$|The first steel for {{the bridge}} arrived on May 18, 1911, and was lowered by derrick {{to the bottom}} of the gorge. Men climbed down rope ladders to attach cables to the steel beams and the steel was hoisted back up both sides of the canyon as the beams were needed. The first train crossed the bridge only four months later on September 17. Half the <b>rivets</b> <b>holding</b> the bridge {{together}} were installed after trains started using the bridge. The bridge was built quickly to facilitate laying the last 25.5 mi of track to Bend where Jim Hill himself drove the [...] "golden" [...] spike on October 5. Dramatic photographs of the bridge's construction were taken by Olof Hedlund of Madras.|$|R
50|$|The widened holes {{opened into}} an {{unguarded}} utility corridor behind the cell tier. From the corridor they {{climbed to the}} roof of their cell block, inside the building, where they set up a small workshop. There, they assembled a variety of stolen and donated materials, including more than 50 raincoats that they turned into makeshift life preservers and a 6 by 14 ft rubber raft, the seams carefully stitched together and sealed with heat from nearby steam pipes. They stole a small accordion-like concertina from another inmate to serve as a bellows to inflate the raft, and built makeshift paddles from scrap wood. Finally, they climbed a ventilation shaft leading to a large fan and grille on the roof and cut away the <b>rivets</b> <b>holding</b> both in place.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the run of}} the {{original}} advert, it was quickly followed up by a [...] "Rematch" [...] advert, featuring the two teams from {{the original}} final. In this script, the two teams played on a set representing the interior hull of the ship, no longer within a cage, and scored goals by hitting the bulkheads within a painted-on rectangle. Furthermore, as there were now only two teams remaining, the target was now to reach 100 goals. The two teams were said to have reached 99-99, meaning that the next goal would win; however, the previous 198 goals and other errant shots meant that the <b>rivets</b> <b>holding</b> the ship together had weakened, so when Lu√≠s Figo scored the winning goal for Os Tornados, there was a hull breach, water rushed in and the two teams had to swim for shore.|$|R

5000|$|According to the ballads, Chandu was a Chekaver (warrior), {{like his}} cousins Aromal Chekavar and Unniyarcha. Chandu Chekaver {{secretly}} hated Aromal's family because {{his love for}} Unniyarcha was spurned. This leads to him taking part as Aromal's helper in a duel ("Ankam") with Aringodar Chekaver. Chandu chekavar allies with Aringodar chekavar and sabotages Aromal's sword by replacing the metal <b>rivets</b> <b>holding</b> the blade to the hilt with wooden ones.During the duel the blade get separated but Aromal picks up the blade and throws it at Aringoder killing him. After that Aromal won, Chandu takes matters {{into his own hands}} and unexpectedly stabs his cousin to death. Henceforth, the word Chathiyan, meaning [...] "Betrayer", is added to his name to indicate his infamy. Unniyarcha, herself a warrior and Aromal's sister, vows revenge for her brother's life. Revenge is finally achieved when her son Aromalunni Chekaver challenges Chandu to a duel and kills him.|$|R
40|$|Metallurgical and {{mechanical}} {{analyses were performed}} on steel and rivet samples recovered from {{the wreck of the}} RMS Titanic. It was found that the steel possessed a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature that was very high with respect to the service temperature, making the material brittle at ice-water temperatures. This has been attributed to both chemical and microstructural factors. It has also been found that the wrought iron rivets used in the construction of Titanic contained an elevated amount of incorporated slag, and that the orientation of the slag within the <b>rivets</b> may <b>hold</b> an explanation for how the ship accumulated damage during its encounter with the iceberg...|$|R
2500|$|On 29 February 2008, the Garden Bridge {{was closed}} to all traffic, in {{preparation}} for its removal. On 1 March 2008, {{as part of the}} Bund Refurbishment Project, an extensive reconfiguration of traffic flow along the Bund, and in preparation for World Expo 2010 to be held in Shanghai, Waibaidu Bridge was cut into two sections, detached from its abutments, and moved by boat into a shipyard in Pudong for extensive repairs and restoration. On 6 April 2008, {{the southern part of the}} bridge was removed and on 7 April 2008, the northern part was removed as well. The restoration work was undertaken by Shanghai Shipyards at its Minsheng Road docks in Pudong, and formally started on 5 April 2008. According to the project engineers, [...] Almost 160,000 <b>rivets</b> <b>hold</b> China's first steel bridge together. Once common practice in the construction industry, the use of rivets has been replaced by welding. Riveting, a dying art, is now only used on a small scale for building railway bridges and ships. Bridge repairers Shanghai Shipyard found and recruited nearly 60 riveters from two factories in Shanhaiguan of Hebei Province and Xi'an of Shaanxi Province and flew them to Shanghai. They worked in four-man groups, heating rivets to between 900 and 1,000 degrees Celsius before hammering them into the structure. [...] "At night, it was like watching a meteor flying across the sky as one worker cast a heated rivet high and the other quickly took it with tools and hammered it on the bridge without a second's delay, a Shanghai Shipyard engineer said.|$|R

The object was identified {{during the study}} of unpublished material from the excavations carried out at the site during 1928 - 1931. It is a circular plate featuring several <b>rivets</b> to <b>hold</b> the straps that were probably made in leather. After presenting the disc {{and the results of}} the EDXRF analysis that identify the metals used in the production of the disc (iron) and the rivets (silver and copper), we analyse its context of provenance and the historical framework of this category of defensive weapon.

40|$|The Szent Istv√°n Kir√°ly Museum of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r {{bought the}} cuirass, {{which had been}} found in the Danube near Pilismar√≥t, from a private {{collector}} in 1982. The breast and back plates of the cuirass were built of bronze plates. The complete cuirass is a unique item and it belongs to the group of cuirasses found in the Danube region [√àaka (Cseke), Ducov√© (Duc√≥), √àierna nad Tisou (√Ågcserny≈ë), Nadap, P√°zm√°ndfalu]. An intact armour was found in grave 12 of Dendra in the Aegean, which was composed of a high, separate neck guard, interlocked plates and a coat-of-chain built of two parts underneath. Two fragmentary cuirasses of the same type are known from the settlement of Thebes. They are dated from the LH II-III A 2 /B 1 period. The shape of the cuirass from the Danube and its high neck guard are similar to the miniature bronze cuirass, worn as a pendant, from the hoard find of Brandgraben (Steiermark) dated from Bz D-Ha A 1 and the bipartite cuirass found in the Seine at Saint-Germain-du-Plain. On this cuirass from the Danube, flat <b>rivets</b> <b>hold</b> the two plates together on both sides. Similar, although conical rivets were used in the cuirasses from √àierna nad Tisou and Saint-Germain-du-Plain. A motive of semicircular, punched dots can be seen {{on the bottom of the}} back plate of the cuirass from the Danube. This and the solution of the shoulder strap on the right shoulder show similarity to the cuirass from Saint-Germain-du-Plain. The finely punched dot row (‚ÄúGleich-Buckel-System‚Äù) and the plastic rib are characteristic decorations of the cuirasses of the Danube region. The cuirass from the Danube cannot exactly be dated in lack of accompanying finds nevertheless the listed characteristic suggest that it came from the Bz D-Ha A 1 period...|$|R

40|$|Payload Fairing (PLF) of {{a launch}} vehicle protects the payload from {{excessive}} thermal loads, acoustic vibrations, aerodynamic loads and other undesirable environmental influences during the atmospheric ascent {{phase of the}} flight. The Payload Fairing (PLF) of LVM 3 consists of four segments, the Boat Tail, the Cylinder, the Nose Cone and the Nose Cap. It has a cylinder diameter of 5 m and a semi-cone angle of 200 for the boat-tail and nose cone portions. The overall height of the structure is 10. 65 m. In order to save structural mass and minimize fabrication time, the PLF is realized using sandwich construction with carbon/epoxy face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core and assembled with aluminium alloy interface rings at all the segment joints. It is constructed in two halves with the longitudinal joints formed using a Linear Bellow System (LBS). The LBS consists of a linear piston-cylinder <b>riveted</b> structure <b>holding</b> a reinforced rubber bellow in folded condition and accommodates a Mild Detonating Cord (MDC) for pyro separation. For qualification of the structural elements of the payload fairing, a full-scale structural test is to be conducted. This involves simulation of aerodynamic pressure on the nose cap and nose cone areas and shear force application at three levels of bulkhead segment joints. This project brings {{out the details of}} the methodology, loads, test set-up and procedure for this test. For this purpose two pressure chambers are used in nose cone and nose cap regions for the simulation of aerodynamic pressures. So this paper includes the Design, Modeling and Finite Element Analysis of these pressure chambers...|$|R
5000|$|Veera joined Gautham Menon's directorial team in 2006 {{and worked}} with him during the {{production}} of Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006) and Pachaikili Muthucharam (2007), before being announced {{as one of the}} four new male leads in a film titled Chennaiyil Oru Mazhaikaalam to be directed by Menon. The film, set in the backdrop of Chennai's booming IT industry, began its shoot in mid 2007 with Trisha Krishnan leading an ensemble cast but was later delayed and then eventually shelved. Veera then continued his work with Menon as an assistant director, and featured in a small role of an army commando in the Suriya-starrer Vaaranam Aayiram (2008). Veera made his debut as a lead actor with Menon's psychological thriller Nadunisi Naaygal, in which he played a psychopath murderer. He revealed in order to prepare for the role he trained with a Chennai-based psychiatrist, Rangarajan, and learnt typical mannerisms and behavioural patterns shown by psychopaths. The film, which had been long in production, opened to mixed reviews in February 2011 from critics and did not perform well commercially. However Veera won rave reviews for his portrayal, with a critic from Sify.com noting [...] "for a first timer, Veera as the psychopath with split personality makes a lasting impression in a well-written role" [...] and that [...] "he is <b>riveting</b> and <b>holds</b> the film together with his performance". Similarly another reviewer from Times of India stated [...] "Veera has tremendous screen presence and fulfils the faith reposed in him by the director", and his performance saw him garner a nomination for at the Vijay Awards in 2011 for Best Debut Actor.|$|R
40|$|Joint is {{combining}} {{two or more}} component for an application. Rivet joint is {{a method}} to joint two components in real world. Nowadays, rivet joint commonly used in manufacturing industry, automobile industry and also in aerospace industry due to the good clam-up, lightweight and good in corrosion resistance. This thesis deal with the loading {{for a group of}} aluminium AA 5052 blind rivet pop with the steel plate AISI 1006. This assessment have two objectives which first to investigate the shear stress on a group of aluminium rivet and second to determine whether centroid of joint influence the strength of joint. Six different geometry of riveted joint was design to achieve the objectives. Three from six design were used to design in variable rivet distance from centroid but constant in angle from centroid meanwhile the other three were designs with constant rivet distance from centroid and different in angle from centroid. The experiment was used the Shimadzu Tensile Test Machine for testing the design in axial force. Result obtained from experiment will be compared to the simulation by using Algor Fempro. From the result, the farthest distance <b>rivets</b> from centroid <b>hold</b> the highest load and the centroid influence the strength of joint. The best position will hold the highest load, highest stress and highest shear is at position of rivet 21 mm distance from centroid and angle 51 ¬∞...|$|R
60|$|At {{the bottom}} of her heart she had both fear and {{contempt}} of all towns-people, whom she generalized from her experience of them as summer folks of a greater or lesser silliness. She often found herself unable to cope with them, even when she felt that she had twice their sense; she perceived that they had something from their training that with all her undisciplined force she could never hope to win from her own environment. But she believed that her son would have the advantages which baffled her in them, for he would have their environment; and she had wished him to <b>rivet</b> his <b>hold</b> upon those advantages by taking a wife from among them, and by living the life of their world. Her wishes, of course, had no such distinct formulation, and the feeling she had toward Cynthia as a possible barrier to her ambition had no more definition. There had been times when the fitness of her marriage with Jeff had moved the mother's heart to a jealousy that she always kept silent, while she hoped for the accident or the providence which should annul the danger. But Genevieve Vostrand had not been the kind of accident or the providence that she would have invoked, and when she saw Jeff's fancy turning toward her, Mrs. Durgin had veered round to Cynthia. All the same she kept a keen eye upon the young ladies among the summer folks who came to Lion's Head, and tacitly canvassed their merits and inclinations with respect to Jeff in the often-imagined event of his caring for any one of them. She found that her artfully casual references to her son's being in Harvard scarcely affected their mothers in the right way. The fact made them think of the head waiters whom they had met at other hotels, and who were working their way through Dartmouth or Williams or Yale, and it required all the force of Jeff's robust personality to dissipate their erroneous impressions of him. He took their daughters out of their arms and from under their noses on long drives upon his buckboard, and it became a convention with them to treat his attentions somewhat like those of a powerful but faithful vassal.|$|R
