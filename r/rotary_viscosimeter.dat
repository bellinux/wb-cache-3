Test {{results show that the}} optimal ratio of ultra-fine fly ash, ultra-fine slag, zeolite powder and silica fume are respectively 20 %, 20 %, 10 % and 8 %. And the optimized mix proportion is the composition of 8 % silica fume and 12 % slag. By using water reducing agent and mineral admixtures we could get the cement paste which has good liquidity and no bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Four {{kinds of}} {{solutions}} were prepared by dissolving cellulose acetate in dichloromethane, formic acid, acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid respectively, {{and then were}} electrospun into fibers. The solutions were characterized for their viscosity and conductivity using <b>rotary</b> <b>viscosimeter</b> and conductivity meter, respectively. The morphology and performance of the electrospun CA fibers were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), digital microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that the important factors determining the electro-spinnability of the CA solutions were boiling point, viscosity and conductivity of the resulting solutions. 8 % CA spinning solution with trifluoroacetic acid as solvent had good spinnability, and the average diameter reached 236 nm; the obtained fibers were mainly amorphous, but characterized for good mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{viscosity}} measurtement of molten rocks. The reason of such investigation {{was due to the}} solving of SC No. 95 / 135 / 059 LITHO-JET. Technology of thermic rock melting for trenching of tenous vertical works. One task in the scope of above investigation was to experimentally verify the properties of melts of various types of works. An important moment in the trenching of tenuous vertical works by rock melting is the ability of melt to penetrate into the rock cracks. From this point of view an important physical property of molten rock is its viscosity. There are various methods how to measure viscosity but for the continuous measurements just some of them are suitable. The most suitable is <b>rotary</b> <b>viscosimeter</b> because it is simple in its construction, it allows to measure the viscosity as a function of temperature, concentration of wide class of sub stances with different rheologic properties. Hence, it allows to measure structural viscosity of the chemical reaction systems. The viscosity of molten nefelitic basanite as the function of temperature is studied in this paper. Viscosity of the nefelinitic basanite taken at locality Konrádovce was measured using <b>rotary</b> <b>viscosimeter</b> HAAKE ROTOVISKO. Eperimental conditions shown, that rising of the temperature vs. viscosity is in reverse order. Measurement is realised in scale 1370 - 1550 °C. Under 1370 °C was sample very viscous and measurement was impossible. Viscosity is the function of the temperature, pressure and gas components of rock. Though the viscosity measurements was carried out at atmospheric pressure, what does not fully conform real condition during trenching, it is still possible to express the effect of pressure. Other conditions, which take effect of viscosityof molten rocks in nature conditions will be subject of future investigation...|$|E
