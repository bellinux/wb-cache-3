40|$|Abstract — Three decades ago, {{theoretical}} physicists {{suggested that}} the controlled <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> could result in electronic circuitry whose power dissipation approaches thermodynamic limits, growing at a significantly slower pace than the fCV 2 rate for CMOS switching power. Early engineering research in this field, which became generally known as adiabatic computing, focused on the asymptotic energetics of computation, exploring VLSI designs that use reversible logic and adiabatic switching to preserve information and achieve nearly zero power dissipation as operating frequencies approach zero. Recent advances in CMOS VLSI design have taken us to real working chips that rely on controlled charge recovery to operate at substantially lower power dissipation levels than their conventional counterparts. Although their origins {{can be traced back}} to the early adiabatic circuits, these so-called energyrecovering systems approach charge recycling from a more practical angle, achieving operating frequencies in the hundreds of MHz with relatively low overhead. Among other energy recovering designs, researchers in the field have demonstrated microcontrollers, standard-cell ASICs, SRAMs, LCD panel drivers, I/O drivers, and multi-GHz clock networks. In this tutorial, we will present an overview of the field, focusing on the most promising charge recovering design techniques for ASICs that are close to integration into the field. I...|$|E

Among other potential benefits of operation at cryogenic temperatures are the use of large low-resistivity wafers, simple processing, higher and faster electrical signal because of higher mobility and drift velocity of carriers, and lower noise of the readout circuit.

40|$|Changes {{in holding}} {{potential}} (Vh), affect both gating charge (the Q(Vh) curve) and peak ionic current (the F(Vh) curve) seen at positive test potentials. Careful {{comparison of the}} Q(Vh) and F(Vh) distributions indicates that these curves are similar, having two slopes (approximately 2. 5 e for Vh from - 115 to - 90 mV and approximately 4 e for Vh from - 90 to - 65 mV) and very negative midpoints (approximately - 86 mV). Thus, gating charge movement and channel availability appear closely coupled under fully-equilibrated conditions. The time course by which channels approach equilibration was explored using depolarizing prepulses of increasing duration. The high slope component seen in the F(Vh) and Q(Vh) curves is not evident following short depolarizing prepulses in which the prepulse duration approximately corresponds to the settling time for fast inactivation. Increasing the prepulse duration to 10 ms or longer reveals the high slope, and left-shifts the midpoint to more negative voltages, towards the F(Vh) and Q(Vh) distributions. These results indicate that a separate slow-moving voltage sensor affects the channels at prepulse durations greater than 10 ms. Charge movement and channel availability remain closely coupled as equilibrium is approached using depolarizing pulses of increasing durations. Both measures are 50 % complete by 50 ms at a prepulse potential of - 70 mV, with proportionately faster onset rates when the prepulse potential is more depolarized. By contrast, charge movement and channel availability dissociate during recovery from prolonged depolarizations. <b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> gating <b>charge</b> is considerably faster than <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> sodium ionic current after equilibration at depolarized potentials. <b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> gating <b>charge</b> at - 140 mV, is 65 % complete within approximately 100 ms, whereas less than 30 % of ionic current has recovered by this time. Thus, charge movement and channel availability appear to be uncoupled during recovery, although both rates remain voltage sensitive. These data suggest that channels remain inactivated due to a separate process operating in parallel with the fast gating charge. We demonstrate that this behavior can be simulated by a model in which the fast charge movement associated with channel activation is electrostatically-coupled to a separate slow voltage sensor responsible for the slow inactivation of channel conductance...|$|R

We attribute this to triplet-triplet annihilation and the formation of higher energy excited states that subsequently underwent charge transfer. This unique dip and <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> population is a clear indication that triplets are formed by non-geminate recombination, as such a kinetic is incompatible with a monomolecular triplet state formation process...|$|R

There was so much noisy conversation, and congratulation, and indignation, that {{the remainder of the}} family were soon awakened, and Smike received a warm and cordial welcome, not only from Kate, but from Mrs Nickleby also, who assured him of her future favour and regard, and was so obliging as to relate, for his entertainment and that of the assembled circle, a most remarkable account extracted from some work the name of which she had never known, of a miraculous escape from some prison, but what one she couldn't remember, effected by an officer whose name she had forgotten, confined for some crime which she didn't clearly recollect.|$|R
40|$|The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> {{collection}} efficiency (CCE) at low temperatures, the so-called "Lazarus effect", was studied in Si detectors irradiated by fast reactor neutrons, by protons of medium and high energy, by pions and by gamma-rays. The experimental {{results show that}} the Lazarus effect is observed: (a) after all types of irradiation; (b) before and after space charge sign inversion; (c) only in detectors that are biased at voltages resulting in partial depletion at room temperature. The experimental temperature dependence of the CCE for proton- irradiated detectors shows non-monotonic behaviour with a maximum at a temperature defined as the CCE recovery temperature. The model of the effect for proton-irradiated detectors agrees well with that developed earlier for detectors irradiated by neutrons. The same midgap acceptor-type and donor-type levels are responsible for the Lazarus effect in detectors irradiated by neutrons and by protons. A new, abnormal "zigzag"-shaped temperature dependence of the CCE was observed for detectors irradiated by all particles (neutrons, protons and pions) and by an ultra-high dose of gamma-rays, when operating at low bias voltages. This effect is explained in the framework of the double-peak electric field distribution model for heavily irradiated detectors. The redistribution <b>of</b> the space <b>charge</b> region depth between the depleted regions adjacent to p(+) and n(+) contacts is responsible for the "zigzag"-shaped curves. It is shown that the CCE recovery temperature increases with reverse bias in all detectors, regardless of the type of radiation...|$|R
