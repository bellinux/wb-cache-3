25|$|In 1998 Yamaha marketed a 1000cc four {{cylinder}} <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> {{called the}} YZF 'R1', this model {{introduced a new}} style of gearbox design which shortened the overall length of the motor/gearbox case, to allow a more compact unit. This, in turn allowed the motor {{to be placed in}} the frame further forward, designed to improve handling in a short wheel-based frame.|$|E
25|$|A {{handful of}} bicycle frames {{are made from}} {{magnesium}} which has around 64% the density of aluminum. In the 1980s, an engineer, Frank Kirk, devised a novel form of frame that was die cast in one piece and composed of I beams rather than tubes. A company, Kirk Precision Ltd, was established in Britain to manufacture both <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> and mountain bike frames with this technology. However, despite some early commercial success, there were problems with reliability and manufacture stopped in 1992.|$|E

500|$|The final rider {{to set off}} was {{the race}} leader Tony Gallopin (...) [...] Gallopin was 36 seconds ahead of Porte {{overnight}} and expressed hope {{that he would be}} able to defend his lead and take overall victory. Immediately after he set off, however, he was nervous and uncomfortable on his bike. (Gallopin, like most of the riders, was riding a conventional <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> with aero bars attached.) At the intermediate time check, he was already 58 seconds behind Porte; he lost another 41 seconds in the second part of the stage. His time of 22' 02" [...] meant he finished 29th on the stage and lost the yellow jersey. He dropped to sixth place overall.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, former cyclist Davide Cassani {{claimed in}} a YouTube video that Fabian Cancellara {{had used a}} {{motorized}} bike during his victories at the Tour of Flanders and the Paris–Roubaix that year. In the video, Cassani showed a normal <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> on a stand and after he pressed a button, the pedals began to rotate. Cassani then alleged that a motor could easily be stowed in the seattube of the bike and the button {{to turn it on}} would be located on the handlebars. In the YouTube video, Cassani showed clips of Cancellara at the two races allegedly [...] "turning on" [...] the motor while riding and showing the drastic increase in speed. The claims caught steam since rumors were already going around about riders possibly using the new motor, the Gruber Assist, which could produce 100 Watts of power to aid the rider.|$|E

500|$|Simpson {{was born}} on 30 November 1937 in Haswell, County Durham, the {{youngest}} of six children of coal miner Tom Simpson and his wife Alice (née Cheetham). His {{father had been a}} semi-professional sprinter in athletics. The family lived modestly in a small terraced house until 1943, when his parents took charge of the village's working men's club and lived above it. In 1950 the Simpsons moved to Harworth on the Nottinghamshire–Yorkshire border, where young Simpson's maternal aunt lived; new coalfields were opening, with employment opportunities for him and older brother Harry, by now, the only children left at home. Simpson rode his first bike, his brother-in-law's, at age 12, sharing it with Harry and two cousins for time trials around Harworth. Following Harry, Tom joined Harworth & District CC (Cycling Club) aged 13. He delivered groceries in the Bassetlaw district by bicycle and traded with a customer for a better <b>road</b> <b>bike.</b> He was often left behind in club races; members of his cycling club nicknamed him [...] "four-stone Coppi", after Italian rider Fausto Coppi, due to his slim physique.|$|E

Vandenbergh's time of 3' 50" [...] was marginally beaten by Sébastien Minard of , setting the tone {{for most of the}} stage with numerous placings set to be settled by tenths of a second. [...] sprinter Nacer Bouhanni, riding a <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> for the course, was the first rider to go beneath 3' 50", as he set a time of 3' 47". However, his stay at the top was also short-lived as 's Maarten Tjallingii went three seconds quicker to move {{to the top of the}} timesheets. [...] sprinter Borut Božič was the next rider to assume the stage lead, as he set a time of 3' 40"; his time was ultimately good enough for a final placing of eighth. Božič's time provided a stiff test for the majority of the field, as his time held on at the top for over half an hour, but Peter Velits (...) ultimately went quicker by less than a second to take the lead.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1986, Bridgestone {{models were}} {{numbered}} in multiples of 100, {{with the higher}} numbers indicating a higher end bike. [...] The entry level <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> in 1986, for example, {{may have been the}} Bridgestone 100, while the Bridgestone 700 would have been a competition level race bike. [...] Beginning in 1987 there was a change, with model designations consisting of two letters followed by a numeral. [...] The letters indicated the type of bike, and the number indicated the position in the product lineup. [...] The numbering was also reversed, with the smaller numbers indicating a higher position in the product line. [...] For example, the RB-1 would have been the top of the line <b>road</b> <b>bike,</b> followed by the RB-2, RB-3, etc.|$|E

2500|$|When first {{riding a}} fixed gear, a cyclist {{used to a}} {{freewheel}} may try to freewheel, or coast, particularly when approaching corners or obstacles. Since coasting is not possible {{this can lead to}} a [...] "kick" [...] to the trailing leg, and even to loss of control of the bicycle. Riding at high speed around corners can be difficult on a <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> converted into a fixed-gear bicycle, as the pedals can strike the road, resulting in loss of control. Proper track bikes have a higher bottom bracket to compensate for the constantly spinning cranks and largely mitigate this problem.|$|E
2500|$|The SF {{evolved to}} include disc brakes and cast alloy wheels. Developed from the 750S <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> was the 750 SFC (super freni competizione), a half-faired racer that was {{developed}} to win endurance events like the Oss 24 hours, Barcelona 24 hours and the Bol D'Or at Le Mans. [...] This it did, often placed first, second and third in the same race, and dominating the international endurance race circuit in 1971. [...] Distinguished by its characteristic orange paint which would become the company's race department colour, its smooth aerodynamic fairing and upswept exhaust, the SFC was Laverda's flagship product and best advertisement, flaunting pedigree and the message of durability, quality, and exclusivity. [...] The SFC [...] "Series 15,000" [...] was featured in the Guggenheim Museum in New York's 1999 exhibit The Art of the Motorcycle {{as one of the}} most iconic bikes of the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|A notable rider {{could not}} start the stage, David Zabriskie (...) crashed during a {{reconnaissance}} ride {{and had to}} abandon. A choice faced the riders as they devised their strategy for the time trial: should they lose time {{at the foot of}} the final climb to switch to a normal <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> or power through with their aerodynamic machine not suited for steep climbing? The choices differed, as Michael Rogers opted for a change, while Tejay van Garderen (...) continued on the TT bike. Kristijan Koren (...) was the first rider to complete the course under the 51 minutes bar, but then Rohan Dennis (...) exploded that time with a chrono of 49 minutes 20 seconds. Frenchman Sylvain Chavanel (...) then scored an honorable time, a little more than a minute in arrears of Dennis. Overall contenders who lost time on the last day's echelon, Lawson Craddock (...) , Chad Haga (...) , Philip Deignan (...) and Francisco Mancebo (...) all performed well enough to keep their top ten overall placings.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, Ducati earned {{its place}} in motorcycling history by {{producing}} the fastest 250cc <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> then available, the Mach 1. In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement V-twin [...] motorcycles and in 1973, released a V-twin with the trademarked desmodromic valve design. In 1985, Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the [...] "Cagiva" [...] name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the [...] "Ducati" [...] name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from Texas Pacific Group and sold a 51% {{stake in the company}} for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an initial public offering of Ducati stock and renamed the company [...] "Ducati Motor Holding SpA". TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi.|$|E
2500|$|With {{less than}} a minute {{covering}} the top five, the final stage was the one to decide the general classification of the 2013 Tour de Suisse. The final time trial stage was set up unconventionally, with the [...] itinerary split into two distinct sections. The opening [...] from the start in Bad Ragaz was flat, heading towards the first intermediate time-check at Flums. From there on, the route headed upwards towards the finish at Flumserberg. The first element of the climb towards the second time-check averaged around 8.5% over a distance of , with the final [...] slightly steeper, averaging 9.5%. Such was the climb, it was expected that riders would start the stage on time-trial machinery, before stopping to change to a <b>road</b> <b>bike</b> prior to the climb. As was customary of time trial stages, cyclists set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification {{at the end of the}} previous stage. Thus, Olivier Kaisen of , who, in 151st place, trailed overall leader Mathias Frank (...) by one hour, thirty minutes and forty seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.|$|E
