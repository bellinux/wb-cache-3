500|$|When an {{interviewer}} in 1988 {{asked about the}} Bulletin Board System jargon in his writing, Gibson answered [...] "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote Neuromancer"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote Neuromancer on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as [...] "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't <b>really</b> <b>use</b> it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson {{did not have an}} email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch how people behave around them.

2500|$|On 20 July, the {{producers}} went on another expedition, to Dorogobuzh, {{in order to}} film the Battle of Borodino and the related parts of the plot. Photography could not be carried out in Borodino itself, {{mainly because of the}} many memorials located there. On 1 August, work was commenced. The shooting of the battle itself began on 25 August 1963 – its 151st anniversary by the Julian Calendar. 13,500 soldiers and 1,500 horsemen substituted for the historical armies. Several reports in the Western press have put the number of soldiers who participated at 120,000; however, in an interview to National Geographic in 1986, when asked [...] "did he <b>really</b> <b>use</b> 120,000 soldiers for the battle of Borodino?", Bondarchuk answered: [...] "that is exaggeration, all I had was 12,000." [...] The troops were supposed to return to their bases after thirteen days, but eventually remained for three months. 23 tons of gunpowder, handled by 120 sappers, and 40,000 liters of kerosene were used for the pyrotechnics, as well as 10,000 smoke grenades. Tens of thousands of cubic meters of soil were dug out to construct earthworks resembling the Bagration flèches and the Raevsky redoubt. The set was divided to sectors, and a system of loudspeakers was installed – one for each area – to enable the director to coordinate the troops' movements. On 4 November, the session ended and Bondarchuk went back to Moscow.|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe fame played drums on [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". Due {{to various}} {{personal}} and legal struggles, Lee {{was living in}} the studio for a time during the recording of the album. Humphrey was a good friend of Lee's, and had previously worked with his band prior to the production of Hellbilly Deluxe. Zombie later asked Lee to appear on the album, with Lee agreeing to do so. On the collaboration, Lee stated [...] "I went to his house after I got out of jail to stay for a while, and I think I was there about a day or two and they were working on the record downstairs and Scott and Rob were like, 'Dude, Tommy’s upstairs, we should ask him to play.' And they asked me to play and I was like, 'I would love to play right now. I could <b>really</b> <b>use</b> ... you know, just kind of check out, really do some music' and I ended up playing like four tracks or so on the record." [...] Lee is credited as the drummer for [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] was originally referred to as [...] "Creature Core" [...] prior to the release of the album.

In the case of Udaipur, the feet of the passengers have worn the rock veins that crop out everywhere, smooth and shiny; and in the rains the narrow gullies must spout like fire-hoses. The people have been untouched by cholera for four years, proof that Providence looks after those who do not look after themselves, for Neemuch Cantonment, a hundred miles away, suffered grievously last summer. [...] "And what do you make in Udaipur?" [...] "Swords," [...] said the man in the shop, throwing down an armful of tulwars, kuttars, and khandas on the stones. [...] "Do you want any? Look here!" [...] Hereat, he took up one of the commoner swords and flourished it in the sunshine. Then he bent it double, and, as it sprang straight, began to make it [...] "speak." [...] Arm-venders in Udaipur are a sincere race, for they sell to people who <b>really</b> <b>use</b> their wares. The man in the shop was rude--distinctly so. His first flush of professional enthusiasm abated, he took stock of the Englishman and said calmly: [...] "What do you want with a sword?" [...] Then he picked up his goods and retreated, while certain small boys, who deserved a smacking, laughed riotously from the coping of a little temple hard by. Swords seem to be the sole manufacture of the place. At least, none of the inhabitants the Englishman spoke to could think of any other.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, however {{such things}} might be, {{she was to}} have {{occasion}} to say to herself {{that there might be}} but a deeper treachery in recoveries and reassurances. She was to feel alone again, as she had felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband during their return from meeting the Castledeans in Eaton Square. The evening in question had left her with a larger alarm, but then a lull had come--the alarm, after all, was yet to be confirmed. There came an hour, inevitably, when she knew, with a chill, what she had feared and why; it had taken, this hour, a month to arrive, but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it, for it showed her sharply what Amerigo had meant in alluding to a particular use that they might make, for their reaffirmed harmony and prosperity, of Charlotte. The more she thought, at present, of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this resource, the more it came back to her as the product of a conscious art of dealing with her. He had been conscious, at the moment, of many things--conscious even, not a little, of desiring; and thereby of needing, to see what she would do in a given case. The given case would be that of her being to a certain extent, as she might fairly make it out, MENACED-- horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word. Why it was that to speak of making her stepmother intervene, as they might call it, in a question that seemed, just then and there, quite peculiarly their own business--why it was that a turn so familiar and so easy should, at the worst, strike her as charged with the spirit of a threat, was an oddity disconnected, for her, temporarily, from its grounds, the adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its way. That, precisely, was doubtless why she had learned to wait, as the weeks passed by, with a fair, or rather indeed with an excessive, imitation of resumed serenity. There had been no prompt sequel to the Prince's equivocal light, and that made for patience; yet she was none the less to have to admit, after delay, that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home, and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension. The consequence of this, in turn, was a renewed pang in presence of his remembered ingenuity. To be ingenious with HER--what DIDN'T, what mightn't that mean, when she had so absolutely never, at any point of contact with him, put him, by as much as the value of a penny, to the expense of sparing, doubting, fearing her, of having in any way whatever to reckon with her? The ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use of Charlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree, and his triumph, on the occasion, had been just in the simplicity. She couldn't--and he knew it--say what was true: [...] "Oh, you 'use' her, and I use her, if you will, yes; but we use her ever so differently and separately--not at all in the same way or degree. There's nobody we <b>really</b> <b>use</b> together but ourselves, don't you see?--by which I mean that where our interests are the same I can so beautifully, so exquisitely serve you for everything, and you can so beautifully, so exquisitely serve me. The only person either of us needs is the other of us; so why, as a matter of course, in such a case as this, drag in Charlotte?" ...|$|E
