25|$|Caltrain bought 14 {{remanufactured}} Budd <b>Rail</b> <b>Diesel</b> <b>Car</b> ("Boise Budd") single-level {{cars from}} Virginia Railway Express around 2000 {{for use on}} Special-Event trains. A seven-car special train took fans to the first game at Pac Bell Park on March 31, 2000. The northbound train ran at an estimated 125% of capacity and skipped stops after Hillsdale because it was already well above seated capacity. These cars were sold in 2005 after Bombardier cars were delivered and are now in service on the Grand Canyon Railway.|$|E
25|$|The Budd <b>Rail</b> <b>Diesel</b> <b>Car,</b> RDC or Buddliner is a {{self-propelled}} diesel {{multiple unit}} (DMU) railcar. Between 1949 and 1962, 398 RDCs were built by the Budd Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The cars were primarily adopted for passenger service in rural areas with low traffic density or in short-haul commuter service, and were less expensive to operate in this context than a traditional diesel locomotive-drawn train with coaches. The cars could be used singly or several could be coupled together in train sets and controlled from the cab of the front unit. The RDC {{was one of the}} few DMU trains to achieve commercial success in North America. RDC trains were an early example of self-contained {{diesel multiple unit}} trains, an arrangement now in common use by railways all over the world.|$|E

500|$|Later in the year, Amtrak {{began an}} {{accelerated}} repair {{program on the}} unmodified cars, which had logged over [...] in revenue service, but very few cars were actually repaired. By the end of 1975, out-of-service rate was still 27.5%, and many trains ran with fewer cars than demand called for. In February 1976, Amtrak cut Metroliner service from 15 to 13 round trips {{because of the lack}} of serviceable cars. In August, Budd unveiled the SPV-2000, a <b>Rail</b> <b>Diesel</b> <b>Car</b> successor built with the Metroliner shell design. Although heavily marketed, the SPV-2000s were extremely unreliable and never achieved the widespread use of the Metroliners and Amfleets.|$|E

This vehicle was fitted with a 6-cylinder Leyland O.350 diesel to power the air-conditioning, buffet and lighting. This was later replaced with a Leyland O.400 diesel. BRB 1181 was easily distinguished from the other cars by having a smaller roof dome.|$|E
