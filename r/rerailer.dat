50|$|The {{trains are}} powered by three 1.5 V AA batteries, an {{optional}} AC adapter, or a USB plug. The {{direction of the}} train is changed by pressing a button. The control system includes two infrared sensors that can be clipped to the track. These sensors are used to automatically change {{the direction of the}} train if it is being operated on a linear (or point-to-point) track configuration, as opposed to a continuous loop. The throttle allows for either instant reversing, or reversing after a delay of approximately 5 seconds. The basic track set includes an oval of track, controller, electrical feeder, two sensors, <b>rerailer,</b> and a wheel cleaning device for the powered trains. The AC adapter is available separately; plug versions for continental Europe, Britain and USA are available.|$|E
