J- 113397 facilitated motor activity in naïve mice at low doses (0. 1 – 1 mg/kg) and inhibited it at higher ones (10 mg/kg). Likewise, in MPTP-treated mice, J- 113397 <b>reversed</b> <b>motor</b> deficit at 0. 01 mg/kg but worsened hypokinesia at higher doses (1 mg/kg).

Single-cell recordings were performed in sham-operated rats, in 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals and in rats receiving chronic l-dopa treatment following dopamine (DA) denervation.

Conversely, no change was detected in the sensitivity of presynaptic D 2 DA receptors modulating striatal GABA transmission in both parkinsonian and l-dopa-treated rats.

40|$|Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a 20 -aminoacid peptide that {{selectively}} activates a G-protein coupled receptor named NPSR. Preclinical {{studies have}} shown that NPSR activation promotes anxiolysis, hyperlocomo-tion, arousal and weakfullness. Previous findings suggest that dopamine neurotransmission plays a role in the actions of NPS. Based on the close relationship between dopamine and Parkinson disease (PD) and on the evidence that NPSR are expressed on brain dopaminergic nuclei, the present study investi-gated the effects of NPS in motor deficits induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6 -OHDA in the mouse rotarod test. 6 -OHDA injection evoked motor deficits and significantly reduced tyrosine hidroxylase (TH) -positive cells in the substantia nigra (SN) and ven-tral tegmental area.

We report that AAVshDyrk 1 A efficiently transduced HEK 293 cells and primary neuronal cultures, triggering the specific inhibition of Dyrk 1 A expression. Injecting the vector into the striata of TgDyrk 1 A mice resulted in a restricted, long-term transduction of the striatum.

40|$|Spasticity {{arises from}} {{hyperexcitability}} of the neural stretch reflex arc secondary to injury of the corticospinal tract. In response to injury, {{the density of}} glutamatergic inputs from afferent 1 A fibers to motor neurons increases dramatically and adaptive changes occur in the morphology of microglia cells in the spinal cord. SUMMARY: Involvement of the endocannabinoid system in pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for spasticity has been demonstrated in animal models of MS. Stimulation of cannabinoid (CB) 1 receptors reduces the hyperglutamatergic drive from sensory afferents to spinal cord motor neurons and blocks the synaptic effects of activated microglia and pro-inflammatory mediators (e. g. TNF-α) on glutamatergic transmission. Enhancing corticospinal tract excitability through intermittent theta burst stimulation inhibits the stretch reflex and spasticity by promoting long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity that requires stimulation of CB 1 receptors. Evidence indicates that the antispasticity effects of THC:CBD oromucosal spray (Sativex®) are associated with enhanced cortical long-term potentiation. Key Messages: Glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways {{are involved in the}} regulation of muscle tone. CB 1 receptors, which are associated with movement, postural control, and pain and sensory perception, influence glutamatergic pathways. THC:CBD oromucosal spray was shown to <b>reverse</b> <b>motor</b> cortex plasticity from long-term depression through long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, thereby restoring, at least in part, effective corticospinal inputs to spinal circuits...|$|R

Triggers for neuromuscular junction degeneration remain to be determined, but the axon repulsion factor semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A), which is derived from terminal Schwann cells, is a plausible candidate. This study examines the hypothesis that Sema 3 A signaling through its motor neuron neuropilin- 1 (NRP 1) receptor triggers distal axonopathy and muscle denervation in the SOD 1 G 93 A mouse model of ALS. Neuropilin- 1 {{was found to be}} expressed in axonal terminals at the mouse neuromuscular junction in vivo and in NSC- 34 motor neuronYlike cells in vitro. In differentiated NSC- 34 cells, an anti-NRP 1 A antibody that selectively blocks Sema 3 A binding to NRP 1 prevented Sema 3 A-induced growth cone collapse.

PD is clinically characterized by development of motor disturbances, such as bradykinesia, resting tremors, rigidity and a later loss of postural reflexes. Oxidative stress is a hallmark factor where the oxidation of dopamine generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and an unbalanced production ROS induces neuronal damage, therefor leading the neuronal death. Gallic Acid (GA) and its derivatives are present in the plant kingdom and acts as a potent antioxidant. Wistar male rats devided into seven groups randomly with 8 in each.

Initially, 16 μg 6 -OHDA (6 -OHDA group) or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid - aCSF; Sham group) was infused into the right MFB of adult male Wistar rats. Fifteen days after surgery, the 6 -OHDA and Sham groups were randomly subdivided and received ipsilateral injection of either 60 mM NMDA or aCSF in the right STN. Additionally, a control group was not submitted to stereotaxic surgery. Five groups of rats were studied: 6 -OHDA/NMDA, 6 -OHDA/Sham, Sham/ NMDA, Sham/Sham, and control. Fourteen days after injection of 6 -OHDA, rats were submitted to the rotational test induced by apomorphine (0. 1 mg/kg, ip) and to the open-field test. The same tests were performed again 14 days after NMDA-induced lesion of the STN. The STN lesion reduced the contralateral turns induced by apomorphine and blocked the progression of motor impairment in the open-field test in 6 -OHDA-treated rats. However, lesion of the STN did not prevent the reduction of striatal concentrations of dopamine and metabolites or the number of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons after 6 -OHDA lesion.

40|$|Effective {{dopamine}} (DA) neuron differentiation from neural {{precursor cells}} (NPCs) is prerequisite for precursor/stem cell-based therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nurr 1, an orphan nuclear receptor, {{has been reported}} as a transcription factor that can drive DA neuron differentiation from non-dopaminergic NPCs in vitro. However, Nurr 1 alone neither induces full neuronal maturation nor expression of proteins found specifically in midbrain DA neurons. In addition, Nurr 1 expression is inefficient in inducing DA phenotype expression in NPCs derived from certain species such as mouse and human. We show here that Foxa 2, a forkhead transcription factor whose role in midbrain DA neuron development was recently revealed, synergistically cooperates with Nurr 1 to induce DA phenotype acquisition, midbrain-specific gene expression, and neuronal maturation. Thus, the combinatorial expression of Nurr 1 and Foxa 2 in NPCs efficiently yielded fully differentiated nigral (A 9) -type midbrain neurons with clearly detectable DA neuronal activities. The effects of Foxa 2 in DA neuron generation were observed regardless of the brain regions or species from which NPCs were derived. Furthermore, DA neurons generated by ectopic Foxa 2 expression were more resistant to toxins. Importantly, Foxa 2 expression resulted in a rapid cell cycle exit and reduced cell proliferation. Consistently, transplantation of NPCs transduced with Nurr 1 and Foxa 2 generated grafts enriched with midbrain-type DA neurons but reduced number of proliferating cells, and significantly <b>reversed</b> <b>motor</b> deficits in a rat PD model.

40|$|BTS 74 398 (1 -[1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) cyclobutyl]− 2 -(3 -diaminethylaminopropylthio) ethanone monocitrate) is a monoamine reuptake {{inhibitor}} that <b>reverses</b> <b>motor</b> {{deficits in}} MPTP-treated (1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine) common marmosets without provoking established dyskinesia. However, {{it is not}} known whether BTS 74 398 primes the basal ganglia for dyskinesia induction. In this study, the ability of BTS 74 398 to sensitize 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) -lesioned rats for the production of abnormal motor behaviours and the induction of striatal ΔFosB were determined in comparison with l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester (l-dopa). Acute administration of BTS 74 398 induced a dose-dependent ipsilateral circling response in unilaterally 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats whereas l-dopa produced dose-dependent contraversive rotation. The ipsilateral circling response to BTS 74 398 did not alter during 21 days of administration. In contrast, l-dopa treatment for 21 days caused a marked increase in rotational response. Repeated administration of both l-dopa and BTS 74 398 increased general motor activity and stereotypic behaviour. In l-dopa-treated rats, orolingual, locomotive, forelimb and axial abnormal movements developed whereas BTS 74 398 produced only locomotion with a side bias but no other abnormal movements. Sensitization of circling responses and the development of abnormal movements in 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats have been associated with the potential of dopaminergic drugs to induce dyskinesia. Furthermore, striatal ΔFosB immunoreactivity, shown to correlate with dyskinesia induction, was increased by l-dopa but was unaffected by repeated BTS 74 398 administration. The lack of such changes following repeated BTS 74 398 treatment suggests that it may be an effective antiparkinsonian therapy that is unlikely to produce involuntary movements...|$|R
25|$|The {{first use}} of pumped storage was in the 1890s in Italy and Switzerland. In the 1930s {{reversible}} hydroelectric turbines became available. These turbines could operate as both turbine-generators and in <b>reverse</b> as electric <b>motor</b> driven pumps. The latest in large-scale engineering technology are variable speed machines for greater efficiency. These machines operate in synchronization with the network frequency when generating, but operate asynchronously (independent of the network frequency) when pumping.|$|R
