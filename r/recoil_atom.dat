40|$|This {{research}} has been concerned with the chemical consequences of neutron capture in chromium(III), cobalt(III) and ruthenium(III) ammine complexes: pentammine, ethylenediamine and tetraethylene-pentamine. The isotopic exchange of ligand chlorine atoms of complexed ions with outer anionic chloride ions during neutron bombardment of the solid chromium(III), ruthenium(III) and cobalt(III) ammine complexes has been studied with chlorine- 36 labelled chlorine atoms and anionic chloride ions. The order of stability of the complexes is: [M(NH 3) 5 C 1]C 12 <cis- and trans-[M(en) 2 C 12] C 1 <[M(tetren) C 1]C 12. Although the retention was increased gradually during prolonged neutron irradiation, which {{is described as a}} result of pile annealing (thermal and radiation), a few recoil species were observed on paper electrophoresis. The macroscopic distribution of recoil products in Cr(III) and Ru(III) ammine complexes, determined by the re-irradiation of paper electrophoregram, showed that the rupture of metal-ligand bond is about 2 - 3 % in acid media and about 9 - 11 % in neutral media. The <b>recoil</b> <b>atom</b> reaction was explained using the disorder model, which postulates that the <b>recoil</b> <b>atom</b> generates about its starting point only small changes in the lattice arrangement without producing a melt, and the final fate of the <b>recoil</b> <b>atom</b> is determined by the structure of the immediate environment it has reached after losing its kinetic energy. The chemical effects of internal conversion of outer energetic bromine atoms in Cr(III) ammine complexes (-NM 3, ethylenediamine), and 58 mCo and 60 mCo in the Co (III) tetren complex have been investigated. The experimental observations on isotope exchange and paper electrophoresis indicated that there is no significant evidence for an additional chemical effect. The results were discussed in view of the possibility that the effect of large crystal field stabilization for Cr(III) and Co(III) {{plays an important role in}} determining the recoil reactions. Thermal annealing reactions differ from system to system depending on the physical and chemical properties of the host crystal. The isochronal thermal annealing of neutron irradiated [Cr(NH 3) 5 C 1] C 12 and cis-[Cr(en) 2 C 12] C 1 was discussed using the exciton model. Thermal transfer, or exchange, in chlorine- 36 labelled [Ir(NH 3) 5 C 1] C 12 and trans-[Ir(en) 2 C 12] C 1 has been shown to give a heating curve similar to that obtained during annealing of neutron irradiated complexes. The substitution of chlorine- 36 labelled chlorine atoms in the complex by anionic chloride ions in [Ir(NH 3) 5 C 1] C 12 was explained by the isotope exchange model, involving a single step chemical exchange.

To describe and quantify this radiation exposure damage parameters as defined {{in the frame of}} the dpa-concept are appropriate. They combine the probability for the production of a primary <b>recoil</b> <b>atom</b> (PKA) in a neutron induced nuclear reaction with the number of stable defects in the evolving cascade of displaced lattice atoms. Calculations of such parameters and damage production rates are commonly based on the well established NRT-Lindhard model. However, due to its inherent deficiencies, i. e. restrictions of the underlying physics and insufficiencies of the modelling, the NRT model is not appropriate for light mass, mono- and polyatomic materials in blankets of (D,T) -fusion reactors. Therefore, this work has focused on computer simulations of collision cascades within the bounds of the binary collision approximation (BCA) using the code Marlowe. Because of the specific requirements, the code had to be modified and extended significantly, particularly by a consistent treatment of ionic interactions and a new implementation of rectangular geometries.

30|$|The {{specific}} surface features {{are created by}} ion beams in two competing processes: (i) surface roughening occurring due to sputtering and (ii) smoothening due to surface diffusion. During the ion–solid interaction, the impinging low energy (~keV) ions are mostly stopped by target nuclei, because of which the energy gets dissipated over a large volume. During the passage through the target material, the incident ion transfers the {{significant amount of energy}} to the target atoms to displace them from their equilibrium position. During the collision cascade process, the ion is affected by nuclear scattering, leading to the sequence of displacement events until the <b>recoil</b> <b>atom</b> retains sufficient energy to displace other atoms. Based on the used ion species and ion energies, the governing mechanism for evolution of surface features can be different. However, the simultaneous role of surface mobility and surface diffusion both cannot be ignored. Eklund et al. reported the evolution of surface features of graphite by 5  keV Ar irradiation under the predictions of the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation in 2 [*]+[*] 1 dimensions [40]. The Bradley and Harper model [21] based on Sigmund’s theory [41] of sputtering is the most accepted approach to justify the early stage of surface morphological changes. The later stage dynamics of the morphology change is dominated by the nonlinear terms of the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation [42]. For the present case, considering the used fluences (in the order of 1016 – 1017 ions/cm 2), such high values of sputtering yield should completely eliminate all the Ag content from the Si substrate. However, our experimental results of RBS show Ag content in 30  nm thick film up to the fluence of 0.5 [*]×[*] 1017 ions/cm 2. Such findings can be justified by considering the dynamic changes in the local dispersion of target density and inhomogeneous surface contours during the early stages of irradiation.|$|E

Especially {{the appearance of the}} more intimately mixed species cannot be explained by models discussed hitherto in the literature [6] (billiard ball impact, ligand vacancy exchange followed by combination [7], hot spot reaction).

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{emission}} processes of metal-organic clusters MmMen, (M is the organic molecule and Me the metal atom) ejected from self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold after keV ion bombardment. These aggregates are often observed upon energetic ion bombardment of strongly bound molecules like SAMs. The explanation of this effect remains elusive, especially for large clusters as those observed in our study. The emission of these clusters is investigated using ToF-SIMS under 15 keV Ga+ bombardment. In particular, we have measured the energy distributions (KEDs), which are informative of the physical processes of sputtering. We have probed both {{the influence of the}} intermolecular forces and the adsorbate-metal bonding on the cluster ion emission. Importantly, our KEDs revealed that a significant fraction of MmMen clusters is formed via the metastable decay of larger aggregates in the acceleration section of the spectrometer. This is the experimental evidence that another cluster formation channel has to be considered in addition to the recombination mechanisms proposed by other groups. In parallel to these experiments, we have used classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model an overlayer of octanethiols on gold. A realistic potential has been used including long-range forces between the hydrocarbon chains of the alkanethiols. Our key finding concerns the emission of large clusters which were not observed under sub-keV projectile impact. Statistically, they are predominantly formed in high yield events, where many fragments and (supra) molecular species are ejected. From the microscopic viewpoint, these events mostly stem from the confinement of the projectile and <b>recoil</b> <b>atom</b> energies in a finite nanovolume of the surface. As a result of the high local energy density, molecular aggregates desorb from an overheated liquid-like region surrounding the impact point. In summary, from a combined experimental and computational study we have shown that analytical models involving linear collision cascades and recombination processes are insufficient to describe metal-thiolate cluster emission from SAMs under keV ion bombardment. The detailed MD investigation have allowed us to obtain a general picture of the emission of these aggregates in which the mechanisms at play are reminiscent of those high yields events (megaevents) with non linear effects used usually to account for large (bio) molecule desorption.

The collision dynamics, on the other hand, remain virtually un-changed if the friction loss of these particles is switched on or off. This is illustrated by looking at the yield, emission sites and energies of sputtered surface atoms. ...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{stars in}} their final stages of {{collapse}} radiate most of their binding {{energy in the form}} of MeV neutrinos. The <b>recoil</b> <b>atoms</b> that they produce in elastic scattering off nuclei in organic tissue create a radiation damage which is highly effective in the production of irreparable DNA harm, leading to cellular mutation, neoplasia and oncogenesis. Using a conventional model of the galaxy and of the collapse mechanism, the periodicity of nearby stellar collapses and the radiation dose are calculated. The possible contribution of this process to the paleontological record of mass extinctions is examined...|$|R
