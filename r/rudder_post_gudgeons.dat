2500|$|<b>Rudder</b> <b>post</b> and mast {{placement}} {{defines the}} difference between a ketch and a yawl, as these two-masted vessels are similar. Yawls are defined as having the mizzen mast abaft (i.e. [...] "aft of") the rudder post; ketches are defined as having the mizzen mast forward of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the <b>rudder.</b> The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|R
50|$|The common {{definition}} of Yawl and Ketch using the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> {{does not reflect}} the nautical tradition and was created by much more recent developments of a handicap system for racing yachts.|$|R

60|$|The castaways {{continued}} {{to call out}} {{and in the meantime}} brought their rude raft close {{to the side of the}} steam yacht. As the vessel slipped past them slowly, they threw a bit of rope to the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> and made fast.|$|R
50|$|The CCA and the {{following}} rules used the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> definitions of ketch and yawl so they had a cut and dried definition for measuring sail so boats could be handicapped with boats fulfilling their new and arbitrary definition of Yawl and Ketch receiving slightly different handicaps.|$|R
2500|$|Ketches {{are similar}} to a sloop, {{but there is a}} second shorter mast astern of the mainmast, but forward of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> The second mast is called the mizzen mast and the sail is called the mizzen sail. A ketch can also be [...] with two head sails.|$|R
50|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} was conventional {{with a pair}} of mainwheels on an axle {{mounted on}} pairs of V-struts, the forward, vertical members were fixed to the wings and the rearward drag struts to the wing roots. A tailskid shock absorber was attached to an extension of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b>|$|R
50|$|Monongahela and Kineo were {{next in the}} column, and, also {{blinded by}} smoke, ran aground on the western shore. The impact {{separated}} the two ships. The stress of backing off the shore disabled Monongahelas engine, and a thirty-two-pounder (14.5 kg) round shot split Kineos <b>rudder</b> <b>post,</b> disabling her steering. Both ships drifted downriver.|$|R
5000|$|Rudder & Steering: The 5.5 ft rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is {{constructed}} of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder.|$|R
50|$|Both the ketch and the yawl {{have two}} masts, {{with the main}} mast foremost; the {{distinction}} usually being that a ketch has the mizzen mast forward of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post,</b> whereas on a yawl, it is aft of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> But the balance of sail area can be an overriding characteristic. If 20% {{or more of the}} sail area is in the mizzen sail the rig would be termed a ketch. This is particularly true on center cockpit yachts. Compared to a ketch, a similar size yawl's mizzen sail is much smaller than the main, because of the limitations of the mizzen sheet. So on a ketch, the dual purpose of the mizzen sail is to both propel and balance the vessel, while on a yawl, the smaller mizzen mainly serves the purpose of trim or balance. Yawls tend to have mainsails almost as large as those of comparable sloops.|$|R
50|$|On 3 January 1957, the {{ice pack}} had loosened; and enabled Northwind {{to lead the}} {{battered}} Arneb into port. After unloading the cargo, the crew repaired the cracks and split seams by listing the ship alternately to port and to starboard. Although having suffered a bent <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> and a broken propeller blade, Arneb was able to continue the operation.|$|R
50|$|A tiller or till is a lever {{attached}} to a <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> (American terminology) or rudder stock (English terminology) of a boat that provides leverage {{in the form of}} torque for the helmsman to turn the rudder. The tiller can be used by the helmsman directly pulling or pushing it, but it may also be moved remotely using tiller lines or a ship's wheel.|$|R
50|$|It had conventional, spilt axle, fixed {{landing gear}} with a 6 ft track. The axles and drag struts were hinged {{from the same}} pylon used by the lower wing bracing wires. Struts joined the wheels, {{enclosed}} in fairings, to shock absorbers within the wing root aircraft fairings. At the rear the B-4 had a tripod tailskid with a vertical rubber shock absorbing extension of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 10 August 1916, {{and demonstrated}} good performance and manoeuvrability, being easy to fly. It was wrecked during a crash landing during a test flight at Cranwell on 20 September 1916 after the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> failed. [...] No further development was carried out, as by this time, effective synchronising gear {{was available to}} the British, and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter was already in service.|$|R
50|$|During early September further {{attempts}} were made to penetrate the ice barrier to the west. On the 12th, Rescues <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> was split in a storm off Griffiths Island, and on the 13th the two ships, Advance towing Rescue, turned east in hopes of returning to the United States that season. On the 14th, however, they were caught, frozen, midway across the entrance to Wellington Channel. A winter of drifting began.|$|R
50|$|Like the W.12, the W.27 and W.32 were single-bay biplanes of largely {{conventional}} configuration, unusual only {{in having}} no dorsal tail fin, with an all-moving rudder that projected below the fuselage and {{forward of the}} <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> They differed from the earlier design in having shorter fuselages, more severely staggered wings, and I-struts for both the interplane and cabane bracing, where the W.12 had used more conventional pairs of struts.|$|R

5000|$|Classic junks {{were built}} of {{softwoods}} (although after the 17th century of teak in Guangdong) {{with the outside}} shape built first. Then multiple internal compartment/bulkheads accessed by separate hatches and ladders, reminiscent of the interior structure of bamboo, were built in. Traditionally, the hull has a horseshoe-shaped stern supporting a high poop deck. The bottom is flat in a river junk with no keel (similar to a sampan), so that the boat relies on a daggerboard, leeboard or very large rudder to prevent the boat from slipping sideways in the water. Ocean-going junks have a curved hull in section with {{a large amount of}} tumblehome in the topsides. The planking is edge nailed on a diagonal. Iron nails or spikes have been recovered from a Canton dig dated to circa 221 BC. For caulking the Chinese used a mix of ground lime with Tung oil together with chopped hemp from old fishing nets which set hard in 18 hours, but usefully remained flexible. Junks have narrow waterlines which accounts for their potential speed in moderate conditions, although such voyage data as we have indicates that average speeds on voyage for junks were little different from average voyage speeds of almost all traditional sail, i.e. around 4-6 knots. The largest junks, the treasure ships commanded by Zheng He, were built for world exploration in the 15th century, and according to some interpretations may have been over 120 m in length, or larger. This conjecture was based on the size of a <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> that was found and misinterpreted, using formulae applicable to modern engine powered ships. More careful analysis shows that the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> that was found is actually smaller than the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> shown for a 70' long Pechili Trader in Worcester's [...] "Junks and Sampans of the Yangtze".|$|R
50|$|Gazela was engine-less until 1938, when a Mannheim-Benz {{diesel engine}} was installed. With the {{depletion}} of cod on the Grand Banks, vessels were being forced to fish the Davis Strait, between Greenland and Baffin Island, Canada. The contrary winds and frequent icebergs in this area made life difficult for ships without engines. To accommodate the propeller, a new <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> was installed and her counter was extended approximately 10-12 feet, giving her a long overhanging transom.|$|R
50|$|The {{landing gear}} was {{conventional}} and fixed. On each side a tapered metal leg, narrow near {{the ground and}} broadening upwards, angled slightly outwards. It {{was attached to the}} engine mounting and carried each end of a single axle. The shock absorbers were contained within the wheels. At the tail the free end of a short strut, hinged to the fuselage, was fixed to a vertical shock absorber within the <b>rudder</b> <b>post,</b> with the tailskid rubber mounted from it.|$|R
5000|$|Both the yawl and the ketch {{have two}} masts, {{with the main}} mast foremost. On classic yacht types with long {{overhangs}} and inboard rudders, the distinction is simple: a ketch has the mizzen mast forward of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post,</b> whereas on a yawl, it is aft of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> [...] For boats with shorter overhangs or outboard rudders the distinction is more usefully determined by comparing the purposes and relative sizes of the mizzens. Compared to a ketch, a similar size yawl's mizzen sail is {{much smaller than the}} main, and is usually situated very far aft, behind the helm station. On a ketch, the principal purpose of the mizzen sail is to help propel the vessel as part of the working sail, the sail area being split up between two masts to ease handling. On a yawl, the smaller mizzen mainly serves the purposes of trim and balance, working more as an [...] "air rudder" [...] or trim tab than as a substantial part of the working sail. Yawls tend to have mainsails almost as large as those of sloops of comparable sized hulls.|$|R
50|$|A yawl (from Dutch jol), in the United Kingdom {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a dandy, is a two-masted sailing craft similar to a sloop or cutter but with an additional mizzenmast (or mizzen mast) located well aft of the main mast, often right on the transom, or aft of the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> if the vessel has an inboard hung rudder. (A vessel with a larger mizzen located in a more forward position is called a ketch; see below: Yawl versus ketch.) The mizzen sail (smaller than the mainsail) is hoisted on the mizzen mast.|$|R
50|$|Conner {{was a rare}} non-billionaire fielding a team {{to compete}} in the 2003 America's Cup, held in New Zealand, {{receiving}} funding of up to US$40 million from his sponsors. His syndicate, Stars & Stripes, suffered a severe setback before they departed California when one of the two Stars & Stripes boats (USA-77) sank when its <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> failed during training. Raised from 55 feet of water and eventually repaired, they were unable to recover the valuable testing time lost and they were defeated in the quarter-finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rear}} the fin was almost triangular, and built as an {{integral}} part of the fuselage. The fabric covered rudder was rounded, and moved between the separate elevators, which with the tail plane formed an elliptical shape. As a result, the elevator hinges, like those of the ailerons were strongly forward swept. The tailplane was supported from the fin near the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> with a pair of external struts. There was a long tailskid. The main undercarriage had two cantilever forks with rubber-in-compression springing, its legs faired and the wheels spatted.|$|R
50|$|Towle now {{presented}} {{his plan to}} the passengers' committee and in turn they pressured the captain into letting him try it. Towle had a 100 ft chain composed of 60 lb links wound around the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> below the break, then secured {{the ends of the}} chain to the port and starboard frames of the ship using block and tackle. Two lighter chains were led down from the wheelhouse and attached to the heavy chain and also to the ship's frames. This allowed some limited movement of the rudder and the ship became steerable again.|$|R
5000|$|The Type E sat high off {{the ground}} to {{accommodate}} a large propeller, almost horizontally because of a long tailskid from the fuselage {{to the end of}} the <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b> The main undercarriage had a pair of forward-projecting skids which reached from forward of the propeller almost to the trailing edge of the wing. Each skid carried a pair of wheels on a short axle [...] The skids were attached to the upper fuselage longerons with a pair of near vertical struts on each side and by further bracing to the lower fuselage longeron.|$|R
50|$|Great Eastern sailed from Liverpool on Tuesday 10 September 1861, {{commanded}} by Captain James Walker. On her second day out the wind increased to gale force, causing {{the ship to}} roll heavily. The port paddle wheel was completely lost, and the starboard paddle wheel smashed to pieces {{when one of the}} lifeboats broke loose. At the same time it was discovered that the cast iron <b>rudder</b> <b>post,</b> which was 11 in in diameter, had sheared off 2 ft above its collar and the rudder was swinging free and hitting the screw, which was slowly breaking it up.|$|R
2500|$|Boat rudders may {{be either}} {{outboard}} or inboard. Outboard rudders are {{hung on the}} stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> which comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit. [...] Inboard keel hung rudders (which are {{a continuation of the}} aft trailing edge of the full keel) are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing. [...] Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.|$|R
5000|$|The Asiago has a simple, flat sided fuselage, {{hexagonal}} at {{the front}} and rectangular at the rear, plywood covered all over. [...] The cockpit is immediately {{in front of the}} high wing, which is raised up on a pedestal so its leading edge is over the pilot's head. Particular attention was given to the seat, to minimise pilot fatigue on long flights. Aft, the pedestal drops away gradually and the fuselage tapers. The undercarriage consists of a fixed, semi-recessed monowheel with a tennis ball sprung skid ahead of it reaching to the nose, assisted by a very small tail bumper {{at the bottom of the}} <b>rudder</b> <b>post.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The wreck site lies at a {{depth of}} [...] to [...] of water {{approximately}} [...] off North Head. The wreck site is on sand away from any reef structure and completely intact but significantly buried under the sand to a level approximately the same as what would have been the deck level. It is a small site with just the two boilers (about 800 – 1000mm dia by 2.5m long approx) a broken engine and paddle wheel shaft (shifted by about 1 meter to the starboard) visible above the sand line. The sharp cutting shape of the bow and stern can just be made out with the twin (bow and stern) <b>rudder</b> <b>posts</b> just above the sand level.|$|R
5000|$|Dakotan resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Although {{the company had}} {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes, Dakotan continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful manner over the next twenty years. One incident of note occurred on 20 August 1923 when Dakotan issued distress calls after she ran aground at Cabo San Lázaro on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The Navy transport ship [...] and the Standard Oil tanker Charles Pratt responded to Dakotans calls. Charles Pratt successfully freed Dakotan, which had suffered damage to her <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> in the accident. The American-Hawaiian ship Nevadan arrived and towed Dakotan to Los Angeles for repairs.|$|R
25|$|The {{empennage}} of the Hydro-triplane {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of lattice girders, parallel in plan and each constructed from a horizontal member fixed to the upper wing {{at the top of the}} innermost interplane struts and a member below it which sloped upward from the lower wing to meet the upper one at the tail. Three sloping cross braces completed each girder. The rectangular tailplane, fitted with elevators, was placed over the ends of the girders, its leading edge braced by a central, vertical strut to the hull which also supported the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> out beyond the hull on upper and lower sloping struts. The trapezoidal rudder extended a little above the horizontal tail, which had a deep V-shaped cut-out to accommodate its movement.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the rear}} the fin was built as an {{integral}} part of the fuselage. [...] The fabric covered rudder was rounded, horn balanced and mounted on a forward leaning hinge. The elevators and tailplane together formed an elliptical shape rather like that of the wings. As a result, the elevator hinges were strongly forward swept. [...] The tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage was supported from the fin near the <b>rudder</b> <b>post</b> with a pair of external struts; the rudder moved above it. There was a small tailskid. The wide track main undercarriage had two cantilever forks fixed to the main spar, with rubber shock absorbers at the attachment points. The legs were faired and the wheels were in spats.|$|R
50|$|The wreck site lies at a {{depth of}} 26 m to 27 m of water {{approximately}} 450 m off North Head. The wreck site is on sand away from any reef structure and completely intact but significantly buried under the sand to a level approximately the same as what would have been the deck level. It is a small site with just the two boilers (about 800 - 1000mm dia by 2.5m long approx) a broken engine and paddle wheel shaft (shifted by about 1 meter to the starboard) visible above the sand line. The sharp cutting shape of the bow and stern can just be made out with the twin (bow and stern) <b>rudder</b> <b>posts</b> just above the sand level.|$|R
