In addition, Silvy created a series of 'Studies on Light' in London in 1860. These studies of fog and twilight include, arguably, the first use of blur as a creative effect in the history of photography. Silvy redefined still life in a work which includes the Times newspaper and a mass-produced sauce bottle. However, Silvy's modernity was expressed in many other ways.

40|$|The {{traditional}} musicological {{conception of}} performance is as {{the reproduction of}} pre-existing texts. This makes no allowance for {{the extent to which}} meaning emerges from the act of performance, and from the interactions between the various participants in performance events. A broadly semiotic approach focusses attention on such issues, and in this article I illustrate such an approach in terms of the communicative function of the mazurka ‘script’ and the role of performance gesture in conditioning musical meaning. I argue that, instead of thinking in terms of the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>works,</b> it is better to borrow Jeff Pressing’s term and think in terms of performances referencing scores, traditions, and other pre-existing entities: this way it is possible to conceptualise performances that range from the Werktreue ideology or tribute bands to parody or burlesque. Discourses of the relationship between works and performances are mirrored by those between performances and recordings, and consideration of the latter helps to clarify features shared by both: creativity, collaboration, and semiosis...|$|E

40|$|As Walter Benjamin {{described}} {{in his famous}} essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction", the role of art in society {{and the notion that}} art has become modified through mechanical reproduction has engaged not only artists, but also curators and the museum public. Benjamin embraced the severing of the quasi-mystical "aura " from the original as a potentially liberating phenomenon, both for the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> of art and for the art of film, thereby making works of art widely available, introducing new forms of perception in film and photography and allowing art to move from private to public, from the elite to the masses. While the loss of the aura for Benjamin represented new possibilities, what was forfeited in this process were the "aura " and the authority of the object containing within it the values of cultural heritage and tradition. This paper evaluates the different ways that museums are responding to life on the Internet, and looks to three models of museum Web-sites: the documentation of traditional collections through online databases, the virtual museum with no concrete counterpart to resonate the onlin...|$|E

The theory, as the main part of this thesis, covers the early European Renaissance period and the period of Jackson Pollock. I examined: the content differences among works of art from those two periods, in what way the works of art were depicted and the painting through its gestuality. The main part of this thesis explores the area of gestural painting {{all the way to the}} Abstract Expressionism. The thesis is also based on practical work. In my own personal research of painting, in seventh and eighth semester, I depicted abstract with strongly emphasized gesturality. I was particularly interested in the dripping technique, so I incorporated this concept in my teaching curriculum for the seventh, eighth an ninth grade students of primary school.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} process of <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> {{of art in the}} province of Quebec. Reproduction is studied historically, considering its significance as a cultural industry and its characteristics as a mode of communication. The dissertation first engages the theoretical discourse surrounding the novelty of technologies of reproduction of art works {{at the turn of the}} century and further pursues an exploration of reproduction within the framework of postmodernity. The phenomenon is studied with special attention to the movement of art works into private spaces. In considering the history of reproduction with regard to works of art in Quebec, four distinct periods have been established: 1936 - 1950, the novelty of techniques of reproduction; 1950 - 1970, the era of education; 1970 - 1980, the discovery of national identity through reproductions of Quebec artists; and 1980 - 1989 : the consolidation of a new market; 1989 - 1990 : the economical boom of the market and the structures get organized. The portrayal of this new cultural industry is traced and its different characteristics considered. Selection of works, styles, marketability and motives for purchase are presented problematically. Thus, in the last chapter, a theory for art reproductions as a silent mode of communication in the private space is explored...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the influence of}} the Etching Revival in Britain on fine art photography {{at the turn of the}} Century by focusing upon two photographers: Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882 - 1966) and James Craig Annan (1864 - 1946), who made photogravure (or photo-etching) their chosen art form. Already masters of the platinum photo-chemical print at the turn of the Century, they worked directly from photographic negative to embrace an ink-on-paper aesthetic, combining the perfect gradation of continuous-tone photography with the express means of photo-etching. By a close comparative study of the interrelations between various processes in photography and other graphic arts, unique aesthetic and technical properties of the different processes can be discriminated from shared qualities, affecting form and meaning in both photo-chemical prints and photogravures. For instance, in the history of engraving, the mezzotint had supplied a tonal element; in etching, aquatint translated the effect of watercolour wash; and lithotint provided the kind of tonal gradation presaged in 1839 by Sir John Herschel's coinage of 'photography' by analogy with lithography. In the 1860 s, graphic arts critics such as P. G. Hamerton and the etcher-critic Sir Francis Seymour Haden held that the essential quality of the etching was that of the hand drawn (but chemically etched) line which expressed the artist's autographic and artistic intention, an attitude which clearly separated artist-etchers from the position of reproductive engravers. However, one of the artist-etcher James McNeill Whistler's most important contributions to the Etching Revival was his ability to create tone, not just through fineness and density of lines but also by various means of expressive inking and wiping of the printing plate. His cultural and aesthetic impact on J. C. Annan's etcher friends D. Y. Cameron and William Strang, and A. L. Coburn's etcher mentor Frank Brangwyn, created a productive relationship between the etching and the pictorial photograph through its etched equivalent, the photogravure. Whistler's influence was also felt in the basis of the New English Art Club, with which the photographer-critic P. H. Emerson was closely involved in the 1880 s. Emerson's seminal work Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art (1889) provided historical and critical foundation for a whole generation of photographers. In his writings, he advocated the photogravure as the perfect translation in ink of the aesthetic qualities of the platinum print, eventually learning to make gravures himself. Emerson's admiration of Whistler's etched work is especially apparent in his book of photo-etchings Marsh Leaves (1895), in which he experimented with both the high-contrast, sparse etching style of Whistler and Hayden, and the full tonal range inherent in photography. James Craig Annan had been the first British photographer to learn the process of photogravure, travelling to Vienna in 1883 with his father Thomas Annan to recieve instruction directly from its inventor, Karl Klic. Annan and his friend D. Y. Cameron travelled together and worked side by side; Annan's portrait of Strang as 'The Etcher' and Strang's laudatory reviews of Annan's photographs suggest mutal admiration; and Annan was also a friend of Muirhead Bone, a member of the New English Art Club. All three of Annan's etcher-friends are considered to be leaders of the Scottish Etching Revival, with Cameron and Strang expressing their commitment to the fine art status of the origional etching by resigning in 1903 from the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers in protest at the Society's inclusion of reproductive prints in their exhibtions. In this context, Annan, a son of a family whose primary business was the craftsmanly <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> of art, maintained a Whistlerian insistence on the origionality of the fine art photogravure. Alvin Langdon Coburn was already an accomplished photographer when in 1902 - 03 he studied in Ipswich, Massachusetts, with the Arts and Crafts printmaker and educator Arthur Wesley Dow. In 1904, he studied wood-engraving in London with the painter-etcher Frank Brangwyn, where he experienced the etching process first hand and was influenced by Brangwyn's social commitment to the industrial worker in the urban landscape. In 1906, he attended London County School of Photo-Engraving at Bolt Court, bought his own etching press, and became a photographer-gravurist. Printing his original hand-pulled gravures in his books London (1909) and New York (1910), Coburn was effectively refuting the contention of etcher-critic Joseph Pennell (student and biographer of Whistler), in his 1897 article 'Is Photography Among the Fine Arts?', that images produced by the mechanism of the camera could not approach the status of art. The challenge for the artist-photogravurist was to re-introduce, into the technical constraints of photography and gravure, elements of personal artistic control. The exercise of control in photography was defined by Coburn and Annan as a process of selection, a fine sense of judgement in pictoral emphasis. Although unable to redispose elements of the composistion, the photogravurist could, by control of focus in the photograph and contrast of inking in the photogravure, prioritise the most important elements and suppress or exclude less important ones. This idea is directly related to Haden and Hamerton's concept of selection and omission in etching, the artistic emphasis through structure and tone, and refined economy of expression. The slide presentation showed how Annan's and Coburn's photogravures finely balanced the ink-expression of etching with the continuous tone of the photograph, placing 'pictorialist' photography of the 1890 s and early Twentieth Century back in its graphic arts context...|$|E
