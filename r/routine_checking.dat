[...] The exception is metal-on-metal implants, which were not tested in clinical trials but because of the high revision rate of metal-on-metal hips, in the future the FDA has stated that clinical trials will be required for approval and that post-market studies will be required to keep metal on metal hip implants on the market.|$|E

An engineer in Edmonton duly did so when the aircraft arrived from Toronto following a trouble-free flight {{the day before the}} incident. While conducting this check, the FQIS failed and the cockpit fuel gauges went blank. The engineer had encountered the same problem earlier in the month when this same aircraft had arrived from Toronto with an FQIS fault. He found then that disabling the second channel by pulling the circuit breaker in the cockpit restored the fuel gauges to working order albeit with only the single FQIS channel operative. In the absence of any spares he simply repeated this temporary fix by pulling and tagging the circuit breaker.|$|E
5000|$|Vouching can be {{described}} as the essence or backbone of auditing. The success of an audit depends on the thoroughness with which vouching is done. After entering in all vouchers, only then can auditing start. Vouching is defined as the [...] "verification of entries in the books of account by examination of documentary evidence or vouchers, such as invoices, debit and credit notes, statements, receipts, etc. The object of vouching is to establish that the transactions recorded in the books of accounts are (1) in order and have been properly authorized and (2) are correctly recorded. “Simple <b>routine</b> <b>checking</b> cannot establish the same accuracy that vouching can. In <b>routine</b> <b>checking,</b> entries recorded in the books only show what information the bookkeeper chooses to disclose, however these entries can be fictitious without any vouching or vouchers. By using a vouching or a voucher system a company will have concrete and solid documentation and evidence of expenses, capital, and written proof in audits. [...] Vouching is the essence or backbone of auditing because when performing an audit, an auditor must have proof of all transactions. Without the proof provided by vouching, the claims provided by the auditor are just that, only claims. In most cases, hard to detect frauds can only be discovered through the use of vouching. This means that the auditor must conduct vouching with great importance, if not, he can be charged with negligence which happened in the case of Armitage v. Brewer and Knott. Through this case, the importance of vouching was realized. In this case, the auditors were found to be guilty on negligence, because the auditors did not display enough reasonable care and skill in vouching the wage sheets and ended up failing to detect fraud in manipulation of these wage records and cash vouchers. When delivering the decision the Judge stated that [...] "It was clear that a good many documents were suspicious on either face and called for Inquiry". It was declared that it was essential that due care and attention are to be given to vouching in auditing.|$|E

40|$|Background: No good {{evidence}} exists {{to support the}} practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord, yet {{it is a common}} medical intervention in birth. Some evidence shows damage to the baby because the practice more frequently leads to premature cord-cutting and the vaginal examination, required by such <b>routine</b> <b>checking,</b> may be physically and/or emotionally damaging to the women. Our objective was to learn what training midwives have received and what their current practice is in relation to a possible nuchal cord at birth? Method: Questions about nuchal cord at birth were posted to two online midwifery discussion forums and responses were invited. Twenty-six midwives from 10 countries responded to questions on nuchal cord practices. Results: The teaching and practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord at birth is widespread, according to at least some participants from all 10 countries. Other midwives from the same countries argued that, although they were aware that the procedure is the dominant midwifery practice, many midwives neither teach it nor perform it routinely. Conclusion: In the absence ofclear evidence, firmly entrenched positions are being argued for and against <b>routine</b> <b>checking.</b> The debate is infused with high emotion. Those arguing for <b>routine</b> <b>checking</b> cite safety for the baby as their main concern. Those arguing against checking cite the need to keep birth normal and the well-being of the baby as their primary concerns. There is a need to reconsider how the possibility of nuchal cord at birth should be conceptualised from a midwifery perspective to ensure woman-centred decision-making...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} to support the practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord which historically developed as a medical intervention in birth. There is some evidence of damage to the baby as this practice more frequently leads to prematurely cutting the cord. The vaginal examination, that <b>routine</b> <b>checking</b> requires, may be damaging physically and/or emotionally to the women. Question: What do midwives say about their training and current practice in relation to the possibility of a nuchal cord at birth? Method: Questions about nuchal cord at birth were posted to two on-line discussion fora and responses were invited. Participants: Twenty six midwives from 10 countries who engaged in online discussion fora concerning maternity care responded to questions on nuchal cord practices. Findings: The teaching and practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord at birth is widespread according to at least some participants from all 10 countries. Other midwives from the same countries argued that, although they were aware that the procedure is the dominant midwifery practice, many midwives neither teach it nor perform it routinely.

40|$|In {{this article}} an {{overview}} of physical principles of detection of Improvised Explosives Devices during <b>routine</b> <b>checking</b> of persons and baggage are described.

It is focused on both principled faults of detecting equipment and faults in utilizing. It is necessary to introduce in practice lately developed portals for checking persons and devices for checking baggage {{which are based on}} new physical principles. Security screening is unreliable in case only one physical principle of detection is used. If more physical principles are used the smuggling of a masked IED is practically impossible.

30|$|According to {{previously}} published studies [3 – 6], the SRT has several advantages: it is easily applied (thus decreasing {{the time and}} effort required for tourniquet application); it is sterile and can be applied intraoperatively (saving tourniquet time); no additional step for limb exsanguination is required; and it covers a narrow area of the limb. On the other hand, the pressure applied by the SRT is fixed (cannot be adjusted), and the SRT cannot entirely replace the PT since it cannot be used in very obese patients due to limitations on the limb circumference. Furthermore, the SRT is disposable, so there is a direct cost. On the other hand, there is an indirect cost for PTs. The device requires regular maintenance, repairs, and replacements, as well as <b>routine</b> <b>checking,</b> daily calibration checks of all valves and gauges, intraoperative monitoring of tourniquet function at frequent intervals, and rigorous monthly performance-assurance tests [1].|$|E
40|$|Enterotoxins {{secreted}} by S. aureus {{are known}} as a food-poisoning agent {{that is associated with}} various gastro-intestinal pathological conditions. In this study, a one-step immunodetection method was devised for <b>routine</b> <b>checking</b> of SEB in milk and fruit juices available locally. Antibodies against recombinant SEB were raised, purified, and cross reactivity was checked against clinically important bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Streptococci, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella and Bacillus subtilis). Purified anti-SEB antibodies were conjugated with gold nanoparticles (Ab-GNPs) for direct detection of SEB in samples. SEB (33 %, 4. 76 % and 15 %) was found in non-sterilized milk (118), sterilized milk (42) and juices (60), respectively. Coagulase, MSA tests and PCR amplification of 725 bp of the SEB gene confirmed the presence of S. aureus in the collected samples positive for SEB. Immunoassay is easy, reliable and less time consuming and will be helpful to detect the SEB in food samples at local level...|$|E
