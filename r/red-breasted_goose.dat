50|$|In 2011, Ornithologists {{from the}} Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (BSPB/BirdLife in Bulgaria) and the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust enacted {{a project that}} would lead to a greater {{understanding}} of the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>geese's</b> migration patterns. Six <b>red-breasted</b> <b>geese</b> were branded and given miniature GPS transmitters. The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>geese</b> will now be tracked via satellite. Scientist and conservationists alike hope that learning about the geese's migration patterns will lead to proper conservation and more aggressive policies in the geese's territory. Some prior counts have revealed a more positive discovery, noting an increase in the geese's population. This led to a prediction which states there may be over a fifty percent increase in their population.|$|R
50|$|In February 2013, the Bulgarian {{court had}} {{overturned}} a decision which prohibited an energy wind project from continuing {{their work in}} an important winter site for the threatened <b>red-breasted</b> <b>geese.</b> The construction of wind turbines in the area not only threaten the geese by being an obstacle that they fly into. The area they are being constructed in will also deprive <b>red-breasted</b> <b>geese</b> of a critical feeding ground.

50|$|However, {{the most}} {{time-consuming}} sequence involved <b>red-breasted</b> <b>geese</b> in flight — {{not in terms}} of actual filming, but in preparing for it. The birds had to be reared by hand from birth so that they would respond to the voice of their 'mother', and this eventually enabled them to be photographed as they flew alongside a moving open-top car.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> often nests {{close to}} nests of birds of prey, such as snowy owls, {{peregrine}} falcons and rough-legged buzzards, which helps {{to protect this}} small goose from mammalian predators such as the Arctic fox. The closer the goose's nest to the eyrie (bird of prey nest), the safer it is from predation. Based on the size and how timid the geese are, they rely on the bird of prey for defense. It is extremely unusual for the bird of prey to attack, but is still possible. Additionally, the larger the colony the safer it is. This in turn positively influences the survival and reproductive success of the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose.</b> Aside from nesting close to birds of prey, red-breasted geese nest on islands on rivers which also protects them from land-based predators. However, {{there is evidence that}} the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> will prefer to nest near birds of prey over the choice of a river island. In contrast to the birds of prey that offer the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> protection from predators, which choose to place their nests in the open cliff side, this goose will create a cryptic nest hidden much better than the birds of prey nests. A typical <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> colony is around 4 pairs depending on nest location, food abundance, and bird of prey density. While incubating, the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> stays within a 1.5 km range of its nest. [...] Male <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> tend to guard the nest of their young from a distance while the females generally hide on the nest. The main predator for red-breasted geese eggs and goslings is the Taimyr Gull which have access to nests located on river islands.|$|E

40|$|The Danube Delta, a {{buffering}} {{interface between}} the Danube river catchment and the Western Black Sea {{is a unique}} place not only in Europe, but also among other deltaic ecosystems due to its high biodiversity. It {{is considered to be}} the most important wetland area in South Eastern Europe, with a significant role to the regional and global water cycle. It is the second largest delta in Europe (Volga is the first), a place with the richest ornithological fauna in the world (over 250 species), an area of highest diversity with insects, birds and fishes and a crossroads for migratory birds, a place where globally endangered and therefore rare species of birds are to be found, like Dalmatian pelicans, pygmy cormorans, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>geese.</b> Along time, the Danube Delta’s natural resources and ecosystems have been seriously affected by human careless and destructive intervention, whether it had to do with the cutting of new water channels for shipping or with the pollution of the Danube river due to sewage, industrial waste, pesticides and nutrients, reduction of flooding zones (which are natural fish nurseries) by damming, or with the ruthless exploitation of Delta’s resources through agriculture, fishing, hunting, tourism, reed growth and cutting, sand extraction. A proper ecological management of the Danube Delta as a biosphere reserve has been financially supported so far by the Romanian government, by the World Conservation of Nature Union (IUCN), by UNESCO, by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and by the World Bank. At this moment Ukraine intend to build a shipping channel over the Bistroe branch of the Danube, in the north of the Danube Delta which will have a tremendous impact over the area. It seems that political reasons and economical reasons demote the ecological and ethical ones. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{species of}} {{waterfowl}} breeding in North America have distribution patterns that collectively reflect the past geologic and ecological histories of this continent. In general, our waterfowl species {{may be grouped}} into those that are limited (endemic) to North America, those that are shared between North and South America, {{and those that are}} shared with Europe and/or Asia. Of the forty-four species known to breed in continental North America, the resulting grouping of breeding distributions is as follows: Limited to North America: Snow goose (also on Greenland and Wrangel Island), Ross goose, Canada goose (also on Greenland), wood duck, American wigeon, black duck, blue-winged teal, redhead, canvasback, ringnecked duck, lesser scaup, Labrador duck (extinct), surf scoter, bufflehead, hooded merganser. Shared with Eurasia: Trumpeter swan (whooper swan), whistling swan (Bewick swan), white-fronted goose, brant goose, gadwall, green-winged teal, mallard, pintail, shoveler, greater scaup, common eider, king eider, harlequin duck, oldsquaw, black scoter, white-winged scoter, common goldeneye, red-breasted merganser, common merganser. Shared with South America: Fulvous whistling duck, black-bellied whistling duck, muscovy duck, cinnamon teal, masked duck, ruddy duck. Shared with Asia only: Emperor goose, spectacled eider, Steller eider (rarely to Norway). Shared with Europe only: Barrow goldeneye (Iceland and Greenland). Native to Eurasia, introduced into North America: Mute swan. It is thus clear that the strongest zoogeographic affinities of our waterfowl are with Europe and Asia, since twenty-three out of the forty-four native North American species have. populations shared with one or both of these areas. Only six species are shared with South America, and, of these, the fulvous whistling duck has a more general tropical distribution that includes Africa and southern Asia. Consequently, it would appear that South America has played only a minor role in providing waterfowl stock for North America, and vice versa. Certainly the great number of waterfowl species shared between the North American and Eurasian landmasses can be largely attributed to Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene history. Ploeger (1968) analyzed the distributions of eighteen species of arctic-breeding Anatidae and concluded that both their present distributions and their described geographic variations could be at· tributed to the physical-geographical situation existing in the Northern Hemisphere during Late Glacial times. Only a minority (38 percent) of these species exhibit noticeable geographic variation, and most of the eighteen have breeding ranges that include both North America and Eurasia. The exceptions are three Eurasian <b>geese</b> (<b>red-breasted,</b> bean, and lesser white-fronted geese), three North American geese (Canada, Ross, and snow geese), and the North Atlantic barnacle goose. It is of interest that these are all geese, a group noted for their strongly traditional wintering and breeding grounds, as opposed to the less tradition-bound ducks...|$|R

50|$|In {{autumn of}} 1997 the {{population}} {{was estimated to be}} around 88,000 individuals. In the winter these numbers can shrink to around 70,000. The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> is legally protected in many states, however hunting is still continued. The AEWA is monitoring the species and providing up to date information on the status of the species, its habitat, migrations, ecology, and conservation needs. It was considered a Vulnerable species by the IUCN. Over 80% of the population roost during the winter at just five sites, with nearby feeding areas threatened by changes in land use. In addition, there has been a strong decline in numbers in the last decades. However, it is possible that this decline may have been exaggerated, as it is possible that some birds may winter at unknown sites. The species' winter distribution has already changed significantly since the 1960s when much of the population occurred along the western coast of the Caspian Sea, in Iran, and in Iraq. Some birds may now be wintering farther west as indicated by recorded counts of 2,000 birds in Hungary as of the winter of 2014, whereas counts previously only accounted for a few hundred. As it is not clear to what extent the known population fluctuates in this species—as in other Arctic geese—and given the worsening outlook for the species as a whole, the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>goose</b> was uplisted from a species of Least Concern to Endangered status in the 2007 IUCN Red List. In 2015 it was relisted as Vulnerable. There have been attempts to conserve the species, such as in 2005-2008, a Life-funded project in Romania was implemented so that the habitat quality of an important salt water lake used by the species was increased. The Life Programme and AEWA hosted a workshop in February 2009 for the species that aimed to draft a new International Species Action Plan and report the results of the Life project.|$|E
