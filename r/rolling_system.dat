40|$|Abstract: The shimmy {{phenomenon}} is a self-excited limit cycle oscillation occurring in many physical <b>rolling</b> <b>systems,</b> particularly in aircraft nose landing gears (NLG). This paper presents a new active damping controller {{developed in the}} context of the European DRESS (“Distributed and Redundant Electro-mechanical nose gear Steering System”) project for avoiding the shimmy oscillation. The controller based on the direct adaptive control approach, consists of two terms: the fuzzy adaptive term approximates the feedback linearization control law, and the stabilizing control term compensates the structural modelling error. The closed-loop system stability is proven by using Lyapunov theory. Simulation results corresponding to different test scenarios show that the proposed controller is able to effectively damp the shimmy phenomenon. 1...|$|R

40|$|Many vehicle systems contain rolling {{elements}} which exhibit unstable rolling motion, called shim-mying, which {{may lead to}} disastrous results. The classical shimmying wheel is a simple model which captures the essential dynamics of such systems. For-tunately, this model possesses a particular geometric structure which provides a simple means to design a globally stabilizing controller. However, this model is limited because it assumes that the wheel rolls with-out slipping, and for real systems, the wheel may slip because the constraint force, applied by friction, is bounded. The controller which globally stabilizes the <b>rolling</b> <b>system</b> sometimes fails to stabilize the slipping system.

To address this issue, a new approach based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and time series modeling is proposed in this paper. This approach seeks to identify faults appearing in a <b>rolling</b> bearing <b>system</b> using proper autoregressive (AR) model established from the nonstationary vibration signal.

Second, vibration signals are filtered with calculated filtering parameters. Third, the IMF which is closely correlated to the filtered signal is selected according to the correlation coefficient between the filtered signal and each IMF, and then the AR model of the selected IMF is established. Subsequently, the AR model parameters are considered as the input feature vectors, and the hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to identify the fault pattern of a rolling bearing. Experimental study performed on a bearing test system has shown that the presented approach can accurately identify faults in rolling bearings...|$|R
