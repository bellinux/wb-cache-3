5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay,</b> scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E

5|$|Elements {{heavier than}} iron were {{produced}} in supernovae through the r-process and in AGB stars through the s-process, {{both of which}} involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.

5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and {{suggest that it is}} in thermal equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E

Sensitivities to aH and 8 ~S radiation, i. e. ratio of developed grains to <b>radioactive</b> <b>decays</b> in the specimen, were determined ~ with Ilford L 4 and Kodak NTE emulsions. The highest values obtained in monolayers of emulsion were for aH and 1 ~i for s~S. The influence of various experimental parameters on sensitivity is described, and {{the possibilities for}} quantitative electron microscope radioautography are discussed. Radioautography methods are employed to locate <b>radioactive</b> <b>decays</b> and to measure the amount of radioactive substances in a given specimen area.

5|$|While {{experimenting with}} the {{products}} of <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay,</b> in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that {{there appeared to be}} more than one element at each position on the periodic table.

In this work we aimed to simulate emitting particles tracks of radionuclides and their <b>radioactive</b> <b>decays</b> at DNA level inside the cell nucleus. Accordingly, using the Monte Carlo-based track structure simulation technique, we estimated the radial distribution of deposited energy and kinetic energy spectra of electrons produced by primary particles resulting from <b>radioactive</b> <b>decays</b> of diff erent radionuclides within cell nucleus. To address the possibility of DNA damage, we performed the cluster analysis of track structures of emitted particles inside the volumes corresponding {{to the size of}} the native double-stranded DNA.

5|$|Plutonium {{isotopes}} undergo <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay,</b> {{which produces}} decay heat. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. The decay heat is usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram. In larger pieces of plutonium (e.g. a weapon pit) and inadequate heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant.

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay,</b> as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 <b>Radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E

5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay</b> and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of <b>radioactive</b> <b>decay,</b> and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.|$|E
5|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts.
