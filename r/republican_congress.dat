5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress.</b> In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

Through these democratic groups Colajanni came into contact with the positivist theories, and personalities such as Filippo Turati and Leonida Bissolati. Colajanni became one of the protagonists of the Italian positivist and evolutionary socialism, inspired by Darwinian evolution.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} two years, President Obama had a {{majority}} in the House and filibuster-proof super-majority in the Senate (until February 2010), which coincided with the 111th United States Congress, considered to {{have been one of the}} most productive Congresses in terms of legislation passed since the 89th Congress, during Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. However, in the November 2010 elections, the Republicans won the House majority and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate. He faced either a split or <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress</b> thereafter, limiting his economic legislation to mainly budgetary matters.|$|E

According to Brian Hanley's history of the IRA, the revived Citizen Army had 300 or so members {{around the country in}} 1935. However, the Congress itself split in September 1934 and led to an ICA split with it. One fraction was led by Michael Price and Nora Connelly which had left congress while the opposing fraction led by O'Donnell and Roddy Connelly were loyal to those that stayed.|$|E

25|$|President Obama also {{attempted}} to address inequality before taxes (i.e., market income), {{with an increase}} in the minimum wage and infrastructure investment. While the <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress</b> did not support a federally-mandated {{increase in the minimum wage}}, 18 states did increase their minimum wages, benefiting an estimated 7 million workers, following the President's 2013 State of the Union speech calling for an increase. During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request. He signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act into law in December 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Great Recession {{had caused}} federal {{government}} revenues {{to fall to}} their lowest level relative {{to the size of}} the economy for 50 years, with tax revenues falling nearly $400 billion (20%) between 2008 and 2009. At the same time, safety net expenditures caused expenditures to rise considerably. For example, automatic stabilizer spending (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments, which increased without legislative action) ranged between $350–420 billion annually from 2009 to 2012, roughly 10% of the expenditures. This drove the budget deficit up even without any policy steps by President Obama, creating significant debt concerns. This resulted in a series of bruising debates with the <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> which attempted (with much success) to blame the President for the deficits caused primarily by the recession that began during the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|President Obama pledged {{before he}} was elected not to raise taxes except on those couples earning over $250,000 (200,000 for individuals). With the Bush tax cuts {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with the <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of Republicans in the House opposed it. It extended the Bush tax cuts for roughly the bottom 99% of income earners (those earning below $400,000, or $450,000 for married couples).|$|E

2500|$|The Act was {{sponsored}} by Senator Robert A. Taft and Representative Fred Hartley, both <b>Republicans.</b> <b>Congress</b> overrode the veto on June 23, 1947, establishing the act as a law. Truman described the act as a [...] "slave-labor bill" [...] in his veto, but after it was enacted over his veto, he used its emergency provisions {{a number of times}} to halt strikes and lockouts. [...] The new law required all union officials to sign an affidavit that they were not Communists or else the union would lose its federal bargaining powers guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Board.|$|R
25|$|Their banner was the Plough and the Stars. Connolly {{said the}} {{significance}} of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. The symbolism of the flag was evident in its earliest inception of a plough with a sword as its blade. Taking inspiration from the bible and following the internationalist aspect of socialism it reflected the belief that war would be redundant with the rise of the Socialist International. This was flown by the Irish Citizens Army during the 1916 rising. The design changed during the 1930s to that of the blue banner on the left, which was designed by members of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> and was adopted as the emblem of the Irish Labour movement, including the Irish Labour Party, though they eventually dropped it. It is also claimed by Irish republicans and has been carried alongside the Irish tricolour and Irish provincial flags at Official IRA, Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO) and Continuity IRA rallies and marches.|$|E
25|$|His {{subsequent}} book, {{released in}} summer 2006, is titled Conservatives without Conscience, {{a play on}} Barry Goldwater's book The Conscience of a Conservative. In it, he asserts that post-Goldwater conservatism has been co-opted by people with authoritarian personalities and policies, citing data from Bob Altemeyer. According to Dean, modern conservatism, specifically in the Christian Right, embraces obedience, inequality, intolerance, and strong intrusive government, {{in stark contrast to}} Goldwater's philosophies and policies. Using Altemeyer's scholarly work, he contends that there is a tendency toward ethically questionable political practices when authoritarians are placed in positions of power, and that the current political situation is dangerously unsound because of it. Dean cites the behavior of key members of the Republican leadership, including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich, and Bill Frist, as clear evidence of a relationship between modern right-wing conservatism and this authoritarian approach to governance. He places particular emphasis on the abdication of checks and balances by the <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> and of the dishonesty of the conservative intellectual class in support of the GOP, {{as a result of the}} obedience and arrogance innate to the authoritarian mentality.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 3420land grant {{applications}} {{were submitted}} by immigrants and naturalized citizens, {{many of them}} Anglo-Americans. The first group of colonists, known as the Old Three Hundred, arrived in 1822 to settle an empresarial grant that {{had been given to}} Stephen F. Austin by the Spanish. The group settled along the Brazos River, ranging from the near present-day Houston to Dallas. Shortly after they arrived, Austin learned that the new Mexican government had not ratified his father's land grant with Spain. He was forced to travel to Mexico City, 1,200miles (1,931km) away, to get permission for his colony. During his time in the capitol, Austin impressed various important people in the government by offering to draw a map of Texas, to help remove sediment obstructing navigation of the Colorado River, and by promising to carry out an Indian pacification campaign. On February 18, 1823, tenmonths after Austin arrived in Mexico City, Agustin I approved his colonization contract. Onemonth later, Agustin abdicated as emperor, and the newly created <b>republican</b> <b>congress</b> nullified all acts of his government, including Austin's colonization contract. Many of Austin's new friends in Mexico praised his integrity before the congress, and his contract was re-approved in mid-April. On his return to Texas in July 1823, Austin established San Felipe de Austin as the new headquarters for his colony.|$|E
