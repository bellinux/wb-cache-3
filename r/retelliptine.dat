It was first {{isolated}} from the bark and stem of Aspidosperma oli-vaceum 2) and it has been found to possess similar antitumor activity as its 5, 11 -dimethyl isomer, ellipticine, and related compounds like 9 -methoxyellipticine. 3, 4) As the main mecha-nism of these agents ’ antineoplastic action, a stabilization of the “cleavable complex ” which is formed between DNA and the enzyme, topoisomerase II, 5) is generally accepted, although additional mechanisms have been discussed for some pyridocarbazoles, e. g. reactivation of the lost function-ality of the p 53 protein. 6) Based on the naturally occurring lead compounds, numerous modifications of this system have been studied, 7) leading to the development of drugs like elliptinium, 8) datelliptium, 9) <b>retelliptine,</b> 10) or pazelliptine. 11...|$|E
