40|$|A new hybrid micro vehicle, {{called the}} Hopping <b>Rotochute,</b> was {{developed}} to robustly explore environments with rough terrain while minimizing energy consumption over extended periods of time. Unlike traditional robots, the Hopping <b>Rotochute</b> maneuvers through complex terrain by hopping over or through impeding obstacles. A small coaxial rotor system provides the necessary lift while a movable internal mass controls the direction of travel. In addition, the low mass center and egg-like shaped body creates a means to passively reorient the vehicle to an upright attitude when in ground contact while protecting the rotating components. 	The design, fabrication, and testing of a radio-controlled Hopping <b>Rotochute</b> prototype {{as well as an}} analytical study of the flight performance are documented. The aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical design of the prototype is outlined which were driven by the operational requirements assigned to the vehicle. The aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor system as well as the damping characteristics of the foam base are given based on experimental results using a rotor test stand and a drop test stand respectively. Experimental flight testing results using the prototype are outlined which demonstrate that all design and operational requirements are satisfied. A dynamic model associated with the Hopping <b>Rotochute</b> is then developed including a soft contact model which estimates the forces and moments on the vehicle during ground contact. A comparison between the vehicle's motion measured using a motion capture system and the simulation results are presented to determine the validity of the experimentally-tuned dynamic model. Using this validated simulation model, key parameters such as system weight, rotor speed profile, internal mass weight and location, as well as battery capacity are varied to explore the flight performance characteristics. The sensitivity of the hopping <b>rotochute</b> to atmospheric winds is also investigated as well as the ability of the device to perform trajectory shaping. Ph. D.

40|$|A new hybrid micro vehicle {{called the}} hopping <b>rotochute</b> has been {{developed}} to robustly explore rough and complex terrain. Unlike other jumping robots, the vehicle traverses an area by intermittently powering a small coaxial rotor system that allows the device to hop over obstacles of various shapes and sizes. Amovable internal mass controls the vehicle’s direction of travel, and the exterior shape and low mass center allow the vehicle to passively reorient itself to an upright attitude when {{in contact with the}} ground. This paper presents a dynamic model of the hopping <b>rotochute</b> used to assess the basic flight performance of the vehicle. The experimental methods used to estimate model parameters are described and comparisons between measured and simulated motion are presented. Basic flight performance predicted by dynamic simulation is reported, including maneuverability, jumping performance, and total range. The simulated results indicate that the hopping <b>rotochute</b> is capable of surmounting larger obstacles than current hoppers while being able to navigate {{with the use of a}} movable internal mass.

40|$|The Hopping <b>Rotochute</b> is a {{promising}} micro vehicle with {{the capability of}} exploring rough and complex terrains with minimum energy consumption. While {{it is able to}} fly over obstacles via thrust produced by its coaxial rotor, its physical architecture, inspired from a "Weebles Wooble," provides re-orientation wherever it hits the ground. Therefore, this aerial and ground vehicle represents a potential hybrid vehicle capable of reconnaissance and surveillance missions in complex environments. The most recent version of the Hopping <b>Rotochute</b> is manually controlled to follow a trajectory. The control commands, listed in a file prior to the particular mission, are executed exactly as defined, like a "batch job," regardless of the uncertain external events. This control scheme is likely to cause great deviations from the route. Consequently, the vehicle may finish the mission very far away from the desired end point. However, if a vehicle is capable of receiving the control commands during a mission, "interactive processing" can be realized and efficient path tracking would be achieved. Hence, the development of the Hopping <b>Rotochute</b> that follows a trajectory autonomously reveals the foundation of this thesis. Two control approaches inspired the proposed methodology for developing an autonomous trajectory-following algorithm. The first approach is rule-based control that enables decision making through conditional statements. In this thesis, rule-based control is used to select a target point for a particular hop based on the existence of an obstacle and/or wind in the environment. The second approach is model predictive control employed to predict future outputs from hop performance models. In other words, this technique approaches the problem by providing intelligence pertaining to how a particular hop will end up before being attempted. Hence, the optimum control commands are selected based on the predicted performance of a particular hop. This research demonstrates that the autonomous Hopping <b>Rotochute</b> can be realized by rule-based control embedded with some performance models. In the assumption of known boundaries such as wall and ceiling information, this study has two aims: (1) to avoid obstacles by creating a smaller operational volume inside the real boundaries so that the vehicle is restricted from exiting the operational volume and no violation occurs within the real boundaries; (2) to estimate the wind by previous hops to select the next hopping point with respect to the estimated wind information. Based on the developed methodology, simulations are conducted for four different scenarios in the existence of obstacles and/or wind, and the results of the simulations are analyzed. Finally, based on the statistics of simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is discussed. M. S.

40|$|Received date; Accepted date] – to be {{inserted}} later A hybrid micro air/ground vehicle {{has been developed}} and is specifically tailored to explore interior spaces with complex terrain. The vehicle, called the hopping <b>rotochute,</b> maneuvers through intricate environments by hopping over or through impeding obstacles. A small coaxial rotor system provides the necessary lift while a moveable internal mass allows directional control. In addition, the low mass center and egg-like exterior shape of the body creates a means to passively reorient the vehicle to an upright attitude when {{in contact with the}} ground while protecting the rotating components. This paper examines basic flight performance of the device obtained through a validated simulation. Key parameters such as system weight, rotor speed, internal mass weight and location, as well as battery capacity are varied to explore air vehicle performance characteristics such as single hop height and range, number of hops, and total achievable range. In general, the total achievable range is increased as the internal mass weight, internal mass offset, and battery capacity are increased. For a given system, an optimum rotor speed and pulse width results in the maximum achievable total range for a single battery charge. The sensitivity of the hopping <b>rotochute</b> to atmospheric winds is also investigated and the ability of the device to perform trajectory shaping is shown. 1...|$|E
