Rotation of the lumbar vertebral body and coronal plane deformity {{may influence the}} function of lumbar forward flexibility. We hypothesize that the more advanced axial and coronal plane deformity could cause more limitation on forward flexibility in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Methods: Between January 2011 and August 2011, 85 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were enrolled in this study. The proximal thoracic, major thoracic, thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L), and lumbar (L 1 /L 5) curves were measured by Cobb's method. Lumbar apical rotation was graded using the Nash-Moe score. Lumbar forward flexibility was measured using the sit and reach (S and <b>R)</b> <b>test.</b> Statistical analysis was performed using {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA), Spearman's and Pearson's correlation coefficients. Results: The mean age was 16. 1 ± 2. 84 years. The mean proximal thoracic, major thoracic, TL/L, and L 1 /L 5 curves were 17. 61 ° ± 8. 92, 25. 56 ° ± 11. 61, 26. 09 ° ± 8. 6, and 15. 10 ° ± 7. 85, respectively. The mean S and R measurement was 25. 56 ± 12. 33 cm. The magnitude of the TL/L and L 1 /L 5 curves was statistically positively related to vertebral rotation (rs = 0. 580 and 0. 649, respectively). The correlation between the S and <b>R</b> <b>test</b> and both the TL/L and L 1 /L 5 curves was negative (rp = – 0. 371 and – 0. 595, respectively). Besides, the S and <b>R</b> <b>test</b> also demonstrated a significant negative relationship with vertebral rotation (rs = – 0. 768). Conclusion: In patients with idiopathic scoliosis, spinal deformity can diminish lumbar forward flexibility. Higher lumbar curvature and rotation lead to greater restriction of lumbar flexion...|$|E

Analysis of variance and the <b>r</b> <b>test</b> were performed to determine whether 22 separate factors were associated with the severity of diabetic retinopathy. There were significant associations between retinopathy and duration of disease, systolic blood pressure, urinary albumin index, and blood urea nitrogen. Multiple regression analysis with retinopathy as the criterion variable and 20 other factors as explanatory variables revealed that, of those explanatory variables showing statistical significance, the strongest associations were with duration of disease and type of diabetic therapy, in that order. The <b>r</b> <b>test</b> also revealed significant associations between retinopathy and both the type of diabetic therapy and the use of anti-hypertensive therapy.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} behavior {{of human beings}} is usually supported by rapid monitoring of outstanding events in the environment. Some investigators have suggested that a primary attention deficit might trigger symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, researchers have long discussed the relationship between schizophrenia and the schizophrenia-like psychosis of epilepsy (SLPE). On {{the basis of these}} considerations, the objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate attention performance of patients with both disorders. Patient age was 18 to 60 years, and all patients had received formal schooling for at least four years. Patients were excluded if they had any systemic disease with neurologic or psychiatric comorbidity, or a history of brain surgery. The computer-assisted TAVIS- 2 <b>R</b> <b>test</b> was applied to all patients and to a control group to evaluate and discriminate between selective, alternating and sustained attention. The TAVIS- 2 <b>R</b> <b>test</b> is divided into three parts: one for selective attention (5 min), the second for alternating attention (5 min), and the third for the evaluation of vigilance or sustained attention (10 min). The same computer software was used for statistical analysis of reaction time, omission errors, and commission errors. The sample consisted of 36 patients with schizophrenia, 28 with interictal SLPE, and 47 healthy controls. The results of the selective attention tests for both patient groups were significantly lower than that for controls. The patients with schizophrenia and SLPE performed differently in the alternating and sustained attention tests: patients with SLPE had alternating attention deficits, whereas patients with schizophrenia showed deficits in sustained attention.

In this multicenter prospective study, we {{addressed the issue of}} inter- and intrasite reproducibility using the recently developed reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based MammaTyper (<b>R)</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: Ten international pathology institutions participated in this study and determined messenger RNA expression levels of ERBB 2, ESR 1, PGR, and MKI 67 in both centrally and locally extracted RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer specimens with the MammaTyper (<b>R)</b> <b>test.</b> Samples were measured repeatedly on different days within the local laboratories, and reproducibility was assessed by means of variance component analysis, Fleiss' kappa statistics, and interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: Total variations in measurements of centrally and locally prepared RNA extracts were comparable; therefore, statistical analyses were performed on the complete dataset. Intersite reproducibility showed total SDs between 0. 21 and 0. 44 for the quantitative single-marker assessments, resulting in ICC values of 0. 980 - 0. 998, demonstrating excellent agreement of quantitative measurements. Also, the reproducibility of binary single-marker results (positive/negative), as well as the molecular subtype agreement, was almost perfect with kappa values ranging from 0. 90 to 1. 00. Conclusions: On the basis of these data, the MammaTyper (R) has the potential to substantially improve the current standards of breast cancer diagnostics by providing a highly precise and reproducible quantitative assessment of the established breast cancer biomarkers and molecular subtypes in a decentralized workup...|$|E
