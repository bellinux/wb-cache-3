5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are <b>Red</b> <b>Fescue</b> (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), Tormentil (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis).|$|E

40|$|The wear {{tolerance}} of grasses used {{in sport and}} recreational turf is important both for practical and for economic reasons. It is increasingly important to identify wear-tolerant species and cultivars, especially for early spring and late autumn. In a three year experiment the performance of cool-season turfgrass species, including Agrostis L. spp. (bentgrasses), Poa pratensis L. (smooth-stalked meadow-grass) and Festuca rubra L. (<b>red</b> <b>fescues),</b> was determined in Finland (61 o 17 ŽN, 22 o 14 ŽE). The study contained twenty-nine, nineteen and six cultivars of F. rubra, P. pratensis and Agrostis spp. sown in three separate trials. The trials were subjected to football-type artificial wear twice a week during three growing seasons. Ground cover and tiller density were recorded. The wear {{tolerance of}} species was significantly affected by season and age ofts and treatments. Ability of species to withstand wear varied considerably; the wear resistance of PP. pratensis was excellent, whereas Festuca spp. almost disappeared {{after three years of}} intensive wear. There were also large differences within species. The recovery of Agrostis cultivars from winter was slower than other species. The highest tiller densities of P. pratensis varieties were recorded for "Melba", "Cocktail" and "Limousine" and of Festuca spp. cultivars, "Darwin", "Center" and "Rainbow". The most wear-tolerant fescue cultivars were "Epsom", "Center", "Olivia" and "Diva". There were only minor differences in visually estimated tolerance of P. pratensis cultivars, but the most dense ground cover was recorded for "Limousine", "Conni" and "Cocktail". VokKV...|$|R
40|$|Many {{different}} types of hay are acceptable in horse feed- ing programs. Local availability often influences the popularity of a particular variety of hay in a geographical area. For example, coastal bermudagrass hay is popular in the south-ern United States where it is well adapted, but it is rarely fed in the northern U. S. where {{it is hard to}} grow. In Kentucky, the most popular hay choices for horses are alfalfa, timothy, orchardgrass and alfalfa-grass mixes. Somewhat less popular but still common are <b>red</b> clover, <b>fescue,</b> and bermudagrass. Sev-eral factors should be considered when deciding what type of hay to feed. Most important is cleanliness, but nutrient value and the type of horse being fed should also be considered. The Best Hay Is Clean Hay Without a doubt the best hay for horses is clean hay. Hay that is moldy or dusty should not be fed to horses, even when the amount of mold or dust appears to be minor. Any hay (al...|$|R
40|$|Fluidized bed combustion, a {{desulfurization}} {{process for}} coal-fired power plants, produces a waste that contains {{large amounts of}} calcium oxide and calcium sulfate. Since approximately 200 kg of fluidized bed combustion waste (FBCW) is generated per metric ton of coal burned, it represents a significant potential source of lime that must be evaluated {{before it can be}} properly utilized. In this study, FBCW was compared with calcium hydroxide as a lime source in a greenhouse study with <b>red</b> clover, tall <b>fescue,</b> oat, and buckwheat. The FBCW and calcium hydroxide were applied at rates calculated to adjust the pH of Westmoreland silt loam (Ultic Hapludalf, mixed, mesic) to 5. 0, 5. 5, 6. 0, and 6. 5. Though the loading rates from FBCW were higher than those from calcium hydroxide, FBCW treatments increased Ca levels more than did calcium hydroxide only in red clover. Only dry matter yields of buckwheat were higher for FBCW than for calcium hydroxide applications. All species showed higher FBCW-induced Mg and S increases than hydrated lime. In spite of the Zn loading, Zn levels in herbage decreased as the pH levels increased as a result of FBCW application. Soil pH increases in FBCW and Calcium hydroxide treatments were comparable when the materials were applied in equivalent amounts. It was concluded that FBCW may be valuable as a lime, Mg, or S source when the effects of heavy metals in the material are evaluated...|$|R

500|$|Common cord-grass (Spartina anglica) {{was planted}} {{in the area in}} the 1990s. It can now be found on {{surrounding}} marshes where it has invaded the fronting mudflats. The Spartina is generally shorter in the bay than at other sites due to the high tides and the turbidity of the water, reaching around [...] as opposed to [...] elsewhere. On higher ground common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima) can be found along with sea aster (Aster tripolium). Where the land is ungrazed, common reed (Phragmites australis) often forms a zone above the sea aster. Where the upper marsh is grazed by cattle <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra) and creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera) are found. The area of marsh furthest from the sea supports Sea couch (Agropyron pungens) and sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Grazed grasslands {{have been}} {{identified}} as an important source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. The loss of soil N as N 2 O is a critical factor for managing sustainable agroecosystems, not only with respect to the contribution of N 2 O to global warming by radiative forcing, but also for its effect on stratospheric ozone depletion. An experiment was set up on the experimental farm Østervoll, SE Norway, to investigate the effect of clover density in multi species swards (MSS) on N 2 O emissions from urine patches. The species used in the MMS were ryegrass, tall <b>fescue,</b> <b>red</b> clover and white clover. Clover densities ranged from 0 - 100 % in mixed stands with grass yielding all together nine different treatments. We used artificial urine (50 g N m- 2) to simulate urine deposition and measured N 2 O flux using static chambers. Gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography and soil samples were analyzed for NH 4 + and NO 3 -. Harvest took place on the 13 th of September and the plant samples were analyzed for N yield and clover percentage. The data obtained were analyzed using one way ANOVA. The results showed no significant differences in cumulative N 2 O emission in the period from urea application to ley harvest between grass treatments and grass dominated mixtures, however high emissions were associated with clover monocultures. The high standard error within replicates of the same treatments suggested an effect of topography, resulting in lower emissions in plots situated on a slope, presumably because of nitrogen leaching. When scaled for N-yield, cumulative N 2 O emissions tended to be higher for treatments with high clover percentage. In conclusion, clover percentage and species distribution had little effect on urine-associated N 2 O emissions. This warrants that there might be tradeoff between increasing N uptake by companion grass and N yield-scaled N 2 O emissions in grazed multispecies pastures...|$|R
40|$|Forage {{crops are}} the most {{important}} feed for ruminants and provide energy, fibre and protein as well as essential micronutrients such as cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn). In this thesis, different aspects of the micronutrient concentrations of forage crops were investigated in temporary grasslands in Sweden. Common and novel forage grasses (cocksfoot, meadow fescue, perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, timothy), legumes (birdsfoot trefoil, red clover, white clover) and forbs (caraway, chicory, ribwort plantain, salad burnet) were grown on contrasting soils in a pot experiment (two soils) and a field experiment (timothy, meadow <b>fescue,</b> <b>red</b> clover, white clover, chicory in mixtures, three sites, two soils in common with the pot experiment). The soils were micronutrient-poor/low pH (granitic, till), micronutrient-rich/high pH (alum shale, till) and the third field site had a low soil pH but average soil micronutrient concentrations granitic/sandstone, postglacial) compared to Swedish arable soils. It was found that micronutrient concentrations differ between forage species, but that varietal differences are few and small. Legumes and forbs generally had higher Co, Cu, Fe and Zn concentrations compared to grasses. There were few species differences in Mn concentrations whereas plant Mo concentrations was strongly affected by soil pH. Overall, the plant micronutrient concentrations appeared to be more dependent on the soil pH than on the soil micronutrient concentration (as extracted by EDTA and 7 M nitric acid). The micronutrient concentrations of the grass-legume mixture were affected by the differences in micronutrient concentrations between legumes and grasses, {{as well as by the}} botanical composition of the grasses and legumes in the mixture. An increased proportion of red clover was positively correlated to increased concentrations of several micronutrients in grass-legumes mixtures. The changes in micronutrient concentrations with phenological development at five defined stages were studied in three species. The decline of micronutrient concentrations was largest in timothy, less in perennial ryegrass and least in red clover. The generally low concentrations found in timothy were largely due to the high DM proportion of micronutrient-poor stems. It is concluded that of the forage crops, clover-rich swards harvested at an early development stage have higher micronutrient concentrations, although the soil characteristics also have a large impact...|$|R

[...] These Soay sheep are believed to be remnants of the earliest sheep kept in Europe in the Neolithic Era, and are small, short-tailed, usually brown with white bellies, and have naturally moulting fleeces. [...] About 200 Soay sheep remain on Soay itself, and soon after the evacuation a second feral population of them was established on Hirta, which at that time had no sheep; these now number between 600 and 1,700. A few Soays have been exported to form breeding populations {{in other parts of the}} world, where they are valued for their hardiness, small size and unusual appearance. On Hirta and Soay, the sheep prefer the Plantago pastures, which grow well in locations exposed to sea spray and include <b>red</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra), sea plantain (Plantago maritima) and sea pink (Armeria maritima).|$|E
