Marina Militare (Italian navy) warships were positioned along the shorelines of Italy armed with torpedoes. Gunboats <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the rivers and waterways of Rome, including the Tiber River which flows around Vatican City.|$|E
500|$|When {{ambulance}} {{crew members}} Reg Jones and John Saua {{arrived at the}} Samarkand, {{the door to the}} flat was wide open, the gas fire was on, the curtains were drawn, and the apartment was dark. The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: [...] "Well, we had to get the police, we only had [...] and an empty flat, so John <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> radioed, and got the aspirator... It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of it all over the pillow—black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down... We felt his pulse... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all." [...] At 11:30a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: [...] "Once the police arrived, which seemed like no time at all, we got [...] off to hospital as quick as we could." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} between {{his senior year}} of high school and his {{freshman}} year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began an intense regimen of weight training, and <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as [...] "the happiest time in my life." [...] He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him. A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American. Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his {{senior year of high}} school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.|$|E

2500|$|This Manlove Alliott {{design was}} a {{self-propelled}} steam vehicle having a vertical boiler on each end platform {{with the engine}} mounted below the saloon floor. The upper deck had knife-board seats, back to back, with a top canopy and open sides and ends, with modesty rails. The boiler chimneys <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> through the roof, at each end, serving coke boilers 25½ inches in diameter and [...] high. The two-cylinder steam engine had a piston bore of 7½ inches and a stroke of 9inches. Unladen it weighed 9 tons and was capable of carrying 50 passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Campese {{scored two}} tries in a 32-13 {{victory over the}} Scottish rugby team, in which Australia scored five tries to Scotland's two. Former Wallaby captain Andrew Slack, author of Noddy: The Official Biography of Michael Lynagh, wrote that, [...] "Australia won 32-13 and {{although}} Lynagh was successful with only five kicks from eleven attempts, two delicate chip kicks provided tries for David Campese and ensured the restoration of Australia's rugby reputation." [...] Slack further wrote that, [...] "Campese had been the undoubted star of the tour, and that was made clear by the four youngsters who <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the Murrayfield pitch after the game waving a large banner reading 'David Campese Walks on Water.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Cadwalader {{included}} with his letter a [...] "rough {{draft of the}} road from this place," [...] meaning from Crosswicks, where Cadwalader was at the time, to Princeton. The map was highly detailed. Cadwalader put numbers next to bridges, for example, to indicate the number of soldiers defending them. A block of text perpendicular to the others <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down {{the right side of}} the map, highlighting a road: [...] "This road leads to the back part of Princeton which may be entered anywhere on this side—the country cleared, chiefly, for about 2 miles... few fences." [...] The map was particularly helpful in that it displayed not what existed at the time Cadwalader drew it up, but what would exist by the time General Washington could act on the intelligence it provided. In other words, the map was estimative, indicating [...] "works begun, and those intended this morning." ...|$|E

2500|$|That bad bowling on that Sunday, that's {{the only}} regret I have in cricket, and I'm sorry I can't have it over again, because knowing what I could do, in my opinion, that's what hurts {{most of all}} [...] [...] Sometimes it haunts me, but anyway, that's {{part and parcel of}} life, and you cop it sweet. Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back bad memories, but you cop it sweet and anyone decent you respond by telling them what you think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Chester Smith, {{the retired}} East Liverpool Police Captain and sharpshooter, {{described}} events differently in a 1979 interview for TIME magazine. Smith, who {{was credited with}} shooting Floyd first, stated that he had deliberately wounded, but not killed, Floyd. He added: [...] "I knew Purvis couldn't hit him, so I dropped him with two shots from my [...]32 Winchester rifle." [...] According to Smith's account, after being wounded, Floyd fell and did not regain his footing. Smith then disarmed Floyd. At that point, Purvis <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ordered: [...] "Back away from that man. I {{want to talk to}} him." [...] Purvis questioned Floyd briefly, and after receiving curses in reply ordered agent Herman [...] "Ed" [...] Hollis to [...] "Fire into him." [...] Hollis then shot Floyd at point-blank range with a sub-machine gun, killing him. The interviewer asked if there was a cover-up by the FBI, and Smith responded: [...] "Sure was, because they didn't want it to get out that he'd been killed that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{searched for}} a site for his new park and found one on Lehigh Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets, five blocks west of Baker Bowl, {{straddling}} the neighborhoods known as Swampoodle and Goosetown. It was still primitive at the time, an area of [...] "high clay bluffs, rain-washed gullies, quagmires, open fields, even ponds" [...] where chickens pecked and pigs rooted. Although a grid of streets was planned for the area, few actually existed. The area was already served by public transportation: trolleys <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down Broad Street and back and forth along Lehigh, and both the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads had major stations nearby. The area had [...] "underachieved" [...] thus far due {{to the presence of}} the city's Hospital for Contagious Diseases (the [...] "smallpox hospital") a block west on Lehigh, but Shibe's privileged connections in town brought him word that the city would be closing the facility. Without the hospital, the area's stigma would eventually dissipate, but at the time, the land was still a bargain.|$|E

2500|$|From December 26 to December 31, 1969, Weatherman {{held the}} last of its National Council {{meetings}} in Flint, Michigan. Flying to the event, Dohrn and Jacobs <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the aisles of the airplane, seizing food, frightening the passengers. The meeting, dubbed the [...] "War Council" [...] by the 400 people who attended, adopted Jacobs' call for violent revolution. Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the [...] "armed struggle." [...] Reminding the delegates {{of the murder of}} Sharon Tate and four others on August 9, 1969 by members of the Manson Family. [...] "Dig it," [...] Dohrn said approvingly. [...] "First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner {{in the same room with}} them, they even shoved a fork into a victim’s stomach! Wild!" [...] She then held up three fingers in what she called the [...] "Manson fork salute." [...] Over the next five days, the participants met in informal, random groups to discuss what [...] "going underground" [...] meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass [...] "wargasm"—practicing karate, engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches. The [...] "War Council" [...] ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. J.J. condemned the [...] "pacifism" [...] of white middle-class American youth, a belief which they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of [...] "repersonalization" [...] brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution. [...] "We're against everything that's 'good and decent' in honky America," [...] Jacobs said in his most oft-quoted statement. [...] "We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother's nightmare." ...|$|E
