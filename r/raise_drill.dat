60|$|During those fiery and feverish days, {{every citizen}} of the loyal states felt himself to be, in reserve at least, a {{possible}} soldier. It was necessary to <b>raise,</b> <b>drill,</b> and render effective in an incredibly short time a large army; {{and it would have}} been impossible to do so had it not been for the eager enthusiasm with which civilians of every sort enlisted, and threw themselves into their military duties with almost incredible devotion. Garfield felt that he must bear his own part in the struggle by fighting it out, not in the Senate but on the field; and his first move was to obtain a large quantity of arms from the arsenal in the doubtfully loyal state of Missouri. In this mission he was completely successful; and he was next employed to raise and organize two new regiments of Ohio infantry. Garfield, of course, knew absolutely nothing of military matters at that time; but it was not a moment to stand upon questions of precedence or experience; the born organizers came naturally to the front, and Garfield was one of them. Indeed, the faculty for organization seems innate in the American people, so that when it became necessary to raise and equip so large a body of men at a few weeks' notice, the task was undertaken offhand by lawyers, doctors, shopkeepers, and schoolmasters, without a minute's hesitation, and was performed on the whole with distinguished success.|$|E

40|$|While {{world oil}} {{production}} and reserves have been increasing since 1859, ‘peak oil’ analysts claim that production is {{on the cusp of}} a period of sustained decline. I first subject the peak oil model to a number of robustness tests. The peak oil assumption of a linear relationship between the ratio of production to cumulative production and cumulative production is rejected using data from different regions, time periods, and commodities. The peak oil model predicts a single peak in discoveries, followed by peak in proved reserves, then a peak in production. Yet, world discoveries have had four distinct peaks since 1950, and world proved reserves have continued to rise. Second, I derive an economic model of oil supply in which scarcity occurs both in total reserves and in the quality of those reserves. Depletion <b>raises</b> <b>drilling</b> costs and reduces the size of undiscovered pools. Technological change driven by learning-by-doing offsets Ricardian depletion effects.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the concept of}} shaft constructed by raise boring in underground mines, {{and the idea of}} inverse construction can be extended to other fields of underground engineering. The conventional raise boring methods, such as the wood support method, the hanging cage method, the creeping cage method, and the deep-hole blasting method, are analyzed and compared. In addition, the raise boring machines are classified into different types and the characteristics of each type are described. The components of a raise boring machine including the drill rig, the drill string and the auxiliary system are also presented. Based on the analysis of the raise boring method, the rock mechanics problems during the raise boring process are put forward, including rock fragmentation, removal of cuttings, shaft wall stability, and borehole deviation control. Finally, the development trends of raise boring technology are described as follows: (i) improvement of rock-breaking modes to <b>raise</b> <b>drilling</b> efficiency, (ii) development of an intelligent control technique, and (iii) development of technology and equipment for nonlinear raise boring...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNDWorkers {{who stand}} on {{platforms}} or equipment that vibrate {{are exposed to}} foot-transmitted vibration (FTV). Exposure to FTV can lead to vibration white feet/toes resulting in blanching of the toes, and tingling and numbness in the feet and toes. OBJECTIVESThe objectives are 1) to review {{the current state of}} knowledge of the health risks associated with foot-transmitted vibration (FTV), and 2) to identify the characteristics of FTV and discuss the associated risk of vibration-induced injury. PARTICIPANTSWorkers who operated locomotives (n = 3), bolting platforms (n = 10), jumbo drills (n = 7), <b>raise</b> <b>drilling</b> platforms (n = 4), and crushers (n = 3), participated. METHODSA tri-axial accelerometer was used to measure FTV in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 guidelines. Frequency-weighted root-mean-square acceleration and the dominant frequency are reported. Participants were also asked to report pain/ache/discomfort in the hands and/or feet. RESULTSReports of pain/discomfort/ache were highest in raise platform workers and jumbo drill operators who were exposed to FTV in the 40 Hz and 28 Hz range respectively. Reports of discomfort/ache/pain were lowest in the locomotive and crusher operators who were exposed to FTV below 10 Hz. These findings are consistent with animal studies that have shown vascular and neural damage in exposed appendages occurs at frequencies above 40 Hz. CONCLUSIONSOperators exposed to FTV at 40 Hz appear to be at greater risk of experiencing vibration induced injury. Future research is required to document the characteristics of FTV and epidemiological evidence is required to link exposure with injury.

40|$|Water {{shortage}} {{is a major}} constraint to sustaining {{and increasing}} the productivity of rice-wheat systems.

40|$|The current paper reports {{selected}} {{findings from}} a major collaborative research programme conducted in the United Kingdom into the fundamental understanding of laser shock peening, when applied to key airframe and aero-engine alloys {{as a means of}} controlling fatigue performance. It is recognised that relatively deep compressive residual stresses are generated into the surface of a material subjected to LSP which can subsequently resist fatigue crack initiation from that surface. However, it is clear that balancing tensile stress will evolve at some location within the material in order to satisfy equilibrium and under certain circumstances this can lead to sub-surface fatigue initiation. The distribution of the RS field will be highly dependent on LSP process parameters, the structural form and the precise mode and raster pattern of pulse application. Finite element models will be described that predict the RS fields associated with LSP applied to the aerospace grade aluminium alloys Al 2024 and Al 7010 using an eigenstrain approach. Validation of these models is provided by laboratory fatigue experiments on test coupons containing different LSP patch geometries (full width or centre constrained), supplementary stress <b>raising</b> features (<b>drilled</b> holes) and different through thickness dimensions. Particular attention is paid to modelling the application of LSP at edge locations in terms of the angle of incidence and laser pulse sequencing. Interactions between the LSP process and geometric features was found to be key to understanding the location for fatigue crack initiation. Particularly relevant for engineering application, was the fact that not all instances of LSP application provided an improvement in cyclic fatigue life. <br/...|$|R

40|$|PurposeTo {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of local exhaust ventilation to control respirable crystalline silica exposures to acceptable levels during concrete dowel drilling. ApproachPersonal breathing zone samples for respirable dust and crystalline silica were collected while laborers drilled holes 3. 5 cm diameter by 36 cm deep in a concrete slab using a single-drill slab-riding dowel drill equipped with local exhaust ventilation. Data were collected on air flow, weather, and productivity. ResultsAll respirable dust samples were below the 90 25 g detection limit which, when combined with the largest sample volume, resulted in a minimum detectable concentration of 0. 31 mg m 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 0193. This occurred in a 32 -min sample collected when 27 holes were drilled. Quartz was only detected in one air sample; 0. 09 mg m 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 0193 of quartz was found on an 8 -min sample collected during a drill maintenance task. The minimum detectable concentration for quartz in personal air samples collected while drilling was performed was 0. 02 mg m 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 0193. The average number of holes drilled during each drilling sample was 23. Over {{the course of the}} 2 -day study, air flow measured at the dust collector decreased from 2. 2 to 1. 7 m 3 s 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 0191. ConclusionsThe dust control performed well under the conditions of this test. The initial duct velocity with a clean filter was sufficient to prevent settling, but gradually fell below the recommended value to prevent dust from settling in the duct. The practice of <b>raising</b> the <b>drill</b> between each hole may have prevented the dust from settling in the duct.

40|$|Deep {{drilling}} technologies use MWD (Measuring While Drilling) and LWD (Logging While Drilling) systems {{near the}} drill bit {{in order to}} gather large amounts of directional and geological information. The data are mostly processed downhole. To transmit the main results to the surface in nearly real time a high speed data communication system with more than 100 bit/s is highly advantageous. The most commonly usedprocessfor data transmission in boreholes is the so called mud pulse telemetry. However, mud pulse telemetry systems cannot transmit such high data rates. A significant improvement is expected {{through the use of}} acoustic waves along the drill string for data transmission. In the 1980 s and 1990 s there were some attempts to transmit the downhole data by means of acoustic signals along the metallic drill string to the surface. However, these trials were not much of a success, because the acoustic transmission channel of a real drill string was too complex for the applied modulation schemes. In details, a drill string channel configuration consisting {{of a large number of}} drill pipes and tooljoints with different diameters causes multiple signal reflections and depending on the superimposing of all reflections with the original signal, pass- and stop bands will be created. This limits the achievable data rate, because only thepassbands are suitable for use by data transmission. Moreover, the characteristics of the pass- and stop bands vary with each change in the drill string configuration. Because of such challenging issues, the acoustic transmission process is significantly complex. However, the deployment of new actuators in combination with latest state of the art techniques from mobile communications can overcome the mentioned difficulties. Such techniques enable for instance an adaptive bi-directional communication to be applied, whereby the data transmission can continuously be adapted to the changing channel characteristics. As a first step for the application of the acoustic communication system on a real drill string a prototype systemfor unidirectional communication (uplink transmission) was developed and built up. Due to their relatively large sizes (outer diameter: 11 1 / 4 "), the current prototype components cannot be used in standard deep bottom hole assemblies. However, suitable drill strings for such prototype sizes are found in mining drilling operations, for example with <b>raise</b> bore <b>drilling.</b> Thus, the initial prototype components were designed to be integrated into a <b>raise</b> bore <b>drill</b> string. The highly robust communication concept was developed to allow initial data rates of up to 30 bit/s. The prototype transmitting system consists of two units. The first one is located downhole. It includes a generator, a battery and a transmitter-sub. Furthermore there is the surface unit, which includes a receiver module, a WLAN access point and a terminal computer. The downhole batteiy can be recharged by a downhole alternator, which is driven by the drilling mud. The receiver module is attached to the uppermost drill string element and connected via a WiFi module to the terminal computer. At the surface unit the received data will be decoded and evaluated. The communication system is ready to be tested on a real well to transmit different types of data to the surface and to decode them there. The data to be transmitted during the initial field test will include information about the battery status, the temperature of the downhole unit in addition to dynamic and directional drilling data. In order to test the application limits as well as the robustness of the novel acoustic data transmission system, the influence of different interferences and noise sources on the data transmission quality were to he investigated. Unfortunately, the field trial was delaved several times and in the end cancelled in the scope of this project. But results from laboratory tests are available. During these investigations with the new acoustic communication telemetry system several interfering signals were generated to simulate real operation. Water waspumped through the system and the mechanical interaction between the drill string and the borehole wall was reproduced by rubbing on the drill string with sandpaper and applying hammer scales as well as combinations thereof Although the induced interferences reduced the quality of the data stream, the data transmission along the drill string was still possible in the presence of any kind of interference. The next development step would be the implementation of an adaptive, bi-directional communication system. This already has been built up and tested in the laboratory setup. The bi-directional communication system will significantly increase the transmission rate...|$|R

The Advanced Piston Corer (APC), a soft sediment coring system developed from the hydraulic piston corer (HPC), allows recovery of ocean sediments with minimal coring disturbance. As a coring too[, the APC system is subject to limitations imposed by the effect of geology, for example the physical properties and sediment type. Critical questions to be addressed here are the inability to thrust the core barrel into a stiff sediment formation and the need to extract it without suffering mechanical failure. These two problems, penetration and overpull refusal, are the major reasons for stopping APC coring. Measurements of physical properties have been made on more than 400 APC holes cored from beneath the ocean floor. These samples represent several sediment types deposited in various environmental settings, as well they consist of different physical properties (bulk density, etc.). The properties measured at the limits of APC coring (deepest APC core) are used to understand how APC coring works as a function of sediment type and of the physical properties of the sediment. This understanding may allow the APC to be used more efficiently in the future and improve the quality of science obtained from APC cores. Based on the data from the Ocean Drilling Program (158 APC holes), this study indicates trends in the physical properties of sediment recovered from deepest APC core with the depth of maximum APC penetration from each hole. The performance of the APC varies with lithology. The occurrence of APC refusal (overpull and penetration refusal) depends on different physical properties and sediment types. In general, overpull refusal occurred mostly in biogenic sediments, while non-biogenic sediments with higher wet-bulk density and lower water content or porosity are more likely to lead to penetration refusal than others. The introduction of APC- 129 (the upgrade of the APC), which was first used during ODP Leg 130 in 1990, improved the performance of APC coring in calcareous sediments. A pullout force is needed to withdraw the core barrel from the sediment by <b>raising</b> the <b>drill</b> string. The results of APC coring accord with the theoretical relationship between pullout forces and shear strength. Pullout force correlated with shear strength of the sediment and the depth below seafloor...|$|R
50|$|May 25, 1917. My dear Sir: You have doubtless {{seen the}} President's {{announcement}} wherein {{he refused to}} make use of the Volunteer Forces which Congress had authorized him to permit me to raise. Prior to this announcement by the President, I had sent him a telegram as follows: -- Ed. note: see above -- Accordingly, I communicated with as many of the men who had agreed to raise units for service in this division as possible, and after consultation with about twenty of them I issued the statement which is herewith appended. I now release you and all your men. I wish to express my deep sense of obligation to you and to all those who had volunteered under and in connection with this division. As you doubtless know, I am very proud of the Rough Riders, the First Volunteer Cavalry, with whom I served in the Spanish-American War. I believe it is a just and truthful statement of the facts when I say that this regiment did as well as any of the admirable regular regiments with which it served in the Santiago campaign. It was <b>raised,</b> armed, equipped, <b>drilled,</b> mounted, dismounted, kept two weeks aboard transports and put through two victorious aggressive fights in which it lost one-third of the officers and one-fifth of the men; all within sixty days from the time I received my commission. If the President had permitted me to raise the four divisions, I am certain that they would have equalled the record, only on a hundredfold larger scale. They would have all been on the firing line before or shortly after the draft army had begun to assemble, and moreover they could have been indefinitely reinforced, so that they would have grown continually stronger and more efficient. I regret from the standpoint of the country that your services were not utilized. But the country has every reason to be proud of the zeal, patriotism and businesslike efficiency with which you came forward. With all good wishes, Faithfully yours, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.|$|R
