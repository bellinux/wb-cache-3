5|$|The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an American self-regulatory {{organization}} that assigns age and content <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> consumer video games. The ESRB {{was established in}} 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{delivered}} the series to ITV in August 2003 for broadcast {{in the autumn}} schedules, but it was then rescheduled four times {{over the next several}} months, before ITV eventually set a premiere date of 11 July 2004. It was then rescheduled to the preceding Wednesday, in the 9 pm slot. The series lost two million viewers over two weeks and ITV pulled episode four from the schedules on the morning before it was due for broadcast, replacing it with It Shouldn't Happen on a TV Soap, a bloopers programme, which returned ITV's <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> above the five million mark.|$|E
5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L. Fleiss) is a {{statistical}} measure {{for assessing the}} reliability of agreement between a fixed number of raters when assigning categorical <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> a number of items or classifying items. This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when assessing the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E

50|$|While Rashid et al. did not examine lurkers directly, they {{conducted}} an experimental study on MovieLens that investigated {{how to raise}} low contribution rates in online communities. They discovered that participants showed a higher likelihood of rating movies when <b>ratings</b> were valuable <b>to</b> someone than when ratings {{were associated with the}} probability of having previously watched a movie. Furthermore, they found that participants showed an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when <b>ratings</b> were valuable <b>to</b> MovieLens subgroups than when <b>ratings</b> were valuable <b>to</b> the entire MovieLens online community, and participants demonstrated an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when <b>ratings</b> were valuable <b>to</b> individuals who liked similar movie genres as the participant than when <b>ratings</b> were valuable <b>to</b> individuals who liked dissimilar movie genres as the participant. These authors also found that participants demonstrated a reduced likelihood of rating movies when <b>ratings</b> were valuable <b>to</b> oneself than when <b>ratings</b> were valuable <b>to</b> someone else. Given these findings, Rashid et al. claim, “…designers can use information about the beneficiaries of contributions to create subtle and integrated messages to increase motivation”(p. 958).|$|R
5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E

After {{a meeting at}} Scapa Flow later in July between Sims, Jellicoe, and Admiral David Beatty (commander of the Grand Fleet), the Admiralty requested that the U.S. Navy send four dreadnoughts and six destroyers to join the Grand Fleet. The Admiralty intended that {{the arrival of the}} American dreadnoughts would allow it to decommission five ships of the pre-dreadnought , freeing up four thousand officers and <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> serve on new light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines then under construction.|$|E

McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> be published on the service, and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.|$|E

5|$|Statistical ranking systems place Lasker {{high among}} the {{greatest}} players of all time. The book Warriors of the Mind places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca. In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> players {{based on their}} performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of those surveyed (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca). The most up-to-date system, Chessmetrics, is rather sensitive {{to the length of}} the periods being compared, and ranks Lasker between fifth and second strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Big Brother 11 was the {{eleventh}} {{season of the}} American reality television series Big Brother. It {{is based upon the}} Netherlands series of the same name, which gained notoriety in 1999 and 2000. The series premiered on CBS on July 9, 2009 and lasted ten weeks until the live finale on September 15, 2009. The eleventh season saw a slight increase in ratings when compared to the past season of the series, which had some of the lowest <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> date. The season premiered to a total of 6.59 million viewers, a slight increase from the previous season's launch. Despite this, it is the second lowest premiere for a season behind Big Brother 10. The season finale had a total of 7.78 million viewers, continuing to average slightly above the past season. In total, the series averaged 7.19 million viewers, higher than that of the previous two seasons. Big Brother 11 featured a total of 13 HouseGuests, one of which was a returning player from a previous season. The series ended after 73 days, in which HouseGuest Jordan Lloyd was crowned the winner and Natalie Martinez the runner-up.|$|E
5|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) was $8.3 billion in 2012, a figure {{expected to rise}} to $15 billion in 2013. In 2012, Fitch Group upgraded Turkey's credit rating to investment grade after an 18-year gap; {{this was followed by}} a ratings upgrade by Moody's in May 2013, as the service lifted Turkey's government bond <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> the lowest investment grade Baa3. In September 2016, Moody's cut Turkey's sovereign debt to junk status. In the economic crisis of 2016 it emerged that the huge debts incurred for investment during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government since 2002 had mostly been consumed in construction, rather than invested in sustainable economic growth. Private bank debts in Turkey were 6.6 billion TL in 2002 and had increased to 385 billion TL by the end of 2015.|$|E

40|$|Most {{of what we}} {{know about}} what makes a face {{attractive}} and why we have the preferences we do is based on attractiveness ratings of static images of faces, usually photographs. However, several reports that such <b>ratings</b> fail <b>to</b> correlate significantly with <b>ratings</b> made <b>to</b> dynamic video clips, which provide richer samples of appearance, challenge the validity of this literature. Here, we tested the validity of attractiveness <b>ratings</b> made <b>to</b> static images, using a substantial sample of male faces. We found that these ratings agreed very strongly with <b>ratings</b> made <b>to</b> videos of these men, despite the presence of much more information in the videos (multiple views, neutral and smiling expressions and speech-related movements). Not surprisingly, given this high agreement, the components of video-attractiveness were also very similar to those reported previously for static-attractiveness. Specifically, averageness, symmetry and masculinity were all significant components of attractiveness rated from videos. Finally, regression analyses yielded very similar effects of attractiveness on success in obtaining sexual partners, whether attractiveness was rated from videos or static images. These results validate the widespread use of attractiveness <b>ratings</b> made <b>to</b> static images in evolutionary and social psychological research. We speculate that this validity may stem from our tendency to make rapid and robust judgements of attractiveness...|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{his senior}} year, ESPN named {{him as one}} of the top 25 three point {{shooters}} in the national class of 2012. At the time of their November 2011 National Letter of Intent signings, Stauskas, Glenn Robinson III and Mitch McGary gave Michigan a consensus top 10 entering class for its 2012 class. Stauskas visited Michigan along with future teammate Robinson to see the 61–56 New Year's Day 2012 victory by the 2011–12 Wolverines team over Minnesota. Then Stauskas led St. Mark's to 67–57 victory in a 2012 Hoophall Classic contest with 16 points against Friends Central. As the season progressed, Stauskas (and Robinson) improved in the national player <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> offset McGary's slide and maintain a top-rated class. He scored 19 to lead his school to a 59–53 2012 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game victory over Noel's Tilton. Stauskas earned the NEPSAC championship game MVP. He was selected to the 2012 All-NEPSAC Class AA first team (along with teammate Kaleb Tarczewski). Following these honors, Stauskas's stock and rankings continued to rise.|$|E
