40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the torque. The hub and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut. The hub also forms the support for the pitch change actuator system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The single <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal. Stress and strain analysis, material hardness requirements, weight predictions, and stiffness characteristics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used as low friction joints between rotating machine components. In industrial applications, bearings are considered as critical mechanical components and a defect in such a bearing, unless detected in time, causes malfunction and may even lead to catastrophic failure of the machinery. The research work presented focuses upon the detection of a localized defect in a double <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> using vibration analysis. For bearing analysis, frequency domain approach is taken followed by experimentation {{for the detection of}} vibration signal in which single point defects are artificially created on ball, inner race and outer race, then for vibration response these defected double row ball bearings are tested under different speed and loading conditions, and resulting vibration signals are then processed using considered vibration-based techniques in frequency domain.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{a dynamic}} multibody {{model of a}} deep groove single <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> The objective {{of the study is}} to simulate the dynamic behavior of a bearing under different operational conditions. Typical vibration signals used in bearing diagnostics are simulated using the non-linear Hertzian contact theory. Geometry, material properties, friction and damping coefficients are considered as input while displacements, velocities, accelerations and forces between bearing rings are calculated and validated with the analytical formulations found in literature. Furthermore localized faults are introduced in the simulation in order to extract bearing defect frequencies and to represent the real vibration signal signature in case of fault components. For this purpose, a simplified model is realized using the polygonal contact model. This approach allows to investigate more in detail the effect of localized defects by reproducing the real rolling elements trajectories through a discretization of the contact surfaces. The low computation efficiency compared to the traditional Hertzian approach limits the application of this contact algorithm on the complete bearing model. Nevertheless, the simplified model allows to draw conclusions regarding the influence of the shaft/cage speed on the fault size estimation giving an innovative contribution on bearing diagnostics. status: publishe...|$|E

The double <b>row</b> angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> supports combined axial and radial loads, provides high shaft stiffness and limits {{the movement of}} the pump impeller, shaft, and seal. Recent studies, tests, and analysis of double <b>row</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> operating in various conditions have both confirmed and contradicted some long held opinions, regarding the application of these bearings in centrifugal pumps. The studies indicate the Conrad type (e. g., without filling slot) double <b>row</b> angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> operate at lower temperatures than the maximum capacity failing slot type double row bearings at 3, 600 rpm rotational speed. These lower operating temperatures result in longer bearing and lubricant life and greater pump reliability. The filling slot of the modern design maximum capacity double row bearing has been redesigned so that it seldom has direct influence n the bearing life and performance when correctly applied in the pump. Double <b>row</b> angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> having moderate to high contact angle and normal axial internal clearance operate at lower temperature and have better internal motion than bearings having lower contact angles and greater clearances in typical pump application conditions.

50|$|Sven Wingqvist, at {{the time}} a thirty-year-old plant {{engineer}} responsible for repairs and maintenance at Gamlestadens Fabriker, was dissatisfied with the performance of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> then in use. These were rigid <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> imported from Germany, and if the long shafts on the machinery in a textile mill were the least bit misaligned, the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> would become overheated and break down, bringing production to a costly halt. In spring 1907, Wingquist presented a breakthrough - a double <b>row</b> self-aligning <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> with a spherical raceway in the outer ring, shared by both <b>rows</b> of <b>balls.</b> This allowed the inner ring to align freely in relation to the outer ring, with no negative impact on the function of the bearing. The new bearing solved the problem associated with misalignment of the shafts and thus did away with the frequent production stops. Self-alignment was particularly useful in the less-than-perfect machinery of the times and in buildings with subsidence problems, which was the case at Gamlestadens Fabriker, since much of the land on which Gothenburg has been built is clay.|$|R

40|$|The pitch bearing, which {{connects the}} hub and the blades, allows the {{required}} oscillating {{movements of the}} blade, to change the angle of attack thus reducing the lift and drag coefficients there by controlling power and loads of the wind turbine. During the service life of the turbine of approximately 20 years the pitch bearing is loaded dynamically. In a double <b>row</b> four-point contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing,</b> which is often used for this application, the described loads lead to radial and axial displacements between {{the inner and outer}} ring and deformations. These displacements and deformations lead to contact angles which vary from the mounted contact angle which is given by the supplier of the bearing. These divergent angles are called free contact angles. For a four-point contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> the mounted contact angle in the presented example is 45 Â°. Deviations from the mounted contact angle can lead to reduced fatigue life of the bearing and increased wear, arising from the modified contact behavior. Under axial loads and bending moments the contact area shifts perpendicular to the rolling direction. In the worst case the contact area is truncated, which leads to concentrated and comparatively high stresses. This paper shows how the free contact angles of a double <b>row</b> four-point contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> of a modern wind turbine with 7. 5 MW behaves during the service life and the effects of contact angle variations to the stress distribution.

A thorough, systematic investigation with the help of fishbone approach is carried in order to find out the root cause of the failure and also to decide on new rig.

40|$|AbstractClearance {{not only}} affects the startup torque, {{rotation}} precision and stiffness of bearing, but also affects the load distribution, load-carrying capacity and life of bearing. A computational {{model in which}} the clearance of bearing is first included is presented for determining the contact force distribution and static load-carrying capacity of a double <b>row</b> four-point contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> which is subjected to the combined radial, axial and overturning moment loadings.

The results show that, with the increase in the absolute value of negative clearance, the maximum contact load decreases first and then increases. The clearance values in the range of âˆ’ 0. 2 Â mmâ€“ 0 Â mm have little effect on the static load-carrying capacity of bearing.

It is shown that the natural frequencies depend on applied in-plane load, initial geometrical imperfection and the in-plane boundary conditions.;In the theoretical analysis, the natural frequencies, out-of-plane static displacements and in-plane stress distribution are calculated using the Rayleigh-Ritz minimization technique.

In this concept, the relationship between the out-of-plane and in-plane displacement coefficients are first determined by solving the equations resulting from the minimization of the total potential energy with respect to the in-plane displacement coefficients.
