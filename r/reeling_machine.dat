25|$|Silk is {{produced}} year-round in Thailand by {{two types of}} silkworms, the cultured Bombycidae and wild Saturniidae. Most production is after the rice harvest in the southern and northeastern parts of the country. Women traditionally weave silk on hand looms and pass the skill on to their daughters, as weaving {{is considered to be}} a sign of maturity and eligibility for marriage. Thai silk textiles often use complicated patterns in various colours and styles. Most regions of Thailand have their own typical silks. A single thread filament is too thin to use on its own so women combine many threads to produce a thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to produce a uniform strand of raw silk. The process takes around 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local operations use a <b>reeling</b> <b>machine</b> for this task, but some silk threads are still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between video slot <b>machines</b> and <b>reel</b> <b>machines</b> is in the way payouts are calculated. With <b>reel</b> <b>machines,</b> {{the only way to}} win the maximum jackpot is to play the maximum number of coins (usually 3, sometimes 4, or even 5 coins per spin). With video machines, the fixed payout values are multiplied by the number of coins per line that is being bet. In other words: on a <b>reel</b> <b>machine,</b> the odds are less unfavorable if the gambler plays with the maximum number of coins available.|$|R

50|$|The AQS-18 (V)-3 is one export {{version of}} the US Navy’s AQS-13F helicopter-borne dipping sonar and is used by many {{friendly}} nations, including the Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. It contains many of the high-performance features of the US Navy version. In high reverberation-limited conditions the sonar system transmits a specially shaped pulse and its digital signal processor employs Fast Fourier Transform techniques to increase detection capabilities. A high source level provides long range search capabilities, improved figure of merit, and a high-speed <b>reeling</b> <b>machine</b> to achieve maximum depth and retrieve the sonar transducer rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|The AQS-13 {{system was}} {{introduced}} to the US fleet aboard the Sikorsky SH-3D anti-submarine warfare helicopter in the mid-1960s. This was an upgrade from the AQS-10 system carried aboard the SH-3A helicopter. The AQS-13 offered an improved <b>reeling</b> <b>machine</b> and longer cable or [...] "wet-end" [...] than the AQS-10. The [...] "dry-end" [...] components of the system remained essentially the same as the AQS-10. Developed in the 1950s, these components utilized primarily vacuum tube technology. The RO-358 chart recorder provided a means of recording a permanent record of target data as well as additional means for target evaluation.|$|E
5000|$|The AQS-13 {{systems are}} all {{primarily}} active sonar transmitting {{in the upper}} end of the medium frequency sonar range. These systems offered the additional capabilities of voice communication, bathythermography and rudimentary passive sonar. Helicopter borne active sonar has significant advantages over other sensors and is especially effective in the inner zone where noise from the ships of the carrier battle group can interfere with passive sensors. The components of the AQS-13 are informally divided into two groups, the [...] "wet end" [...] and [...] "dry end." [...] The [...] "dry end" [...] involves the processing of the acoustic signals to obtain tactical data. The [...] "wet end" [...] components are those necessary to deploy the acoustic unit into the ocean and retrieve it. These [...] "wet" [...] components include the acoustic elements in a submersible unit, the reel & cable and <b>reeling</b> <b>machine.</b> The hydrophone and projector elements are housed within the submersible unit or transducer. The transducer, also called the [...] "dome", a term borrowed from ship-board sonars, is lowered or [...] "dipped" [...] from the helicopter on a cable by means of the hydraulic <b>reeling</b> <b>machine.</b> The dip depth of the transducer is selected by the operator to achieve the maximum detection probability at the dip location on that particular day as determined by the study of ocean conditions (see Underwater Acoustics). During active search, the acoustic pulse is emitted from the projector assembly. Echos or [...] "returns" [...] are received by the hydrophone, routed through the sonar cable, processed in the aircraft and displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT) in a plan position indicator (PPI) format. Returns were also processed and made available to the RO-358 chart recorder in the AQS-13E and earlier systems. This data was made available to the aircraft tactical computer in the AQS-13F. The various functions were selectable by the operator, such as pulse lengths, range scales and other modes to enhance operations for the particular conditions. Sensor elements on the <b>reeling</b> <b>machine</b> monitor the relative angle of the deployed sonar cable and provide flight reference signals to the aircraft stabilization equipment in order to maintain a steady hover position over the submerged transducer. Tactical data of the target is obtained from the acoustic returns, including range, bearing and relative speed. Later versions of the AQS-13 were also capable of processing acoustic signals transmitted to the aircraft from sonobuoys.|$|E

5000|$|The AQS-13F {{system was}} {{introduced}} to the US fleet as standard equipment aboard the Sikorsky SH-60F Seahawk helicopter, that replaced the SH-3H as the inner-zone ASW platform aboard aircraft carriers in the late-1980s/early-1990s. Key components of the AQS-13F system had origins in the made-for-export AQS-18 sonar developed for the German Navy for use in the Sea Lynx helicopter. The AQS-13F offered improved acoustic processing, a longer transmit pulse, faster <b>reeling</b> <b>machine,</b> longer cable and increased acoustic transmit power. The processed target data could also be displayed on the aircraft multifunction displays and/or recorded via the aircraft mission tape recorder. Due to the limited funding approved by Congress, the aircraft systems were limited to [...] "off the shelf" [...] technology wherever possible. This resulted {{in the use of the}} same [...] "dry-end" [...] as the AQS-13E, even though more modern technology was available.|$|E

5000|$|Song Yingxing {{opened his}} chapter on {{clothing}} with {{the aspects of}} sericulture in producing silk. He gave an accurate description of the raising of silkworms, along with their instinctual mating tradition. Those raising the silkworms had their eggs deposited on sheets of paper or cloth, and stored {{for use in the}} following year. He wrote that in some regions a bathing process was used on these sheets, employing rain water, lime water, or brine, and gave specifications on the timing for this during winter, in the 12th month of the year. The reason for this, he said, was so that the inferior eggs would die in the process, hence less mulberry leaves would be consumed needlessly. He also provided specifications on how to avoid damaging the eggs in the long process of preparation before the bathing process in the 12th month. He noted the differences between two general forms of silkworms, late and early, while providing information on a wide variety in different silkworm breeds and cocoons, and even silkworm diseases. After their eventful hatching, he described the proper living conditions and environment that the silkworms should be immersed in, as well as the care that should be given in feeding them. He warned of different sources of foul odors and smoke that had the capability of killing the silkworms if they came into contact. He described the spinning of cocoons, gathering of cocoons, sorting of cocoons, and the different pests such as birds and mosquitoes that should be avoided, He also described the proper planting of mulberry trees and how to harvest them. For the process of making silk, he noted that raw silk could not be reeled into normal silk until a formal wadding process was done. He described the reeling of silk fabric with a <b>reeling</b> <b>machine,</b> the spooling of silk fibers, the spinning of silk fibers into weft yarns, the silken threads drawn into a warp frame for weaving, and the [...] "ingenious" [...] works of figure designing. He also described the proper dimensions of different draw looms, ...|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} {{began in}} 1871 and {{was completed in}} July the next year. Three months later the factory started operation. In the beginning, there were 150 silk <b>reeling</b> <b>machines</b> (300 basins), and about 400 female workers operated the machines in the mill. The lifestyle of the workers has been recorded in the diary of one, Wada Ei.|$|R

This limited the manufacturer's ability to offer large jackpots since even the rarest event had a likelihood of 0.1%. The maximum theoretical payout, assuming 100% return to player would be 1000 times the bet, but that would leave no room for other pays, making the machine very high risk, and also quite boring.|$|R

50|$|The station {{signed on}} with a very-short-lived country music format. This was {{followed}} by a light-popular music format ("pop for adults"). CFMI was distinguished in its earlier years by being a technical innovator of early automation systems. Stereo automation systems of the day relied heavily on reel-to-reel tape machines for music. CFMI's automation had no <b>reel</b> <b>machines,</b> but relied totally on cartridge carousels, which allowed greater programming flexibility ("random access"), but no broadcast cartridges of the day could reproduce quality stereo. The response of CFMI's engineers was to invent a new cartridge that could: the Aristocart. Parent company Western International Communications went on to develop a manufacturing division, exporting these improved cartridges to broadcasters around the world. Today's broadcasters use computer systems with large hard drives to reproduce music digitally, and have no need of tape systems. But in its heyday (circa 1975-1990), the Aristocart was an improvement to a technical problem shared by all commercial stereo broadcasters.|$|R
