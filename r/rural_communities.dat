40|$|The {{purpose for}} {{conducting}} {{the study was}} to explore the trait differences by gender of the study habits and technology use patterns of <b>rural</b> <b>community</b> college students. Significant research and data presently exists at the university level specific to study habits and technology use, but little research had been conducted targeting those topics in a <b>rural</b> <b>community</b> college setting.
