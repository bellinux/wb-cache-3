50|$|Explanations for the {{relatively}} low level of social mobility in the US include the better access of affluent children to superior schools and preparation for schools so important in an economy where pay is tilted toward educated workers; high levels of immigration of unskilled laborers and low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization,</b> which leads to lower wages among the least skilled; public health problems, like obesity and diabetes, which can limit education and employment; {{the sheer size of}} the income gap between the rich which makes it harder to climb the proverbial income ladder when the rungs are farther apart; poverty, since those with low income have significantly lower rates of mobility than middle and higher income individuals.

30|$|We {{are aware}} of the fact that some other aspects of the two labor markets, such as {{different}} <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization</b> or firms’ size, may also be potentially important in explaining part of the differences in self-employment rates and complement our explanation. Notwithstanding, our results could have interesting implications from a policy point of view, since policies aimed at fostering self-employment are viewed as an instrument to reduce unemployment and to reinforce the economic growth. The fact that self-employment provides an outlet for relatively disadvantaged workers in Spain compared to Denmark, in particular for low wage workers, unemployed without benefits, and non-employed mothers with small children, suggests that probably the institutional setting in Spain has a negative impact on entrepreneurial activities of high value added. In this respect, the effort from a policy point of view should be directed towards improving the conditions to start and operate a business.|$|R

Such decisions not only determine who participates in controlling an organization and setting its strategic direction, but also reflect the organizational structure. In this paper, we examine the antecedents of CHRO presence according to the contingency, institutional, and homophily theories. Based on a multi-industry sample of 215 firms that considers a 10 -year period, we find that the presence of a CHRO is influenced by the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization,</b> rapid declines or increases in numbers of employees, the employment of a new or outsider chief executive officer (CEO), and the institutionalization of the CHRO position in the industry or firm. However, we find no evidence of the presumed influence of knowledge intensity or the CEO or TMT human resource management (HRM) experience. Overall, we find that the institutional theory has the highest explanatory power regarding the existence of CHRO positions.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the {{evolution}} of unionism in the 1970 n and 1980 s, when the post-oil shock world economy created a "crisis of unionism" throughout the western world. I try to explain why union representation of work forces fell in some countries but not in others and contrast union responses {{to the challenge of}} the period. I find that: [...] <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization</b> diverged greatly among developed countries [...] The composition of union members shifted from private sector blue collar workers to public sector end white collar workers in all countries, producing increased divisions within union movements by category of worker [...] Changes in the industrial composition of employment, changes in public attitudes toward unionism, and the growth of governmental protection of labor do not explain the divergence in density [...] Differing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> inflation contributed to the divergence, with unions doing better in countries with high inflation. In addition, unemployment raised density in settings where unions disperse unemployment benefits [...] The primary reason for the divergence are differences in the incentives and opportunities different industrial relations systems give employers to oppose unions. Unions fared best in neo-corporatist settings and worst in settings where decentralized bargaining creates a strong profit incentive for managers to oppose unions and where management is relatively free to act on that incentive [...] Union organizations and modes of operating changed significantly in some countries with declining or endangered unionism but not in others Most strikingly, my analysis indicates that if 1980 s trends continue the west will be divided between countries with strong trade union movements operating in a neo-corporatist system, as in Scandinavia, and countries with 'ghetto unionism' limited to special segments of the work force, as in the United States. ...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{grows out}} of the {{research}} on the United States summarized in Low-Wage America: How Employers Are Reshaping Opportunities in the Workplace, which sought to understand how U. S. firms were responding to economic globalization, deregulation, and technological progress, and how such responses were affecting typically low-wage front-line workers. The focus is placed here on five industries [...] retail, hotels, hospitals, food processing, and call centers [...] in each of five European countries [...] Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The varied experience of European firms offers a rich source of insights into the interaction of firm strategies, labor-market institutions, and economic outcomes for low-wage workers. Relative to the United States, the generally higher degrees of government regulation of product and labor markets and the substantially higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization</b> and coverage by collective bargaining agreements in Europe mean that European firms typically face greater constraints on the business strategies than similar firms in the United States. The volume consists of two parts. The first (Chapters 1 through 4) reviews key features of the six national economies, their labor-market institutions, and low-wage work. Chapter 2 presents our main findings on the level and trends in low-wage work, and the principal characteristics of the low-wage labor markets in each country. Chapter 3 analyzes the national pay-setting institutions, broadly defined, that are the primary determinants of wages in each of the six economies. Chapter 4 reviews the effect of national institutions on the supply side of the low-wage labor market. The second half of the volume (Chapters 5 through 10) presents the five industry case studies.

30|$|The {{system of}} {{collective}} bargaining in Spain {{can be characterized}} by its large scope, intermediate degree of centralization, substantial inertia in wage indexation and homogeneity in wage setting decisions. The rate of coverage reaches more than 80  % of private sector workers despite a low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization</b> below 15  %. This disparity in rates is sustained, of course, by the principle of automatic effectiveness. The bargaining process takes place mainly at the sectoral level within a provincial scope—only less than 15  % of workers are subject to a firm agreement, which are frequent in large firms and negligible in firms with fewer than 200 workers. The high rate of inertia in wages {{is reflected in the}} large share of agreements (between 60 and 70  %) that incorporate indexation clauses.

40|$|Excerpt] One of {{the central}} goals of {{contemporary}} feminism has been the full integration of women into the workforce. While broader economic and social forces were decisive in propelling women into full-time employment, the women 2 ̆ 7 s movement took as its particular task shaping {{the nature of that}} participation. The movement sought to achieve economic equality for women workers through two primary strategies: 1) gaining entry to traditionally male-dominated jobs and training, and 2) upgrading the pay and status of traditionally female-dominated jobs. The clerical sector—with its overwhelming concentration of women workers, its rock-bottom pay scales, and its gender-based work culture—was a logical focus of that second strategic course. Historically, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization</b> among clericals has been low. Some feminists blamed this on the indifference of maledominated unions to the particular problems of women in the workforce. Others believed that there were unique circumstances which made clerical workers resistant to traditional trade union approaches. Out of such analyses, a small but determined network of activists shaped an alternative conception of organization for office workers, beginning in the early 1970 s...|$|E

This study develops {{the first evidence}} on {{the degree to which}} labor unions develop members' political leadership in the broader community by studying the relationship between state legislators' occupations and the unionization rates of occupations across U.

The fraction of legislators of a given occupation in a state increases with the occupation's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>unionization</b> in that state compared to the fraction of legislators of the same occupation in other states with lower unionization rates.

It holds conditional on differences in observable state characteristics and when using state fixed effects. While much research has described the role of unions in influencing economic outcomes and in politics through lobbying, campaign contributions, and voter mobilization, this work adds a new perspective on the role of unions in society. They promote elected political leadership by individuals from working- and middle-class jobs. Arguments over the social value of this role of unions are explored...|$|E
