The <b>reassignment</b> vector is used here not to modify the time-frequency representation, but only {{as a source of}} information about the spectral structure of the signal. This approach focused on the boundaries extends the use of the <b>reassignment</b> principle to wide band signals...|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} <b>reassignment</b> is a {{technique}} forsharpening a time-frequency representation by mappingthe data to time-frequency coordinates that are nearer tothe true region of support of theanalyzed signal. The method has been independentlyintroduced by several parties under various names, includingmethod of <b>reassignment,</b> remapping, time-frequency <b>reassignment,</b> and modified moving-window method. Inthe case of the spectrogram or the short-time Fourier transform, the method of <b>reassignment</b> sharpens blurrytime-frequency data by relocating the data according tolocal estimates of instantaneous frequency and group delay.This mapping to reassigned time-frequency coordinates isvery precise for signals that are separable in time andfrequency {{with respect to the}} analysis window.|$|R
5000|$|The term is {{used today}} in the New York City Department of Education to {{describe}} teachers who wound up on ATR status for the above stated causes. Frequently, the teachers lost their positions because the New York City Department of Education closed their school. New York City, in recent years, closed many of its large {{middle and high schools}} in favor of smaller schools, offering up space to charter schools. [...] The ATR teacher program developed from the 2005 contract between New York City and the United Federation of Teachers which eliminated seniority rights. [...] A small minority of current and former ATR teachers were exonerated teachers who were formerly assigned to <b>reassignment</b> centers. The <b>reassignment</b> centers no longer exist.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} an {{essential}} factor {{on the origin}} of genetic codes is a balanced accomplishment of robustness and changeability, two antithetical, but fundamental, properties for the survival and evolution of organisms. These measures are defined as the intrinsic properties of genetic codes. An evaluation of these properties explains the structural regularity of genetic codes, estimates the order of codon <b>reassignment</b> in deviant codes, and predicts the most probable deviant codes that exist. The enumeration of genetic codes that could have evolved from the standard genetic code under the selection pressure on robustness and changeability strongly limits the freedom of codon <b>reassignments.</b> The codon <b>reassignments</b> of all currently known deviant genetic codes belong to this predicted evolutionary path, and they generally give the highest improvements on robustness and changeability...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, three {{state of}} the art non-stationary {{sinusoidal}} analysis methods based on Fourier transform (FT) are compared- the derivative method, <b>reassignment</b> and generalized <b>reassignment.</b> 1 The derivative method and <b>reassignment</b> were designed to analyze linear log-AM/linear FM sinusoids. Generalized <b>reassignment</b> can analyze sinusoids containing arbitrary order modulations, however the discussion will be limited to linear log-AM/linear FM in order to compare it objectively to <b>reassignment</b> and the derivative method. In this paper, the equivalence of <b>reassignment</b> and the derivative method is shown to hold for arbitray order modulation estimation and theoretical comparison with generalized <b>reassignment</b> is presented. The results of tests conducted on two different frequency ranges, full range (frequencies up to Nyquist) and reduced range (frequencies up to 3 / 4 Nyquist) frequency range, are compared to the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs). 1...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, {{the term}} [...] "flag officer" [...] {{generally}} {{is applied to}} all general officers authorized to fly their own command flags—i.e., brigadier general, or pay grade O-7, and above. However, {{as a matter of}} law, Title 10 of the United States Code makes a distinction between general officers and flag officers. Non-naval officers usually fly their flags from their headquarters, vessels, or vehicles, typically only for the most senior officer present. In the United States all flag and general officers must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate; each subsequent promotion requires renomination and re-approval. For the Navy, each flag officer assignment is usually limited to a maximum of two years, followed by either <b>reassignment,</b> promotion and <b>reassignment,</b> or retirement.|$|R
5000|$|On March 17, 1969, {{shortly after}} Kerry's third wound, Commodore Charles Horne, the {{commander}} of Coastal Squadron 1, filed for Kerry's <b>reassignment</b> to the U.S. per Kerry's request. He was entitled to this early departure from Vietnam (subject to approval by the Bureau of Naval Personnel), because {{those who had been}} wounded three times, [...] "regardless {{of the nature of the}} wound or treatment required ... will not be ordered to serve in Vietnam and contiguous waters or to duty with ships or units which have been alerted for movement to that area." [...] According to the Navy regulation that governed this (BUPERS Instruction 1300.39), the request for the [...] "thrice-wounded reassignment" [...] was optional at the request of the wounded party and required requesting <b>reassignment.</b> Kerry requested <b>reassignment</b> and was granted his request.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study two {{important}} reliability issues in deep submicron VLSI design, namely antenna effect and crosstalk noise, {{in the context}} of threelayer channel routing. Cost functions for both of the failure mechanisms are introduced and based on these cost models, reliability enhancement techniques are presented. For antenna effect minimization, a layer <b>reassignment</b> algorithm is adopted while for crosstalk minimization, an algorithm that combines layer <b>reassignment</b> and track <b>reassignment</b> is presented. Experimental results show that these algorithms can reduce the antenna effect and the crosstalk noise considerably without increasing the routing area. The relationship between these two objectives has also been studied and a technique for optimizing them simultaneously is proposed. Key Words: antenna effect, crosstalk, channel routing, design for reliability. 1 Introduction Due to the scaling down of device geometry in deep-submicron technologies, antenna effect and crosstalk no [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{dispersion}} curves in plate-like structures {{is possible}} with guided Lamb waves. In this research, experimental development of dispersion curves {{relies on the}} spectrogram, which suffers from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. <b>Reassignment</b> is capable of localizing ill [...] defined dispersion curves. Unfortunately, <b>reassignment</b> also introduces spurious components, which reduce <b>reassignment</b> performance. This research develops an algorithm that provides both localization of dispersion curves and elimination of spurious components. To achieve this, an alternative formulation of <b>reassignment</b> called differential <b>reassignment</b> is modified and superimposed with nonlinear anisotropic diffusion. This study first examines <b>reassignment</b> and diffusion components individually. Three different versions of differential <b>reassignment</b> are considered, {{two of which are}} modifications explicitly derived in this research. The combined algorithm is then applied to reassign experimentally measured spectrograms, leading to a significant increase in clarity and notch detection performance. M. S.

40|$|The XSQ (eXtensible SeQuence) format was {{designed}} to accommodate different run types (standard SOLiD sequencing and exact chemistry call (ECC) runs), simplify indexing samples workflow and support new data types such as ECC in the new 5500 sequencing instrument; these data cannot be stored in any existing formats (e. g. csfasta & QV. qual) as {{there are more than}} one call per position. Other problems with existing formats are the file size, I/O demand, and lack of pairing of reads. The XSQ format uses information packing to reduce the file size by 60 %, resulting in reduced storage needs and reduced transfer times. It also has integrated pairing of reads, so mapping and pairing can happen together much more quickly, rather than having the two reads of a pair mapped separately and then merged subsequently. The new XSQ file allows users to perform very efficient indexing <b>reassignment</b> and such <b>reassignment</b> only introduces minimal impact to downstream analysis instead of reanalyzing all indexing samples. The hierarchical data format also provides a basic level of partitioning and indexing within the file so that subsets of the data can be retrieved without reading through the entire file...|$|R
40|$|Several {{yield and}} {{reliability}} enhancement techniques {{have been proposed}} for the compaction, routing and technology mapping stages of VLSI design. For yield, we modify the existing layouts to reduce {{the sensitivity of the}} design to random point defects, which are the main yield detractors in today 2 ̆ 7 s IC technology. For reliability, we deal with several important failure mechanisms including electromigration, antenna effect, crosstalk noise and hot-carrier effect. ^ At the layout compaction stage, new techniques for yield enhancement are presented and the yield improvement results on some industrial examples are shown. These new techniques take 2 D connections into consideration when performing 1 D compaction and they consider the problem of data volume control when dealing with hierarchical design. For this stage of the VLSI layout design, we also propose a minimum layout perturbation compaction algorithm for electromigration reliability enhancement. This algorithm can increase the width of the wires which have electromigration reliability problems and resolve the design rule violations introduced by the wire widening process with minimum changes to the layout so that the previously achieved layout optimization goals such as area, performance and yield can be preserved as much as possible. ^ At the routing stage, a layer <b>reassignment</b> algorithm is presented for yield enhancement for 2 -layer channel routing. This layer <b>reassignment</b> approach is then extended to antenna effect minimization during the 3 -layer routing process. We also develope an algorithm which combines layer <b>reassignment,</b> track <b>reassignment</b> and dogleg insertion to reduce the crosstalk noise in routing. ^ For the technology mapping stage, a logic level hot-carrier effect model is presented. Based on this model a mapping algorithm which targets hot-carrier effect is proposed and it is shown that a design with the lowest power measure, which has long been regarded as the rough measure of reliability, is not always the best design for reliability. ^ Experimental results have shown that by applying the proposed techniques it is possible to achieve significant yield and reliability improvement during the layout and logic levels of VLSI design. ...|$|R
