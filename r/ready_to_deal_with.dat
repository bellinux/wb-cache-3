Growing evidence suggests that a sub-group of women do not make decisions about RRM and RRO immediately following genetic testing, but rather, consider these decisions years later. Women's perspectives on the timing of these decisions are not well understood. Accordingly, {{the purpose of this}} research was to describe how women construct the 'right time' to consider decisions about RRM and RRO. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 22 BRCA 1 / 2 carrier women and analyzed using qualitative, constant comparative methods. Results The time that lapsed between receipt of genetic test results and receipt of RRM or RRO ranged from three months to nine years. The findings highlighted the importance of considering decisions about RRM and RRO one at a time. The women constructed the 'right time' to consider these decisions to be when: (1) decisions fit into their lives, (2) they had enough time to think about decisions, (3) they were <b>ready</b> emotionally <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the decisions and the consequences, (4) all the issues and conflicts were sorted out, (5) there were better options available, and (6) the health care system was ready for them.

40|$|Abstract With {{globalization}} {{and the current}} direction towards more integrated and cooperating world of business, workplaces and especially teams are becoming increasingly diverse. Cultural diversity brings with it benefits to the team, but also disadvantages like misunderstandings and even conflicts. In this thesis I aimed to find what leaders of multicultural teams {{have to take into}} account to avoid conflicts rising from different expectations and perspectives people from different cultures have. To achieve this I first looked at the main differentiating variable in multicultural teams: culture, and then worked through diversity, teams and leadership to find approaches that lead to best results when managing multicultural teams. To do this I used literature review as there already is variety of literature of the different components, and also confirmed this through empirical study, where I observed and interviewed a multicultural team, OuluSES, for almost a year. The most important findings were first of all about culture: culture was found to be emergent, people have their own individual culture, but are also part of bigger cultures. For managers of multicultural teams the most important finding was that creating personal relationships lessen the misunderstandings and especially conflicts in multicultural teams, and also lead to best results overall, especially compared to approaches where cultural differences were completely ignored. The findings from this thesis not only offer a new perspective into the debate between static, national cultures and emergent cultures, but the biggest advantage of the thesis is for every-day leaders of multicultural leaders. As cultural diversity is bound to increase also in the future, workplaces are also bound to become increasingly diverse, which means that leaders have <b>to</b> be <b>ready</b> and equipped <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> conflicts rising from the differences in expectations, which is where this thesis helps...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of satirical ideas towards the social condition of the contemporary society in the near ~ commencing year of second millennium in Wells's The War of the Worlds. Through the narrative, obviously Wells wants to point out how human-beings' morality has been degraded to a serious extent. The advanced accomplishment {{in science and technology}} has been abused by the superior beings to destroy other people and to seek for their own benefit. As a result, instead of contributing virtue to mankind, science and technology have resulted in the vice which is not only being used to demolish one another but also unconsciously leading l to self destruction. j In showing Wells's satirical ideas, the writer covers the discussion on the main characters' behavior in relation with the contemporary society under the suppression of tyrant with superior technology. Both main characters, the Narrator and the Brother of Narrator, have shown a somewhat immobile virtue under such a repressive situation that makes other people deviate in moral and ethic. Through the study, the writer focuses his analysis to reveal the use of satire through the main characters by Wells to convey his social-foresight towards the contemporary society. His vision of the modern society is concerning the abused advancement that make Wells and even the writer of this thesis worried. By giving a terrible picture of destruction of the world as visioned by Wells, people are expected <b>to</b> be more <b>ready</b> and careful <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> every advancement which may bring harm effects instead of advantages. Thus, Wells's foresight of the contemporary society may become the warning for man not to forget the role of moral and ethic as means to control advancemen...|$|R

60|$|His taste, indeed, his {{judgment}} of quality, {{seems to have}} been bestowed upon him in its essentials like a gift of nature. From the very first he was sure of his taste and could account for it. His earliest writing shews, if anything, too large a portion of tact and composure; a critic might have said that such a perfect control of his means was not the most hopeful sign in a young author. Henry James reversed the usual procedure of a beginner, keeping warily to matter well within his power of management--and this is observable too in his early letters--until he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> matter more robust. In his instinct for perfection he never went wrong--never floundered into raw enthusiasms, never lost his way, never had painfully to recover himself; he travelled steadily forward with no need of guidance, enriching himself with new impressions and wasting none of them. He accepted nothing that did not minister in some way to the use of his gifts; whatever struck him as impossible to assimilate to these he passed by without a glance. He could not be tempted by any interest unrelated to the central line of his work. He had enough even so, he felt, to occupy a dozen lives, and he grudged every moment that did not leave its deposit of stuff appropriate to his purpose. The play of his thought was so ample and ardent that it disguised his resolute concentration; he responded so lavishly and to so much that he seemed ready to take up and transform and adorn whatever was offered him. But this in truth was far from the fact, and by shifting the recollection one may see the impatient gesture with which he would sweep aside the distraction that made no appeal to him. It was natural that he should care nothing for any abstract speculation or inquiry; he was an artist throughout, desiring only the refracted light of human imperfection, never the purity of colourless reason. More surprising was his refusal, for it was almost that, of the appeal of music--and not wordless music only, but even the song and melody of poetry. It cannot be by accident that poetry scarcely appears at all in such a picture of a literary life as is given by his letters. The purely lyrical ear {{seems to have been}} strangely sealed in him--he often declared as much himself. And poetry in general, though he could be deeply stirred by it, he inclined to put away from him, perhaps for the very reason that it meant too forcible a deflection from the right line of his energy. All this careful gathering up of his powers, in any case, this determined deafness to irrelevant voices, gave a commanding warrant to the critical panoply of his later life. His certainty and consistency, his principle, his intellectual integrity--by all these the pitch of his opinions, wherever he delivered them, reached a height that was unforgettably impressive.|$|E

40|$|Social {{housing is}} a {{phenomenon}} that has introduced {{significant changes in the}} residential sector. The distinguishing feature of this new way of building dwellings is the supply of residential solutions at lower rents than the market rents, which are built to form a relationship with the territory, and equipped with a host of new services that had not been provided in that specific area yet. At the same time it also marks the beginning of a change in the concepts of dwelling and of living that involve, in turn, the need for an innovative form of residential building management. A property featuring apartments for rent requires careful management skills that must take into account several factors. Private individuals are increasingly involved in social housing initiatives, but they are not sufficiently <b>ready</b> and prepared <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> social housing projects with rigor and professionalism. Facility management alone cannot cater for all real estate issues, which also entail skills in social management, and in building relationships with the community that settles in the new social housing area. The whole results in the combination of these skills: 1. management and maintenance of buildings; 2. administration of the settlement; 3. social support aimed at the community; 4. involvement of residents in the organization of community life and in the care of common spaces. So far, discussions and debates concerning social housing have focused mostly on the architectural, cultural, social and practical feasibility of such operations. Today social housing has become a concrete reality that is spreading all over the country. We believe that in order to further the development of the concept of social housing, experts need to think over the management of social housing projects throughout their entire life-cycle. This paper intends {{to address the issue of}} the management of residential buildings for rent, with special focus on all the aspects that characterize it, both real-estate and social ones...|$|R
