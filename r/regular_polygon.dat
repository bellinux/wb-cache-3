5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a <b>regular</b> <b>polygon</b> and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of <b>regular</b> <b>polygon</b> but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of <b>regular</b> <b>polygon</b> in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
2500|$|In two dimensions, {{there is}} an {{infinite}} family of convex uniform polytopes, the <b>regular</b> <b>polygons,</b> the simplest being the equilateral triangle. Truncated <b>regular</b> <b>polygons</b> become bicolored geometrically quasiregular polygons of twice as many sides, t{p}={2p}.

The uniform truncation operation doubles the sides to {2p}. The snub operation, alternating the truncation, restores the original polygon {p}. Thus all uniform <b>polygons</b> are also <b>regular.</b> The following operations {{can be performed}} on <b>regular</b> <b>polygons</b> to derive the uniform polygons, which are also regular polygons: ...|$|R
2500|$|Some <b>regular</b> <b>polygons</b> (e.g. a pentagon) {{are easy}} to {{construct}} with straightedge and compass; others are not. This led to the question: Is it possible to construct all <b>regular</b> <b>polygons</b> with straightedge and compass? ...|$|R
5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any <b>regular</b> <b>polygon,</b> computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each <b>regular</b> <b>polygon,</b> calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E
