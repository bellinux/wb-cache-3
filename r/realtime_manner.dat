From previous research has resulted a communication data between server and weather sensor using Point to Point link. Wireless mesh as one of variant innovation from WLANs technology offers a unique solution because {{it could be a}} replacement or enhancement for the established wireless network to be more effective and efficient. It has a wider coverage area without neglect of security factor and mobility. The result of this research is a Wireless Weather Station system which has been integrated with Mesh Network technology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Although team-based {{projects}} {{have become a}} popular practice in colleges with focus on helping students learn subjects collaboratively and effectively, the current education paradigm mainly adopts ad hoc collaboration practices. There lacks a quantitative methodology for enabling appropriate and scientific approaches to guide the educational community in teaching and transforming educational practices to support the development, implementation, and improvement of state-of-the-art collaborative-learning practices on campuses. This paper presents a new computational model and framework to quantitatively explore the collaboration-based behavioral dynamics of student teams {{and its impact on}} team performance. More specifically, a suite of mathematical models in the form of computations, structural equation modeling, and principal component analysis are created to describe and analyze a variety of learning circumstances, aimed at generating rules of thumb to guide student teams to retune collaborative practices in a proactive and <b>realtime</b> <b>manner</b> for improved performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} adapting (scaling) an MPEG- 4 {{video to}} comply with a given (or changing) network bandwidth. We differ-entiate between realtime and non-realtime video adaptation, which is to be performed by routers and (proxy) servers, respectively. Mainly we will look into temporal video scaling, which simply means dropping the least important frames. This can be done on the fly, in a <b>realtime</b> <b>manner,</b> on a router with extended functional-ity. To do so, we have to look into the patterns of frames existing in a video. Those patterns (and correspondingly, the video data) can be modified in different ways such that, e. g., varying network bandwidth can be closely matched. Such modification patterns and their effectiveness (in terms of bandwidth reduction) must be communicated to the routers in order to enable them to take “intel-ligent ” scaling actions. We describe the concept of modification patterns and show how they are periodically communicated to, and utilized by, routers for scaling and transmitting a video stream. Furthermore, we in-troduce an efficient binary representation for them. 1...|$|E

In this work, we studied the resynchronization problem that arises when a gateway changes the data content carried in an MPEG 2 Transport stream. In short, the distance between original timestamps is changed non-uniformly, and decoders will fail to reconstruct the encoding clock from the resulting stream. We propose a cheap software realtime approach to solve this problem. Experimental results from a realtime HDTV stream lter shows that our approach is correct and ecient...|$|R

It is therefore {{the aim of}} this study to build a monitoring system of body 2 ̆ 7 s {{temperature of}} dengue fever patient atomatically and in a <b>realtime</b> <b>manner.</b> The built system uses an IC LM 35 as a main temperature sensor equipped by a voltage regulator, a DAQ interface unit and package program of LabVIEW 7. 1 as an operational system basis as well as a visual display unit. After sets of body 2 ̆ 7 s temperature measurements we found a transfer function as V = 0. 01 θ − 0. 05. This transfer function were then used as main input to acquire the calibration function where to be found as θ = 79. 69 V − 7. 81 and considered as the sensor characteristic. Later, such calibration function being inputed into formula XI box within LabVIEW 7. 1 component diagram blocks which runs the whole monitoring system. Monitored body 2 ̆ 7 s temperature was nicely plotted graphically onto panel front of LabVIEW 7. 1 and to be set well-operated within range 30 to 40 oC.

40|$|Abstract. This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the problem of 3 D object re-trieval from large datasets in a near <b>realtime</b> <b>manner.</b> In order to ad-dress this task we focus on three major subproblems of the field: (i) pose normalization of rigid 3 D models with applications to 3 D object retrieval, (ii) non-rigid 3 D object description and (iii) search over rigid 3 D object datasets based on 2 D image queries. Regarding the first of the three subproblems, 3 D model pose normalization, two main novel pose normalization methods are presented, based on: (i) 3 D Reflective Object Symmetry (ROSy) and (ii) 2 D Reflective Object Symmetry computed on Panoramic Views (SymPan/SymPan+). Considering the second sub-problem, a non-rigid 3 D object retrieval methodology, based on the prop-erties of conformal geometry and graph-based topological information (ConTopo++) has been developed. Furthermore, a string matching strat-egy for the comparison of graphs that describe 3 D objects, is proposed. Regarding the third subproblem a 3 D object retrieval method, based on 2 D range image queries that represent partial views of real 3 D objects, is presented. The complete 3 D objects of the database are described by a set of panoramic views and a Bag-of-Visual-Words model is built using SIFT features extracted from them. The methodologies developed and described in this dissertation are evaluated in terms of retrieval accuracy and demonstrated using both quantitative and qualitative measures via an extensive consistent evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets...|$|E
40|$|The flow of information, and {{consequently}} the decision-making along {{the chain of}} mining from exploration to beneficiation, typically occurs in a discontinuous fashion over long timespans. In addition, due to the uncertain nature of the knowledge about deposits and the inherent spatial distribution of material characteristics, actual production performance in terms of produced ore grades and quantity and extraction process efficiency often deviate from expectations. Reconciliation exercises to adjust mineral reserve models and planning assumptions are performed with timely lags of weeks, months or even years. With the development of modern information and communication technology over the last decade, a flood of data about {{different aspects of the}} production process is available in a <b>realtime</b> <b>manner.</b> For example, sensor technology enables online characterisation of geochemical, mineralogical and physical material characteristics on conveyor belts or at working faces. The ability to utilise this additional information and feed it back into reserve block models and planning assumptions opens up new opportunities to continuously control the decisions made in production planning to increase resource recovery and process efficiency. This leads to a change in paradigm from a discontinuous method to near real-time reserve reconciliation and model updating, which calls for suitable modelling and optimisation methodologies to quantify prior knowledge in the reserve model, process and integrate information from different sensor sources, back propagate the gain in information into reserve models and efficiently optimise operational decisions in real-time. This paper introduces the concept of an integrated closed-loop framework for real-time reserve management, incorporating sensor-based material characterisation, geostatistical modelling under uncertainty, modern data assimilation methods for sequential model updating and mining system simulation and optimisation. The effectiveness of the framework and the value added will be demonstrated in an illustrative case study. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
