5|$|The voice used on WWV {{was that}} of Don Elliott Heald until August 13, 1991, when {{equipment}} changes required <b>rerecording</b> the announcer's voice. The one used at that time {{was that of}} KSFO morning host Lee Rodgers, but was soon switched to the voice of John Doyle.|$|E
5|$|Lola Visual Effects {{worked on}} 48 shots, {{including}} some animation to Bana and Nimoy. Bana required extensive {{damage to his}} teeth, which was significant enough to completely replace his mouth in some shots. Nimoy's mouth was reanimated in his first scene with Kirk following a <b>rerecording</b> session. The filmmakers had filmed Nimoy when he rerecorded his lines so they could rotoscope his mouth into the film, even recreating the lighting conditions, but they realized they had to digitally recreate his lips because of the bouncing light created by the camp fire.|$|E

50|$|The EP sold out, {{and is now}} {{considered}} a collector's item. However, three of the EP's five tracks were later <b>rerecorded</b> by Sarah Harmer on her 2000 solo album You Were Here, and another was <b>rerecorded</b> for her 2005 album I'm A Mountain.|$|R
5000|$|The Beautiful Mistake is an eponymous EP by The Beautiful Mistake. It {{was first}} {{released}} in 2001 as the December EP, <b>rerecorded</b> in 2002 when the band signed with Sidecho Records and <b>rerecorded</b> again in 2003 {{due to the}} low quality of the previous recording.|$|R
25|$|To bypass DRM {{technologies}} {{embedded in}} video-streaming services, hackers employ {{a variety of}} methods. Besides <b>rerecording</b> and redistributing video streams, they place links to video-streaming services in web pages owned by the hackers, sell legitimate users' data {{on the black market}} for other people's use, and legitimate users sharing their account with family or friends who intend not to pay for the service.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the book}} The Greatest Music Never Sold by Dan Leroy states that within one month from the album's initial {{delivery}} to A, the entire project was suddenly and unilaterally rejected. Regardless {{of the expected}} industry procedures, there was reportedly no strategic contact from the record company toward the band's management; there was made no industry-standard attempt whatsoever for any renegotiation, remixing, <b>rerecording,</b> or reassignment.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Baillie {{teamed up}} with singer Adam Ant (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, {{alongside}} Baillie, of burlesque troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song Gun in Your Pocket, about Ross, Brand and the entire affair. He intended to release the song as the lead single for his ninth album Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter (with a <b>rerecording</b> of early 1980s outtake Who's A Goofy Bunny Then? as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased Malcolm McLaren). Gun in Your Pocket was performed live {{on at least one}} occasion, at a guerilla gig (one of several he played around this time) at London's Troubadour Café on 2 April 2010, and was setlisted, (but not performed) at Adam's Pirate Metal Extravanganza concert at the Scala on 30 April 2010, while the recording received a club play when Adam DJ'd at the Family Affair clubnight in Shoreditch, London on 24 April.|$|E

5000|$|Lady '95 is a 1995 Styx {{re-recording}} of the 1973 song [...] "Lady". It was <b>rerecorded</b> as {{a result}} of a contractual dispute between A&M Records and Wooden Nickel Records. It solely appears on A&M compilations, most notably Styx: Greatest Hits, for which the song was <b>rerecorded.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Problems {{with low}} {{fidelity}} and poor pressings continued. Blind Lemon Jefferson's 1926 hits, [...] "Got the Blues" [...] and [...] "Long Lonesome Blues", were quickly <b>rerecorded</b> in the superior facilities of Marsh Laboratories, and subsequent releases used the <b>rerecorded</b> version. Both versions were released on compilation albums.|$|R
500|$|The JAMs re-edited {{the single}} {{in such a}} way that—they hoped—"brought [...] inside the [...] "law" [...] but still got up peoples noses", {{removing}} all but a snatch of The Beatles, replacing or doctoring the MC5 sample, and <b>rerecording</b> the Samantha Fox vocal. [...] This new version—named [...] "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)"—was released on 18 May 1987 as JAMS 23T, and was included on The JAMs debut album 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?). [...] Indeed, according to Drummond, the recording of 1987 was funded by the sales of [...] "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)".|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{different}} method in writing new material for The Hunting Party as opposed to their previous albums. While for all their previous albums they used the traditional method of writing, demoing and <b>rerecording</b> in the studio, songs were instead written and composed in the studio itself, with no material being written or composed beforehand. Delson spoke about the methods used on the album {{in an interview with}} Premier Guitar, saying that [...] "Something unintentional might be the coolest sound I make all day, and knowing how to allow those mistakes to happen and to shape them potentially makes for some great music." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing the song's {{origins in}} an {{interview}} with National Public Radio (NPR), Shields said that the writing and recording of [...] "City Girl" [...] was [...] "very simple, {{in the sense that it}} was just me teaching Brian the chord structure and Brian just jamming along to it." [...] The duo recorded an instrumental rehearsal version of the song, after which Shields said there was [...] "no point in <b>rerecording</b> it." [...] He later wrote lyrics and recorded vocals for the song but emphasised that there was no need for [...] "elaborations [...] overdubs." [...] Shields described this method of recording as a [...] "slapdash approach", noting that there was no [...] "point in labouring over something … because you don't know what's going to work".|$|E

500|$|Clayton has sung on some occasions, {{including}} on {{the song}} [...] "Endless Deep", the B-side {{to the single}} [...] "Two Hearts Beat As One" [...] from 1983. Clayton also sang backup vocals on [...] "I Will Follow" [...] during live performances in 1983 and 1984. He also spoke the last verse of [...] "Your Blue Room". Clayton can be heard speaking on [...] "Tomorrow ('96 Version)" [...] (a <b>rerecording</b> of [...] "Tomorrow" [...] that he arranged) a song from U2's 1981 album October. He plays the guitar on a few occasions, most notably the song [...] "40", where he and guitarist The Edge switch instruments. He also plays the keyboards on [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] and [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)".|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to keep the band focused, Godrich had them record A Moon Shaped Pool to tape with analog {{multitrack}} recorders. This added creative limits to the process, as <b>rerecording</b> a take meant first erasing the previous take. For the introduction to [...] "Daydreaming", the band slowed the tape, creating a pitch-warping effect. Radiohead still used digital manipulation on many tracks; for example, Greenwood used the music programming language Max to manipulate the piano on [...] "Glass Eyes". Drummer Clive Deamer, who had performed with Radiohead on the King of Limbs tour and appeared on their 2011 double single [...] "The Daily Mail" [...] and [...] "Staircase", played additional drums on [...] "Ful Stop". Greenwood estimated that 80% of the album was recorded in two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Beginning with AkustiChrisye in 1996, Chrisye's {{next several}} albums were {{arranged}} by Erwin Gutawa. The music video for the titular song of their next collaboration, Kala Cinta Menggoda (1997), won the MTV Video Music Award for South-East Asia on 10September 1998. The two then collaborated on <b>rerecording</b> the Badai Pasti Berlalu soundtrack album, releasing their version with orchestral music and new duets. Two years later, the music video for [...] "Setia" [...] from Konser Tur 2001 stirred up controversy for its {{portrayal of a}} woman in skintight clothing, considered against Eastern values. Chrisye's final collaboration with Gutawa, Dekade, was a cover album which featured a song written exclusively for the album by Pongky of Jikustik. The singer's last studio album, Senyawa (2004), was a collaboration with other Indonesian artists, which Chrisye arranged.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{later said}} that without Williams's score the film {{would have been}} only half as successful, and {{according}} to Williams it jumpstarted his career. He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, The Sugarland Express, {{and went on to}} collaborate with the director on almost all of his films. The original soundtrack for Jaws was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, [...] and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score, and Varèse Sarabande put out a <b>rerecording</b> of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by the Beatles, Radiohead {{tried to}} keep the songs succinct. The opening track, [...] "2 + 2 = 5", was {{initially}} recorded as a studio test, and was finished in two hours. Radiohead struggled to record [...] "There There"; after <b>rerecording</b> it in their Oxfordshire studio, Yorke was so relieved to have captured the song he wept, feeling it was the band's best work. Radiohead had attempted to record an electronic version of [...] "I Will" [...] in the Kid A and Amnesiac sessions, but abandoned it as [...] "dodgy Kraftwerk"; instead they used components of this recording to create [...] "Like Spinning Plates" [...] on Amnesiac. For Hail to the Thief, the band sought to [...] "get to the core of what's good about the song" [...] and not be distracted by production details or new sounds, settling on a stripped-back arrangement.|$|E
500|$|As David Bordwell describes, {{technological}} improvements {{continued at}} a swift pace: [...] "Between 1932 and 1935, [...] created directional microphones, increased the frequency range of film recording, reduced ground noise... and extended the volume range." [...] These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: [...] "Increasing the fidelity of recording... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness." [...] Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin' in the Rain—was that some silent-era actors {{simply did not}} have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, <b>rerecording</b> of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, {{a process known as}} [...] "looping", had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Dragon Ball Z {{celebrated its}} 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing {{that it would}} {{broadcast}} a re-edited and remastered version under the name [...] The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, {{as well as in}} a more faster-moving, and focused story. The episodes remastered for HDTV, with <b>rerecording</b> of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast, and featuring updated opening and ending sequences. On April 5, 2009, the series premiered in Japan airing in Fuji TV. Dragon Ball Z Kai reduced the episode count to 159 episodes (167 episodes internationally), from the original footage of 291 episodes. Damaged frames were removed, resulting in some minor shots being remade from scratch in order to fix cropping, and others to address continuity issues. The majority of the international versions, including Funimation Entertainment's English dub, are titled Dragon Ball Z Kai.|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the songs}} {{included}} on Glee: The Music, Volume1, except for the bonus tracks, were released as singles, available for download. The releases made the Glee Cast the tenth cast to have entries chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in its 51-year history. Their debut single [...] "Don't Stop Believin' charted at number five in Australia, number four in the US and Ireland, and number two in the United Kingdom. In the US, 177,000 copies of the song were sold in its first week of release. Its number four debut surpassed the Journey original, which peaked at number nine in 1981. The original rendition sold 42,000 copies in {{the week of the}} Glee Cast release, up 48% on the previous week. [...] "Don't Stop Believin' was also the cast's best-selling single, and has sold 1,005,000 copies in the US, a combination of sales from the original release (921,000) and the <b>rerecording</b> for the season finale (84,000). It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on October13, 2009, and platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association the following year.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the verses}} {{of the opening}} song [...] "Arabian Nights" [...] was altered {{following}} protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from [...] "Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face," [...] in the original release to [...] "Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense." [...] The change first appeared on the 1993 video release. The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release, but the re-release uses the edited lyric. The <b>rerecording</b> has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line. The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line. Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in {{a list of the}} most controversial films in history, due to this incident. The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine. They criticized the characters' Anglicized features and Anglo-American accents, in contrast to the other characters in the film, which are dark-skinned, have foreign accents and grotesque facial features, and appear villainous or greedy.|$|E
