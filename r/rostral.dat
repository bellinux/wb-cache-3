5|$|Canthus, or Canthus rostralis, {{the angle}} between the supraocular {{scale and the}} <b>rostral</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the <b>rostral</b> bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the <b>rostral</b> forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|The front (<b>rostral)</b> part of {{the skull}} is shortshorter and broader than in T.hylophilusand flat and the notches in the {{zygomatic}} plates at the sides are poorly developed. The plates themselves are broad. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow interorbital region (between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped. The braincase is robust.|$|E
5|$|The head is flattened, triangular, and {{distinct}} from the neck. The snout is blunt, rounded, and raised. The nostrils are large, each {{in the middle of}} a large, single nasal scale. The lower edge of the nasal touches the nasorostral. The supranasal has a strong crescent shape and separates the nasal from the nasorostral anteriorly. The <b>rostral</b> is as broad as it is high.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} banded sea krait is black, with lateral {{nostrils}} and an undivided <b>rostral</b> scale. The upper lip and snout are characteristically colored yellow, and the yellow color extends backward {{on each side of}} the head above the eye to the temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also present, their position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular <b>rostral</b> plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids are {{diagnosed}} {{by the following}} features; short T-shaped frontals that form the <b>rostral</b> boundary of the supratemporal fenestra; a caudolateral overhanging shelf of the squamosal; a lateral process of the quadrate that contacts the quadratojugal; raised, stalked, parapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae, a modified pedal digit II; chevrons and prezygapophysis of the caudal vertebrae elongate and spanning several vertebrae; {{the presence of a}} subglenoid fossa on the coracoid.|$|E
5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The <b>rostral</b> bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The <b>rostral</b> scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across {{the top of the}} head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which there is only one pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is fairly}} large and {{distinct}} and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The {{edge of the}} snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the <b>rostral</b> scale is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the <b>rostral,</b> there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish frontal (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two parietals (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow supraoculars. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large nasal scale. The eye is relatively large—equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale—but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small circumorbital scales. The temporal scales are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10–12 sublabials and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) supralabials. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsia {{was coined}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs {{possessing}} certain characteristic features, including horns, a <b>rostral</b> bone, teeth with two roots, fused neck vertebrae, and a forward-oriented pubis. Marsh considered the group distinct {{enough to warrant}} its own suborder within Ornithischia. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek κερας/keras meaning 'horn' and οψις/opsis meaning 'face'. As early as the 1960s, it was noted that the name Ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be Ceratopia. However, this spelling, while technically correct, has been used only rarely in the scientific literature, {{and the vast majority of}} paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia. As the ICZN does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily, this is unlikely to change.|$|E
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the <b>rostral</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a <b>rostral</b> tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} system {{is made up}} in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the olfactory bulb (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb. Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the ventral side of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the <b>rostral</b> limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC). The AOC gives rise to the olfactory tract, which ends in the olfactory bulb.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rostral</b> migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} <b>rostral</b> scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Spinosaurus was {{primarily}} a terrestrial predator or a piscivore, as indicated by its elongated jaws, conical teeth and raised nostrils. The hypothesis of spinosaurs as specialized fish eaters has been suggested before by A. J. Charig and A. C. Milner for Baryonyx. They base this on the anatomical similarity with crocodilians {{and the presence of}} digestive acid-etched fish scales in the rib cage of the type specimen. Large fish are known from the faunas containing other spinosaurids, including the Mawsonia, in the mid-Cretaceous of northern Africa and Brazil. Direct evidence for spinosaur diet comes from related European and South American taxa. Baryonyx was found with fish scales and bones from juvenile Iguanodon in its stomach, while a tooth embedded in a South American pterosaur bone suggests that spinosaurs occasionally preyed on pterosaurs, but Spinosaurus was likely to have been a generalized and opportunistic predator, possibly a Cretaceous equivalent of large grizzly bears, being biased toward fishing, though it undoubtedly scavenged and took many kinds of small or medium-sized prey. A study by Cuff and Rayfield (2013) concluded that bio-mechanical data suggests that Spinosaurus was not an obligate piscivore and that its diet was more closely associated with each individual's size. The characteristic <b>rostral</b> morphology of Spinosaurus allowed its jaws to resist bending in the vertical direction, however its jaws were poorly adapted with respect to resisting lateral bending.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} functional differentiation was {{a division}} of caudal and <b>rostral,</b> this was based upon the observation that the lesioning of the <b>rostral</b> reticular formation induces a hypersomnia in the cat brain. In contrast, lesioning of the more caudal portion of the reticular formation produces insomnia in cats. This study {{has led to the}} idea that the caudal portion inhibits the <b>rostral</b> portion of the reticular formation.|$|E
25|$|Functional neuroimaging {{suggests}} {{a key role}} for the <b>rostral</b> Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) in modulating both emotional processing and autobiographical retrieval. It is part of brain network showing extensive correlation between <b>rostral</b> ACC and amygdala during imagining of future positive events and restricted correlation during imagining of future negative events. Based on these data, {{it is suggested that}} the <b>rostral</b> ACC has a crucial part to play in creating positive images of the future and ultimately, in ensuring and maintaining the optimism bias.|$|E
25|$|Generally, motor nuclei found {{higher in}} the {{brainstem}} (i.e., more <b>rostral)</b> innervate muscles that are higher on the face. For example, the oculomotor nucleus contains α-MNs that innervate muscles of the eye, and {{is found in the}} midbrain, the most <b>rostral</b> brainstem component. By contrast, the hypoglossal nucleus, which contains α-MNs that innervate the tongue, is found in the medulla, the most caudal (i.e., towards the bottom) of the brainstem structures.|$|E
25|$|Projections {{to areas}} <b>rostral</b> to the {{hypothalamus}} are {{carried by the}} mammillothalamic tract, the fornix and terminal stria.|$|E
25|$|The medial reticular {{formation}} and lateral {{reticular formation}} are two columns of neuronal nuclei with ill-defined boundaries that send projections through the medulla {{and into the}} mesencephalon (midbrain). The nuclei can be differentiated by function, cell type, and projections of efferent or afferent nerves. Moving caudally from the <b>rostral</b> midbrain, {{at the site of}} the <b>rostral</b> pons and the midbrain, the medial RF becomes less prominent, and the lateral RF becomes more prominent.|$|E
25|$|For example, in the horse, {{the eyes}} are caudal to the nose and <b>rostral</b> {{to the back of}} the head.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rostral</b> touches a {{total of}} 6 shields. These are two inter-nasals, two nasals and the first supralabial on each side.|$|E
25|$|Appetitive {{behaviors}} are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. However, appetitive {{behaviors are}} disrupted by the lesions in <b>rostral</b> part rather than caudal part of medial preoptic area. Lesions of the <b>rostral</b> part of medial preoptic area also diminish preference for female by male rats. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments {{showed that the}} level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. mPOA’s involvement in the control of appetitive sexual behaviors is also confirmed by pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic system in it. In rats, lesions to mPOA can eliminate the male copulatory behavior but can only diminish appetitive behavior, which suggests that some other parts of the brain, except for mPOA, are also responsible for sexually appetitive behavior.|$|E
25|$|According to Ezcurra (2007), and Bristowe and Raath (2004) Coelophysis can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the absence of an}} offset <b>rostral</b> process of the maxilla; the quadrate is strongly caudally; a small external mandibular fenestra, which is 9-10% of the mandibular length; and the anteroposterior length of the ventral lacrimal process is greater than 30% of its height.|$|E
25|$|Neurons of the reticular formation, {{particularly}} those of the ascending reticular activating system, {{play a crucial role}} in maintaining behavioral arousal and consciousness. The functions of the reticular formation are modulatory and premotor. The modulatory functions are primarily found in the <b>rostral</b> sector of the reticular formation and the premotor functions are localized in the neurons in more caudal regions.|$|E
25|$|In humans, areas {{specialized}} {{for visual}} object {{recognition in the}} ventral stream have a more inferior location in the temporal cortex, whereas areas specialized for the visual-spatial location of objects in the dorsal stream have a more superior location in the parietal cortex. However, these two streams hypothesis, although useful, are a simplification of the visual system because the two streams maintain intercommunication along their entire <b>rostral</b> course.|$|E
25|$|Semaphorin-neuropilin repulsive {{signaling}} works synergistically with EphB signaling {{to guide}} neural crest cells down the <b>rostral</b> half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin {{acts in the}} cephalic region to guide neural crest cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, neural crest cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic contact inhibition with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. Neural crest cells that migrate through the <b>rostral</b> half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route neural crest cells take is dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further neural crest cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch.|$|E
25|$|Functionally {{distinct}} pathways for auditory processing in the {{orbitofrontal cortex}} include a <b>rostral</b> stream associated with phonetic processing, {{and a more}} caudal stream terminating just posterior to the orbitofrontal cortex in the periarcuate prefrontal cortex associated with auditory-spatial processing, though these connections share extensive overlap. Both ventral and dorsal visual streams share connections with orbitofrontal cortical areas, including rich projections {{to and from the}} superior temporal pole, important for integration of spatial and object processing.|$|E
25|$|Coelacanths are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their <b>rostral</b> glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements {{in a sort of}} hibernation mode.|$|E
25|$|They are nocturnal piscivorous drift-hunters. The body {{is covered}} in cosmoid scales that act as armor. Coelacanths have eight fins – 2 dorsal fins, 2 {{pectoral}} fins, 2 pelvic fins, 1 anal fin and 1 caudal fin. The tail is very nearly equally proportioned and is split by a terminal tuft of fin rays that make up its caudal lobe. The eyes of the coelacanth are very large, while the mouth is very small. The eye is acclimatized to seeing in poor light by rods that absorb mostly short wavelengths. Coelacanth vision has evolved to a mainly blue-shifted color capacity. Pseudomaxillary folds surround the mouth and replace the maxilla, a structure absent in coelacanths. Two nostrils, along with four other external openings, appear between the premaxilla and lateral <b>rostral</b> bones. The nasal sacs resemble those of many other fish and do not contain an internal nostril. The coelacanth's <b>rostral</b> organ, contained within the ethmoid region of the braincase, has three unguarded openings into the environment and {{is used as a}} part of the coelacanth's laterosensory system. The coelacanth's auditory reception is mediated by its inner ear, which is very similar to that of tetrapods because it is classified as being a basilar papilla.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those persons}} who have been {{bereaved}} within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral amygdala and <b>rostral</b> anterior cingulate cortex hyperactivity to reminders of their loss. In {{the case of the}} amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity. In those individuals who avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern {{in which there is a}} decrease in the activation of the dorsal amgydala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|Baroreceptor reflex: Baroreceptors in {{the high}} {{pressure}} receptor zones detect changes in arterial pressure. These baroreceptors send signals ultimately to the medulla of the brain stem, specifically to the <b>rostral</b> ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The medulla, {{by way of the}} autonomic nervous system, adjusts the mean arterial pressure by altering both the force and speed of the heart's contractions, as well as the systemic vascular resistance. The most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the left and right carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch.|$|E
25|$|The scalation {{includes}} 23-29 (usually 23-25) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 169-214 and 177-214 ventral {{scales in}} males and females, respectively, 52-86 (usually 75 or fewer) subcaudal scales in males, {{which are usually}} divided, and 47-72 subcaudals in females. On the head, the <b>rostral</b> scale is about as high, or slightly higher, than it is wide. There are three to 11 (usually five to 9) keeled intersupraocular scales, seven to 13 (usually eight to 11) sublabial scales and six to 9 (usually seven) supralabial scales, the second of which is fused with the prelacunal to form a lacunolabial.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason why}} Eogavialis was {{initially}} placed within Tomistoma {{was due to}} the fact that the premaxilla and nasal bones made contact with one another, a feature also seen in Tomistoma. However, this characteristic has since been shown to be present in other extinct gavialids, meaning that premaxilla and nasal contact is a plesiomorphic trait of all tomistomines, including basal ones. Eogavialis also has a very similar cranial anatomy when compared to Tomistoma, having the same proportions, <b>rostral</b> length, and tooth number, leading to the conclusion by some authors of papers published after 1982 that Eogavialis is synonymous with Tomistoma.|$|E
