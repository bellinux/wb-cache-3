50|$|Schmidt cameras {{have very}} {{strongly}} curved focal planes, thus requiring that the film, plate, or other detector be correspondingly curved. In {{some cases the}} detector is made curved; in others flat media is mechanically conformed {{to the shape of}} the focal plane through the use of <b>retaining</b> <b>clips</b> or bolts, or by the application of a vacuum. A field flattener, in its simplest form a planoconvex lens in front of the film plate or detector, is sometimes used. Since the corrector plate {{is at the center of}} curvature of the primary mirror in this design the tube length can be very long for a wide-field telescope. There are also the drawbacks of having the obstruction of the film holder or detector mounted at the focus halfway up the tube assembly, a small amount of light is blocked and there is a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction and its support structure.|$|R

40|$|Objective To assess {{residual}} protein on {{dental instruments}} cleaned in general dental practice by manual, manual plus ultrasonic and automated washer disinfector (AWD) processes. Design and setting Instruments submitted by 30 dental surgeries in the South West of England. Subjects (materials) and methods Instruments analysed were matrix bands, associated <b>retaining</b> <b>clips,</b> diamond {{and stainless steel}} burs, extraction forceps and hand scalers. Each instrument was visually assessed under magnification for residual debris. Residual protein was extracted by immersion in detergent and sonication. A collection of used but uncleaned instruments of each type (n = 177) was also analysed for adherent protein using ophthalaldehyde/N-acetylcysteine reagent. Main outcome measures Residual protein levels allowed comparisons {{to be made on}} the effectiveness of different cleaning processes. Results One thousand, three hundred and four instruments were analysed. Observational data demonstrated several shortcomings in cleaning chemistries and operation of the AWD. For uncleaned instruments, median residual protein levels ranged from 0. 4 mu g (stainless steel burs) to 462 mu g (extraction forceps). Following manual washing, median protein levels ranged from 0. 3 - 78 mu g; for manual plus ultrasonic washing, levels ranged from 9 - 39 mu g and AWD levels ranged from 0. 3 - 27 mu g. Manual washing combined with ultrasonic cleaning was significantly less effective than the other two processes (p < 0. 008). AWDs reduced the variability in the cleaning process. No correlation was found between visual scoring and residual protein determination. Conclusion(s) There was a wide variation in residual protein levels both within and between different methods and instruments and this underlines the complexity of this process...|$|R

40|$|DE 1004054754 A UPAB: 20060607 NOVELTY - The {{connection}} has a borehole (2) {{formed in}} a wall of a high pressure pipe, where an end of an injection pipe is introduced into the borehole and broadened in the borehole up to an inner diameter of the borehole. A sealing ring (3) formed complementary to the broadening is inserted into the borehole and protected with a <b>retaining</b> <b>clip</b> (8) in a circulating nut (7) of the borehole against a movement from the borehole. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a common-rail-system with a common rail and injector lines. USE - Used between an injector line and a common rail of a common rail system (Claimed) in a motor vehicle. Can also {{be used in a}} hydraulic system and a gaseous high-pressure system. ADVANTAGE - The connection avoids the need for complex, cost-intensive and polluting preparation of forgings, such that the connection requires small material usage, thus reducing manufacturing costs of the connection, and hence reducing fuel consumption of the motor vehicle. The sealing ring is protected with the <b>retaining</b> <b>clip</b> in the nut of the borehole against the movement from the borehole, such that the connection can be assembled and disassembled in a faster and cost-effective manner...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA sports {{surface that}} {{encourages}} elastic deformation during contact in combined anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions {{through a process}} of horizontal deformation and displacement, may result in reduced foot and lower limb loading. Research concluded that a modular plastic tile surface which permits a limited amount of horizontal displacement via the tile connections has the potential to attenuate more braking force in comparison to a typical homogenous sports surface and therefore reduce the risk of tissue overloading and potential injury. A system whereby a modular plastic tile surface could encourage a limited amount of multi-lateral horizontal displacement via the tile attachment mechanisms was therefore developed. During rapid changes in direction or while landing on a sports surface, forces are transmitted from the athlete into the sports floor. Energy is preserved in the surface as the floor deforms, with a component of this energy being dissipated {{as a result of the}} dampening characteristics of the materials used to construct the sports surface. The sports tile development process therefore required the realisation of a <b>retaining</b> <b>clip</b> system to hold the tiles in firm engagement. Each tile also had to be able to be easily pulled apart for disassembly purposes. The tiles used in the surface had to be able to move independently from each other, in order for the surface to be able to dissipate energy. A design method was therefore adopted which saw the development of a number of alternative attachment approaches which were analysed via the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method. A design solution was developed through a combination of iterative design and finite element simulation, with the final solution encouraging horizontal elastic deformation during athlete to surface contact, as a result of horizontal displacement. The “tile to tile” interface is the most critical aspect of the new modular tile surface that has been developed, as this feature in addition to its unique octagonal and square tessellated tile configuration, combine to allow multi-lateral horizontal displacement in the surface, and therefore the potential to reduce horizontal braking forces...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} video {{summarization}} method based {{on the study of}} spatio-temporal activity within the video. The visual activity is estimated by measuring the number of interest points, jointly obtained in the spatial and temporal domains. The proposed approach is composed of five steps. First, image features are collected using the spatio-temporal Hessian matrix. Then, these features are processed to retrieve the candidate video segments for the summary (denoted clips). Further on, two specific steps are designed to first detect the redundant clips, and second to eliminate the clapperboard images. The final step consists {{in the construction of the}} final summary which is performed by <b>retaining</b> the <b>clips</b> showing the highest level of activity. The proposed approach was tested on the BBC Rushes Summarization task within the TRECVID 2008 campaign...|$|R
5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which <b>retained</b> the <b>clips</b> of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|R
50|$|Reconstruction of the viaduct {{began in}} the summer of 1882:in the rebuilt viaduct, the three inner columns in each pier were still cast-iron, but the two outer 'rakers' were each a single wrought-iron tube filled with {{concrete}} and provided with timber ice fenders. The original raker foundation piles were <b>retained,</b> but cast-iron <b>clips</b> were bolted around them, and the annulus between clips and pile filled with cement. Although by August 1883 the viaduct reconstruction was sufficiently far advanced that construction traffic was run over it, passenger services over the line did not resume until 1 May 1884.|$|R
50|$|Clipboards can be {{constructed}} {{from a variety of}} material, including but not limited to, aluminum, PVC, polypropylene, High Impact Polystyrene, Foamex and even wood. Clipboards generally come in two different designs—single or folding. Single clipboards are the more traditional type and consist of a single piece of rigid material and some sort of fixing mechanism along the top. Folding clipboards are usually constructed from a single piece of flexible PVC with two rigid materials enclosed within. A folding hinge connects the two sections to allow the front to be folded over the content to provide protection and often to allow some sort of promotional print or instructions. Folding clipboards also provide additional benefits because of the extra space available, allowing the incorporation of pen holders and pockets for storage. The arrival of the microprocessor and Internet age gave rise to high-tech variants of the traditional clipboard, the first being the Ferranti Market Research Terminal that <b>retained</b> a <b>clip,</b> to hold A4 paper sheets (looking like a large clipboard) but recording answers to questions in its electronic memory.|$|R

2500|$|Fused {{plugs and sockets}} {{of various}} {{proprietary}} and non-interchangeable types are found in older public buildings in the UK, where {{they are used to}} feed AC electric wall clocks. They are smaller than conventional sockets, commonly being made to fit BESA junction boxes, and are often of very low profile. Early types were available fused in both poles, later types fused in the line only and provided an earth pin. Most are equipped with a <b>retaining</b> screw or <b>clip</b> to prevent accidental disconnection. The prevalence of battery powered quartz controlled wall clocks has meant that this connector is rarely seen in new installations for clock use. [...] However, it has found use where a low profile fused connector is required and is still available. [...] A relatively common example of such a use is to supply power to an illuminated mirror that has limited clearance from the wall.|$|R
