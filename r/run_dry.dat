5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may <b>run</b> <b>dry</b> for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Wilsonville also {{provides}} its own {{water supply and}} wastewater treatment. The wastewater system was built in 1972, while the water system was upgraded with a new treatment plant in 2002. Water is drawn from the Willamette River from the Wilsonville Water Treatment Plant built {{at a cost of}} $46 million in conjunction with the Tualatin Valley Water District. The city used to use wells to provide drinking water, but those began to <b>run</b> <b>dry</b> in the late 1990s. The plant’s initial capacity was 15 million gallons per day, but can be expanded to 120 million gallons per day. Neighboring Sherwood will begin receiving water from the plant in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to <b>run</b> <b>dry,</b> resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{was offered}} a higher ranking {{position}} within Indiana Gas at the Chicago headquarters, but by then he had {{become aware of the}} business's connection to the corrupt and disgraced monopolist Charles T. Yerkes. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago leadership. After the pipeline became fully operational in 1892, Haynes moved to Kokomo where he was made a supervisor of the Indiana Gas's local operations. The Indiana General Assembly began attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas be used more conservatively. He specifically recommended that the flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a figure that shocked the company's leaders. Despite his support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity. He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate artificial increases in well pressure. The court case continued until 1896, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed, including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among other companies and the field's wells began to <b>run</b> <b>dry</b> by 1905modern experts estimate as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet (30km3) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or misused.|$|E

25|$|Not all of {{the water}} removed from the river by the swallow holes is {{returned}} to the channel at Leatherhead. The chalk aquifer also feeds the springs {{at the southern end}} of Fetcham Mill Pond, which have never been known to <b>run</b> <b>dry.</b> A survey in March 1883 estimated that the Fetcham springs were producing about 3.6 million gallons of water (16,000 m3) every day. A second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about 5 million gallons of water (22,000 m3) a day. The water table in the chalk of the Wey Gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater percolation alone. It has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the Mole Gap.|$|E
25|$|Cholesbury Camp an Iron Age hillfort and {{scheduled}} monument, {{is the dominant}} feature in the landscape.

Originally, a palisade, requiring wood from between 10–15,000 trees, would have topped the earthworks. Today, {{the extent of the}} fort is demarcated by a magnificent stand of mature beech trees. Associated with the fort is a pond, known locally as the 'Holy’ or ‘Bury’ pond, which is fed by a spring, that is perpetual: it has never been known to <b>run</b> <b>dry,</b> even in the severest of droughts. The church of St Lawrence is within the hillfort's boundary. Cholesbury Common runs through the village either side of the road.|$|E

25|$|The {{transitional}} style (640-625 BC) {{linked the}} orientalizing (Proto-Corinthian) with the black-figure style. The old animal frieze {{style of the}} Proto-Corinthian period had <b>run</b> <b>dry,</b> as did the interest of vase painters in mythological scenes. During this period animal and hybrid creatures were dominant. The index form of the time was the spherical aryballos, which was produced in large numbers and decorated with animal friezes or scenes of daily life. The image quality is inferior compared with the orientalizing period. The most distinguished artists of the time were the Shambling Bull Painter, whose most famous work is an aryballos with a hunting scene, the Painter of Palermo 489, and his disciple, the Columbus Painter. The latter’s personal style can be most easily recognized in his images of powerful lions. Beside the aryballos, the kotyle and the alabastron {{are the most important}} vase shapes. The edges of kotyles were ornamented, and the other decorations consisted of animals and rays. The two vertical vase surfaces frequently have mythological scenes. The alabastrons were usually painted with single figures.|$|E
25|$|Multimillion-dollar {{investments}} {{beginning in}} the 1990s by the World Bank have reclaimed desert and turned the Ica Valley in Peru, one of the driest places on earth, into the largest supplier of asparagus in the world. However, the constant irrigation has caused a rapid drop in the water table, in some places as much as eight meters per year, {{one of the fastest}} rates of aquifer depletion in the world. The wells of small farmers and local people are beginning to <b>run</b> <b>dry</b> and the water supply for the main city in the valley is under threat. As a cash crop, asparagus has provided jobs for local people, but most of the money goes to the buyers, mainly the British. A 2010 report concluded that the industry is not sustainable and accuses investors, including the World Bank, of failing to take proper responsibility for the effect of their decisions on the water resources of poorer countries. Diverting water from the headwaters of the Ica River to asparagus fields has also led to a water shortage in the mountain region of Huancavelica, where indigenous communities make a marginal living herding.|$|E
25|$|The Derwent starts {{its course}} at Lilla Rig on the North York Moors {{a few miles}} from the east coast of Yorkshire. After {{collecting}} the waters of the Jugger Howe Beck, Black Beck and Troutdale Beck it flows south through the Forge Valley to West Ayton. From there it continues across lower ground to where it is joined by the River Hertford. The Sea Cut, a man made channel, connects the Derwent to the North Sea near Scarborough to alleviate flooding in the lower reaches of the Derwent, downstream of the Cut. This management area is about 127km² and largely rural with no major settlements. Corallian limestone lies beneath this area. The landscape is upland moors in the upper reaches with lower lying flatter land near Hackness. The river flows through the narrow Forge Valley and several designated natural conservation sites. Water is retained behind a weir at West Ayton and there are sink holes in the river bed where river water is lost to underlying aquifers, so that in drought years the river below the weir may <b>run</b> <b>dry.</b> There are no wastewater treatment works. The ecology and fisheries have a very high sensitivity to changes in water flow.|$|E
