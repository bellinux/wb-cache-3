40|$|Steering bogies and {{actively}} steered bogies {{are subjected to}} increasing interest. <b>Self-steering</b> <b>bogies</b> {{have been used in}} large numbers of hauling locomotives primarily in the USA to reduce flange wear and improve adhesion. However, the steering performance of <b>self-steering</b> <b>bogies</b> is reported to deteriorate under traction. This article compares several bogie types and proposes a new design of steering bogie featuring forced steering combined with control of the bogie yaw movement or actuated yaw forced steered bogie (AY-FS). The bogie stability of a force steered bogie is improved by yaw actuation using a negative derivative control of the bogie yaw misalignment. An additional benefit of the bogie design is that actuators and control sensors for the AY-FS bogie can be mounted on the vehicle body rather than on the bogie frame. The article presents simulation results for a yaw actuated force steered bogie under traction curving conditions. The AY-FS bogie is compared with rigid and force steered bogies and is shown to give superior performance at high traction adhesion levels during curving. The curving performance improvements achieved depend on the curvature, lateral forces on the vehicle, the traction load, and the rail friction. The greatest curving performance advantages occur in tighter curvatures with high traction loads and low rail friction and with high lateral forces to the inside rail such as would result from coupler loads on pulling locomotives...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, {{substantial}} improvements were made to rail infrastructure worldwide. This was necessary to accommodate the ever increasing transportation demand and requirements. Nowadays, trains are required to transport heavier loads and to travel at higher speeds. One of the major improvements was achieved {{by the development of}} the off-flange curving bogie designs to reduce wheel and rail wear. Off-flange designs include passive steering and actively controlled steering. The development and implementation of <b>self-steering</b> <b>bogies</b> on locomotives was promoted in the early 1980 ’s by two major locomotive manufacturers. Up to date, thousands of these locomotives, with built-in <b>self-steering</b> <b>bogies,</b> have been manufactured and taken into service (Swenson, 1999). Most <b>self-steering</b> <b>bogies</b> have mechanical linkage systems to steer the wheel sets. As an alternative to the mechanical linkage system, the DCD Group (a South African manufacturer of rail and mining equipment) initiated the development of a Passive Hydraulic Steering (PHS) system. First PHS prototype systems, developed by DCD, have proven that huge wear reduction possibilities exist on both, rails and wheels. In addition the prototype systems also significantly decreased noise and vibration levels when negotiating tight corners (Swenson & Scott, 1996 and DCD Rolling Stock, 2012). However, existing prototype solutions require further improvements and development for optimisation. To be able to identify and implement improvements, the need exists to perform modelling and testing of the systems to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} operation and suitability of a complete unit. The aim of this research project is thus, to mathematically model an existing prototype PHS system and validate the model with data from experiments and tests. This model can then be used in order to improve and optimise performance, cost and reliability of the system, before mass production is considered. A literature survey was conducted, focusing on general wheel and rail wear mechanisms, techniques to improve wheel and rail life and on existing techniques for modelling the hydraulics and multi-body dynamics of locomotive systems. The literature survey was followed by extensive laboratory tests on component basis, a quarter PHS system and on the full PHS system. From these tests all parameters needed for the characterisation of the PHS and the mathematical model were determined. These tests also provided data for the validation of the PHS model. Finally, a mathematical model of the PHS system was successfully generated and validated. This model can now be used in a multi-body dynamic locomotive simulation to evaluate its effectiveness. The results and findings of the literature survey, experiments and modelling are reported on and discussed in this report.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>self-steering</b> <b>bogies</b> in locomotives has occurred without extensive study of traction curving bogie dynamics. It is reported that these bogies {{are unable to}} steer at high tractive effort levels with the performance {{essentially the same as}} rigid bogies. This is due to the required adhesion level approaching wheel rail friction limits and causing creep saturation. Reassessment of the curve steering task in a hauling locomotive has identified that existing concepts of perfect steering [R. M. Goodall and T. X. Mei, Chapter 11 : Active suspensions, in Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics, S. Iwnicki, ed., Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL, USA, 2006], [R. M. Goodall, S. Bruni, and T. X. Mei, Concepts and prospects for actively-controlled railway running gear, Vehicle Syst. Dynam. 44, supplement 1 (2006), pp. 60 - 70] are not appropriate for high traction loads in hauling locomotives. An extensive parametric simulation study has been conducted on steering bogie designs for hauling locomotives. Testing of passive steering bogie designs have shown superior performance from forced steering bogies where steering is only partially dependant on wheel rail creep forces. New active steering bogie designs have been proposed [S. Simson, Railway bogie, Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2007900891, 2007] where steering control is independent of wheel rail creep forces. The new designs combine force steering of wheelsets with secondary yaw activation. The parametric study shows that new active steering bogie designs give superior steering performance under traction...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. This report {{documents}} the steps taken to {{gain insight into}} the dynamics of a HS MkVII <b>self-steering</b> three piece <b>bogie.</b> This was done by firstly studying the dynamics and stability of linear simplifications of the bogie and wagon and then by investigating {{the dynamics of the}} bogie by means of a non-linear model. With the necessary insight into the dynamics of the bogie, an optimised relationship between the primary suspension stiffness and the centre plate friction of a <b>self-steering</b> three-piece <b>bogie</b> was achieved. The optimised model’s wear is less than half that of the reference model and has a safe operating speed of 80 km/h for an empty wagon and 140 km/h for a loaded wagon. It is recommended that the following be done before issuing a final technical recommendation; • A final optimisation of the lateral and longitudinal primary suspension stiffness arrangement; taking into consideration the physical vertical load bearing capacity of the rubber suspension elements. • A study in order to quantify the effects, on wear, of the increased misaligned position of the bogie on straight track following a curve. A verification of the ADAMS/Rail simulation results by conducting specific on-track tests. • A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis...|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} and optimizing a rail vehicle {{there is a}} contradiction between, on the one hand, stability on straight track at high speed and, on the other hand, reasonable wheel and rail wear in small- and medium radius curves. Higher speeds require to some extent stiffer wheelset guidance to avoid hunting and ensure stability. However, with stiffer wheelset guidance the risk of increased wheel and rail wear in curves is imminent. In this paper, {{the process of developing}} and optimizing a track-friendly bogie is described. A multi-body system (MBS) simulation model was used, taking due consideration to nonlinearities in suspension and wheel-rail contact, as well as realistic flexibilities in the track. Adequate and systematic consideration is taken {{to a wide range of}} possible non-linear wheel-rail combinations. Dynamic stability is investigated both on straight track and in wide curves at high speeds. The balance between flange wear and tread wear is studied in order to maximize wheel life between re-profiling operations in the intended average operation. The result is a bogie with relatively soft wheelset guidance allowing passive <b>radial</b> <b>self-steering,</b> which in combination with appropriate yaw damping ensures stability on straight track at higher speeds. The bogie has been subject to both certification testing and long-term service testing in the Gröna Tåget (the Green Train) research and development programme. 1...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Sound {{pressure}} levels exceeding {{acceptable limits}} are being generated by trains travelling on the 1000 m radius curved railway line past {{the town of}} Elands Bay. Unacceptable sound levels are attributed mainly to top of rail wheel squeal. Top of rail wheel squeal belongs {{to the family of}} selfinduced vibrations and originates from frictional instability in curves between the wheel and the rail under predominantly saturated lateral creep conditions. In small radius curves, saturated lateral creep conditions occur due to the steering of railway wheelsets with large angles of attack. Given the large curve radius and the utilisation of <b>self-steering</b> <b>bogies</b> on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore railway line, curve squeal is a highly unexpected result for the 1000 m radius curved railway line. This is because curving of bogies in large radius curves are achieved without high wheelset angles of attack leading to saturated creep conditions. An experimental and analytical investigation was carried out to identify the mechanisms influencing the generation of wheel squeal in large radius curves. Simultaneous measurement of sound pressure and lateral wheel-rail forces were made during regular train service in one of the two 1000 m radius curves at Elands Bay to characterise the bogie curving behaviour for tonal noise due to wheel squeal occurring in the large radius curve. The lateral force curving signature not only reveals the levels of lateral wheel-rail forces required for bogie curving, but also whether the bogie is curving by means of the creep forces generated at the wheel-rail interface only or if contact is necessitated between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner to help steer the bogie around the curve. The test set-up consisted of two free field microphones radially aligned at equivalent distances towards the in – and outside of the curve in line with a set a strain gauge bridges configured and calibrated to measure the lateral and vertical forces on the inner and outer rail of the curve. This test set-up allowed the squealing wheel to be identified from the magnitude difference of the sound pressures recorded by the inner and outer microphones in combination with comparing the point of frequency shift of the squeal event due to the Doppler Effect with the force signals of the radially aligned strain gauge bridges. From the experimental phase of the investigation, it was found that wheel squeal occurring in the 1000 m radius curve at Elands Bay is characteristic of empty wagons and is strongly related to the squealing wheel’s flange/flange throat being in contact with the gauge corner of the rail. Here high levels of spin creepage associated with high contact angles in the gauge corner lead to high levels of associated lateral creepage necessary for squeal generation. This is in contrast to lateral creepage due to high wheelset angles of attack being the key kinematic parameter influencing squeal generation in small radius curves. Furthermore, the amplitude of wheel squeal originating from the passing of empty wagons was found to be inversely proportional to the level of flange rubbing on the squealing wheel i. e. increased flange contact on the squealing wheel brings about a positive effect on squeal control. Contrary to the empty wagons which are characterised by tonal curve squeal, loaded 4 wagons requiring contact between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner in the 1000 m curve was characterised by broadband flanging noise. It was concluded from measurements that flange contact occurring under high lateral forces for steady state curving of loaded wagons provides the complete damping necessary for squeal control. The curve squeal noise that originated from the passing of empty wagons in the Elands Bay curve could further be classified according to the frequency at which the squeal event manifested itself in the curve, i. e. low frequency audible (0 – 10 kHz), high frequency audible (10 – 20 kHz) and ultrasonic squeal (> 20 kHz). The vast majority of low frequency audible squeal events recorded in the 1000 m Elands Bay curve occurred at approximately 4 kHz and originated from the low rail/trailing inner wheel interface, whilst the vast majority of high frequency audible squeal events occurred in the frequency range between 15 and 20 kHz and originated from both the high rail/leading outer wheel and low rail/trailing inner wheel interfaces...|$|R
