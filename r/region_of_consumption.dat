Recycling of these substances, on an industrial scale, remains somewhat developed while it presents numerous advantages over the exploitation of primary resources. Thus, in order to increase the efficiency of the use of the REEs and to decrease European dependence on these strategic elements, research and development efforts must be achieved in all areas of their life cycle whether it concerns exploitation of ores or end-of-life equipment such as the one EXTRADE project targets (Wastes of Electric and Electronic Equipment). In this context, the project EXTRADE aims to develop new fields of valorization of permanent magnets type NdFeB present in WEEE targeting 3 types of electronic equipment,i) hard disk drives of computers, ii) speakers of audio and video devices and iii) small electric motors present in ICT (information and Communication Technologies). EXTRADE project proposes to address the extraction of the NdFeB permanent magnetsfrom the WEEE deposit, developing units operation of treatment of WEEE intended to retrieve the contents of the magnet type NdFeB and to develop thermal, physical and physico-chemical treatments for producing new magnets or fractions enriched in alloys of REEs compatible with a recycling in the hydrometallurgical production of REE...|$|R

Europe {{is one of the most}} important <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> these substances. In this context, Europe in its 'Raw materials' strategy puts the recycling at the center of its concerns to provide a part of securing its supplies in rare earth elements. Recycling of these substances, on an industrial scale, remains somewhat developed while it presents numerous advantages over the exploitation of primary resources. This paper will present some results obtained from characterization study of permanent magnets present in wastes of electric and electronic equipment. Three different electronic components containing magnets are identified: hard dick drives, small electric motors and speakers. Several kilograms of theses wastes have been sampled at recycling plant. The representative sample has been dismantled manually to recover the magnets contained to quantify the amount of magnets in the investigated components. Thorough characterization results show that the weight percentage of magnets varies in the three investigated electronic components: 4 6 % in the speakers, 2. 5 - 2. 8 % in the hard disks, and between 0. 8 and 2 % in some electric motors. The results of the thermal treatments of the magnets of the investigated samples show that the majority of these magnets lose their magnetic property upon reaching Curie temperature (300 - 400 ° C) in 15 - 20 minutes. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) reveals the morphological aspects of these magnets which consist in crystals shaped tetrahedral phase Nd 2 Fe 14 B sintered in the presence of the interphase rich in rare earths elements (Nd, Dy and Pr). The magnetsare layer coated with 20 µm thick. This layer consists in Ni, Zn or metals alloys.

Using debts for medical care recorded in probate inventories, we construct the first quantitative analysis of levels of demand for medical care and the types of medical provision in small towns and villages across the Netherlands – locations much more representative of most of Europe than its better-studied cities. We reveal substantial growth in the sick’s reliance on commercial medical practitioners between 1650 and 1800, measured by both the frequency and size of debts to practitioners. We also find large differences between the commercialised maritime areas of the Netherlands and the more autarchic inland regions, where households were particularly unlikely to have used medical practitioners circa 1650. These differences extended to the types of practitioner involved: surgeons were most prominent in the maritime region; apothecaries in the inland <b>region.</b> Patterns <b>of</b> medical <b>consumption</b> converged during the nineteenth century, as did the types of practitioner used, anticipating laws restricting professional activity in medicine.
