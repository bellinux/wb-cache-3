In this study, a new graphical analysis procedure is proposed, using the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) vs. Ou respirogram because of its distinct characteristics that provides easy visual inspection. The OUR plot is typically divided into two respiration phases, and each one of these phases can be simulated by a previously derived analytical equation. Based on the 2 -phase model, five characteristic parameters (CPs) were derived for the OUR respirogram. Mathematically the 5 CPs can be related to the system parameters (SPs), including the four Monod kinetic parameters and two operating conditions (initial substrate and biomass concentration).

Aerobic biodegradation was studied by respirometric tests, being the respirometry a widely used technique for the characterisation of wastewater and activated sludge [1]. Respirometry is the measurement and interpretation of the biological oxygen consumption rate under well-defined experimental conditions.

One of the {{consequences}} of the social and economIc change due to industrialisation is the generation of industrial wastewater which requires treatment before being released into the natural aquatic environment. The municipality has wastewater treatment plants which were initially designed for the treatment of domestic wastewater. The presence of industrial wastewater in these treatment plants introduces various difficulties in the treatment process due to the complex and varying nature of the industrial wastewater. A means needs to be developed, that will allow the municipality to evaluate if a wastewater treatment plant can adequately treat a particular composition or type of wastewater to a quality suitable for release to the environment. Developing a simulation model for a wastewater treatment plant and calibrating it against plant operating data will allow the response of the wastewater treatment plant to a particular wastewater to be evaluated. In this study a model for the Mariamidge Wastewater Treatment Plant is developed in the WEST (Worldwide Engine for Simulation, Training and Automation) software package. The sources of data for modelling were laboratory experiments, historical data from the municipal laboratory and modelling of experiments. Dynamic input files representing the properties of the influent wastewater were generated by characterising the influent wastewater through the use of batch <b>respirometric</b> <b>tests</b> and flocculation filtration on composite samples of wastewater. Kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients of the model were determined from batch <b>respirometric</b> <b>tests</b> on wastewater and activated sludge, and simulation of the batch respirometric experiment.

Influent characterisation and reliable ASM 3 model parameters were determined from the <b>respirometric</b> batch <b>test</b> and modelling of experiments. The resulting plant model was able to closely predict the trends of the effluent COD concentration in the plant.

Primary treatments are often designed to reduce heavy metal and salt contents in wastewater, nevertheless trace concentrations persist and may reach the biological reactor, resulting in biomass inhibition and dramatic loss in purification efficiency.

40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} a {{manometric}} respirometric measuring system {{was applied to}} practical environmental cases related to wastewater management and biodegradation studies of oil-contaminated soils and materials used in landfill structures. Pollution of groundwater, surface water and soils is a worldwide problem. Therefore, tests simulating the biodegradation behaviour of organic compounds in water media and soils have become increasingly important. Respirometric methods provide direct measurement of the oxygen consumed by micro-organisms in biodegradation processes from an air or oxygen-enriched environment in a closed vessel. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a crucial environmental parameter {{used to measure the}} quality of water and treatment results in wastewater. Generally, BOD is measured with standardised methods, which are usually time-consuming as well as laborious. In this work the manometric <b>respirometric</b> <b>test</b> was compared with conventional BOD tests by determining the BOD of pulp and paper mills as well as domestic wastewater samples. The effect of different factors such as type, amount and pre-treatment of inoculum and the effect of dilution of a sample on the BOD values were also tested. A right dilution was noticed to be the most significant factor affecting the BOD values of the industrial wastewater samples. The mathematic estimation of the BOD 7 values from the respirometric data was proved to work reliably after a 2 – 3 day incubation period. Characterisation of organic fractions of the pulp and paper mill wastewater was carried out with methods including filtration, long term BOD measurements and COD analyses. The most significant observation in characterisation analyses was that a remarkable part of the detected oxygen demand was consumed for the biotransformation of biodegradable fractions into new inert decomposition products, not only for mineralisation of the biodegradable COD fraction. Biodegradation behaviour of the peat samples with different decomposition rates was studied in order to evaluate the applicable peat types {{that can be used in}} landfill structures. Only minor (BOD/ThOD <  0. 4 %) biodegradation was observed with compaction peat samples, and the stable state, in which biodegradation stopped, was achieved during a two month period. The manometric respirometric method was also applied for the biodegradation studies in which the effect of the modification of soil properties on biodegradation rates of bio-oils was tested. Modified properties were the nutrient content and the pH of the soil. Fertiliser addition and pH adjustment increased both the BOD/ThOD% values of the model substances and the precision of the measurement.

The observed results highlighted good system performance in terms of both COD removal and nitrification, thus showing a sort of biomass adaptation to hydrocarbon. Such a result has been also confirmed by the biomass <b>respirometric</b> <b>tests.</b> Moreover, membrane fouling analysis showed an increase of the total resistance in the last period of the experiments. Such a result was most likely due to the hydrocarbon which caused an irreversible fouling due to oil deposition onto the membrane surface...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} main {{results of an}} {{experimental}} campaign performed on a membrane bioreactor pilot plant designed to treat synthetic shipboard slops. The experimental campaign was divided into two phases: salinity acclimation up to 20 g NaCl L- 1 (Phase I) and hydrocarbon (diesel fuel) dosing (Phase II). The observed {{results show that the}} carbon removal was not severely affected by the wastewater features. Conversely, <b>respirometric</b> <b>tests</b> showed that nitrification was strongly affected by the salinity (33 % of nitrification efficiency at 20 g NaCl L- 1 - Phase I) {{as a result of the}} salinity in the autotrophic biomass. Moreover, the sludge viscosity increased during Phase II due to the wastewater composition, leading to an increase in the membrane resistance, and severe degradation of the sludge dewaterability was also observed. Indeed, the capillary suction time increased by a factor of 3 times compared with that of Phase I...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{sequential}} batch {{membrane bioreactor}} pilot plant is investigated {{to analyze the}} effect of a gradual increase in salinity on carbon and nutrient removal, membrane fouling and biomass kinetic parameters. The salinity was increased by 2 g NaCl L- 1 per week up to 10 g NaCl L- 1. The total COD removal efficiency was quite high (93 %) throughout the experiment. A gradual biomass acclimation to the salinity level was observed during the experiment, highlighting the good recovery capabilities of the system. Nitrification was also influenced by the increase in salinity, with a slight decrease in nitrification efficiency (the lowest value was obtained at 10 g NaCl L- 1 due to lower nitrifier activity). Irreversible cake deposition was the predominant fouling mechanism observed during the experiment. <b>Respirometric</b> <b>tests</b> exhibited a stress effect due to salinity, with a reduction in the respiration rates observed (from 8. 85 mgO 2 L- 1 h- 1 to 4 mgO 2 L- 1 h- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first scale up under non-sterile {{conditions of the}} biodegradation process of 2 -naphthalensulfonic acid polymers (NSAP) contained in a petrochemical wastewater by two white-rot fungi (Bjerkandera adusta and Pleurotus ostreatus). The biodegradation experiment was conducted first in flasks and then in packed-bed bioreactors filled with inert and biodegradable carriers (straw), the latter acting as both physical support and carbon source. Reactor inoculated with P.  ostreatus attached on straw worked under non-sterile conditions for three months showing 30  ±  5 % NSAP degradation. <b>Respirometric</b> <b>tests</b> showed that the fungal treatment was also able to significantly increase the biodegradable fraction of the wastewater COD, which rose from 9 % to 40 %. It was observed that the fungal degradation of the straw in the bed releases non-biodegradable by-products. Taking into account this contribution to nbCOD, the combined treatment of fungi and activated sludge could theoretically be able to reduce the original COD by up to 73 %...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{demonstrate}} that integrating biological process and photocatalytic oxidation in a system operated in recycling mode can be a promising technology to treat pharmaceutical wastewater characterized by simultaneous presence of biodegradable and refractory/inhibitory compounds. A lab-scale system integrating a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a TiO(2) slurry photoreactor was fed on simulated wastewater containing 10 mg/L of the refractory drug Carbamazepine (CBZ). Majority of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed by the MBR, while the photocatalytic oxidation was capable to degrade CBZ. CBZ degradation kinetics and its impacts on the biological process were studied. The adoption of a recycling ratio of 4 : 1 resulted in removal of up to 95 % of CBZ. Effluent COD reduction, sludge yield increase and <b>respirometric</b> <b>tests</b> suggested that the oxidation products were mostly biodegradable and not inhibiting the microbial activity. These results evidenced {{the advantages of the}} proposed approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater and similar industrial effluents. G. Laera, M. N. Chong, Bo Jin and A. Lope...|$|R
