5|$|The Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence, Restricted licence {{requires}} the same scores {{as the old}} term Grade II.The minimum age is 12 years. The licence allows the user to make <b>radiotelegraphy</b> (Morse code) and radiotelephony transmission in 12 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 100W.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{modes of}} {{operation}} include voice communication using amplitude modulation (AM), and Morse code using continuous wave (CW) <b>radiotelegraphy.</b> Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.|$|E
5|$|The Amateur Station Operator's Licence, General Grade, {{requires}} {{a minimum of}} 50% in each section of the written examination, and 60% overall, and a demonstration of proficiency in sending and receiving Morse code at 8 words per minute (without errors for each). The minimum age is 14 years. The licence allows a user to make <b>radiotelegraphy</b> and radiotelephony transmission in 13 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 400W. In addition, satellite communication, facsimile, and television modes are permitted.|$|E
25|$|New {{regulations}} {{were needed to}} govern the use of <b>radiotelegraphy.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiotelegraphy</b> using Morse {{code was}} vital during World War II, {{especially}} in carrying messages between the warships and the naval bases of the belligerents. Long-range ship-to-ship communication was by radio telegraphy, using encrypted messages because the voice radio systems on ships then were quite limited in both their range and their security. <b>Radiotelegraphy</b> was also extensively used by warplanes, especially by long-range patrol planes that were sent out by those navies to scout for enemy warships, cargo ships, and troop ships.|$|E
25|$|By now, Susini and his {{partners}} were focusing on another project. Immediately after reacquiring the station from Crítica, they sold it to Radio Prieto, using the money to create a <b>radiotelegraphy</b> company, Sociedad Anónima Radio Argentina, constituted on August 31, 1927.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{conflict}} with Peru was over the bases in the Amazon basin were dismantled and the troops sent to new bases like Tres Esquinas Air Force Base in the Department of Caqueta, Palanquero Air Force Base in the Department of Cundinamarca and San José del Guaviare in the Department of Guaviare. Meanwhile, the School of Military Aviation was moved to Cali, and leaving in Madrid the <b>Radiotelegraphy</b> and Maintenance Schools.|$|E
25|$|In addition, rapidly moving armies in {{the field}} could not have fought {{effectively}} without <b>radiotelegraphy</b> because they moved more rapidly than telegraph and telephone lines could be erected. This was seen especially in the blitzkrieg offensives of the Nazi German Wehrmacht in Poland, Belgium, France (in 1940), the Soviet Union, and in North Africa; by the British Army in North Africa, Italy, and the Netherlands; and by the U.S. Army in France and Belgium (in 1944), and in southern Germany in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{air station}} was {{initially}} {{led by a}} first lieutenant {{who was also a}} pilot, and manned with four conscripted pilots, four conscripted mechanics, a joint chief mechanic and accountant, and a support staff of ten. The station was to carry out operations including participation in exercises through machine gun shooting, dropping of dummy bombs and dummy mines, aerial photography, reconnaissance along the coast from Farsund to Arendal, and <b>radiotelegraphy.</b> For this the air station was equipped with three Sopwith Camel fighters and two Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.2 reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Telegraphy {{requires}} that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Many methods are designed according {{to the limits of}} the signalling medium used. The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples. In the 19th century, the harnessing of electricity led to the invention of electrical telegraphy. The advent of radio in the early 20th century brought about <b>radiotelegraphy</b> and other forms of wireless telegraphy. In the Internet age, telegraphic means developed greatly in sophistication and ease of use, with natural language interfaces that hide the underlying code, allowing such technologies as electronic mail and instant messaging.|$|E
25|$|The rank flag or {{distinguishing}} flag is {{the flag}} flown by a superior officer on his flagship or headquarters (hence the term flagship). The origins {{of this are}} from the era before <b>radiotelegraphy</b> and radiotelephony, when orders were given by flag signals. The flag denotes the ship which must be watched for signals designating orders. Such flags are also flown when leaders of the government (presidents, prime ministers or defense secretaries) are aboard Navy ships, showing the ship to hold the headquarters of highest level of authority for the Armed Forces. Today, with the progress in communications, this flag indicates the obligation of the other Naval vessels to pay the relevant honours (Manning the rails, firing cannon salute, attention, etc.) according to nautical etiquette. In a group of naval ships all commanded by superior officers, only {{the commander of the}} group or the officer of the highest rank can fly his flag.|$|E
25|$|As {{a crystal}} radio has no power supply, the sound power {{produced}} by the earphone comes solely from the transmitter of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna. The power available to a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the radio transmitter. Even for a powerful commercial broadcasting station, if {{it is more than}} {{a few miles from the}} receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured in microwatts or nanowatts. In modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 picowatts at the antenna can be heard. Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using amplification only due to the great sensitivity of human hearing, which can detect sounds with an intensity of only 10−16 W/cm2. Therefore, crystal receivers have to be designed to convert the energy from the radio waves into sound waves as efficiently as possible. Even so, they are usually only able to receive stations within distances of about 25 miles for AM broadcast stations, although the <b>radiotelegraphy</b> signals used during the wireless telegraphy era could be received at hundreds of miles, and crystal receivers were even used for transoceanic communication during that period.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Morse code {{began to}} be used {{extensively}} for early radio communication, before {{it was possible to}} transmit voice. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most high-speed international communication used Morse code on telegraph lines, undersea cables and radio circuits. In aviation, Morse code in radio systems started to be used on a regular basis in the 1920s. Although previous transmitters were bulky and the spark gap system of transmission was difficult to use, there had been some earlier attempts. In 1910, the US Navy experimented with sending Morse from an airplane. That same year, a radio on the airship America had been instrumental in coordinating the rescue of its crew. Zeppelin airships equipped with radio were used for bombing and naval scouting during World War I, and ground-based radio direction finders were used for airship navigation. Allied airships and military aircraft also made some use of <b>radiotelegraphy.</b> However, there was little aeronautical radio in general use during World War I, and in the 1920s, there was no radio system used by such important flights as that of Charles Lindbergh from New York to Paris in 1927. Once he and the Spirit of St. Louis were off the ground, Lindbergh was truly alone and incommunicado. On the other hand, when the first airplane flight was made from California to Australia in 1928 on the Southern Cross, one of its four crewmen was its radio operator who communicated with ground stations via radio telegraph.|$|E
500|$|Vintage {{operating}} {{activity is}} not limited to the AM mode. Many devotees use their [...] "classic" [...] amateur gear from vintage-era American manufacturers like Eico, EF Johnson, National, Heathkit, Hammarlund, Drake, Collins, WRL, Swan, Signal/One, Lafayette and Hallicrafters, to make <b>radiotelegraphy</b> (CW), SSB, FM and RTTY two-way contacts. Although 1930s through 1970s gear is considered [...] "vintage", collectors may differ on the cutoff dates.|$|E
500|$|... "Glowbugs" [...] are {{a related}} aspect of vintage radio and harken {{back to the}} early days of amateur radio, when the {{majority}} of hams hand-crafted their own equipment. Smaller in size than [...] "boat anchors", [...] "glowbug" [...] is a term used by US amateurs to describe a simple home-made tube-type radio set, reminiscent of the shortwave radio-building craze of the 1920s and 1930s. [...] "Glow" [...] refers to the glow of the vacuum tubes and [...] "bug" [...] to the gear's relatively diminutive size. The Doerle regenerative receiver and Hartley transmitter circuits are considered [...] "classic" [...] glowbug designs. Generally, any small, home-built tube-type transmitter or receiver may be referred to as a glowbug. The majority of glowbug transmitters are designed {{to be used in the}} CW <b>radiotelegraphy</b> mode.|$|E
500|$|In April 1935, Air Traffic Control in the United Kingdom was {{improved}} by {{the introduction of}} a new control zone system. Heston was added as a control zone, relieving Croydon of some traffic. As a result of these changes the wavelength used by Lympne for <b>radiotelegraphy</b> changed from 862 metres to 825 metres. Six new direction finding stations were installed as part of these improvements, including one at Lympne. The improvement meant that Croydon would now be able to communicate by radio with two aircraft at the same time. In August Henri Mignet flew his Mignet HM.14 [...] "Flying Flea" [...] across the Channel to Lympne, where the aircraft was demonstrated in front of large crowds. Also that month 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF held its annual camp at Lympne after having converted from a bomber squadron to a fighter squadron earlier in the year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a series}} of tests {{conducted}} at the U.S. Army's Langley Field in Hampton, Virginia, in July and August 1917, the world's first [...] "plane-to-plane" [...] and [...] "ground-to-plane, and vice versa" [...] communications by radiotelephony (as opposed to <b>radiotelegraphy</b> which had been developed earlier) were made to and from modified US Army JN-4s by Western Electric Company (Bell Labs) design engineers Lewis M. Clement and Raymond Heising, the developers of the experimental wind generator-powered airborne wireless voice transmitter and receiver equipment.|$|E
2500|$|These {{generators}} {{have been}} used, sometimes inappropriately {{and with some}} controversy, to support various fringe science investigations. In 1911, George Samuel Piggott received a patent for a compact double machine enclosed within a pressurized box for his experiments concerning <b>radiotelegraphy</b> and [...] "antigravity". Much later (in the 1960s), a machine known as [...] "Testatika" [...] was built by German engineer, Paul Suisse Bauman, and promoted by a Swiss community, the Methernithans. Testatika is an electromagnetic generator based on the 1898 Pidgeon electrostatic machine, said to produce [...] "free energy" [...] available directly from the environment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Radiotelegraphy</b> proved {{effective}} for rescue work in sea disasters by enabling effective communication between ships and from ship to shore. In 1904, Marconi began {{the first commercial}} service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907. Notably, Marconi's apparatus was used to help rescue efforts after the sinking of Titanic. Britain's postmaster-general summed up, referring to the Titanic disaster, [...] "Those who have been saved, have been saved through one man, Mr. Marconi...and his marvellous invention." ...|$|E
2500|$|The late 1880s {{through to}} the 1890s saw the {{discovery}} and then development of a newly understood phenomenon into a form of wireless telegraphy, called Hertzian wave wireless telegraphy, <b>radiotelegraphy,</b> or (later) simply [...] "radio". Between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published {{the results of his}} experiments where he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 theory of electromagnetic radiation. Many scientists and inventors experimented with this new phenomenon but the general consensus was that these new waves (similar to light) would be just as short range as light, and, therefore, useless for long range communication.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson became President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich in December 1916 and was {{appointed}} First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp on 2 April 1917.

2500|$|The first {{telephone}} {{experiments in}} Portugal connected Carcavelos to the Central do Cabo in Lisbon, in 1877. In 1882, the Edison Gower-Bell Telephone Company {{was established in}} both Lisbon and Porto, to explore the respective telephone service concessions. In 1887, the concession was transferred to APT - The Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company, which was kept by the latter until 1968, {{the year in which}} the Public Company [...] "Telefones de Lisboa e Porto" [...] (TLP) was created. The Post Office, Telegraphs and Telephones (CTT) explored until this present day, the telephone service {{in the rest of the}} country. For the exploration of <b>radiotelegraphy</b> and wireless telephone, a contract with the Marconi's Wireless Telegraphy Company concession was confirmed in 1922. In 1925, the [...] "Companhia Portuguesa Rádio Marconi" [...] (CPRM) was set up and took on all responsibilities of the previous concession.|$|E
2500|$|In 1901, {{convinced}} his wireless theories were correct, Tesla with financing from banker J. P. Morgan began {{construction of a}} high-voltage wireless station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. Although it was built as a transatlantic <b>radiotelegraphy</b> station, Tesla also intended it to transmit electric power without wires as a prototype transmitter for his proposed [...] "World Wireless System". Essentially an enormous Tesla coil, it consisted of a powerhouse with a 400-horsepower generator and a 187-foot (57m) tower topped by a 68-foot (21m) diameter metal dome capacitive electrode. [...] The circuit he used was {{a version of the}} [...] "magnifying transmitter" [...] he built at Colorado Springs (above). [...] Underneath the surface was an elaborate ground system that Tesla said was needed to [...] "grip the earth" [...] to create the oscillating earth currents which he believed would transmit the power.|$|E
2500|$|Practical <b>radiotelegraphy</b> {{communication}} systems {{were developed by}} Marconi beginning in 1895. By 1897 the advantages of narrow-bandwidth (lightly damped) systems noted by Crookes were recognized, and resonant circuits, capacitors and inductors, were incorporated in transmitters and receivers. The [...] "closed primary, open secondary" [...] resonant transformer circuit used by Tesla proved a superior transmitter, because the loosely-coupled transformer partially isolated the oscillating primary circuit from the energy-radiating antenna circuit, reducing the damping, allowing it to produce long [...] "ringing" [...] waves which had a narrower bandwidth. Versions of the circuit were patented by Marconi, John Stone Stone and Oliver Lodge, and were widely used in radio for twenty years. In 1906 Max Wien invented the quenched or [...] "series" [...] spark gap, which extinguished the spark after the energy had been transferred to the secondary, allowing the secondary to oscillate freely after that, reducing damping and bandwidth still more.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Radiotelegraphy</b> using Morse code, {{also known}} as [...] "CW" [...] from [...] "continuous wave", is the {{wireless}} extension of landline (wired) telegraphy developed by Samuel Morse and dates to {{the earliest days of}} radio. Although computer-based (digital) modes and methods have largely replaced CW for commercial and military applications, many amateur radio operators still enjoy using the CW mode—particularly on the shortwave bands and for experimental work, such as earth-moon-earth communication, because of its inherent signal-to-noise ratio advantages. Morse, using internationally agreed message encodings such as the Q code, enables communication between amateurs who speak different languages. It is also popular with homebrewers and in particular with [...] "QRP" [...] or very-low-power enthusiasts, as CW-only transmitters are simpler to construct, and the human ear-brain signal processing system can pull weak CW signals out of the noise where voice signals would be totally inaudible. A similar [...] "legacy" [...] mode popular with home constructors is amplitude modulation (AM), pursued by many vintage amateur radio enthusiasts and aficionados of vacuum tube technology.|$|E
2500|$|Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests {{based upon}} the CODEX {{standard}} word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. [...] The First Class license required 20 WPM code group and 25 WPM text code proficiency, the others 16 WPM code group test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20 WPM code text (plain language) test. [...] It was also necessary to pass written tests on operating practice and electronics theory. [...] A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. [...] This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship. [...] However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete. [...] (By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.) [...] Currently, only one class of license, the Radiotelegraph Operator License, is issued. [...] This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. [...] For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and <b>radiotelegraphy</b> practices, as well as 16 WPM codegroup and 20 WPM text tests. [...] However, the code exams are currently waived for holders of Amateur Extra Class licenses who obtained their operating privileges under the old 20 WPM test requirement.|$|E
