40|$|Abstract. A wear tester was developed. MC PA (nylon) {{filled with}} MoS 2 and PU (polyurethane) {{were used as}} the {{material}} of the rubber wheel of <b>roller</b> <b>guide</b> shoes. Their wear performances was investigated with the tester. The {{results show that the}} wear rate of MC PA increases firstly and then decreases with increasing load, and reverses with increasing velocity. The wear rate of PU decreases firstly and then increases with increasing velocity. In addition, the main wear mechanisms of PU are plough wear and abrasive wear at the low load (200 N). At the loads of 200 N~ 500 N, the main wear form of MC PA is the adhesive wear. Adhesive wear is the main mechanism of MC PA at the low velocity (3 m/s). Due to inner heat accumulation by friction, squama-peering occurs on MC PA surface at the high velocity (8 m/s). The dominant wear mechanisms of PU are abrasive wear and fatigue pitting. And the main reason of PU’s failure is the interior heat accumulation caused by friction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Instead of 2 D {{expanding}} diagram method, {{this paper}} presents a new regenerating method for cutter location paths of using smaller tools to produce cylindrical cams. According to the expected motions, cams are put to use in various applications in mechanism. For a cylindrical cam, the roller follower operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller. By using the conventional method, full-sized cutting tools, will restrict the flexibility of choosing cutting tools for wide <b>roller</b> <b>guide.</b> The manufacture of cylindrical cams is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed. Since the guiding curve cannot be offset exactly along the cylindrical surface, this leads to some approximating problems. Though the tool-paths generation by using the same size tools as rollers is applied in practice, the study of NC program by unequal tools is not available to meet high precision requirement. This proposed 3 D offset-based generating method can regenerate tool-paths for standard cutting tools instead of larger ones and implemented on computerized CAM system. Examples with wider grooves are demonstrated to prove its effectiveness...|$|E
