40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} we address the {{question}} of how large a stochastic perturbation an asymptotically stable linear functional differential system can tolerate without losing the property of be-ing pathwise asymptotically stable. In particular, we investigate noise perturbations which are either independent of the state or influenced by the current and past states. For perturbations inde-pendent of the state, we prove that the assumed <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> for the noise is optimal. 1...|$|E

Here we compute {{the distribution of the}} q-mode magnetization fluctuations {{as a function of the}} temperature, the wave vector q, and a fading out external field. We obtain new classes of probability distributions generated by this external field as well as new critical behavior in terms of its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> out.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analytical}} model {{to determine the}} probability of error for a communication system {{as a function of}} mobile velocity. We investigate the performance of a system model with power control and error control coding. In a multipath fading environment, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> is highly dependent on the velocity of the mobile. To incorporate the effect of velocity, we apply a Markovian model to the channel that captures the correlation between successive bits. We then develop an error recursion that accounts for the power control and the channel coding. At low speeds, we find that effective power control is crucial to maintain low error rates. At higher speeds where power control is ineffective, error control coding is necessary to mitigate the channel impairments. For more intermediate speeds, the model gives the worst performance because neither power control nor error control coding can counteract the effects of the channel. 1 Introduction Wireless communication s [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A set of garment polyester-mix fabrics {{was tested}} for their {{potential}} suitability as surrogate dosimetry materials using optically and {{thermally stimulated luminescence}} techniques. A strong native blue-stimulated optically stimulated luminescence and thermoluminescence signal was observed with unirradiated samples, but this could be avoided by measurement of infra-red stimulated luminescence, and a sample of blue polyester-cotton mix fabric exhibited particularly high sensitivity to radiation dose. However, near complete fading at room temperature within several hours and rapid bleaching of the signal when exposed to daylight limit the deployment of this mode of measurement. The fading behaviour is critically dependent on the atmosphere in which the material is measured and on the storage conditions, where a reduction in oxygen significantly reduces the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading.</b> A cathodoluminescence study of the samples performed in a scanning electron microscope revealed complex emission spectra obtained with spatially integrated measurements and, in one fabric examined in more detail, the spatially resolved emission was found to vary in intensity and wavelength within the polyester fibre filaments {{which is likely to}} be associated with differences in crystallinity...|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to correct plumage color fading when comparing the plumage coloration of birds captured at different times during the breeding season. We proposed two methods for correcting plumage color fading and compared them using the throat feathers of the Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica gutturalis). One method uses the color shift of feathers on live birds during the same breeding season (the field method). The other method uses longitudinal color measurements of feathers placed on the open ground (the experimental method). This method has an advantage of not capturing the birds twice. The field and experimental methods estimated similar <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> <b>of</b> hue and brightness. Saturation was predicted to fade with time in the experimental method, which is unrealistic {{because there was no}} effect of time on saturation in live birds. Using the field method, we derived an equation for correcting plumage color fading in Barn Swallows. When assessing changes in plumage color, the field method should be used whenever possible since this method estimates plumage color fading in live birds...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{existing}} literature on performance evaluation <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels is concentrated on either the symbol error <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the links, or the outage capacity. We present in this technical report approximation techniques for the packet error <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> quasi-static <b>fading</b> channels. This model applies when the channel coherence time {{is larger than the}} signaling time and leads to multiple symbols experiencing the same fading state during a packet transmission. We start by giving a closed-form upper bound on the asymptotic coding gain of the packet error rate in quasi-static fading channels. Using the fact that the asymptotic formulation is inversible with respect to the mean signal-to-noise ration (SNR), we present a packet error outage metric, with applications to channels where links are subject to both fading and log-normal shadowing effects simultaneously. We then show that a unit step approximation can be derived for the packet error <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> block <b>fading</b> channels, that closely matches the numerical computation of the packet error rate in a tractable closed-form expression. Using the asymptotic approximation method, we derive the optimal power allocation for different relaying protocols, especially when optimal combination of the symbols received at the destination may not be possible...|$|R

40|$|Oscillations {{observed}} in the light curve of Nova V 1974 Cygni 1992 since summer 1994 have been interpreted as permanent superhumps. From simple calculations based on the Tidal-Disk Instability model of Osaki, and assuming that the accretion disc is the dominant optical source in the binary system, we predict that the nova will evolve to become an SU UMa system as its brightness declines from its present luminosity by another 2 - 3 magnitudes. Linear extrapolation of its current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> (in magnitude units) puts {{the time of this}} phase transition within the next 2 - 4 years. Alternatively, the brightness decline will stop before the nova reaches that level, and the system will continue to show permanent superhumps in its light curve. It will then be similar to two other old novae, V 603 Aql and CP Pup, that still display the permanent superhumps phenomenon 79 and 55 years, respectively, after their eruptions. We suggest that non-magnetic novae with short orbital periods could be progenitors of permanent superhump systems. Comment: 5 pages, 2 eps. figures, Latex, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of a CDMA reverse link with an up/down power control algorithm in the presence of fading. We derive a stochastic nonlinear feedback control system model for the power controlled reverse link and study the power control performance based on the nonlinear model using the technique of statistical linearization. We provide a general analysis frame work that allows us to study the effect of mobile speed, power control step size, and fading channel parameters such as correlation coefficient and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> on power control errors. Numerical results show excellent accuracy of our analysis, which can be used to design and optimize the system parameters without going through lengthy simulations. For example, in the presence of shadow fading, it is seen that a power control step size in the range of 0. 5 - 1. 3 dB is sufficient to keep power control errors near a minimum. In the case of Rayleigh fading, the standard deviation of power control errors grows [...] ...|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{existing}} literature on performance evaluation of fading channels is concentrated on the symbol error rate of the links. A good review of these results {{as well as an}} interesting framework for the evaluation of symbol error rates in fading channels is available in the book of Simon and Alouini [1]. These results are focused on the symbol error <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels; when the fading is relatively fast compared to the symbol transmission duration, with proper interleaving, one can extend them to packet error rates [2]. On the other hand, when the fading is much slower than the packet transmission time, one has to consider that most symbols in the packet will experience the same fading state - a model known as block fading or quasi-static fading. A metric of choice for performance evaluation of this system models is the outage capacity [3 - 5]. Being reliant on infinitely long random codes, these results provide a theoretical bound on the performance of transmission schemes over block fading channels, but they fail to capture the behavior of practical systems, which is the foremost motivation for the current work.|$|E

This search covers observations from 2003 September to 2005 March. We have an effective coverage of 1. 74 deg 2 yr for rapidly fading transients that remain brighter than 17. 5 mag for more than 30 minutes. This search is the first large-area survey to be able to detect typical untriggered GRB afterglows. Our background rate is very low and purely astrophysical. We have found four previously unknown cataclysmic variables (CVs) and one new flare star. We have not detected any candidate afterglow events or other unidentified transients. We can place an upper limit on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> optical transients with quiescent counterparts dimmer than 20 th magnitude at a rate of less than 1. 9 deg - 2 - 2 yr - 1 with 95 % confidence. This places limits on the optical characteristics of off-axis (orphan) GRB afterglows. As a by-product of this search, we have an effective 52 deg 2 yr of coverage for very slowly decaying transients, such as CVs. This implies an overall rate of outbursts from high Galactic latitude CVs of 0. 1 deg - 2 yr - 1...|$|E
40|$|For OFDM {{systems in}} fast fading, it is {{difficult}} to obtain a closed form expression for the OFDM symbol error probability. Thus, tight analytical bounds on actual performance are extremely useful for performance prediction and verification. Additionally, the structure of the bound provides insight into system behavior. A new expurgated 2 -dimensional union bound is proposed and applied to an OFDM system in fast fading. This bound becomes extremely tight as the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> L increases. Performance comparison of the new bound to a lower bound on a known expurgated union bound demonstrates a gain of up to 1. 5 dB at P(ϵ) = 10 ^- 2 for channel implicit diversity order of L= 4. A new simulated upper bound that uses a reduced state vector in a modified trellis search algorithm and a simulated lower bound that assumes limited knowledge of the ICI are also presented. Both bounds are derived from a "time-varying" finite state machine model of the received signal. Performance results for these bounds are extremely tight for small to large values of N, where N is the number of OFDM signal tones. Also, the reduction in computational complexity achieved for N= 512 is from 2 ^ 512 to 2 ^ 6 for both bounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} Doppler spread and {{envelope}} fading based on CW measurements in the indoor radio channel {{are presented in}} this work. In this work, the temporal variations in the channel are caused by a moving receiver, or moving people {{in the vicinity of}} the transmitter and receiver. The result of the channel temporal variations is signal fading. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> can be measured by the Doppler spread. CW measurements were taken at different carrier frequencies from 14 to 14. 5 GHz with an increment of 50 MHz. Different locations, antenna separation distances and positions (LOS or NLOS) were selected to collect the data. Each measurement consists of 2. 5 seconds of temporal variations of the channel. The autoregressive spectral estimation method is used as a. tool to estimate the Doppler spread using CW measurements in the indoor radio channel. Results demonstrated that this method provided good estimates of the Doppler spread with a reasonable resolution and smoother spectrum than traditional spectrum estimation methods. The values of the Doppler spread under different measurement conditions are compared. Statistical analysis of envelope fading distributions based on the K-S and ChiSquare goodness tests and level crossing rates are presented. Those results can be used in future designs of wireless communication systems...|$|E

We followed the evolution of the OH, NH, CN, C 3, and C 2 production rates computed with the Haser model as well as the evolution of the dust production. All five gas species display an asymmetry about perihelion, the rate of brightening being steeper than the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading.</b> The study of the coma morphology reveals gas and dust jets which indicate one or several active zone(s) on the nucleus. The dust, C 2, and C 3 morphologies present some similarities while the CN morphology is different. OH and NH are enhanced in the tail direction. The study of the evolution of the comet activity shows that the OH, NH, and C 2 production rates evolution with the heliocentric distance is correlated to the dust evolution. The CN and, to a lesser extent, the C 3 do not display such a correlation with the dust. These evidences and the comparison with parent species production rates indicate that C 2 and C 3 on one side and OH and NH on the other side could be -at least partially- released from organic-rich grains and icy grains. On the contrary, all evidences point to HCN being the main parent of CN in this comet. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 10 page...|$|E

In addition to the large sample size, we utilise photometry that accounts for the varying angular sizes of galaxies, photometric redshifts verified with spectroscopy, and absolute magnitudes that should have very small random and systematic errors.

50|$|A fader is any device {{used for}} fading, {{especially}} when it is a knob or button that slides along a track or slot. It is principally a variable resistance or potentiometer also called a ‘pot’. A contact can move {{from one end to}} another. As this movement takes place the resistance of the circuit can either increase or decrease. At one end the resistance of the scale is at 0 and at the other side it is infinite. A. Nisbett explains the fader law as follows in his book called The Sound studio:"The ‘law’ of the fader is near-logarithmic over much of its range, which means that a scale of decibels can be made linear (or close to it) over a working range of perhaps 60 dB. If the resistance were to increase according to the same law beyond this, it would be twice as long before reaching a point where the signal is negligible.

40|$|The {{origin of}} gamma-ray bursts {{has been one}} of the great unsolved mysteries in high-energy {{astrophysics}} for almost 30 years. The recent discovery of fading sources at X-ray and optical wave-lengths coincident with the location of the gamma-ray burst GRB 970228 therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the nature of these high-energy events. The optical counterpart appears to be a transient point source embedded in a region of extended nebulosity, the latter having been tentatively identified as a high-redshift galaxy. This would seem to favour models that place gamma-ray bursts at cosmological distances, although a range of mechanisms for producing the bursts is still allowed. A crucial piece of information for distinguishing between such models is how the brightness of the optical counterpart evolves with time. Here we re-evaluate the existing photometry of the optical counterpart of GRB 970228 to construct an optical light curve for the transient event. We find that between 21 hours and six days after the burst, the R-band brightness decreased by a factor of approx. 50, with any subsequent decrease in brightness occurring at a much slower rate. As the point source faded, it also became redder. The initial behaviour of the source appears to be consistent with the 'fireball' model, in which the burst results from the merger of two neutron stars, but the subsequent decrease in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> may prove harder to explain. The gamma-ray burst of 28 February 1997, detected with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on board the BeppoSAX satellite, and located with an approx. 3 feet radius position with the Wide Field Camera on the same satellite, was the first for which a fading X-ray and optical counterpart were discovered.

Observations covered 52 nights pre- and post-perihelion between December 11, 2012, and June 11, 2013 (perihelion: 24 March, 2013). We followed the evolution of the OH, NH, CN, C[SUB] 3 [/SUB], and C[SUB] 2 [/SUB] production rates computed with the Haser model as well as the evolution of the A(θ) fρ parameter as a proxy for the dust production. All five gas species display similar slopes for the heliocentric dependence. An asymmetry about perihelion is observed, the rate of brightening being steeper than the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading.</b> The chemical composition of the comet's coma changes slightly along the orbit: the relative abundance of C[SUB] 2 [/SUB] to CN increases with the heliocentric distance (r) below - 1. 4 au and decreases with r beyond 1. 4 au while the C[SUB] 3 [/SUB]-to-CN ratio is constant during our observations. The behavior of the dust is {{different from that of the}} gas, the slope of the heliocentric dependence becoming steeper in early February, correlated to a change in the visual lightcurve slope. However, the dust color does not vary during the observations. The application of several enhancement techniques on the images revealed structures in the CN, C[SUB] 3 [/SUB], and C[SUB] 2 [/SUB] images. These features imply the existence of one or several active zone(s) on the comet nucleus. The shape of the structures is similar in these three filters and changes from a roughly hourglass shape in December and January to a corkscrew shape in February and March. The structures in the continuum filters (sampling the dust) are not correlated to those observed for the gas.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{derivatives}} of naphtho[1, 2 -b]pyran and the [2, 1 -b] and [2, 3 -b] isomers has been prepared. Those compounds with aryl substituents {{adjacent to the}} hetematom have been obtained by an acid catalysed reaction of a naphthol with a 1, 1 - diarylprop- 2 yn-l-ol and thermal cyclisation of the intermediate ether. Alkyl and spiro-cycloalkyl derivatives have been synthesized by {{the reduction of the}} related naphthopyranones and dehydration of the resulting pyranols. The latter reaction was accompanied by dimerised and polymerised material in the [1, 2 -b] and [2, 3 -b] series. Some reactions of the pyran double bond have been studied in order to assess the influence of the position of fusion of the naphthalene unit on to the pyran ring. Based on the reaction with hypobromous acid and on direct epoxidation of the double bond, the naphthopyrans are more reactive than the corresponding benzopyrans. Particular reactivity was exhibited by the [1, 2 -b] and [2, 3 -b] systems, which were also prone to electrophilic attack in the naphthalene moiety. Ring opening reactions of the epoxynaphthopyrans have been investigated and found to be attractive precursors for benzo-fused derivatives of chroman- 3 -ones and chroman- 3, 4 -diones. The 9 -hydroxy derivatives of the naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans have been etherified with o-halogenoalcohols and these compounds together with their 9 -hydroxy precursors have been esterified with methacryloyl chloride. A range of novel polymers has been prepared by the free radical solution polymerisation of these methacrylate esters. The resulting naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyran based polymers varied in the substitution at C- 3 and in the length of the group separating the naphthopyran unit from the polymer backbone. Macromolecular weight and its distribution have been measured for all of the polymers by gel permeation chromatography. Increase in the length of the spacer group led to a higher molecular weight and to a narrower distribution for the polymer. Conversely, increasing the size of the substituents at C- 3 resulted in a decrease in molecular weight. The photochromic properties of the monomers and polymers have been investigated. Alkyl and spiro-cycloalkane substituted naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans showed no photochromism at 0 °C, but their derived polymers become pale yellow on irradiation.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of the communication channel {{is one of the}} most important issues for successful deployment of LMCS/LMDS systems. This paper focuses on the temporal variations of the signal because of passing vehicles and foliage movement imparted from wind. CW measurements at 29. 5 GHz with transmitter and receiver at fixed locations were carried out for a maximum distance of 1. 5 Km between transmitting and receiving antennas. The presented results include power profile at various locations, cumulative distribution function of received signal strength, autocorrelation function, power spectral density, level crossing <b>rates,</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>fades</b> and interfade statistics. The Kolmogrov Smirnov test is also performed to find the closeness of the acquired data with standard fading channel models. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-This paper {{reports the}} results of {{extensive}} mea-surements {{and analysis of the}} indoor radio propagation chan-nel’s temporal variations. The empirical data base consists of 192 one-min recordings <b>of</b> CW envelope <b>fading</b> waveforms with both antennas stationary. Measurements were carried out in an office environment at 1100 MHz with four transmitter-receiver antenna separations of 5, 10, 20, and 30 m. Effects of controlled degrees of motion with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 individuals walking around the high antenna only, around the low antenna only, and around both antennas were investigated. The reported re-sults include amplitude fading distributions, correlation prop-erties, level crossing <b>rates,</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>fades</b> statistics, and spectrum widths of the frequency domain data. The results can be used in fixed wireless computer communication applications, and in supplementing the available spatial variation models o...|$|R
40|$|Performance of {{diversity}} systems is often evaluated {{under the assumption}} of perfect interleaving and characterised in terms of long-term parameters such as the average bit-error rate, which does not capture the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels. Statistical characteristics (static and dynamic) of the envelope of two correlated Rayleigh fading channels are explored using a physical model. For two popular diversity-combining schemes, maximal ratio combining and selection combining, both static and dynamic (level-crossing <b>rate)</b> properties <b>of</b> correlated <b>fading</b> channels are derived. These results are very useful for performance evaluation {{of diversity}} systems without bit-level simulations. The results can also provide very useful characteristics such as average duration <b>of</b> <b>fades,</b> <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> and outage probability for two-channel diversity systems and can be extended to multiple fading channels...|$|R
