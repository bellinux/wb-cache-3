Both zwitterionic proline and arigine require one water molecule {{in order to}} remain geometrically stable, while zwitterionic glycine necessitates two water molecules (Jensen and Gordon 1995; Im et al. 2008). In addition, one water molecule is already sufficient to cause zwitterionic arginine as the global energy minimum (Im et al. 2008). Accordingly, <b>relative</b> <b>stabilities</b> of these zwitterionic conformers should increase in the order as glycine <proline <arginine.|$|R
40|$|This {{vignette}} demonstrates {{an analysis}} of the <b>relative</b> <b>stabilities</b> of 24 carboxylases from model organisms that grow optimally at different temperatures. In the chemical thermodynamic model, changes in both temperature and oxidation potential influence the <b>relative</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the proteins with an overall progression that fits with the growth temperatures of the organisms. The calculations supporting this study are presented using a series of equilibrium activity diagrams constructed using CHNOSZ. First, equilibrium activity diagrams as a function of either temperature or log aH 2 (at constant values of the other variable) show that both variables contribute significantly to the <b>relative</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the proteins. Second, an equilibrium predominance diagram is used to formulate an expression for log aH 2 as a function of temperature that crosses the protein stability fields in order of increasing growth temperature of the organism. Third, equilibrium activity and chemical species richness diagrams based on this function show pattern that mirrors the natural growth temperature of the organism. The final piece of code produces an animated series of rank-abundance diagrams for the proteins as both temperature and log aH 2 are increased. ...|$|R

A realistic description of the molecular charge distribution can be reached by introducing a quantum-mechanical correction to the Mulliken atomic charges, derived from the 'charge'-'charge flux'-'overlap' (CCFO) model.

40|$|A {{continuum}} electrostatics {{model is}} used to calculate the <b>relative</b> <b>stabilities</b> of 117 mutants of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) involving the mutation of a charged residue to an uncharged residue. The calculations are based on the crystallographic structure of the wild‐type protein and attempt to take implicitly into account the effect of the mutations in the denatured state by assuming a linear relationship between the free energy changes caused by the mutation in the native and denatured states. A good correlation (linear correlation coefficient of ∼ 0. 8) is found with published experimental <b>relative</b> <b>stabilities</b> of these mutants. The results suggest {{that in the case of}} SNase (i) charged residues contribute to the stability of the native state mainly through electrostatic interactions, and (ii) native‐like electrostatic interactions may persist in the denatured state. The continuum electrostatics method is only moderately sensitive to model parameters and leads to quasi‐predictive results for the <b>relative</b> mutant <b>stabilities</b> (error of 2 - 3 kJ mol- 1 or of the order of kBT), except for mutants in which a charged residue is mutated to glycin...|$|R

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of moscovium {{in aqueous solution}} should essentially be that of the Mc+ and Mc3+ ions. The former should be easily hydrolyzed and not be easily complexed with halides, cyanide, and ammonia. Moscovium(I) hydroxide (McOH), carbonate (Mc2CO3), oxalate (Mc2C2O4), and fluoride (McF) should be soluble in water; the sulfide (Mc2S) should be insoluble; and the chloride (McCl), bromide (McBr), iodide (McI), and thiocyanate (McSCN) should be only slightly soluble, so that adding excess hydrochloric acid would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium(I) chloride. Mc3+ should be about as stable as Tl3+ and hence should also be {{an important part of}} moscovium chemistry, although its closest homolog among the elements should be its lighter congener Bi3+. Moscovium(III) fluoride (McF3) and thiozonide (McS3) should be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while moscovium(III) chloride (McCl3), bromide (McBr3), and iodide (McI3) should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form oxyhalides such as McOCl and McOBr, again analogous to bismuth.

5|$|The secular {{evolution}} of the objects' orbits varies with their orbits. The orbits of some objects are metastable, for example, some that are initially aligned with Planet Nine. The orbits of these objects precess until parts of the orbits are tangent to that of Planet Nine, leading to close encounters. Some stable orbits do exist for aligned objects with smaller eccentricities. Objects in these orbits have high perihelia and {{have yet to be}} observed, however, and an additional perturbation would have been required to be captured in these orbits. The curves followed also vary with the semi-major axis of the object, with the region where aligned orbits are possible decreasing for larger semi-major axes. Without the inclusion of resonant dynamics the secular dynamics becomes more complex for inclined objects with semi-major axes beyond 300 AU. Alignment and anti-alignment is this case is more the result of sticky chaos rather than confinement with orbits evolving widely but spending more time in regions of <b>relative</b> <b>stability</b> associated with secular resonances. Including the resonant dynamics, for example if Sedna is in a 3:2 resonance with Planet Nine as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang, also alters these curves and can shift the centers of the libration islands away from anti-alignment.|$|E
