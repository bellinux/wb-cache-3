25|$|In October 1960, a new model, The Frisky Prince {{was shown}} at the Earls Court Motor Show. This was {{basically}} a re-bodied Family Three with front <b>hung</b> <b>doors.</b> Around the same time, a deal was done with a company called Middlesbrough Motorcraft and kits to build your own Frisky became available from them. Anthony Brindle, who had become joint managing director of Frisky Cars {{took part in a}} publicity run attempting to visit five European capitals, Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels, Amsterdam and London not spending more than £5 on fuel.|$|R
60|$|Pierson did not {{shut his}} eyes; he opened {{them as he}} fell on his knees. In the seat behind, Noel and young Morland had also fallen on their knees their faces covered each with a single hand; but her left hand and his <b>right</b> <b>hung</b> at their sides. They prayed {{a little longer than}} any others and, on rising, sang the hymn a little louder.|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} Ingleby's tennis flannels and black {{swimming}} costume which <b>hung</b> behind the <b>door.</b> Ingleby laughed.|$|R

60|$|The {{customers}} were mostly seafaring men, {{and they talked}} so loudly that I <b>hung</b> at the <b>door,</b> almost afraid to enter.|$|R
60|$|Here the {{greatest}} difficulty confronted Clayton, {{for he had}} no means whereby to hang his massive door {{now that he had}} built it. After two days' work, however, he succeeded in fashioning two massive hardwood hinges, and with these he <b>hung</b> the <b>door</b> so that it opened and closed easily.|$|R
60|$|Mixed {{with the}} smell of camphor was the unmistakable smell of seaweed. Tawny ribbons <b>hung</b> on the <b>door.</b> The sun beat {{straight}} upon them.|$|R
60|$|He {{produced}} {{a copy of}} the paper from the pocket of his great-coat which <b>hung</b> from the <b>door,</b> and passed it to his bounding brother.|$|R
5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side <b>hung</b> double <b>doors.</b> By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|R
60|$|A curtain <b>hung</b> {{across the}} <b>door</b> {{of the inner}} chamber, through which Philammon could hear plainly the steps of some one {{walking up and down}} hurriedly and fiercely.|$|R

60|$|Her {{left hand}} still held mine, but her <b>right</b> hand <b>hung</b> listlessly at her side. He raised it gently to his lips--touched it with them, rather than kissed it--bowed to me--and then, with perfect {{delicacy}} and discretion, silently quitted the room.|$|R

60|$|He {{tapped the}} {{barometer}} which <b>hung</b> by the <b>door</b> {{as they went}} out, and, checking a remark which rose to his lips, stole a satisfied glance at the face by his side.|$|R
60|$|They {{paused at}} length {{in a quarter}} unknown to him before a tolerably large house. Its <b>doors</b> <b>hung</b> wide, and across the threshold, in and out, moved two {{continuous}} streams of officers and men.|$|R
60|$|Its {{roof was}} gone, its <b>door</b> <b>hung</b> loose on its hinges. It had but one window, a small one, looking up the valley. Dick laid his {{gun on the}} sill, which was nearly level with his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{night we}} put a tub of water {{at the bottom of}} the back-stairs, and a pile of tin pans at the top of the front stairs, so that any attempt to come up would produce a splash or a rattle. Bells were <b>hung</b> on <b>door</b> handles, sticks of wood piled up in dark corners for robbers to fall over, and the family retired, all armed and all {{provided}} with lamps and matches.|$|R
5000|$|At {{each end}} is a track stopper to absorb any impact made if {{the door is}} slammed and to hold {{the door in the}} open or closed position.

60|$|The bell, <b>hung</b> on the <b>door</b> {{by means}} of a curved ribbon of steel, was {{difficult}} to circumvent. It was hopelessly cracked; but of an evening, at the slightest provocation, it clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence.|$|R
50|$|To {{allow the}} Jubilee line to be {{extended}} to Stratford a new fleet of trains was ordered in 1992 to replace the 1983 Stock running on the line, {{as the cost of}} a new fleet was calculated to be the same as refurbishing the older trains to run with the newer trains. The resulting 1996 Stock, and the first train was delivered in 1996. The Northern line stock also needed replacement and the 1995 Stock replaced the mixture of 1959, 1962 and 1972 Mk I Stock trains that were used on the line, the first trains arriving in 1998. These trains are similar, composed of 17.7 m long cars with externally <b>hung</b> <b>doors,</b> but with differing traction equipment. OPO operation was introduced on the Northern line with the new trains and the last service with a guard operated on the London Underground in January 2000. On the Jubilee line a seventh car was added to trains in 2006 and a new signalling system allowing automatic operation was commissioned in 2011. On the Victoria line, new trains were introduced between July 2009 and June 2011, and a new signalling system has allowed 33 trains per hour from January 2013.|$|R
25|$|Presence {{of toilet}} but not privacy: Some toilets {{do not have}} a real door, but have a cloth <b>hung</b> as a <b>door.</b> In some communities, toilets are located in places where women are shy to access them due to the {{presence}} of men.|$|R
60|$|A winding, narrow stone stair, another length {{or two of}} corridor, and his guide's {{shuffling}} footsteps paused {{beside a}} low iron-studded door let into the solid stone.

5000|$|... "Stand before Me": an {{expression}} found over 100 {{times in the}} Old Testament means [...] "to stand before someone with an attitude of service," [...] used of priests (...) , kings (...) or prophets (...) [...] LXX has the closing as παραἵστημι κατά πρόσωπον ἐγώ πᾶς ὁ ἡμέρα ὁ γῆ ("to stand before my face while the earth remains").

60|$|Mr. Crisparkle goes in, {{with the}} hat {{that has so}} easily, so almost imperceptibly, {{acquired}} the <b>right</b> to be <b>hung</b> up in his hall; hangs it up; and goes thoughtfully to bed.|$|R
60|$|His brain still whirled {{with the}} {{emotions}} that had so lately overwhelmed his mind; his <b>right</b> hand <b>hung</b> helplessly by his side, dragged after him like a prisoner's chain, and lacerated by the uneven surface of the ground over which it was slowly drawn, as--supporting himself on his left arm, and creeping forward a few inches at a time--he set forth on his toilsome journey.|$|R
5000|$|... Mary Beth from Minneapolis, Minnesota {{created the}} WCCD flag {{shown on the}} <b>right,</b> and <b>hung</b> it up on a flag pole outside her house.

6000|$|... "You'll have to {{wait till}} the others come back. I can't carry." [...] Jacob Welse pointed to his <b>right</b> arm, which <b>hung</b> dead. [...] "Only wrenched," [...] he explained. [...] "No bones broken." ...|$|R
60|$|That was {{a comforting}} reflection. It not only {{justified}} a slow progress up the hill, {{but at the}} crest a sprawl on the turf beside the road, to contemplate the Weald from the south. In a matter of two days he had crossed that spacious valley, with its frozen surge of green hills, its little villages and townships here and there, its copses and cornfields, its ponds and streams like jewelery of diamonds and silver glittering in the sun. The North Downs were hidden, far away beyond the Wealden Heights. Down below was the little village of Cocking, and half-way up the hill, a mile perhaps to the <b>right,</b> <b>hung</b> a flock of sheep grazing together. Overhead an anxious peewit circled against the blue, {{and every now and}} then emitted its feeble cry. Up here the heat was tempered by a pleasant breeze. Mr. Hoopdriver was possessed by unreasonable contentment; he lit himself a cigarette and lounged more comfortably. Surely the Sussex ale is made of the waters of Lethe, of poppies and pleasant dreams. Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Professor Charles Frederick Holder and boatman Jim Gardner [Mexican Joe?] {{displaying}} a fish at Catalina, 1898. A large tuna fish {{can be seen}} at <b>right</b> <b>hung</b> by its gills from a pole. Jim Gardner is visible at center. He is wearing a large straw hat, vest and long pants. He has a long pole with a large metal hook at left. Dr. Holder is visible at left and can be seen wearing a corduroy suit and striped hat. He has a gray beard and glasses and is holding a long fishing pole. Holder was a conservationist, sportsman, and professor of Piscatorial science. Please note that some sources identify the boatman as "Mexican Joe" (also known as Jose Felice Presiado). "Avalon, June 2. [...] Prof. C. F.

40|$|The {{vocabulary}} of the Hungarian Polonia Community {{is characterized by}} {{a relatively small number of}} words borrowed directly from Hungarian (ex. : bácsi uncle, mister, néni aunt, madam, lady etc.) and also by a large number of so called “hidden Hungarianisms”: that is to say Hungarian words, expressions, and word formations that are translated directly into Polish. In the lexical system of the Hungarian Polonia Community it is possible to distinguish two groups of “hidden Hungarianisms”: 1. Semantically borrowed words: punktualny – exact, precise, Hung. : pontos, Pol. : dokładny: to nie jest punktualna informacja; 2. Semantically borrowed word formations; mieć prawde – to be <b>right,</b> <b>Hung</b> [...] vkinek igaza van, Pol. : mieć rację: mama, masz prawdę. Thus the vocabulary system of the Hungarian Polish Community is expanding through this process of borrowing Hungarian words and word formations. This characteristic distinguishes the language of the Hungarian Polonia Community from the Polish language spoken in other Polonia communities, where the influence of the host country's language produces a large number of directly borrowed words...|$|R
60|$|As they emerged, Smoke drew off one mitten, lighted a match, {{and glanced}} at the {{thermometer}} that <b>hung</b> beside the <b>door.</b> He remittened his naked hand hastily as if the frost had burned him.

50|$|Chunlian is a couplet, {{typically}} seven characters, on {{two sides}} of the door frame, whose content is related to spring. Lexical and tonal rules are always adhered, though not strictly, as Chunlian is transformed from metrical poems. Sometimes, concurrently, a horizontal scroll with four to five characters is hanged on the crosspiece of the door. Its content is mostly about the beauty of nature, patriotism of China and their earnestness of a splendid future. Except from being <b>hung</b> on <b>door</b> frames, Chunlian is a necessary item that is unfurled in the end of a dragon dance, an exultant performance in celebration.|$|R
