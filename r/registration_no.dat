25|$|Bose's {{arrest and}} {{subsequent}} release {{set the scene}} for his escape to Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Road house in Calcutta about 01:25AM on 17 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose in a German-made Wanderer W24 Sedan car, which would take him to Gomoh Railway Station in then state of Bihar, India. The car (<b>Registration</b> <b>No.</b> BLA 7169) was bought by Subhash Chandra Bose's elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose in 1937. The car is now on display at his Elgin Road home in Calcutta, India.|$|E

2500|$|Test pilot Reuben Snodgrass {{flew the}} prototype, <b>registration</b> <b>No.</b> NX90850, {{for the first}} time on November 15, 1947. On November 18, 1947, while on a one-hour {{demonstration}} flight, it made a low fuel forced landing near San Diego, California destroying the car body and damaging the wing. [...] The pilot, who escaped with minor injuries, reportedly took off with little or no aviation fuel aboard. [...] Although the fuel gauge he had visually checked during the pre-flight check indicated that the tank was full, it was the automobile's fuel gauge, not the aircraft's gauge. Using the same wing and another car body, the second prototype flew again on January 29, 1948 piloted by W.G. Griswold, but enthusiasm for the project waned and Convair cancelled the program. The rights reverted to Hall, who formed T.R Hall Engineering Corp., but the Model 118 in its new incarnation never achieved production status.|$|E

"As much cry as {{the other}} fellows," [...] said Mr Tadpole; [...] "but no one of course would think of {{dissolution}} before the next <b>registration.</b> <b>No,</b> no; {{this is a very}} manageable Parliament, depend upon it. The malcontent radicals who have turned them out are not going to bring them in. That makes us equal. Then we have an important section to work upon--the Sneaks, the men who are afraid of a dissolution. I will be bound we make a good working conservative majority of five-and-twenty out of the sneaks." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{due time}} {{the coast of}} Leaplow made its appearance, close under our {{larboard}} bow. So sudden was our arrival in this novel and extraordinary country, that we were very near running on it, before we {{got a glimpse of}} its shores. The seamanship of Captain Poke, however, stood us in hand; and, by the aid of a very clever pilot, we were soon safely moored in the harbor of Bivouac. In this happy land, there was no <b>registration,</b> <b>no</b> passports, [...] "no nothin'"--as Mr. Poke pointedly expressed it. The formalities were soon observed, although I had occasion to remark, how much easier, after all, it is to get along in this world with vice than with virtue. A bribe offered to a custom-house officer was refused; and the only trouble I had, on the occasion, arose from this awkward obtrusion of a conscience. However, the difficulty was overcome, though not quite as easily as if douceurs had happened to be in fashion; and we were permitted to land with all our necessary effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} of registration {{as a separate}} bureaucratic step can result in higher voter turnout. This is reflected in statistics from the United States Bureau of Census, 19821983. States that have same day <b>registration,</b> or <b>no</b> <b>registration</b> requirements, have a higher voter turnout than the national average. At the time of that report, the four states that allowed election day registration were Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maine, and Oregon. Since then, Idaho and Maine have changed to allow same day registration. North Dakota {{is the only state}} that requires <b>no</b> <b>registration.</b>|$|R
