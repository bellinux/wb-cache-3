5|$|The {{original}} pilot remained unaired, {{although some}} footage {{from the original}} pilot {{was used in the}} first aired episode.

5|$|On 12 January 2016, Alton Towers {{announced}} that Air would be re-themed as Galactica for the 2016 season and would include on-ride virtual reality headsets simulating a <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> the cosmos.

The virtual reality experience is optional, as guests can choose to ride without using the headsets. A promotional website was also released explaining {{more information about the}} ride and its new storyline. In late February 2016, the park {{announced that}} the official opening date would be 24 March 2016.|$|E

5|$|The coaster's seven trains {{double the}} {{capacity}} of the traditional El Loco ride from 4 seats per train to 8 seats per train. The trains are articulated {{in such a way that}} the first row of four riders moves independently from the second row. Each seat features a pair of stereo speakers in the head rest. These speakers are capable of playing multiple tracks for up to 9 minutes on a single charge. Riders are harnessed to the <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> the use of lap bars. The front of each car features a pulsing LED Green Lantern logo while the back of each car features the Green Lantern oath. All of these operational and thematic characteristics are new for this type of ride and were developed specifically for this coaster.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Muhammad Hassan (managed by Daivari). During Hassan's entrance, men in masks {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} ring to represent his Arabic culture. The masked men proceeded to interfered in the match, but Undertaker retaliated and removed all of the masked men from the ring. Midway through the match, Undertaker attempted to use a Tombstone piledriver on Hassan, but Hassan escaped the move and attempted a Clothesline. The Undertaker countered by chokeslamming Hassan and scored the pinfall on Hassan to win the match. Following this, Undertaker executed a Last <b>Ride</b> <b>through</b> the stage floor on Hassan, writing him out of storylines.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, a {{moderate}} Republican, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, was elected South Carolina's governor, attracting even some Democratic votes. When Chamberlain sought re-election in 1876, Gary recruited Wade HamptonIII, a Confederate war hero {{who had moved}} out of state, to return and run for governor as a Democrat. That election campaign of 1876 was marked by violence, of which the most notorious occurrence was {{what became known as}} the Hamburg massacre. It occurred in Hamburg, South Carolina, a mostly black town across the river from Augusta, in Aiken County, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in Hamburg and two white farmers in a buggy tried to <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> its ranks. Both sides filed criminal charges against the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to Hamburg on the day of the hearing, July 8. Tillman was present, and the subsequent events were among his proudest memories.|$|E

5|$|When {{the leading}} squadrons charged {{up to the}} {{trenches}} and the redoubt, the squadron commander and about 12 troopers of 12th Light Horse Regiment, dismounted to attack with rifle and bayonet, while {{the remainder of the}} regiment continued to gallop passed the redoubt on the right, to <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> a gap in the defensive line. When the second line squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment approached the trenches and redoubt, most of the squadron continued mounted riding through the gap. However, as both squadron commanders had dismounted to fight in the trenches and earthworks, the troopers who continued mounted were led by Captains Robey and Davies. These leading troops stopped to assemble at a point near where the road from Asluj crossed the Wadi Saba, behind the main Ottoman defences. When Robey and Davies mounted troopers were reorganised, they rode along the Asluj road into Beersheba in force, to capture the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1260s, John {{returned}} to Europe, {{and there is}} evidence of his activity in Macedonia and Thessaly. He had estates in the valley of the river Strymon in Macedonia, and is attested in documents concerning the properties of monasteries in eastern Thessaly, which the Byzantines had probably recovered by that time, following the death of Michael II of Epirus in 1267/1268. John Doukas of Thessaly, however, remained one of the Empire's chief opponents, and Michael Palaiologos organized a campaign (variously dated to 1272/1273 or 1274/1275) to finally subdue him. It was a large-scale undertaking: an army of some 30,000 men, mostly mercenaries, was placed under the command of John Palaiologos and Alexios Kaballarios, while the land forces were to be aided by a fleet of over 70 vessels under Alexios Philanthropenos. The campaign was initially crowned with success, as the Byzantine army advanced quickly through Thessaly and besieged John Doukas at his capital Neopatras. The latter, however, was able to escape in secret, procure aid from the Duchy of Athens, and utterly defeat the besieging Byzantine army at the Battle of Neopatras. With his forces scattered, John Palaiologos retreated to the north; on his way, he learned of an attack by the Latin fleet on the Byzantine navy at Demetrias. Assembling whatever men he could find, the despotes led his troops in a forty-mile <b>ride,</b> <b>through</b> the night, towards Demetrias. There they encountered the battle in full swing, and the Latins having the advantage. The arrival of fresh troops, however, tilted the balance, and the battle ended in a crushing Byzantine victory.|$|E
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Sharon {{began on}} 19 September with a Western Front style {{bombardment}} during which {{two thirds of}} the mainly ground based heavy artillery, supported by the firepower of two destroyers pounded Ottoman positions, while one third of the heavy artillery fired creeping barrages to cover the infantry assaults. The XXI Corps infantry attacked simultaneously along the front line from the Mediterranean coast where the 60th Division, launched an attack on the western coastal section of the front line defended by the Eighth Army's XXII Corps. During this Battle of Tulkarm the 60th Division breached the front and second line trenches to eventually capture Tulkarm, the site of the Eighth Army headquarters. On their right, the main Tabsor system of trenches held by the Ottoman XXII Corps was attacked and eventually captured during the Battle of Tabsor, by the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut), and the 75th Divisions. These three divisions subsequently advanced, despite the Ottoman XXII Corps being reinforced, to capture Et Tire and Masudiye Station. In the process of the battles for Tulkarm and Tabsor the 7th (Meerut) and 60th Divisions created a gap in the front line, for the Desert Mounted Corps to <b>ride</b> <b>through.</b> They rode north and eastwards to the rear to capture the defending Ottoman armies' lines of communication. The right flank of the attacking XXI Corps was protected from the Eighth Army's Asia Corps, by the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the French Colonial Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie holding and pivoting on the Rafat salient, during the Battle of Arara as the infantry battle progressed.|$|E
