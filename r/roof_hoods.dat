50|$|The palace {{is located}} in a large park and stands on a square plan much like Schloss Johannisburg at Aschaffenburg. The four corner pavilions are topped by squat {{octagonal}} towers with prominent slate <b>roof</b> <b>hoods</b> featuring pierced ball ornaments. The facades are heavily segmented by large windows (with triangular gables on the ground floor and arches on the upper floor). Each row of windows is supported by a cornice. The inner court features two small clock towers and an arcade that surrounds it on the ground floor on all four sides.|$|E
50|$|Cohoes Music Hall, 58 Remsen Street. The one {{outstanding}} Second Empire {{building in}} the district, dating to 1874 and listed on the National Register {{in its own right}} in 1971. Four-story brick building with mansard <b>roof,</b> <b>hood</b> moldings, stone courses and marble storefront {{is one of the most}} ornate and best-preserved commercial facades in the district.|$|R
50|$|In Vädersolstavlan from 1535 two south towers (Södertorn), {{which appear}} to have been {{semi-circular}} in shape, were reported. The inner (north) tower was re-erected in 1524 after the it had collapsed the previous year. The outer (southern) tower originally had a <b>roof</b> <b>hood.</b> In 1637 the inner and outer Söderport were described, the latter {{to make way for the}} first lock, known as the Drottning Kristinas sluss (Queen Kristinas gate), which opened in 1642.|$|R

Core Molding Technologies mainly produced fiber reinforced plastics and plastic composites such as shielding, vehicle <b>roofs,</b> <b>hoods</b> and so on. Besides, {{it also provides}} services for manufacturing and product development, such as custom material formulations, composite mold construction, design for manufacturability and so on.Next Generation Product Released: Core Molding Technologies' Featherlite® SMC Production Reaches 10,000,000 lbs.|$|R
5000|$|The three Chargers, {{wearing a}} color scheme of red body sides and white <b>roof,</b> <b>hood,</b> and trunk, with two blue longitunal stripes, [...] were driven by Jimmy Nix, who {{previously}} ran a Top Gas dragster; Jim Johnson, {{who ran a}} Dodge Polara stocker, and who had won the B/SA title in 1963; Jim Nelson; and Dode Martin. (Nix tried to persuade Chrisman to get Mercury Racing Director Fran Hernandez {{to allow him to}} run his Comet's 427 on nitro, as a way to gain leverage on NHRA, so Nix could use nitro himself).|$|R
5000|$|At the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, Lancia debuted Ypsilon Diamond concept cars, which {{anticipated}} {{the release of}} a luxury model. The Diamond features two-tone paint with a top layer called [...] "eco-chrome" [...] covering pillars, <b>roof,</b> <b>hood</b> and mirrors. The lower part of the body is painted in Chiffon Blanc (a particular kind of white). The interior is fully lined in leather and Alcantara with two-tone seats covered in Galuchat black bronze leather. Head restraints display the Y logo. The outside of the seats, dashboard and some door details are covered with Nubuck light-colored leather with shift knob made of transparent acrylic to get the diamond effect. The Ypsilon Diamond has remained a concept car only.|$|R
25|$|Carbon fiber {{is used on}} the <b>roof,</b> <b>hood,</b> fenders, front {{splitter}}, and rocker moldings; {{the hood}} and fenders are painted over, while the roof and splitter are merely covered in a clear-coat, retaining their black color. A polycarbonate window {{is placed in the}} center of the hood, allowing the engine intercooler to be seen from the exterior. The wheels are the largest ever placed on a production Corvette, with both front and rear wheels increasing in size and diameter over the Corvette Z06. Carbon-ceramic brakes are included. The brake calipers are painted blue, as are the engine intercooler trim and the ZR1 logo. Magnetic Selective Ride Control is also included on the car, with sensors to automatically adjust stiffness levels based on road conditions and vehicle movement.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with most}} {{successful}} racers, Yunick {{was a master}} of the [...] straddling the rules. Perhaps his most famous exploit was his #13 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle, driven by Curtis Turner. The car was so much faster than the competition during testing that they were certain that cheating was involved; some sort of aerodynamic enhancement was strongly suspected, but the car's profile seemed to be entirely stock, as the rules required. It was eventually discovered that Yunick had lowered and modified the roof and windows and raised the floor (to lower the body) of the production car, essentially producing a 7/8 scale car. Since then, NASCAR required each race car's <b>roof,</b> <b>hood,</b> and trunk to fit templates representing the production car's exact profile.|$|R
50|$|The Audi Sport quattro {{concept was}} {{unveiled}} at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show {{to commemorate the}} 30th anniversary of the original Audi Sport quattro. The show car features angular flat C-pillars, {{as well as the}} rectangular double headlights featuring Audi's Matrix LED technology, a spoiler at the lower edge of the rear window, rectangular tail lights, 21-inch wheels, carbon fiber-ceramic brake discs, bucket seats with integrated head restraints, multifunction sport steering wheel, two driving modes (race and setup) in virtual 3D displays, Audi MMI control unit, and air conditioning. The doors and fenders are aluminum, while the <b>roof,</b> <b>hood,</b> and the rear hatch are made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer. The front suspension features five control arms per wheel while the rear has track-controlled trapezoidal link.|$|R
25|$|The Regal {{utilizes}} unibody construction with {{galvanized steel}} front fenders, <b>hood,</b> <b>roof</b> and door panels and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) bumper covers.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{lowering}} {{the centre of}} gravity will always help the handling (as well as reduce the chance of roll-over). This {{can be done to}} some extent by using plastic windows (or none) and light <b>roof,</b> <b>hood</b> (bonnet) and boot (trunk) lid materials, by reducing the ground clearance, etc. Increasing the track with [...] "reversed" [...] wheels will have a similar effect, but remember that the wider the car the less spare room it has on the road and the farther you may have to swerve to miss an obstacle. Stiffer springs and/or shocks, both front and rear, will generally improve handling, at the expense of comfort on small bumps. Performance suspension kits are available. Light alloy (mostly aluminium or magnesium) wheels improve handling and ride as well as appearance.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of rooms with windows opening through {{the western and}} southern facades of the house have skillion hoods. Those that do not are sheltered by the overhang of the ensuite's skillion <b>roof.</b> The <b>hoods</b> feature flat, galvanized iron roofs, timber battens to each side and carved timber brackets. All windows are double-hung sashes, except three opening off the ensuite, which are casement.|$|R

50|$|The Fouga {{aircraft}} company {{submitted a}} prototype tractor and trailer on 2 February 1939. It was tested until 8 May. This vehicle also closely resembled the Renault UE, {{but had a}} higher <b>roof,</b> making <b>hoods</b> unnecessary and enlarging the cargo space. Its suspension had two bogies per side with each two road wheels, sprung by leaf springs. The type, its submission too late because a choice had already been made for a rivalling type, was rejected because its mechanical parts were not easily accessible and the vibration level was too high.|$|R
2500|$|Being {{produced}} to {{the same}} specification, both GE/ALCO and EMD MRS-1s are very similar in appearance and can easily be mistaken; they are both C-C road-switchers that are very low in profile in order to fit within European loading gauges. [...] The major exterior differences are the peaked cab <b>roof</b> and long <b>hood</b> <b>roof</b> on the EMD locomotives, and the radiator intakes {{on the sides of}} the long hood end, which have outside shutters on the Alco locomotives. In addition, the short hood is visibly lower than the long hood, thanks to the long hood's peaked roof; on the ALCO units, the two are the same height. [...] The frame side sills are also different; the Alco's are straight from front to rear, while the EMD's step down towards each end of the locomotive.|$|R

25|$|For 1976, {{the final}} year of this generation, all Olds 88s {{received}} revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments. It was also {{the final year}} for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans, along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later. A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar, padded rear quarter vinyl <b>roof,</b> special <b>hood</b> ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, {{houses of}} the Tudor Revival style, such as the {{building}} above on the right, are found across Cedarcroft. Houses such as these contained elements {{from a variety of}} styles popular throughout the 1920s and 30s. In this stucco-exterior finished sample the slate <b>roof,</b> and half-round <b>hood</b> over the front door, are an homage to cottages found in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} Group 5 cars, the Celica {{received}} extensive {{modifications to the}} bodywork, which was re-styled and built from lightweight fiberglass. Only the <b>hood,</b> <b>roof,</b> doors and rail panel were retained from the stock model. The Celica's distinctive features are its wider body sills in front of and behind the door panel and sloping nose beyond the bonnet, which encases the double headlamps and square grille.|$|R
50|$|The 1093 was {{a factory}} racing model limited edition of 2,140 homologated, which were tuned to 55 hp (41 kW) and {{featured}} a twin-barrel carburettor, rear track rods, four-speed manual transmission and tachometer, had {{a top speed}} of 140 km/h, and were produced in 1962 and 1963. All were painted white with two thin blue stripes running front to back along the <b>hood,</b> <b>roof</b> and trunk.|$|R
5000|$|According to the patent, [...] "Typically, vehicle drivers and/or {{passengers}} place objects on, for example, the <b>roof</b> or <b>hood</b> {{of their}} vehicle. Often, the driver and/or passengers forget {{that they have}} placed the objects there, and proceed to enter the car and drive away. The objects are usually grocery or food items, or beverages such as coffee or soft drinks, etc., but may include other items. Indeed, in one reported case, a baby {{was placed on the}} top of a vehicle and the vehicle driver drove away without knowing the baby was on the roof of the vehicle. The results of this sequence of events range from the comic to the tragic." ...|$|R
50|$|The amplified model {{includes}} high-gloss black roof line, S line roof spoiler, {{exterior mirror}} housings and single-frame grille; 17-inch alloy wheels in five-arm design with black inserts, a matt transparent film for the engine <b>hood,</b> <b>roof</b> and rear hatch; air vent sleeves {{in the body}} color, black sport seats with stitching in Parade Red (amplified red) or Rock Gray (amplified white), floor mats with piping in matching colors.|$|R
50|$|Players have a {{wide variety}} of decals, vinyls, and paint colors, all very similar to the {{previous}} games in the series. Additional extras have been added as well. Players have a huge variety of body modifications, such as rims, hoods, body kits, exhaust tips, spoilers and roof scoops.The Autosculpt feature, which was first introduced in Need for Speed: Carbon, is featured in ProStreet and plays a significant role in terms of car performance. Although there are more parts to autosculpt in the car, the autosculpting method is {{for the most part the}} same. The <b>hood,</b> <b>roof</b> scoop, front bumper and spoiler can all change how a car performs in a race. Autosculpt can affect everything, from a car's handling to its downforce. ProStreet now allows you to modify stock and wide body kits as well as <b>hoods,</b> <b>roof</b> scoops, wheels, spoilers etc. A new feature called the Windtunnel is introduced on the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game. It is not available on Wii and PlayStation 2 versions. The Windtunnel, along with Autosculpt, can affect a car's performance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{researches}} {{of automotive}} companies {{have focused on}} reducing weight of vehicles {{in order to meet}} the needs for high fuel efficiency. Therefore, light metals such aluminum alloys have been applied on automotive body structures. Recently, roller hemming process has been introduced for hemming of aluminum automotive closing parts such as doors, <b>roofs,</b> and <b>hoods.</b> During Roller hemming, the flange of outer panels is bent and folded along the edge of inner panel by a roller attached robot. Since the stress caused by roller hemming can affect the quality of hemmed flanges, the research has focused on the stress analysis by simulation and experiment. Residual stress has been measured in the hemmed flanges and compared to the values of finite elemental analysis...|$|R
