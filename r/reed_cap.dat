50|$|The Basque alboka (albogue), is a single-reed woodwind {{instrument}} {{consisting of}} a single reed, two small diameter melody pipes with finger holes and a bell traditionally made from animal horn. Additionally, a <b>reed</b> <b>cap</b> of animal horn is placed around the reed to contain the breath and allow circular breathing for constant play.|$|E
50|$|Double reeds {{are used}} on the oboe, oboe d'amore, English horn, bass oboe, Heckelphone, bassoon, contrabassoon, sarrusophone, shawm, bagpipes, nadaswaram and shehnai. They are {{typically}} not {{used in conjunction with}} a mouthpiece; rather the two reeds vibrate against each other. However, {{in the case of the}} crumhorn, bagpipes, and Rauschpfeife, a <b>reed</b> <b>cap</b> that contains an airway is placed over the reeds and blown without the reeds actually coming in contact with the player's mouth. Reed strengths are graded from hard to soft.|$|E
5000|$|Hornpipes {{are made}} of a single reed, a small {{diameter}} melody pipe with fingerholes, and a bell traditionally made of animal horn. An animal horn <b>reed</b> <b>cap</b> usually encompasses the idioglot reed. These instruments are descended from single-reed idioglot instruments found in Egypt as early as 2700 BCE. [...] During the Old Kingdom in Egypt (2778-2723 BCE), memets were depicted on the reliefs of seven tombs at Saqqarra, six tombs at Giza, and the pyramids of Queen Khentkaus. [...] Horns were later added to the reed pipe to increase resonance. Horn caps were also added around the reed, and the player would blow into the hornpipe to activate the reed instead of holding it in their mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Clothing was {{generally}} lacking for men. Women wore deer hide aprons and <b>reed</b> <b>caps.</b> Both sexes wore agave fiber sandals. Rabbitskin blankets provided warmth, and human hair capes {{were used in}} ceremonies. Cradles were used to transport infants.|$|R
50|$|De Schoolmeester is a six-sided smock mill with a stage, {{built on}} a two-storey base. The stage is 3.80 m above ground level. The mill itself is at the centre of a long range of drying sheds of green painted {{weatherboard}} under a pantile roof. The mill and cap are thatched with <b>reeds.</b> The <b>cap</b> is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four common sails drive the various items of paper making machinery. There are three Hollander beaters. The sails on the inner stock span 20.50 m and the sails on the outer stock span 20.70 m. They are carried on a cast-iron windshaft which was cast by Leiden millwrights D A Schrettlen & Co in 1860.|$|R
50|$|The kortholt is a <b>capped</b> <b>reed</b> instrument. Its {{construction}} {{is similar to}} that of the chanter of a bagpipe. A double reed is mounted inside a chamber. Blowing through a slot in the chamber causes the reed to vibrate; because the reed is not touched by the lips, the performer has little control over the sound. The pitch of the note can be varied by opening or closing finger and side holes along the length of the instrument.|$|R
5000|$|The hornpipe {{can refer}} to a {{specific}} instrument or a class of woodwind instruments consisting of a single reed, a small diameter melody pipe with finger holes and a bell traditionally made from animal horn. Additionally, a <b>reed</b> <b>cap</b> of animal horn may be placed around the reed to contain the breath and allow circular breathing for constant play, although {{in many cases the}} reed is placed directly in the mouth. It was also known as the pibcorn, pibgorn, or piccorn. One rare Scottish example, called the stock-and-horn, is referred to by Robert Burns among others. Other hornpipes include the Spanish gaita gastoreña, the Basque alboka and the Eastern European zhaleika. When joined with a bag, Baines refers to the instruments as [...] "bag-hornpipes".|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} gravely damaged in the 1802 Vrancea earthquake, {{demolished}} in late 1804 and completely rebuilt in 1807. It was repaired in 1862, 1938, 1976 and 1990. The bell tower dates to 1786, a conclusion {{drawn from the}} presence of Alexandru Mavrocordat Firaris' coat of arms. A date of 1757 has also been proposed, coinciding with the surrounding wall built by Racoviță. It is shaped like the <b>reed</b> <b>cap</b> worn by Saint Spyridon; at first resembling a Russian onion dome, the present shape was fixed in 1862. Initially, its tip featured a crescent, the idea being to offer a certain protection against Ottoman attacks. In 1807, when the structure was rebuilt, this was replaced by an eye within a triangle, a symbol of divinity. The Parisian clock was added after 1830, in line with an express provision of Regulamentul Organic. The roof's current form also dates to 1862. Twin fountains, inscribed in Greek, Ottoman Turkish and Romanian Cyrillic, were added by Grigore III Ghica in 1765; the water flowed along a tiled path from {{what is now the}} Botanical Garden.|$|E
5000|$|The names {{associated}} in {{the period}} with the extant museum capped shawms are variants of the word [...] "Schreierpfeife" [...] (German for [...] "shrieking pipe".) Michael Praetorius in Syntagma musicum II (1619) gives [...] "Schreyerpfeiffen" [...] as the German word for Schryari, which, judging by his description, ranges and illustration, were cylindrical bore instruments something akin to loud cornamusen. It would appear then that the term [...] "Schreierpfeife" [...] {{may have been used}} variously for the two types of loud <b>capped</b> <b>reed</b> instruments.|$|R
5000|$|Double-reed {{instruments}} use two precisely cut, {{small pieces}} of cane bound together at the base. This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery {{has been attributed to}} the observation of wind blowing through a split rush. The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well). [...] This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub-families: exposed double <b>reed,</b> and <b>capped</b> double <b>reed</b> instruments. [...] Exposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player's lips. This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn) and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.|$|R
50|$|The crumhorn is a <b>capped</b> <b>reed</b> instrument. Its {{construction}} {{is similar to}} that of the chanter of a bagpipe. A double reed is mounted inside a long windcap. Blowing through a slot in the windcap produces a musical note. The pitch of the note can be varied by opening or closing finger holes along the length of the pipe. One unusual feature of the crumhorn is its shape; the end is bent upwards in a curve resembling the letter 'J'. The curve is decorative only and does not influence the sound.|$|R
5000|$|The Children of Peace {{rejected}} the [...] "plain style" [...] of Quaker architecture {{and built a}} series of ornate meeting places designed to [...] "ornament the Christian Church with all the glory of Israel". The building most clearly associated with this imagery is the Temple, built over a seven-year period in imitation of Solomon's Temple, and the New Jerusalem described in Revelations 21. The Temple is three storeys tall and measures 60 feet square by 75 feet high. The building is of timber frame construction, held together with mortice and tenon joints. It is square, and each side symmetrical, with tall centred double doors on each side to [...] "allow all to enter on an equal footing". [...] On {{either side of the}} door are three tall, sliding sash windows; there are 3 more per side on the second storey, and one on the third. At each of the building's twelve corners is a square lantern (carved out of a single block of wood) surmounted by four green finials. From the top four lanterns hangs a golden ball, with the word Peace inscribed on it. A <b>reeded</b> frieze <b>caps</b> each storey, and the four corners are tall, reeded quarter columns.|$|R
50|$|Auburn's offense ran {{all over}} Missouri {{in a back}} and forth ball game, until Mizzou {{ran out of gas}} in the 4th Qtr. Auburn ran for a SEC Title game record of 536 yrds on the ground. RB Tre Mason set all rushing records with 304 yrds on 46 touches with 4 touchdowns. QB Nick Marshall added 101 yrds on the ground. Auburn opened the game with the ball but after a 1st down Marshall was {{stripped}} by Kony Ealy setting up Mizzou to go up 3-0. Auburn came right back quickly with a 38-yard strike to WR Sammie Coates for a TD. Missouri would answer with a 28 yd strike to Dorial Green-Beckham; a catch that was dropped but Auburn never challenged. Auburn quickly answered after a 54-yard jailbreak screen to Sammie Coates and a 9 yrd Marshall TD run. Kony Ealy would strip Marshall again and CB E.J. Gaines would return the fumble for a TD to go up 17-14. Auburn marched right down the field and scored on a 7-yard run by Mason. Missouri would kick a field goal to make it 21-20. But Mason took off for a 52-yard run and finished up the scoring drive with a 3 yd run. Missouri would strike right before the half, as Green-Beckham got loose to make it 28-27. Missouri would take 34-31 lead in the 3rd Qtr., but then Auburn took over the game by outscoring them 28-8. Corey Grant would score on an 8-yard run after a 42-yard run by Marshall. Auburn's defense forced a 3-and-out, and Cameron Artis-Payne would score on a 15 yd run. Missouri scored quickly after a 65 yd run by Henry Josey and completed the two point conversion to make it 45-42. Auburn struck quickly again with a 43-yard run by Grant and 23 yd pass to Trovon <b>Reed</b> that was <b>capped</b> by 1 yd TD run by Mason. Mason's final TD run would put the game on ice, 59-42. Later that night Michigan St defeated Ohio State making it possible for Auburn to play Florida State for the National Title. Auburn was the lowest rated pre-season team to ever make it to the title. They were not even in the top 50 and many pundits said they would only win 4 to 6 games.|$|R
