5|$|After {{winning the}} coin toss, Alabama elected {{to receive the}} ball to open the first half. Marquis Maze fielded the James Hairston kickoff and {{returned}} it to the Alabama 30-yard line where the offense began its first series. Alabama opened {{with a pair of}} gains by Trent Richardson on an 18-yard run and on a 22-yard pass reception from AJ McCarron to reach the LSU 30-yard line. However, the drive stalled on the next three plays, and on fourth down Cade Foster missed a 44-yard field goal wide <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> game remained tied at zero. The Tigers began their first offensive series with Jarrett Lee at quarterback from their own 27-yard line.

5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights to the <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced {{to remain on the}} defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E
5|$|By 1139, an {{invasion}} of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent {{the beginning of the}} year mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal claim to the English throne on the grounds of her hereditary <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> oaths sworn by the barons. Arnulf of Lisieux led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother had really been a nun, her claim to the throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.|$|E

5|$|By December 1944 {{the brigade}} was {{preparing}} for Christmas leave, when news of the German offensive in the Ardennes broke. As part of the First Allied Airborne Army, 6th Airborne Division was available {{as a component of}} the strategic reserve for the Allied forces in northwest Europe. The other two divisions available in reserve, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne, were already at Rheims in northern France, and the 6th Airborne was sent by sea to Belgium to assist the defence. With 29 German and 33 Allied divisions involved, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest single battle on the Western Front during the war. On Christmas Day the division moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance; by Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur. The 3rd Parachute Brigade were on the left, 5th Parachute Brigade on the <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 6th Airlanding Brigade in reserve. By the time they arrived in position the German advance had faltered.|$|E
5|$|Count Horn {{directed}} the Prince of Holstein-Beck {{to take the}} village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action. The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn {{up in front of}} Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} attack, only the Canadians {{on the extreme}} <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Australian Brigade on the extreme left were able to capture and hold their set objectives. Over {{the course of the}} next three days, severe {{fighting}} took place and further troops were drawn in to hold and extend the gains of 3 May. On 6 May, the Germans launched a counter-attack which forced the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from their trenches; it was during this engagement that Howell was to perform the act which was to earn him the Victoria Cross.|$|E

The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, Groningen, Nijmegen and Utrecht have instituted stadsdelen as well, although they do not have the same legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are subdivided into districts (wijken), which in turn are subdivided into neighbourhoods (buurten). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status. , the municipalities in the Netherlands were subdivided into 2,621 districts and 11,896 neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put the Bills back in front, 19–17.
