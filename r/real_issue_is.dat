5|$|The <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> that {{it moves}} the moral center more towards the obscene. That {{it becomes more}} normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> that people who drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{has been}} leveled against Finkelstein from several angles. The first sources are {{responses}} from those whose work Finkelstein has discussed. Daniel Goldhagen, whose book Hitler's Willing Executioners Finkelstein criticized, claimed his scholarship has [...] "everything {{to do with}} his burning political agenda". Alan Dershowitz has written that Peter Novick, Professor of History at the University of Chicago and a noted Holocaust historian whose work Finkelstein says inspired The Holocaust Industry, has strongly criticized the latter's work, describing it as [...] "trash". Similarly, Dershowitz, whose book The Case for Israel and Finkelstein's response Beyond Chutzpah sparked an ongoing feud between the two, has claimed Finkelstein's complicity in a conspiracy against pro-Israel scholars: [...] "The mode of attack is consistent. Chomsky selects the target and directs Finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn't actually write the work, that it is plagiarized, that it is a hoax and a fraud," [...] arguing that Finkelstein has leveled charges against many academics, calling at least 10 [...] "distinguished Jews 'hucksters', 'hoaxters' (sic), 'thieves', 'extortionists', and worse." [...] Although the back and forth between Finkelstein and Dershowitz received the most attention and attracted significant controversy, Finkelstein has maintained that [...] "the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> Israel's human rights record." ...|$|E

Leia Calderon of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave it four-out-of-five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Bendis and Coipel's Civil War II #0 serves {{the sole purpose}} of laying out the foundation for the series. Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But {{the good news is that}} this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you might expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E

[...] He was critical of the similarity of the gameplay to the first game; [...] "there is still all of the dungeon crawling action that has worked well {{in the past and}} still works here, but there's still not enough that's new to truly keep pushing the genre forward. There could be more weapons and more characters, but the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> that the world is still a fairly linear adventure with a steady pace towards the end." ...|$|E

[...] Mr Howard said he was opposed to the death penalty, but could not govern what another country did. Howard stated that the death penalty is not the issue of significance.

Consequently, the ASL boycotted the 1925 Challenge Cup due to scheduling conflicts, and the lack of cooperation the USFA inflicted on the ASL.

2500|$|In 2015, Tasmanian Archbishop Julius Porteous {{distributed}} {{a booklet}} outlining the Catholic Church's position on marriage, titled [...] "Don't mess with Marriage". It encouraged parents to lobby parliamentarians against same-sex marriage. An application {{was made by}} Martine Delaney, a Hobart transgender activist and Greens candidate, to Tasmania’s Anti-Discrimination Commission over the booklet. John Roskam, writing in the Australian Financial Review has said, [...] "A vote in a plebiscite or referendum, in which one side {{is not allowed to}} present its case, is not a legitimate vote. That's why both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage should be concerned by the complaint against Archbishop Porteous and the Catholic Church. Freedom of speech is fundamental to liberal democracy. Freedom of speech confers legitimacy on political outcomes". [...] The Anti-Discrimination Commission subsequently upheld the complaint. Senator Eric Abetz said that the church’s right to [...] "teach its flock" [...] its beliefs on marriage were being [...] "shut down". Janet Albrechtsen, writing in The Australian says, [...] "This is not one of those thorny cases of conflicting rights where you have to come down on one side or another. It’s not a case of either supporting same-sex marriage or supporting free speech. Here you have the luxury of both. [...] This is not about defending the Catholic bishops. The <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the emergence of yet another orthodoxy that is strangling free speech".|$|E
2500|$|Many experts {{disagree}} with Kramer's assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell, John Barrett, Joe McCauley, Ted Schroeder, and Tony Trabert rank Laver {{as the best}} of all time. Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, [...] "You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver's the best player of all time." [...] Trabert said in January 2008, [...] "I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he's done something no one has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro. If someone in some other sport held a world record no one else had, you would say that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you've got to say Laver is the best player of all time." [...] Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, [...] "Give him credit? Shoot, the only <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> whether the GOAT [...] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own." [...] Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era (22 in 1962), during the touring pro era (19 in 1967), and during the Open Era (18 in 1969). After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, Laver won a [...] "Professional Grand Slam" [...] by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship, and the Wimbledon Pro.|$|E
6000|$|In {{those first}} months of the war there was, we were told, in England and France a revival of [...] "religion," [...] and indeed many of the books then written gave {{evidence}} of having been composed in exalted, mystic moods. I remember one in particular, called [...] "En Campagne," [...] by a young French officer. And then, somehow, the note of mystic exaltation died away, to be succeeded by a period of realism. Read [...] "Le Feu," [...] which is most typical, which has sold in numberless editions. Here {{is a picture of}} that other aspect--the grimness, the monotony, and the frequent bestiality of trench life, the horror of slaughtering millions of men by highly specialized machinery. And yet, as an American, I strike inevitably the note of optimism once more. Even now the truer spiritual goal is glimpsed through the battle clouds, and has been hailed in world-reverberating phrases by our American President. Day by day the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> clearer, while the [...] "religion" [...] it implies embraces not one nation, wills not one patriotism, but humanity itself. I heard a Frenchwoman who had been deeply [...] "religious" [...] in the old sense exclaim: [...] "I no longer have any faith in God; he {{is on the side of}} the Germans." [...] When the war began there were many evidences of a survival of that faith that God fights for nations, interferes in behalf of the [...] "righteous" [...] cause. When General Joffre was in America he was asked by one of our countrywomen how the battle of the Marne was won. [...] "Madame," [...] he is reported to have said, [...] "it was won by me, by my generals and soldiers." [...] The tendency to regard this victory, which we hope saved France and the Western humanitarian civilization we cherish, as a special interposition of Providence, as a miracle, has given place to the realization that the battle was won by the resourcefulness, science, and coolness of the French commander-in-chief. Science preserves armies, since killing, if it has to be done, is now wholly within that realm; science heals the wounded, transports them rapidly to the hospitals, gives the shattered something still to live for; and, if we are able to abandon the sentimental view and look facts in the face--as many anointed chaplains in Europe are doing--science not only eliminates typhoid but is able to prevent those terrible diseases that devastate armies and nations. And science is no longer confined to the physical but has invaded the social kingdom, is able to weave a juster fabric into the government of peoples. On all sides we are beginning to embrace the religion of self-reliance, a faith that God is on the side of intelligence--intelligence with a broader meaning than the Germans have given it, for it includes charity.|$|E
