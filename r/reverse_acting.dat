The dimeric wild-type repressor (TetR) binds to tet operator tetO in the absence of the inducer anhydrotetracycline (atc) to confer tight repression. We have isolated the revTetR G 96 E L 205 S mutant, which, contrary to TetR, binds tetO only in the presence of atc. This <b>reverse</b> <b>acting</b> mutant was overproduced and purified. Effector and DNA binding properties were analyzed by EMSA and quantified by fluorescence titration and surface plasmon resonance. The association constant KA of revTetR for binding of [atcMg]+ is ∼ 108 M– 1, four orders of magnitude lower than that of TetR. The affinity of TetR for tetO is 5. 6 ± 2 × 109 M– 1 and that for revTetR in the presence of atc is 1 ± 0. 2 × 108 M– 1.

The binding of substrates for the forward (glycolytic) and the reverse (gluconeogenic) reaction is random order, and occurs with only weak {{competition between the}} substrate pair fructose- 6 -phosphate and pyrophosphate, and between the substrate pair fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate and phosphate.

Our work shows that hydrogen bromide and molecular bromine act differently as inhibitors in flames. For HBr, the reaction HBr + H = H 2 + Br (R 2) is rapidly equilibrated, depleting HBr in favor of atomic Br, which is the major bromine species throughout the reaction zone.

In Br 2 -doped flames, the reaction Br 2 + H = HBr + Br (R 9) is far from equilibrationand serves to deplete H in the reaction zone by competing with H + O 2 =O + OH.

Using RNA SELEX and bioinformatics we identified multiple regions in the pre-genomic RNA with high-affinity for Cp dimers. These RNAs form stem-loops with a conserved loop motif that trigger sequencespecific assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) at much higher fidelity and yield than {{in the absence of}} RNA.

Asymmetric cryo-EM reconstruction of the T= 4 VLPs assembled in the presence of one of the RNAs reveals a unique internal feature connected to the main Cp shell via lobes of density.

These findings suggest a role for L 1 ORF 1 p in mediating nucleic acid strand transfer steps during L 1 reverse transcription. LINE- 1, or L 1, is an abundant long interspersed nuclear element that has amplified to a high copy number in mamma-lian genomes by retrotransposition. In humans and mice fo...|$|R
40|$|Biological sulfate {{reduction}} {{is a process}} with high environmental significance due to its major contribution to the carbon and sulfur cycles in anaerobic environments. However, the respiratory chain of sulfate-reducing bacteria is still poorly understood. Here we describe a new respiratory complex that was isolated as a major protein present in the membranes of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. The complex, which was named Qrc, is the first representative of a new family of redox complexes. It has three subunits related to the complex iron-sulfur molybdoenzyme family and a multiheme cytochrome c and binds six hemes c, one [3 Fe- 4 S]+ 1 / 0 cluster, and several interacting [4 Fe- 4 S] 2 +/ 1 + clusters but no molybdenum. Qrc {{is related to the}} alternative complex III, and we show that it has the <b>reverse</b> catalytic activity, <b>acting</b> as a Type I cytochrome c 3 :menaquinone oxidoreductase. The qrc genes are found in the genomes of deltaproteobacterial sulfate reducers, which have periplasmic hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases that lack a membrane subunit for reduction of the quinone pool. In these organisms, Qrc acts as a menaquinone reductase with electrons from periplasmic hydrogen or formate oxidation. Binding of a menaquinone analogue affects the EPR spectrum of the [3 Fe- 4 S]+ 1 / 0 cluster, indicating the presence of a quinone-binding site close to the periplasmic subunits. Qrc is the first respiratory complex from sulfate reducers to have its physiological function clearly elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Phosphonoformate (foscarnet) is a {{pyrophosphate}} (PPi) analogue and {{a potent}} inhibitor of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>reverse</b> transcriptase (RT), <b>acting</b> through the PPi binding site on the enzyme. HIV- 1 RT can unblock a chain-terminated DNA primer by phosphorolytic transfer of the terminal residue to an acceptor substrate (PPi or a nucleotide such as ATP) which also interacts with the PPi binding site. Primer-unblocking activity is increased in mutants of HIV- 1 that are resistant to the chain-terminating nucleoside inhibitor 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (AZT). We have compared the primer-unblocking activity for HIV- 1 RT containing various foscarnet resistance mutations (K 65 R, W 88 G, W 88 S, E 89 K, S 117 T, Q 161 L, M 164 I, and the double mutant Q 161 L/H 208 Y) alone or in combination with AZT resistance mutations. The level of primer-unblocking activity varied over a 150 -fold range for these enzymes and was inversely correlated with foscarnet resistance and directly correlated with AZT resistance. Based on published crystal structures of HIV- 1 RT, many of the foscarnet resistance mutations affect residues that do not make {{direct contact with the}} catalytic residues of RT, the incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), or the primer-template. These mutations may confer foscarnet resistance and reduce primer unblocking by indirectly decreasing the binding and retention of foscarnet, PPi, and ATP. Alternatively, the binding position or orientation of PPi, ATP, or the primer-template may be changed in the mutant enzyme complex so that molecular interactions required for the unblocking reaction are impaired while dNTP binding and incorporation are not...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the behavior of}} an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) fed by a heat source with adaptable temperature and mass flow. For a suitable choice of working fluid, the setting of its evaporation pressure is crucial {{for the performance of}} an ORC installation. The higher the evaporation pressure, the higher the cycle efficiency on the one hand, but the lower the energy recovered from the heat source due to a higher outlet temperature on the other hand. An optimum has to be found to achieve maximum net power production. Heat source temperature profiles typical for geothermal and solar applications are simulated with an electric thermal oil boiler. An optimal control strategy, based on the installation empirical model is developed and verified on an 11 kWe ORC test rig. The installation consists of a <b>reversed</b> single-screw compressor <b>acting</b> as expander, plate heat exchangers acting as evaporator, internal heat exchanger, and condenser and a variable speed multistage centrifugal feed pump. Data acquisition and visualization are realized in a LabView application, which also includes thermodynamic parameters that cannot be measured directly, but are calculated in real time by means of thermophysical property library, Coolprop (Bell et al., 2014). The test rig can be charged with different working fluids. This paper deals with the results obtained during test runs with SES 36 (Solkatherm) and R 245 fa, which are commonly used fluids in low temperature heat recovery applications. The oil temperature at the evaporator inlet is limited to 125 °C because of the expander design: the average temperature may not exceed 120 °C and the maximum pressure is 12 bar. Subcooling caused by non-condensable gases present in the working fluid, typically the case for installations with sub-ambient pressure in the condenser (in particular Solkatherm-filled), is taken into account...|$|R
