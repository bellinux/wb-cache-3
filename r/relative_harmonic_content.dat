40|$|The {{study of}} single {{microbubble}} (MB) acoustics has relevance to signal andimage processing of ultrasound (US) contrast imaging. The {{aim of this}} work is tostudy the effect of consecutive pulses on MB response. RF backscatter data from 223 single lipid shelled Definity MBs were collected using a flow phantom and amodified Philips Sonos 5500 scanner. The results from 2 consecutive imagingpulses (1. 6 MHz, 550 kPa, 6 cycles, 1 kHz PRF) are presented and compared tosimilar results from a theoretical model of Definity (Keller-Miksis equation,Mooney-Rivlin shell model). Bubble survival in the 2 nd pulse response wasobserved for 64 % of scatterers. Surviving signals were observed to decay inamplitude and increase in <b>relative</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> with each incident pulse,with the rate of decay being dependant on the first pulse response. Signals fromMBs at resonance and above, are more resilient to the incident pulse comparedto off-resonant MBs. Resonant MBs have been observed to migrate from resonantscatter in the first pulse response to off-resonant scatter in subsequentpulses, suggesting a change in size which takes them across the resonance peak. Theoretical results confirm that realistic changes in size can account for suchdifferences, and will {{lead to an increase}} in the relative harmonic components asmeasured here. In light of these findings, the larger decay of off-resonantscatter compared to resonant scatter may offer increased performance of pulsesequences such as pulse amplitude modulation, and the order of incident pulsesin the sequence then becomes crucial. Mechanisms including acoustically-drivendiffusion and lipid shedding could be incorporated in future theoretical modelsto account for these effects. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Piezoelectric ceramic {{transducers}} (PZTs) {{are widely}} used in industry for ultrasonic applications such as cleaning, cutting, homogenization, sterilization and welding. Switching inverters are increasingly used to drive these transducers in high power applications. These transducers are non-linear loads that {{are sensitive to the}} <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the driving voltage used. Depending on the inverter topology and modulation method used, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the unfiltered output voltage can vary significantly. It is most desirable to drive tonpilz or horn ultrasonic transducers with a sinusoidal driving signal at the thickness resonance frequency of the ceramic used. Non­ sinusoidal driving signals, e. g. the unfiltered square-wave output voltage of a typical switching-inverter contain harmonics at the thickness resonance frequency as well as at and around multiples of the switching frequency. The transducers are sensitive to the <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the driving signals as unwanted mechanical modes can be excited, leading to the destruction of the transducer. This paper will show that a half-bridge and as-ceil multicell inverter topology deliver outputs with low <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> and are therefore possible switching-converter options for driving an ultrasonic transducer load without activating its destructive modes. In the case of the multicell inverter, the possible voltage unbalance of the cell capacitors will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA single bubble {{oscillating}} in a levitation cell is acoustically {{monitored by}} a piezo-ceramics microphone glued {{on the cell}} external wall. The correlation of the filtered signal recorded over distant cycles on one hand, and its <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> on the other hand, are shown to carry rich information on the bubble stability and existence. For example, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the signal is shown to increase drastically once air is fully dissociated in the bubble, and the resulting pure argon bubble enters into the upper branch of the sonoluminescence regime. As a consequence, the bubble disappearance can be unambiguously detected by a net drop in the <b>harmonic</b> <b>content.</b> On the other hand, we perturb a stable sonoluminescing bubble by approaching a micron-sized fiber. The bubble remains unperturbed until the fiber tip is approached within a critical distance, below which the bubble becomes unstable and disappears. This distance can be easily measured by image treatment, and is shown to scale roughly with 3 - 4 times the bubble maximal radius. The bubble disappearance is well detected by the drop of the microphone <b>harmonic</b> <b>content,</b> but several thousands of periods after the bubble actually disappeared. The delay is attributed to the slow extinction of higher modes of the levitation cell, excited by the bubble oscillation. The acoustic detection method should however allow the early detection and imaging of non-predictable perturbations of the bubble by foreign micron-sized objects, such as crystals or droplets...|$|R
