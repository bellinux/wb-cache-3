40|$|Abstract. Legislation usually lacks a {{systematic}} organization {{which makes the}} management and the access to norms a hard problem to face. A more analytic semantic unit of <b>reference</b> (<b>provision)</b> for legislative texts was identified. A model of provisions (provisions types and their arguments) allows to describe the semantics of rules in legislative texts. It {{can be used to}} develop advanced semantic-based applications and services on legislation. In this paper an automatic bottom-up strategy to qualify existing legislative texts in terms of provision types is described.

The library also worked with the Blind Society to provide volumes, presumably in Braille.
