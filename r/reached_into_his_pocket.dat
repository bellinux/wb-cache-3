500|$|General Prem Chand was {{particularly}} anxious about Bunche's visit. Keenly aware of this, Bunche {{did his best}} to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Prem Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and pulled out a suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, [...] "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." [...] He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, [...] "I felt that it was I, not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." ...|$|E

500|$|At Pellew's orders, British {{boarders}} clambered {{onto the}} maindeck, through the gunports of the French frigate and even jumped {{from their own}} rigging onto the French yards. Although the attackers initially encountered fierce resistance, hand-to-hand combat lasted just ten minutes before the leaderless French sailors broke and ran. Gaining the deck, the British boarding party hauled down the tricolour, signifying {{the end of the}} action. Pellew later described the event {{in a letter to his}} brother Samuel as [...] "We dished her up in fifty minutes, boarded and took her". On the quarterdeck they found Captain Mullon, who had been struck in the back by a roundshot which had also torn away most of his left hip and was close to death. Seeing that his ship was in the hands of the enemy, Mullon <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> for a sheet containing the French coastal codes and tore the paper to shreds with his teeth before dying. However, he had inadvertently destroyed his commission as ship's captain instead of the codes, which were later found intact on his body. French casualties in the action totalled 63, including Mullon killed and his three lieutenants wounded. Losses aboard Nymphe was almost as severe, Pellew losing 23 men, including five officers, killed and 27 wounded. More than 100 prisoners were then collected from Cléopâtre and sent aboard Nymphe, leaving 150 remaining on the French ship under the guard of the small prize crew. The ships were then separated and made their way to Portsmouth together, arriving there on 21 June.|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the battles}} with Villa, Obregón had {{his right arm}} blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he {{attempted}} to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that. [...] The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined {{in the search for}} his missing arm. [...] "I was helping them myself, because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm." [...] The searchers had no luck. A comrade <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying [...] "And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from who knows where, and come skipping up to where the gold azteca [...] was elevated; it reached up and grasped it in its fingers--lovingly--That {{was the only way to}} get my lost arm to appear." [...] The arm was subsequently embalmed and then put in the monument to Obregón on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Out of caution, Radić was {{quieter than}} usual at the {{following}} evening's session of parliament. A verbal confrontation erupted that night when HSS deputy Ivan Pernar shouted insults at several Serbian politicians, questioning their wartime record and suggesting they were responsible for committing atrocities. Croatian politician Lubomir Maštović then made a speech protesting how the death threats against Radić made by Popović and Račić the previous day had gone unpunished {{by the president of}} the Assembly, Ninko Perić. Popović responded by saying [...] "...if Stjepan Radić, who shames the Croatian people, further continues with his insults, I guarantee that his head will fall." [...] The opposition benches reacted by shouting insults and death threats at the NRS party deputies, who responded in similar fashion. Perić ordered a five-minute recess and retreated to his private chamber, where he spoke with Račić. Račić was given the floor when the session was resumed. In his speech, he asserted that Serbian interests had never been in greater danger and stated that he would not refrain from using [...] "other weapons, as need be, to defend the interests of Serbdom". Opposing politicians, especially Pernar, responded by taunting Račić and shouting as he spoke. Račić demanded that Perić penalize those jeering at his speech. Pernar then shouted [...] "you plundered beys!", accusing Račić of looting Muslim homes in Macedonia. Seeing that Perić was not going to reprimand Pernar, Račić <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and produced a handgun. The Minister of Justice, Milorad Vujičić, who was sitting behind the podium, grabbed Račić by the back while the former Minister of Religion, Obradović, seized his right shoulder. Račić pushed both men away and shot Pernar first. He then turned his attention to Ivan Granđa and shot him. He attempted to shoot Svetozar Pribićević just as HSS deputy Đuro Basariček jumped to the podium. Račić aimed at Pribićević but shot Basariček instead. He then shot Radić in the hand and stomach. Radić's nephew, Pavle, rushed to help his uncle. Upon seeing him, Račić yelled [...] "I was waiting for you!" [...] and shot him at point-blank range. He then fled the chamber. Basariček and Radić's nephew died immediately. Pernar and Granđa were wounded but survived. Radić was seriously wounded and was taken to hospital immediately, where he was visited by King Alexander I.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{shooting}} continued outside, nurses and medics entered the building. [...] An unidentified soldier secured the south double doors with his ACU belt {{and rushed to}} help the wounded. According to the responding nurses, {{there was so much}} blood covering the floor inside the building, that they were unable to maintain balance, and had difficulty reaching the wounded to help them. In the area outside the building, Hasan continued to shoot at fleeing soldiers. [...] Herman Toro, Director of the Soldier Readiness Processing Site, arrived at this time. [...] Hasan had gone around the building and was out of sight, but still shooting. Toro and another site worker rushed to assist Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman who was down on the ground north of the medical building. [...] They both took her by the arms and tried to carry her to safety when Hasan returned and aimed his red laser across Toro's chest, but did not fire. [...] Toro took cover behind an electrical box and saw civilian police Sergeant Mark Todd arrive and shout commands at Hasan to surrender. Todd said: [...] "Then he turned and fired a couple of rounds at me. I didn't hear him say a word, he just turned and fired." [...] The two exchanged shots, and then Hasan's pistol was empty. [...] He stopped, turned and <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> for a new magazine and was felled by five shots from Todd, who ran over to him, kicked the pistol out of his hand and put handcuffs on him as he fell unconscious. LTC Tom Eberhart, Deputy Director of Human Resources, Fort Hood, arrived and entered the Medical Building to help. [...] He had to step over bodies to enter the building's north entrance. He assisted another soldier in performing CPR on one of the wounded soldiers at the building's waiting area. [...] Folding chairs were scattered all around. [...] He noticed a soldier outside the south doors of the building and went to help. [...] He had to remove the belt from the door and went outside as others were arriving. [...] The downed soldier was Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, a medical assistant from the building. [...] He had two wounds in the abdomen and a wound to the scalp. He was unconscious and LTC Eberhart went back into the building to retrieve a folding table. [...] Other soldiers assisted getting SSG Lunsford onto the table and around the building to the triage area.|$|E
