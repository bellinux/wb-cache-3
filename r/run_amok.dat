5|$|Cerebrates are {{secondary}} {{agents in}} the Zerg Swarm, each of which commands an individual brood of Zerg that possesses a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Alongside the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, {{each with its own}} personality and methods, although they are genetically incapable of disobeying the Overmind. Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to lose control of its respective brood, which will then <b>run</b> <b>amok.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{flaw in the}} Japanese plans {{was the use of}} midget {{submarines}} for {{the primary}} attack. Midget submarines were originally intended to operate during fleet actions: they would be released from modified seaplane carriers to <b>run</b> <b>amok</b> through the enemy fleet. This concept went out of favour as changing Japanese naval thinking and experience led to recognition that naval warfare would centre around carrier-supported aerial combat. As a result, the midget program's focus changed to the infiltration of enemy harbours, where they would attack vessels at anchor. This concept failed completely during the attack on Pearl Harbor, where the midgets had no effect, and tying up 11 large submarines for six weeks in support of further midget submarine attacks on Sydney and Diego Suarez proved a waste of resources.|$|E

5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men <b>run</b> <b>amok,</b> generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
25|$|The last of {{the four}} films Fassbinder shot in 1969, was his first in color, Why Does Herr R. <b>Run</b> <b>Amok?</b> (Warum läuft Herr R. Amok?). It was co-directed by Michael Fengler (the friend who had been his {{cameraman}} on the short film The little Chaos in 1967). Only {{the outlines of the}} scenes were sketched by Fassbinder. Fengler and the cast then improvised the dialogue. Fassbinder asserted that this was really Fengler's work rather than his. Nevertheless, the two were jointly given a directorial award for the project in the 1971 German Film prize competition and Why Does Herr R. <b>Run</b> <b>Amok?</b> has always been considered among Fassbinder's films.|$|E

25|$|In 2013 Holden {{published}} a novel, Mr. Big Maus, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture <b>run</b> <b>amok</b> and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. Mr. Big Maus is {{a blend of}} late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes within the context of everyday life and features evolution in its character’s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution. Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression.|$|E

500|$|Rodham {{maintained}} {{her interest}} in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles [...] "Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect" [...] in 1977 and [...] "Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective" [...] in 1979. The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, [...] "Her articles were important, {{not because they were}} radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate." [...] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as [...] "one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades", while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority, would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents, and exemplified critical legal studies <b>run</b> <b>amok.</b>|$|E

500|$|In January 1987, Congress {{announced}} it was opening {{an investigation into the}} Iran–Contra affair. Depending upon one's political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the Iran–Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan [...] "witch hunt" [...] by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the [...] "imperial presidency" [...] that had <b>run</b> <b>amok</b> by breaking numerous laws. The Democratic-controlled United States Congress issued its own report on November 18, 1987, stating that [...] "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have". The congressional report wrote that the president bore [...] "ultimate responsibility" [...] for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited [...] "secrecy, deception and disdain for the law". It also read that [...] "the central remaining question {{is the role of the}} President in the Iran–Contra affair. On this critical point, the shredding of documents by Poindexter, North and others, and the death of Casey, leave the record incomplete".|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on the {{blackboard}} as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody <b>run</b> <b>amok,</b> that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E
500|$|In July 1967, {{the band}} {{released}} their fourth single, {{one of the}} more unusual compositions to come from the pen of the Tucker-Mantz songwriting duo, [...] "Dr. Do-Good". The song, which featured Williams playing a prototype steel guitar, and childlike to maddening vocals, was described by music historian Richie Unterberger as [...] "sounding more like a horror movie theme <b>run</b> <b>amok</b> than a radio-ready hit", and consequently the single bubbled under the Hot 100 at number 128. The Electric Prunes reconvened at American Recording Studios to record their second album, Underground, though Hassinger was not as involved in the band's activities, which allowed much more creative freedom to the group to write their own material. For the album, the band wrote seven of the twelve tracks, and expanded upon the experimentation of the first album, with inventive guitar reverb and oscillation, in a unified effort. However, {{in the middle of the}} recording sessions the line-up went through changes when Ritter departed for musical differences, and was replaced by original drummer Weakley, who appeared on five tracks. Spagnola left near the conclusion of recording to address medical concerns, and Mike Gannon was recruited to finish the album. Gannon was included on just two songs as well as the non-album track, [...] "Everybody Knows You're Not In Love". In August 1967, Underground was released, but, without a hit-ready single, did not fare as well on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at number 172. After a U.S. tour in the latter half of 1967, the new line-up embarked on a European tour and this led to appearances at high-profile venues such as The Roundhouse, The Speakeasy Club and Middle Earth. On the final leg of the tour, The Electric Prunes' performance was recorded in Stockholm by the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation. The recordings were issued in 1997 on the live album, Stockholm '67.|$|E
