40|$|International audienceA single {{proposer}} has {{the opportunity}} to generate a surplus by buying out the assets of a group of individuals. These individuals vote to accept or reject the monetary offer made to them by the proposer, who needs the agreement of a <b>qualified</b> <b>majority.</b> The voters rejecting the offer while the <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> is met are frozen out but they can claim compensation in exchange for their asset. This article analyses how compensation rules influence both the votes and the offer made by the proposer. The existence of a symmetric subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is ensured, and multiple equilibrium outcomes with the same offer can arise when compensation depends on the probability of acceptance by the voters. We show that increasing the offer does not always increase the probability of acceptance, in sharp contrast to many similar models. We identify the equilibrium offer when compensation does not depend on the proposal. Increasing compensation always reduces the expected social surplus and the proposer’s expected profit, but does not always benefit the voters. <b>Reinforcing</b> the <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> always increases the proposer’s expected profit, and can lower both the expected social surplus and the voters’ expected utility...|$|R

50|$|The {{declarations}} {{of the conference}} that adopted the Treaty of Nice contained contradictory statements concerning <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting after the enlargement of the European Union to 25 and 27 members: one declaration specified that the <b>qualifying</b> <b>majority</b> of votes would increase {{to a maximum of}} 73.4%, contradicting another declaration which specified a <b>qualifying</b> <b>majority</b> of 258 votes (74.78%) after enlargement to 27 countries. However, the treaties of accession following the Treaty of Nice clarified the required majority.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Maastricht {{established}} the European Community Treaty (EC Treaty) where the <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting system was detailed in Article 148.

We show that given two <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> rules, if transitivity is desired for the societal outcome and if the thresholds {{of one of these}} rules are at least as high as the other’s for any pair of alternatives, then at each preference profile the rule with higher thresholds results in a coarser social ranking. Hence all absolute <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> rules can be expressed as specific coarsenings of the simple majority rule...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{the impact of a}} new system of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting under the Lisbon Treaty on the {{position}} of member states in the Council. The paper mainly deals with potential transformation of member states weight in the Council. With the help of so-called power indexes, the absolute and relative voting power of member states in the Council will be determined. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> is introduced also in the historical development, i. e., how its form ranged from the emergence of the European Communities to the present. Emphasis is of course placed on detailed description of the key articles of the Lisbon Treaty, relating to <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting in the Council. The answer to the question whether the new criteria of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> will mean a different result of the vote in the Council, can be found in the fourth chapter of this thesis. An important element of analysis of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> under the Lisbon Treaty is its comparison with the Nice system in terms of fairness and efficiency. At the conclusion of this thesis, the historical development of the expansion of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting in the Council at the expense of unanimity is included.

50|$|A special law, or <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> law, {{is a type}} of {{legislation}} in Belgium which requires a <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> in both chambers of the bicameral Belgian Federal Parliament to be adopted, amended or repealed. The Belgian Constitution determines which laws require a <b>qualified</b> or special <b>majority.</b> Special laws are primarily used in institutional matters and in matters concerning the competences of the communities and regions of Belgium. One of the best known examples is the Special Law of 8 August 1980 on the Reform of the Institutions.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} Commission {{could make a}} {{proposal}} {{in a way that}} removed the requirement for a <b>qualified</b> <b>majority.</b> For example, the Anti-Dumping Advisory Committee (ADAC) could approve a proposal to impose tariffs based on a simple, unweighted majority, but overturning it would have required a <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> because this meant voting against a Commission proposal. This greatly increased the power of small member states in such circumstances.|$|R
2500|$|The treaty has {{expanded}} {{the use of}} <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting (QMV) in the Council of Ministers by having it replace unanimity as the standard voting procedure in almost every policy area outside taxation and foreign policy. Moreover, taking effect in 2014, {{the definition of a}} <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> has changed: a <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> is reached when at least 55% of all member states, who comprise at least 65% of EU citizens, vote in favour of a proposal. When the Council of Ministers is acting neither on a proposal of the Commission nor on one of the High Representative, QMV requires 72% of the member states while the population requirement remains the same. However, the [...] "blocking minority" [...] that corresponds to these figures must comprise at least 4 countries. Hence, the voting powers of the member states are based on their population, and are no longer dependent on a negotiable system of voting points. The reform of <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> voting (QMV) in the Council {{was one of the main}} issues in the negotiation of the Lisbon Treaty.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The EU {{has tried}} to bridge {{decision}} making by <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> and unanimity {{over the years by}} expanding <b>qualified</b> <b>majorities</b> (consensus) or by making unanimities easier to achieve. I call this decision-making procedure q-"unanimity" andtrace its history from the Luxembourg compromise to the Lisbon Treaty, and to more recent agreements. I analyze the most recent and explicit mechanism of this bridging (article 31 (2) of the Lisbon Treaty) and identify one specific means by which the transformation of <b>qualified</b> <b>majorities</b> to unanimities is achieved: the reduction of precision or scope of the decision, so that different behaviors can be covered by it. I provide empirical evidence of such a mechanism by analyzing legislative decisions. Finally, I argue that this bridging is a ubiquitous feature of EU institutions, used in Treaties as well as in legislative decision-making. ...|$|R
