Two types of c e llular disruption we r e observed during imbibition: ruptures and fractures. Individual cells and small groups of cells on t he surfnces of cotyledons ruptured after immersion in water. Ruptured cells had flaps of cell walls which remained attached to intact portions of cell walls. Fractured cells sp l it in half, and <b>remnant</b> <b>portions</b> of cell walls were completely separated from each other. Disrupted cells on the interior surfaces of blister cavities were of the fractured type.

40|$|A 39 -year-old female with {{a history}} of partial {{salpingectomy}} for tubal pregnancy was diagnosed as having recurrent ectopic pregnancy in the distal portion of the fallopian tube remnant, which was successfully treated by laparoscopic surgery. The patient was multigravida (9 pregnancies) and uniparous. She had undergone right partial salpingectomy by laparotpmy for right isthmic ectopic pregnancy at the age of 31 years. At 6 weeks of the current pregnancy, she was referred to our hospital for suspected ectopic pregnancy. The gestational sac was not observed in the uterus, and a mass was observed in the right adnexal region by transvaginal ultrasonography. Emergency la-paroscopic surgery revealed the pregnancy site in the ampulla of the <b>remnant</b> <b>portion</b> of the right fallopian tube; therefore, this portion was resected. Because the proximal portion of the fallopian tube remnant was completely occluded, we concluded that this was a case of ectopic pregnancy resulting from the intraperitoneal migration of a fertilized ovum. With current developments in assisted reproductive technologies, reanastomosis of the fallopian tube is rarely performed.

40|$|External ear defects can be {{corrected}} by surgery, {{but this may}} not be feasible for personal or medical reasons. Reconstructive solutions are a good alternative, but rely on the artistry and availability of the anaplastologist. A semiautomated methodology using computer-aided design (CAD) and rapid prototyping (RP) technologies was developed for auricular prosthesis development, and demonstrated in a real-life case. The correct geometry and position of the prosthesis were ensured by stacking the computed tomography scan images of the contralateral normal ear in reverse order, and joining them using a medical modelling software program. The CAD model of the <b>remnant</b> <b>portion</b> of the defective ear was subtracted from the model of the mirrored contralateral ear, using a haptic CAD system, to obtain the final geometry of the prosthesis. Polymer models were fabricated in RP systems, and used for making a corresponding mould. Medical grade silicone rubber of the appropriate colour was packed into the mould to fabricate the final ear prosthesis and fitted to the deficient side of the patient using medical grade adhesive. The computer-aided methodology gave a high level of accuracy in terms of shape, size and position of the prosthesis, and a significantly shorter lead time compared to the conventional (manual) technique...|$|E
40|$|After {{centuries of}} timber harvest and {{conversion}} of forest to farmland and development, only small pockets of old growth forest {{remain in the}} eastern United States. These <b>remnant</b> <b>portions</b> of older forest have intrinsic value as a rare forest type and they play an important ecological function on the landscape. However, old growth forests in the eastern U. S. are less well-studied and documented {{than their counterparts in}} the Pacific Northwest. This study was undertaken to predict the geographic location, ecological and spectral characteristics of existing old growth, specifically in the southern Appalachian forests of western North Carolina. Stands of old growth previously field validated by the Southern Appalachian Forest Coalition were used as the response variable. Predictor variables included a range of landscape, topographic, and satellite indices derived from Landsat TM 7 satellite imagery and terrain analysis. Predictions were made using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling techniques. Model results were successful based on validation with existing field data. However, the MaxEnt model produced the most realistic estimate of potential old growth area given the inherent rarity of this forest type and suitability of the MaxEnt modeling technique for predicting the distribution of rare species. Results highlight over 54, 000 hectares of potential old growth to be investigated by researchers on the ground. This analysis will contribute to the relatively limited body of knowledge about old growth in the eastern U. S. and is unique in terms of its broad geographic extent. Continued research on these remnant eastern old growth stands must be done to increase our understanding of this rare forest stage and to better inform related management decisions on both public and private land in the eastern U.

40|$|A case of {{heterotopic}} triplet pregnancy after frozen-thawed {{embryo transfer}} is presented. The patient conceived after transfer of three frozen-thawed embryos at a fertility clinic {{where she had}} previously undergone laparoscopic left salpingectomy due to pyosalpinx. Approximately 4 weeks after the embryo transfer, she presented with a complaint of abnormal genital bleeding and was diagnosed as having a dichorionic twin pregnancy by ultrasound. One week later, she was referred to our hospital because of lower abdominal pain. Hematoperitoneum was suspected based on findings of low blood pressure and tachycardia. Diagnostic emergent laparoscopy demonstrated an ectopic pregnancy in the <b>remnant</b> isthmic <b>portion</b> of the left tube. Laparoscopic excision of the remnant fallopian tube was performed, but the procedure resulted in early pregnant loss {{of one of the}} twins.

40|$|Although a {{critical}} role for caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis in pulmonary endothelium is well established, considerably less is known about caveolae-independent pathways. In this current study, we confirmed that cultured rat pulmonary microvascular (RPMEC) and pulmonary artery (RPAEC) endothelium endocytosed Alexa 488 -labeled albumin in a saturable, temperature-sensitive mode and internalization resulted in co-localization by fluorescence microscopy with cholera B toxin and caveolin- 1. Although siRNA to caveolin- 1 (cav- 1) in RPAEC significantly inhibited albumin uptake, a <b>remnant</b> <b>portion</b> of albumin uptake was cav- 1 -independent, suggesting alternative pathways for albumin uptake. Thus, we isolated and cultured mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) from wild type and cav- 1 (-/-) mice and noted that ~ 65 % of albumin uptake, as determined by confocal imaging or live cell total internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy (TIRF), persisted in total absence of cav- 1. Uptake of colloidal gold labeled albumin was evaluated by electron microscopy and demonstrated that albumin uptake in MLEC from cav- 1 (-/-) mice was through caveolae-independent pathway(s) including clathrin-coated pits that resulted in endosomal accumulation of albumin. Finally, we noted that albumin uptake in RPMEC was in part sensitive to pharmacological agents (amiloride [sodium transport inhibitor], GÃ¶ 6976 [protein kinase C inhibitor], and cytochalasin D [inhibitor of actin polymerization]) consistent with a macropinocytosis-like process. The amiloride sensitivity accounting for macropinocytosis also exists in albumin uptake by both wild type and cav- 1 (-/-) MLEC. We conclude from these studies {{that in addition to}} the well described caveolar-dependent pulmonary endothelial cell endocytosis of albumin, a portion of overall uptake in pulmonary endothelial cells is cav- 1 insensitive and appears to involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis-like process...|$|E
