40|$|AbstractConventional {{coronary}} arteriography is able {{to demonstrate}} the presence of coronary collateral vessels but cannot delineate the specific region of myocardium to which they supply blood. To test the hypothesis that contrast echocardiography can specifically identify collateralized myocardium, contrast echocardiographic perfusion “maps” were compared in patients with (n = 12) end without (n = 12) angiographic evidence of coronary collateral flow, {{both before and after}} coronary angioplasty. Contrast echocardiographic images of the mid-left ventricle in the short-axis view at end-diastole were obtained after separate injections of a sonicated contrast agent into both {{the right and the left}} coronary arteries. A computerbased contouring system was used to determine the individual areas of myocardium perfused by each of the two coronary arteries and then to superimpose the images of the two perfusion beds. The resulting area of overlapping perfusion represented myocardium receiving blood flow from both coronary systems and was defined as collateralized myocardium. To normalize for heart size, overlap area was expressed as a percent of total myocardial area, which was the area between endocardium and epicardium in the short-axis view. To adjust for differences in vascular distribution, overlap area was expressed as a percent of the perfusion area of the <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel.</b> In patients with angiographic collateral flow, the <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel</b> was that vessel receiving the collateral flow. In patients without angiographic collateral flow, the right coronary artery was considered the <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel.</b> Overlap area was 1. 3 ± 0. 4 % of total myocardial area and 6. 6 ± 1. 7 % of <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel</b> area in patients without angiographic evidence of collateral flow compared with 30. 6 ± 2. 5 % and 89. 2 ± 6. 4 %, respectively, in patients with angiographic collateral flow (p < 0. 001 for both). In four patients in whom angiographic collateral flow was abolished by angioplasty, overlap area decreased from 30. 3 ± 5. 3 % to 6. 8 ± 2. 7 % of total myocardial area and from 100 % to 18. 5 ± 5. 4 % of <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel</b> area (p < 0. 05 for both). Thus, contrast echocardiography {{is able to}} map the specific myocardial territory perfused by coronary collateral flow and document an immediate reduction in perfusion in this territory when collateral flow is abolished by angioplasty...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental anatomic study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Eleven canine cadavers; 2 preserved cadavers and 9 fresh cadavers. METHODS: The head and neck of one preserved cadaver injected with pigmented silicone/barium, through the common carotid artery and external jugular vein, was cut in 1 cm sagittal sections and cross-sections. These tissue sections were used to identify the location of <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> > 1 mm that could be used as <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> for free tissue transfer.

RESULTS: Seven approaches were developed to isolate <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> {{of the head and neck}} region. The infraorbital, temporal, and sublingual approaches were easily performed and provided excellent access to the vessels in the region. The approach to the caudal auricular vessels was found to be more difficult but modification of the approach resolved this problem.

However, the success of this surgery requires suitable <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> in the cervical region. This form of reconstruction can be particularly challenging in the vessel-depleted neck. While the internal mammary artery and vein (IMA/V) have been used extensively in breast reconstruction, there are few reports describing their use in head and neck reconstruction. We report the first case series of the use of the internal mammary vessels for head and neck microvascular reconstruction. Methods.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONFree tissue {{transfer}} (FTT) is now {{a common}} procedure in many surgical centres {{around the world and}} it has shown well established results especially in the field of reconstructive surgery. The choice of FTT depends on the size of defect, nature of tissue, length of pedicle and donor site morbidity. Notwithstanding, FTT is complex and always depending on a sufficient <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel.</b> PRESENTATION OF CASEHerein, we report a case in which the abdominal aorta was used as arterial <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel</b> for microvascular transfer of a free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap. It was utilized to reconstruct an extensive pelvic and hip defect following a massive gas gangrene with a prior debridement of other potential recipient vessels. DISCUSSIONIn this case, the patient had a large defect that demanded a choice of a large flap such as the free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap. The iliac system has been sacrificed during the debridement procedure together with other potential recipient vessels. In the presented case, arterial anastomosis of the free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap was performed to the distal part of the aorta without complications. CONCLUSIONUsing the abdominal aorta as a recipient arterial vessel seems to be a reliable alternative that should be considered in difficult reconstructive scenarios such as the “vessel-depleted” pelvis...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{lumbar region}} has been {{scarcely}} explored {{as a donor}} site for free tissue transfer or as a free flap recipient site. The lumbar integument provides a versatile prospective flap site, with a potentially well-concealed scar. Similarly, defects of this region can require <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> that {{may be difficult to}} identify. Although lumbar artery perforators have been described, the reliability of perforators in this region remains questionable. Methods: An anatomical study was undertaken combining both cadaveric and in vivo analysis of the lumbar vessels. The cadaveric component comprised both dissection and angiographic studies in fresh and embalmed cadavers (36 lumbar regions in 18 cadavers), and the clinical study comprised a computed tomographic angiographic study (44 sides in 22 patients) and an operative case report. Results: Perforators were shown to arise from all eight lumbar arteries to enter the lumbar integument, with their size, location, and course described. Lower lumbar perforators were more often septocutaneous and of larger caliber. A case in which the fourth lumbar artery and concomitant vein were used as free flap <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> is described, the first such reported case in the literature. Conclusions: Improving the incidence of identifying lumbar perforators of large caliber and with a septocutaneous course can be achieved by selecting lower lumbar vessels, or with the use of preoperative computed tomographic angiography. Computed tomographic angiography can successfully identify the location, size, and course of lumbar artery perforators and can aid flap design. Lumbar artery perforators are highly useful for both donor and <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> in free flap surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Preoperative {{radiotherapy}} {{and chemotherapy}} {{in patients with}} head and neck cancer result in changes to the vessels {{that are used to}} construct microsurgical anastomoses. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate quantitative changes and HSP 70 expression of irradiated neck <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> and transplant vessels used for microsurgical anastomoses. Methods Of 20 patients included in this study five patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation, another five received conventional radiotherapy and 10 patients where treated without previous radiotherapy. During surgical procedure, vessel specimens where obtained by the surgeon. Immunhistochemical staining of HSP 70 was performed and quantitative measurement and evaluation of HSP 70 was carried out. Results Conventional radiation and neoadjuvant chemoradiation revealed in a thickening of the intima layer of <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels.</b> A increased expression of HSP 70 could be detected in the media layer of the recipient veins as well as in the transplant veins of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Radiation and chemoradiation decreased the HSP 70 expression of the intima layer in recipient arteries. Conventional radiation led to a decrease of HSP 70 expression in the media layer of recipient arteries. Conclusion Our results showed that anticancer drugs can lead to a thickening of the intima layer of transplant and recipient veins and also increase the HSP 70 expression in the media layer of the <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels.</b> In contrast, conventional radiation decreased the HSP 70 expression in the intima layer of arteries and the media layer of recipient arteries and veins. Comparing these results with wall thickness, it was concluded, that high levels of HSP 70 may prevent the intima layer of arteries and the media layer of vein from thickening. </p...|$|R
40|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{of severe}} magnitude involving lower limbs require complex bone and soft tissue reconstructions {{in the form}} of microvascular free tissue transfers. However, satisfactory <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> are often unavailable in the leg due to their vulnerability to trauma and post traumatic vessel disease (PTVD), which extends well beyond the site of original injury. In such situations, healthy <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> for free flap anastomosis can be made available by constructing temporary arteriovenous loops with saphenous vein grafts, anastomosed to corresponding free flap vessels. Our study included 7 patients with severe crush injuries of leg due to rail and road traffic accidents. Long and short saphenous vein grafts were anastomosed to Femoral artery in the subsartorial canal in 2 cases and to large muscular branches and accompanying veins in rest of the cases. Free flap transfers were performed in the same sitting in 6 cases. One case showed insufficient dilatation of the vein loop and hence free flap transfer was staged. Free Latissimus dorsi, Gracilis and Rectus abdominis flaps were performed. There were two cases of flap necrosis - one {{in the case of a}} pathologic vein graft with staged flap transfer which showed vein thrombosis on re exploration. The other case of flap failure was caused by a hematoma underneath the flap. In another patient, secondary haemorrhage occurred on day 18, without any consequence to the flap.

40|$|The {{selection}} of <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> is crucial when reconstructing traumatized lower extremities using a free flap. When the {{dorsalis pedis artery}} and/or posterior tibial artery cannot be palpated, we utilize computed tomography angiography to verify the site of vascular injury prior to performing free flap transfer. For vascular anastomosis, we fundamentally perform end-to-side anastomosis or flow-through anastomosis to preserve the main arterial flow. In addition, in open fracture of the lower extremity, we utilize the anterolateral thigh flap for moderate soft tissue defects and the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for extensive soft tissue defects. The free flaps used in these two techniques are long and include a large-caliber pedicle, and reconstruction can be performed with either the anterior or posterior tibial artery. The preparation of <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> is easier during the acute phase early after injury, {{when there is no}} influence of scarring.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is a potential}} noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect {{coronary artery bypass graft}} stenosis, but its value in clinical practice remains to be established. We investigated the value of MRI in detecting stenotic grafts, including <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened for inclusion 173 consecutive patients who were scheduled for coronary angiography because of recurrent chest pain after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We studied 69 eligible patients with 166 grafts (81 single vein, 44 sequential vein, and 41 arterial grafts). MRI with baseline and stress flow mapping was performed. Both scans were successful in 80 % of grafts. Grafts were divided into groups with stenosis > or = 50 % (n= 72) and > or = 70 % (n= 48) in the graft or <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels.</b> Marginal logistic regression was used to predict the probability for the presence of stenosis per graft type using multiple MRI variables. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic value of MRI. Sensitivity (95 % confidence interval) /specificity (95 % confidence interval) in detecting single vein grafts with stenosis > or = 50 % and > or = 70 % were 94 % (86 to 100) / 63 % (48 to 79) and 96 % (87 to 100) / 92 % (84 to 100), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MRI with flow mapping is useful for identifying grafts and <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> with flow-limiting stenosis. Flow scans could be obtained in 80 % of the grafts.

From this experience, we recommend to preserve longer distal run-off of the pedicle in chimeric anterolateral thigh flap harvest for necessary “self-revascularization” in similar cases...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Internal mammary (IM) {{lymph nodes}} may be exposed during <b>recipient</b> <b>vessel</b> {{preparation}} in free-flap breast reconstruction, and in rare cases, positivity of these nodes may affect treatment {{in patients with}} breast cancer. This systematic review examines the incidence and significance of IM nodes identified by plastic surgeons. Eligibility criteria included free-flap breast reconstruction with concurrent IM node biopsy. Data were analyzed for incidence of IM node biopsy and nodal positivity. Ten studies met inclusion criteria, {{with a total of}} 2055 patients and 717 nodes submitted to pathology. Incidence of IM positivity ranged approximately from 1 % to 11 %, for a calculated gross overall incidence of 2. 9 %. Of 59 patients with a positive IM node, 50 patients received additional adjuvant therapy, with insufficient data to determine the effect of treatment on survival...|$|E
40|$|The anastomotic {{network of}} the {{posterior}} circulation {{in children with}} moyamoya disease has not been analyzed. We aimed to investigate the angiographic anatomy of this unique vascular network in patients with childhood moyamoya disease. Selective and superselective injections of the posterior circulation were performed in six children with newly diagnosed moyamoya disease. The arterial branches feeding the moyamoya anastomotic network, their connections and the <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> were demonstrated. Depending {{on the level of}} the steno-occlusive lesion, the feeding vessels were the thalamoperforators, the posterior choroidals, the splenic artery, parietoccipital artery, other cortical posterior cerebral artery (PCA) branches, the dural branch of the PCA, the premamillary artery and other posterior communicating artery perforators. Through connections, which are described, the <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> were the striate and medullary arteries, other thalamic arteries with or without medullary extensions, the pericallosal artery, medial parietoccipital cortical branches of the PCA and the anterior choroidal artery. High quality selective and superselective angiography helped in demonstrating the angiographic anatomy of the moyamoya posterior anastomotic network previously either vaguely or incompletely described, as well as connections within the posterior circulation but also its relevance as a collateral to the anterior circulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 10 {{years with the}} {{advances}} in microsurgery of techniques and materials the indications for free tissue transfer have considerably been increased. But, {{there are still some}} limitations and drawbacks. Among risk factors associated with flap failure, atherosclerosis can affect both the flap and the <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> of free microvascular tissue transfers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss about the pathogenesis of Monckeberg's sclerosis, and the topics that must be taken into consideration when performing microsurgery in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Reconstruction of soft-tissue defects on {{multiple}} fingers is challenging {{because the number}} of <b>recipient</b> <b>vessels</b> for free flaps is limited. We report the use of a free radial forearm flap with multiple perforator-based skin islands for the reconstruction of complex soft-tissue defects involving multiple fingers. The injuries were caused by a heat press. The flap was transferred, like “bunting,” to the injured hand with an exteriorized pedicle. The technique presented here is advantageous because it simultaneously covers multiple defects and allows immediate hand therapy after the operation...|$|R
