40|$|The {{identification}} of the rotary and unsteady force derivatives through flight tests is very difficult because {{the sensitivity of the}} force coefficients with respect to spin rate and time derivatives of the aerodynamic angles is quite small in comparison with the variations of the aerodynamic coefficients caused by the angle of attack. Here, to avoid this difficulty, the estimation of these force derivatives through flight measurements, is carried out using an aero- dynamic model based on the Tait-Kirchhoff theorem which provides the ana- lytical expression of each aerodynamic coefficient. The model, which exhibits several free parameters, allows to express the <b>rotary</b> <b>force</b> derivatives in terms of apparent mass tensor and of the static moment derivatives whose iden- tifiability is verified about in nearly the entire flight envelope. The model free parameters are identified using an identification method proposed by the author in a previous work. Thus, the main idea of the present study is that the measurements of the static moment derivatives and the knowledge of the apparent mass tensor lead to an estimation of these force derivatives. The method is here used to identify the aerodynamic coefficients of a self- launching glider. Several flight tests were accomplished, whose results are compared with those obtained by CFD simulations, using a boundary ele- ments code. This comparison shows that the model free parameters -and the unsteady and <b>rotary</b> <b>force</b> derivatives- estimated with the proposed method, are in agreement with the results calculated by the code...|$|E

Several of the desired coefficients, specifically Y_r' coefficient of <b>rotary</b> <b>force</b> derivative Y_v' virtual inertia coefficient (lateral acceleration) N_r' coefficient of rotary moment derivative N_v' virtual moment of inertia coefficient (lateral acceleration) remained undetermined at that time. By employing the translational dynamic balance and its associated internal moment balance, it had been hoped that the missing values for these coefficients would be supplied. Only partial success has been achieved, insofar as numerical results are concerned, at contract expiration time. The coefficient of static force derivative, Y_v', and the virtual inertia coefficient, Y_v', have been measured as part of this investigation. These coefficients have been designated Z_w' and Z_ẇ' in this report to comply with the new direction of model motion with respect to the tunnel coordinate system. Since the first of these, Z_w', had already been determined in the angular dynamic measurements, only the presentation of a value for Z_ẇ' is new. This coefficient had appeared in linear combination with the coefficient of <b>rotary</b> <b>force</b> derivative; hence the latter important quantity also is now uniquely determined.

40|$|Equipment {{developed}} in this Laboratory permits {{the determination of}} eight of the dynamic coefficients useful in describing the force and moment reactions on a submerged body moving in water. These coefficients comprise the partial derivatives of moment (about the yaw axis) and of force (in the horizontal plane, and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis) with respect to velocity and acceleration components in specified directions. So long as the instantaneous angles of attack are small and scale effects are absent, these coefficients have constant values. A complete list of coefficients is given in Ref.

The eight coefficients tabulated below are those pertinent to lateral translation and rotation about the yaw axis for a body of revolution: Nr' coefficient of rotary moment derivative Nr[dot]' virtual moment of inertia coefficient (angular acceleration) Nv' coefficient of static moment derivative Nv[dot]' virtual moment of inertia coefficient (lateral acceleration) Yr' coefficient of <b>rotary</b> <b>force</b> derivative Yr[dot]' virtual inertia coefficient (angular acceleration) Yv' coefficient of static force derivative Yv[dot]' virtual inertia coefficient (lateral acceleration) where the prime indicates that the coefficients are in dimensionless form.
