Also included is a compensator coupled across the integrator, in a feed-forward loop, for receiving <b>the</b> angular <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle and outputting compensated angular <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle.

5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E

5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapsing protostar.|$|E
