5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December the {{regiment}} left Lemnos; they disembarked at Alexandria four days later. On 27 December they arrived back at Zeitoun camp. There they were reunited with their horses, and reinforcements arrived to bring {{the regiment}} back up to full establishment, plus another ten percent. At {{the same time the}} Machine-Gun Section was doubled from two to four guns. On 23 January 1916 the regiment were deployed in defence of the Suez Canal, reaching Serapeum on 29 January and Ferry Post <b>Rail</b> <b>Head</b> on 5 March where they took over from two infantry brigades. Later that month the brigade was assigned to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division, alongside three Australian light horse brigades and a British Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) brigade.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most modern {{incinerators}} operating in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra furnace line and a <b>rail</b> <b>head.</b> This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels. The plant initially burned only waste from Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include waste from south Tyne and Wear.|$|E

5|$|The Chalk River, Ontario, {{site was}} {{established}} to rehouse the Allied effort at the Montreal Laboratory away from an urban area. A new community was built at Deep River, Ontario, to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> adjacent to a large military base, Camp Petawawa. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first {{director of the new}} laboratory was Hans von Halban. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by Bennett Lewis in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as ZEEP (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970. A larger 10MW NRX reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} of jointed track is {{cracking}} around the bolt holes, {{which can lead}} to breaking of the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> (the running surface). This was the cause of the Hither Green rail crash which caused British Railways to begin converting much of its track to continuous welded rail.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{pedestrian}} {{access to}} the terminal from the south was made possible {{with the opening of}} a new segment of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. The closing of this gap along the promenade nearly completes the stretch from the Morris Canal to Weehawken Cove, with signage along the concourse at the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> inside the terminal indicating that it is officially part of the walkway.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{standard}} {{heights of}} platforms in Russia; they are 200 and 1100 mm above <b>rail</b> <b>heads.</b> 1100 mm high platforms are gradually changing to 550 mm platform height. 200 mm platforms are used primarily on lines with either small passenger flow or using double-decker trains.|$|R
50|$|The line, {{opened in}} 1867, ran through land at Caythorpe owned by GNR {{chairman}} George Hussey Packe. Packe's land {{was the first}} in south-west Lincolnshire to be mined for iron ore. Opencast workings were either side of the line and used narrow gauge links to <b>rail</b> <b>heads</b> on the line.|$|R
50|$|With {{the turn}} of the century and the opening of the railway came the teamsters and the timber industry. Horse and bullock teams hauled pine and {{hardwood}} to the <b>rail</b> <b>heads</b> at Boynedale, Weitalaba, Nagoorin, Littlemore, Builyan and Many Peaks supplying Mount Morgan mines with the props for their underground mines.|$|R
25|$|For {{this work}} the AA units were {{subdivided}} to support infantry formations. For example, in November 1944, 51 HAA had two batteries providing AA defence for Arezzo, and one {{operating in the}} field role with British XIII Corps in US Fifth Army. At New Year 1945 one battery was still defending the Arezzo <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> while {{the other two were}} in the AA/Field role supporting 6th Armoured Division (two troops), 1st Division (one troop) and 78th Division (one troop).|$|E

25|$|In early 1918, {{after the}} {{collapse}} of Tsarist Russia enabled a significant shift of German combat power from the Eastern Front to the Western Front, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive. The opening blows fell against the British in the Somme and as the offensive gained momentum, the Allies were pushed back significantly. With the vital <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> of Amiens threatened, the Australian units which had wintered in Belgium were brought south to the Somme to help stem the tide of the German advance. The 43rd Battalion subsequently undertook several defensive actions around Villers-Bretonneux and then, after the German offensive was halted, as the Allies sought to regain the initiative, they took part in the Battle of Hamel in July, where the battalion attacked in the centre of the 11th Brigade, tasked with securing the village itself. In August, the 43rd joined the Allied Hundred Days Offensive after which it took part in several attacks against the Hindenburg Line in the final months of the war. One of the battalion's last actions came at the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin in September 1918. For his actions during this battle Corporal Lawrence Weathers was awarded the Victoria Cross, {{the only member of the}} 43rd Battalion to be bestowed this honour, receiving it for attacking two German trenches with grenades during an assault on the Bouchavesnes Ridge on 2 September 1918.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} decade, Dost carried goods to remote {{settlements}} further north including Laverton, Wiluna, Cue, Port Hedland and Marble Bar. He had drays built {{to help in}} haulage. Pastoral stations had been edging northwards following reports from exploring expeditions led by John and Alexander Forrest, Lawrence Wells, [...] David Lindsay and John Wedge. Many of these expeditions relied on some camel transport. De Gray, Mundabullaangana, Pardoo, Tabba Tabba and Wallareenya were all pastoral stations, well established before Port Hedland became a gazetted town in 1896.

2500|$|With {{increased}} {{economic growth}} {{brought on by}} the Doi Moi reforms of the late 1980s, the railway system has entered a renewed phase of development. A number of major projects supported by official development assistance have been proposed or are currently underway, including a series of projects to improve bridge and railway safety on the North-South Railway line, connections to Cambodia and Laos, and the restoration of a number of defunct lines, including the Đà Lạt–Tháp Chàm railway first established in the 1930s. A high-speed rail link between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City has also been proposed, which would reduce journey length from 30 hours to around 6 hours.

25|$|Bourne was an {{important}} junction on the Victorian railway system, but all such connections were severed after the Second World War (see <b>Rail</b> <b>heading).</b> The business stimulus it brought caused major development of the town, {{and many of the}} buildings around the medieval street plan were rebuilt, or at least refaced.
