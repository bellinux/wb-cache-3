2500|$|The VAN {{predictions}} {{have been}} criticized on various grounds, including being geophysically implausible, [...] "vague and ambiguous", that [...] "VAN’s ‘predictions’ never specify the windows, and never state an unambiguous expiration date [...] VAN are not making earthquake predictions in the first place", failing to satisfy prediction criteria, and <b>retroactive</b> <b>adjustment</b> of parameters. [...] It has also been objected that no one [...] "can confidently state, except in the most general terms, what the VAN hypothesis is, because the authors of it have nowhere presented a thorough formulation of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Keith McLeod, {{author of}} The Multiple Scandals of Child Support, {{testified before the}} United States House Committee on Ways and Means that [...] "The 1986 Bradley Amendment to Title IV-D forbids any {{reduction}} of arrearage or retroactive reduction for any reason, ever. This reinforces the approach that inability to pay is no excuse. Needless to say, there are endless stories of men who are now crushed by a debt they {{will never be able}} to pay because they were:* Custodial Parent relinquished custody of one of two children, DCS failed to notify NCP of the requirement of a separate court order needing be established in order to offset the support for the child in his household for the child in her household. * In a coma* A captive of Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War* In jail* Medically incapacitated* Lost their job but were confident of another so did nothing until it was too late* Did not know they could not ask for <b>retroactive</b> <b>adjustments</b> and waited too long* Could not afford a lawyer to seek adjustment when adjustment was warranted* Wouldn’t use the legal system even if they could, feeling it alien from their world, so don’t ask for a reduction when the legal establishment expects them to.Some say this measure is a violation of due process and cruel and unusual as it removes the use of human discretion from dealing with individual cases, not to mention removing human compassion. But non-custodial fathers do not have the money to fight a constitutional case." ...|$|R
25|$|The TWU, for its part, later {{claimed that}} it was forced to strike {{in order to prevent}} the MTA from raising the {{retirement}} age, rather than striking to reduce the retirement age. That was not the case, however, because it is state legislation that sets the terms of the pension plan, and under state law pension terms may not even be the subject of collective bargaining. Years after the strike the pension plan remains retirement at age 55 after 25 years worked. And as a result of past underfunding, due to optimistic rate of return assumptions, and other pension enhancements that benefitted the TWU, such a <b>retroactive</b> inflation <b>adjustment</b> for retirees and an end to employee contributions, the cost of the pension plan to New York City Transit soared from $468 million in FY 2005 to $770 million in FY 2010 with a projected $950 million in pension costs forecast for FY 2014.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, several {{countries}} have introduced support schemes to accelerate investments in renewable energy (RE). When support schemes have served their purpose, and production goals are met, retraction or revision of currently employed support schemes becomes more likely, as confirmed by several policy changes in European countries. Investors in RE are greatly {{affected by the}} risk of subsidy changes when considering an investment opportunity. Therefore, they need to evaluate the likelihood of potential subsidy retractions and revisions, and take it into account when making an investment decision. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine how investment behavior is affected by updating a subjective belief on the timing of a subsidy revision. We incorporate Bayesian learning into a real options modeling approach. Subsidies in the form of fixed feed-in tariffs (FIT) are considered, and we analyze a scenario where a <b>retroactive</b> downward <b>adjustment</b> of the FIT is expected through a regime switching model. We find that investors are less likely to invest when the arrival rate of a policy change increases. Further, investors prefer a lower FIT with a long expected lifespan, while policy makers prefer a higher FIT with shorter life span. In addition, we consider an extension of our model where a FIT scheme is retroactively retracted and followed by a regime under which electricity is sold on a free market. We find that if policy uncertainty is high, an increase in the FIT will be less effective at accelerating investments. However, if policy risk is low, FIT schemes can be very effective for accelerating investment, even in highly volatile electricity markets...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony is given {{in support of the}} fiscal year 2008 budget request for the U. S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) before the House Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Committee on Appropriations. The requested funding will help us continue our support of the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and will help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government {{for the benefit of the}} American people. GAO is especially appreciative of the Subcommittee's efforts to help us avoid a furlough of our staff during fiscal year 2007. Had we not received additional funds this year and not taken other cost minimization actions, GAO would have likely been forced to furlough most staff for up to 5 days without pay. At the same time, due to funding shortfalls, we were not able to make pay <b>adjustments</b> <b>retroactive</b> to January 7, 2007. Our testimony today focuses on key efforts that GAO has undertaken to support the Congress, our fiscal year 2006 performance results, our budget request for fiscal year 2008 to support the Congress and serve the American people, and proposed legislative changes. ...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "We {{would like to thank}} Congress for its past support of GAO. We are especially appreciative of Congressional efforts to help us avoid a furlough of our staff during fiscal year 2007. Had we not received additional funds this year and not taken other cost minimization actions, GAO would have likely been forced to furlough most staff for up to 5 days without pay. At the same time, due to funding shortfalls, {{we were not able to}} make pay <b>adjustments</b> <b>retroactive</b> to January 7, 2007. It is through the efforts of our dedicated and capable staff that we were able to provide the Congress with the professional, objective, fact-based, nonpartisan, non-ideological, fair, and balanced information it needs to meet the full range of its constitutional responsibilities. We are extremely pleased and proud to say that we helped the federal government achieve a total of $ 51 billion in financial benefits in fiscal year 2006 [...] a record high that represents a return on investment of $ 105 for every dollar the Congress invested in us. As a result of our work, we also documented 1, 342 nonfinancial benefits that helped to improve service to the public, change laws, and transform government operations. The funding we received in fiscal year 2006 allowed us to conduct work that addressed many difficult issues confronting the nation, including U. S. border security, Iraq and Hurricane Katrina activities, the tax gap and tax reform, and issues affecting the health and pay of military service members. Our client-focused performance measures indicate that the Congress valued and was very pleased with our work overall. ...|$|R
