5|$|The <b>robbery</b> {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to {{distance}} himself from the legacy of the <b>robbery</b> may {{have been one of the}} sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the <b>robbery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the 5th Congress met, {{high-ranking}} Bolsheviks held {{a meeting}} in Berlin in April 1907 to discuss staging a <b>robbery</b> to obtain funds to purchase arms. Attendees included Lenin, Krasin, Bogdanov, Joseph Stalin, and Maxim Litvinov. The group decided that Stalin, then known by his earlier nom de guerre Koba, and the Armenian Simon Ter-Petrossian, known as Kamo, should organize a bank <b>robbery</b> {{in the city of}} Tiflis.|$|E
5|$|Gilday, Valeri and Bond were {{captured}} {{shortly after the}} Brighton <b>robbery.</b> Bond died in custody while making a bomb {{as part of an}} escape bid, while Valeri turned state's evidence and testified against Gilday.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} all bank <b>robberies,</b> completed and at-tempted, {{reported to the}} U. K. 's Metropolitan Police in the years 1992 - 1994. It shows the rate of repetition against the same branches to be high, with each robbed branch suffering an average of 1. 54 <b>robberies,</b> and the most robbed branch suffering six. Repeat <b>robberies</b> follow the success of earlier <b>robberies,</b> with the probability of repetition being roughly predictable from average sum taken (with attempts counting zero) at prior <b>robberies</b> of the same branch. Repeat <b>robberies</b> are less successful than first <b>robberies,</b> presumably because of security en-hancements or staff training following the earlier event(s). Repeat rob-beries tend to happen soon after first <b>robberies,</b> and indirect evidence suggests — consistent with more direct evidence from other studies — that repeat <b>robberies</b> are substantially {{the work of the}} original robbers. A surprising and potentially important conclusion of the study is that banks differ greatly in their liability to repeat victimisation. Steps shoul...|$|R
5|$|Offenses where impalement was {{occasionally}} employed include: {{contempt for}} the state's responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing highway <b>robbery</b> or grave <b>robbery,</b> violating state policies or monopolies, or subverting standards for trade. Offenders have also been impaled {{for a variety of}} cultural, sexual and religious reasons.|$|E
5|$|Released on bail, Spence and Stilwell were re-arrested October 13 by Marshal Virgil Earp for the Bisbee <b>robbery</b> on a {{new federal}} charge of interfering with a mail carrier.

40|$|This study {{examines}} all bank <b>robberies,</b> completed and attempted, {{reported to the}} U. K. 's Metropciitan Police in the years 1992 - 1994.

5|$|The {{jury was}} impanelled on January 18. The {{indictment}} was read and Cannon delivered his opening statement.

5000|$|When {{he became}} U.S. Marshal, he faced an {{epidemic}} of stage <b>robberies.</b> In May 1877, the Prescott Arizona Miner complained that the stage <b>robberies</b> were now as frequent as had [...] "Indian murders" [...] during prior years. Associate Justice Charles Silent wrote the attorney general, telling him, [...] "this lawlessness... is paralyzing business." [...] Crawley observed that the <b>robberies</b> [...] "have caused much inconvenience... to the businessman." ...|$|R
50|$|Armed <b>robberies</b> occur regularly, {{especially}} in businesses and shopping districts, {{especially in}} the capital Georgetown. Nationally, there were 512 <b>robberies</b> under arms during the period January to October 2012 (a 15% increase from 2011).|$|R
5|$|After a {{short time}} in Flint, Michigan, he moved to New York City's Harlem {{neighborhood}} in 1943, where he engaged in drug dealing, gambling, racketeering, <b>robbery,</b> and pimping.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the <b>robbery</b> were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the <b>robbery</b> proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the <b>robbery.</b> The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|Both Schlesselman and Cowart {{acknowledged}} {{that they would}} be killed {{as a result of the}} murders and insisted they were willing to die. Authorities said the pair planned to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons for their attack, and also bought nylon rope and ski masks at Walmart to use in a <b>robbery</b> or home invasion to fund the spree. Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the <b>robbery</b> after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the driveway.|$|E

5|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, {{the bank}} robber {{was to have}} jumped into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena. After Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way, the producers agreed to make the change. The opening bank <b>robbery</b> scene was filmed on location in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that <b>robbery</b> was a real one.|$|E
5|$|Krasin helped {{manufacture}} bombs {{to use in}} {{the attack}} on the stagecoach. Kamo's gang smuggled bombs into Tiflis by hiding them inside a sofa. Only weeks before the <b>robbery,</b> Kamo accidentally detonated one of Krasin's bombs while trying to set the fuse. The blast severely injured him in the eye, leaving a permanent scar. Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered {{by the time of the}} <b>robbery.</b>|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} the <b>robbery,</b> 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the <b>robbery,</b> they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the <b>robbery</b> and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above.|$|E
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino <b>robbery,</b> where Batman follows a <b>robbery</b> signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
