500|$|The {{construction}} of the temple began in 1890 and completed in 1905. It was inspired by Beow Lean, the chief monk of the Goddess of Mercy Temple at Pitt Street in 1887; he had served earlier in the Kushan Abbey in Fujian in China. The site chosen by Beow, a spiritual location {{in the hills of}} Ayer Itam, facing the sea, was named [...] "Crane Mountain". It was established as a branch of the Buddhist Vatican in Drum Mountain in Foochow in Hokkien province. Beow Lean was the first Abbot of the temple. The buildings of the temple complex were sponsored by five leading Chinese business people of Penang known as [...] "Hakka tycoons". They were: Cheong Fatt Tze, his cousin Chang Yu Nan, Chea Choon Seng, Tye Kee Yoon, and Chung Keng Kooi. Collection of funds for building the temple was also facilitated by dedicating the structures and artefacts {{in the name of the}} temple's benefactors. The main hall, which was completed first, housed a shrine to Guanyin, in a <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> where many other female goddesses called the Queen of Heaven, the Goddess of the Earth, and Goddess of Childbirth are housed; which is said to represent, on a miniature scale, the island of Potalaka where there is a large shrine dedicated to Guanyin in the China Sea. People compared this shrine to the Amitabha Buddha's Western Paradise and started calling it the [...] "Kek Lok Si" [...] ("Jile Si"). There are also many other shrine chambers, which have stately statues, all gilded, of the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, saintly Lohans, guardian spirits, and Heavenly (or Diamond) Kings of Pure Land Buddhism.|$|E

2500|$|The kidney is a bean-shaped {{structure}} with a [...] and a [...] border. A <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> on the concave border is the renal hilum, where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein and ureter leave. The kidney {{is surrounded by}} tough fibrous tissue, the renal capsule, which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal fat. The anterior (front) surface of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior (rear) surface is the transversalis fascia.|$|E
40|$|Paranasal sinus mucocoeles {{are more}} common in frontal and ethmoidal sinuses with highest {{morbidity}} and recurrence rates. Still, endoscopic surgical clearance of disease in the frontal <b>recess</b> <b>area</b> is technically challenging in view of recurrence. A case of recurrent isolated agger nasi mucocoele is reported here and a detail analysis is made on the anatomical, disease and surgical factors for the recurrence of mucocoeles in frontal <b>recess</b> <b>area,</b> the radiological aspects of such lesions required for an operating ENT surgeon and the best surgical approaches to the frontal <b>recess</b> <b>area.</b> Axillary flap technique designed by Wormald is adopted for the surgical clearance of this recurrent isolated agger nasi mucocoele and {{is found to be}} safe, easy with excellent anterior access to the frontal <b>recess</b> <b>area</b> preventing postoperative adhesions, scarring and recurrence...|$|R
50|$|An area of {{continued}} interest and growth is the plating of microwave components. With complex shapes and deep <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> electroless nickel is {{ideally suited to}} act as a corrosion resistant barrier film on top of aluminum and beneath the silver or tin electroplated topcoat.|$|R
30|$|To {{verify the}} {{effectiveness}} of the image fusion algorithm, first, the background elimination processing was performed on the images obtained from Φ[*]=[*] 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °, respectively. Then, the four images were fused using Eqs. (3)–(5), and the fusion result is shown in Fig.  3 b. Comparing the images with and without fusion, {{it can be seen that}} in the stamped <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> of the fused image, there are unidirectional and stable fluctuations of the pixel grayscale value in the image whether on the reflecting surface or the backlit surface. This means that the contrast between the MSCs and the background is clearly enhanced, which is useful for locating the <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> and segmenting the MSCs.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a camming action in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|E

50|$|Like other Android devices, the Tablet S has no {{hardware}} navigation buttons, {{which are}} all implemented via persistent on-screen buttons. The only physical buttons present on the device are the power button and volume rocker located in the <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> on one side.|$|E
40|$|To {{describe}} a quantitative method {{for measuring the}} iridocorneal angle <b>recess</b> <b>area,</b> and, using this, to evaluate factors associated with appositional angle-closure during dark room provocative testing using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Methods: All patients (178 patients, 178 eyes) with clinically narrow angles referred for UBM dark room provocative testing between September 1996 and March 1998 were en-rolled in this study. Images of the inferior quadrant of the angle taken under standardized dark and light conditions were analyzed. The angle <b>recess</b> <b>area</b> (ARA) {{was defined as the}} tri-angular area demarcated by the anterior iris surface, corneal endothelium, and a line perpen-dicular to the corneal endothelium drawn from a point 750 m m anterior to the scleral spur to the iris surface. ARA, and acceleration and y-intercept of the linear regression analysis of the ARA were calculated. In the linear regression formula,...|$|R
50|$|CloisonnéSometimes called epola or hard enamel, cloisonné is stamped {{out from}} a sheet of copper. The {{stamping}} leaves <b>recessed</b> <b>areas,</b> or pools, which are filled with enamel powder and high fired at 800 - 900 degrees. After cooling, {{the surface of the}} pin is ground down to a smooth finish and then the copper is plated.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{also called}} the nasoturbinal concha and the nasal ridge. In 90% of {{patients}} an anterior ethmoidal cell (called the [...] "agger nasi cell") {{can be found in}} the lacrimal bone below the agger nasi ridge. An enlarged agger nasi cell may encroach the frontal <b>recess</b> <b>area,</b> constricting it and causing mechanical obstruction to frontal sinus drainage.|$|R
50|$|The main console unit {{consists}} of a 14×8×2-inch rectangular plastic case that houses the motherboard, with a cartridge slot {{on the right side}} and connectors for the external power supply and RF jack at the rear. The controllers connect into plugs in a <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> {{on the top of the}} unit.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the SRF-39, the SRF-39FP, has a {{transparent}} case, designed to thwart contraband concealment. The radio often appears on the commissary lists of U.S. federal prisons, hence the [...] "FP" [...] suffix. Both are popular in the DXing community partly for their generous <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> for the tuning thumbwheel, 0-10 log strip, and guard chain.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} building, {{designed by}} McLean and Wright, is measured at 60 by 40 ft and is {{topped by a}} hipped roof with two chimneys. A central projecting entry pavilion dominates the front façade, with a recessed entry topped by a transom window and a cornice in scrolled brackets. The doorway is flanked with Doric columns, and Ionic pilasters beyond the <b>recessed</b> <b>area.</b> Above the pilasters is an entablature and triangular pediment with decorated tympanum.|$|E
50|$|Cumann Peile Na bPiarsaigh is a Gaelic Athletic Association club {{based in}} the Ros Muc, Camus and <b>Recess</b> <b>areas</b> in Conamara, County Galway, Ireland.

Cumann Peile Na bPiarsaigh GAA Club caters for large numbers of young boys and girls and adults who play Football and Ladies Football in the parishes of Ros Muc, Camus and Recess.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{attachment}} point theory, Nitzschia cf. paleacea (2  μm) and Fallacia carpentariae (1  μm) settled on sine-wave grooves that were 4 and 2  μm in wavelength because multiple contact points were formed between the diatoms’ bodies and the topographies. Cylindrically shaped diatoms {{were able to}} fit securely in the <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> of the grooves especially when the diatoms’ bodies were aligned longitudinally to the grooves (Figure  1 A) [46].|$|R
50|$|Typical {{finding is}} of multiple, smooth, oval-shaped calcified masses within the joint space or bursa. They have a {{characteristic}} popcorn-ball appearance of calcified cartilage. With serial imaging, masses {{may be found}} to change in size, disappear, or migrate to <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> of the joint. They may pass from the main joint cavity into a neighboring synovial cyst. For this reason, a mass may not be appreciated within the actual joint space itself.|$|R
50|$|Constructed {{of brick}} {{on a stone}} foundation, the Lindsey Building's {{architecture}} is typical of commercial buildings erected {{in the early twentieth}} century. Some of its more distinctive components are Neoclassical, including its three-part facade and some of its smaller details. Twelve stories tall, the building has been modified to include room for modern-styled shops on its first two floors; the main entrance is located in a <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> to the right (from the perspective of someone inside the building) of the shop space.|$|E
50|$|This {{station was}} renovated again from 1990-1994. In {{addition}} to upgrading the same elements that were replaced {{in the previous}} overhaul, tiling on floors and track walls, the public announcement system, and safety threads along platform edges and track-beds were replaced. It also included an art installation by Emmett Wigglesworth called CommUnion. It features twenty-two panels of various designs in the <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> of the platform tiles above the station signs and other designs on the openings in the track walls.|$|E
50|$|Two large buttresses {{project at}} 45-degree angles {{from the corners}} of the bell tower. A pair of narrow {{rectangular}} windows with stone trim are on the south face of the tower at the first story. Similar windows are on both the south and east of the second story, inside a slightly <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> that also includes the arched louvered vents around the bells, again with stone trim. Above them, at the tower's flat roof, is a stone belt course and plain parapet.|$|E
50|$|Coil coating is the {{continuous}} and highly automated industrial process for efficiently coating coils of metal. Because the metal is treated {{before it is}} cut and formed, the entire surface is cleaned and treated, providing tightly-bonded finishes. (Formed parts can have many holes, <b>recessed</b> <b>areas,</b> valleys, and hidden areas that {{make it difficult to}} clean and uniformly paint.) Coil coated metal (often called prepainted metal) is often considered more durable and more corrosion-resistant than most post painted metal.|$|R
50|$|Relief {{printing}} is {{a process}} where protruding surface faces of the printing plate or block are inked; <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> are ink free. Printing the image is therefore a relatively simple matter of inking {{the face of the}} matrix and bringing it in firm contact with the paper. A printing-press may not be needed as the back of the paper can be rubbed or pressed by hand with a simple tool such as a brayer or roller.|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic powder {{deposition}} {{is widely}} used in a plethora of industrial-applications ranging from the pharmaceutical and food. industries, to farm equipment and automotive applications. The disadvantages of this technique are possible back corona (pin-like formations) onset and the Faraday penetration limitation (when the powder does not penetrate in some <b>recessed</b> <b>areas).</b> A possible solution {{to overcome these problems}} is to use tribochargers to electrostatically charge the powder. Tribocharging, or contact charging while two materials are in contact, is related to the work function difference between the contacting materials and generates bipolarly charged particles. The generation of an ion-free powder cloud by tribocharging with high bipolar charge and an overall charge density of almost zero, provides a better coverage of the <b>recessed</b> <b>areas.</b> In this study, acrylic and epoxy powders were fluidized and charged by passing through stainless steel, copper, aluminum, and polycarbonate static mixers, respectively. The particle velocity was varied to determine its effect on the net charge-to-mass ratio (QIM) acquired by the powders. In general, the Q/M increases rapidly when the velocity was increased from 1. 5 to 2. 5 m/s, remaining almost constant for higher velocities. Charge separation experiments showed bipolar charging for all chargers...|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{went through}} several major design changes before its completion. Phillips originally planned {{for it to}} be six stories tall. He then changed the height to nine stories, and finally increased it to 13 stories. [...] Above the second floor, the office tower had a cross section shaped like an [...] "H", with the wings extending north and south. The <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> between the wings created a light well that provided ventilation as well as light to the inner offices.|$|E

50|$|Distinctive {{interior}} {{features include}} the vestibule, lobby and information desk, center stairway, cashier’s office, and {{public and private}} collectors offices. From the main entry on the front facade, a small vestibule opens into the lobby. In the lobby are bulletin cases of glass and wood marked “Immigration” and “Customs,” and a wood building directory. A <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> contains a wood-panel information desk with a hinged gate. In {{the wall behind the}} desk, a shallow, elaborately detailed closet was built into one of the original arches in the masonry bearing wall.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Chrismas mounted Robert Irwin’s {{critically}} acclaimed installation Room Angle Light Volume {{at the first}} Ace/Venice, which opened at 72 Market Street in 1971. In 1977, Ace mounted acclaimed exhibitions of work by Frank Stella and Robert Motherwell, along with Michael Heizer’s Displaced/Replaced Mass. Installed at Ace/Venice, the Heizer piece required that huge chunks be gouged out of the gallery floor to create <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> able to accommodate imposing boulders; the work was considered a triumph for both the artist and dealer.|$|R
50|$|The Amos Judkins House is a {{historic}} house at 8 Central Avenue in Newton, Massachusetts. The 2 1/2 story wood frame house was built c. 1884, and is an excellent and well-preserved example of Queen Anne styling. It has asymmetrical massing, anda variety of gables, projections, and <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> that add variety to its external appearance. The exterior is clad in part in clapboards, and in part with decoratively cut wood shingles. The {{focal point of the}} front porch is a gable-topped arch.|$|R
40|$|Shape distortions are {{generally}} considered influenced by several factors including thermal contraction, curing kinetics, fibre content, lay-up (balanced / unbalanced) and anomalies developed during manufacturing. In this work influences from forming on the shape distortion of a C-shaped composite spar with a <b>recess</b> <b>area</b> {{on one side}} is investigated. The forming influences considered are fibre angle deviation, inbuilt residual fibre compression (RF compression) and inbuilt residual fibre tension (RF tension). Abnormalities due to various stacking sequences and choice of lay-up process are especially focused upon. QC 20160809 </p...|$|R
50|$|Chrysler {{released}} the VH Valiant range in June 1971. The VH {{was the first}} fully Australian-designed Valiant and was a major change from the preceding VG range — these were larger cars, styled to look even larger than they were. The grille treatment on the new VH range was a direct design descendant from the US Mopars with the central <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> for grille and headlamps, surrounded by uninterrupted trim on the outer {{leading edge of the}} whole assembly. The rectangular headlamps were carried over from the VG model.|$|E
50|$|Spare tires in {{automobiles}} {{are often}} {{stored in a}} spare tire well - a <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> {{in the trunk of}} a vehicle, usually in the center, where the spare tire is stored while not in use. In most cars, the spare tire is secured with a bolt and wing-nut style fastener. Usually a stiff sheet of cardboard lies on top of the spare tire well with the trunk carpet on top of it to hide the spare tire and provide a pleasant look to and a flat surface for the trunk space.|$|E
50|$|The High Tops School, {{also known}} as Schoolhouse No. 9, is a {{historic}} school building {{at the corner of}} Reynolds and River roads in Westmoreland, New Hampshire. The 1.5-story wood-frame building was constructed in 1789 but was moved to its present location in 1846 and given an extensive high-quality Greek Revival treatment. It is one of few regional schoolhouses of the period to escape extensive later alteration. Its main facade has the appearance of a Greek temple, with four pilasters supporting a projecting architrave and triangular pediment. The main entrance is in a <b>recessed</b> <b>area</b> between the middle two pilasters.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, in the {{intaglio}} {{process the}} <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> are the printed areas. The whole matrix is inked, and the ink then wiped {{away from the}} surface, so that it remains only in the recesses. Much greater pressure is then needed to force the paper into the channels containing the ink, and a high-pressure press will normally be required. Intaglio techniques include engraving, etching, and drypoint. With planographic techniques, such as lithography, the entire surface of the matrix is flat, and some areas are treated to create the print image.|$|R
50|$|During those years, {{the school}} {{underwent}} {{a period of}} tremendous expansion. By 1882, Mrs. Somers had purchased three additional houses next to the original location. She built an enclosed courtyard {{to serve as a}} <b>recess</b> <b>area,</b> and a tennis and basketball court. Between 1890 and 1917, the student body counted more than 100 boarding students and 50 day students. By that time, the school had built a supportive alumnae base that returned to the school for alumnae events and reunions. The group became organized as the Mount Vernon Alumnae Association in 1885, and has been in existence continuously since.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{topography}} and overburden variation are encountered during Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) device {{manufacturing processes}} {{and have a}} significant impact on device performance and yield. A planarization process, CON-TACT ® planarization, is presented to locally and globally planarize GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) wafers coated with polyimide material. This planarization process involves physically forcing the flowable material from the raised into the <b>recessed</b> <b>areas</b> to create a planar surface. As a result, the surface topography and overburden variation are significantly reduced, and broader processing latitudes are secured for downstream processes. Consequently, easier process control, more consistent device performance, and higher yield can be achieved...|$|R
