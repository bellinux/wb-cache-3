40|$|In {{the last}} decades, mobile {{communication}} services have progressed very rapidly, which demands wider spectrum band.

The proposed OC-MAC protocol increases the spectrum efficiency. Moreover, it also removes the traditional hidden terminal problem commonly faced by the CR.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new wireless MAC protocol, MACA-BI (MACA By Invitation). The protocol is a simplified {{version of the}} well known MACA (Multiple Access Collision Avoidance) based on the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) handshake. The Clear to Send (CTS) control message is retained, while the <b>Request</b> <b>to</b> <b>Send</b> (<b>RTS)</b> part of the RTS/CTS handshake is suppressed. MACA-BI, preserving the data collision free property, is more robust than MACA to problems such as protocol failures (control packet collision and corruption) and finite turn-around time. Analytic results for a 1 Mbps single-hop far-field wireless network, and simulation results for a 10 Mbps multi-hop near-field ATM wireless indoor network, show that MACA-BI outperforms other multiple access protocols in high speed, steady traffic environments (e. g. ATM VBR and CBR) and where the propagation delay can be neglected (typically indoor). I. INTRODUCTION The Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance protocol (MACA), propos [...] ...|$|E

30|$|We {{talk about}} a hidden node problem when a node that {{is not able to}} sense the signal {{transmitted}} by an another neighboring node (the hidden node) operating at the same channel, and hence, it assumes that the medium is free and transmits. The simultaneously transmitted signals interfere at the receiving node causing a failure in the reception process. As a solution to this problem, an exchange of <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (<b>RTS)</b> and clear to send (CTS) frames is described in the IEEE 802.11 standard. However, as widely highlighted in the literature [31], the RTS/CTS mechanism introduces an important overhead and reduces the capacity of the network in terms of throughput since each node has to transmit the RTS and wait for the CTS response before any transmission. Furthermore, in specific scenarios, this mechanism fails to eliminate hidden nodes [32]. In this study, we experiment the performance of our solution in solving the hidden node problem without using the RTS/CTS.|$|E
30|$|In multi-hop communications, {{broadcast}} storm {{is a serious}} problem. The circulation of broadcast messages around the network may consume all available bandwidth and saturate the network [11 – 14]. Moreover, the safety messages and the multi-hop warning messages are both transmitted on the control channel of the allocated spectrum for vehicular communications [15]. This may lead to severe interference between {{the two types of}} messages. The situation is further exacerbated by the strict packet transmission requirements of the safety messages (with a packet generation frequency of 1 − 10 Hz) that results in hidden node collisions [16, 17]. Since broadcast mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 standard [18] does not have a <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (<b>RTS)</b> and clear to send (CTS), hidden node collisions cannot be detected. In this case, many redundant multi-hop retransmissions are required, which contribute to increasing the multi-hop dissemination delay and adversely affecting the reception rate of safety messages [19].|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new Medium Access Control (MAC) {{protocol}} for full exploitation of directional antennas in wireless networks. The protocol introduces a circular directional {{transmission of the}} <b>Request</b> <b>To</b> <b>Send</b> (<b>RTS)</b> control packet, spreading around a station information about the intended communication. The stations that receive the directional RTS, using a simple scheme of tracking the neighbors ’ directions, defer their transmission toward the beams that could harm the ongoing communication. In this way, the proposed protocol {{takes advantage of the}} benefits of directional transmissions as the increase of spatial reuse and of coverage range. Additionally, it reduces the hidden-terminal problem, as well as the deafness problem, two main factors for the decrease of the efficiency of directional transmissions in ad hoc networks. The performance evaluation of the protocol shows that it offers a significant improvement in static, as well as mobile, scenarios, as compared to the performance of the proposed protocols that use omnidirectional or directional transmissions...|$|E

Provided {{that more than one}} node wishes to transmit in a timeslot, which is referred to as a shared group timeslot, any nodes except a coordinator transmit using CSMA. In a shared group time slot, a coordinator broadcasts a clear to send (CTS) shared group frame to indicate that the timeslot is not used by the slot owner. Then, a node sends a <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (<b>RTS)</b> frame and waits for a CTS frame from the coordinator in a response to it.

On the other hand, many wireless networking standards such as IEEE 802. 11 a, 802. 11 b, and 802. 11 g have multirate capability. Therefore, adaptive rate control methods have been proposed for ad hoc networks. However, almost methods require the modification of the <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> (<b>RTS)</b> and clear to send (CTS) packets.

Therefore, our proposed method can attempt to satisfy the conventional IEEE 802. 11 standards. Moreover, an adequate transmission rate is selected based on an estimated TCP throughput performance. From simulation results, it is observed that the proposed method can improve the throughput performance without any modification of packet structures...|$|E
