50|$|The MB {{model was}} sporty and complete. It was {{standard}} {{equipped with a}} speedometer, <b>rpm</b> <b>counter,</b> front disc brake and Honda Comstar wheels. Because of its success Honda released the MT series, a naked off-road version, on the European and South African markets.|$|E
50|$|Light weight variant with 155mm 39 caliber {{barrel and}} {{high rate of}} fire(8 <b>rpm),</b> new <b>counter</b> recoil system and {{possibility}} of use of semi-automatic loader.|$|R
50|$|The {{injection}} of fuel or the quantity of injected fuel has a decisive influence on engine starting, idling, power and emissions. The engine ECU is programmed ("mapped") with relevant data to where the fuel rack position has an equivalent signal {{for the amount of}} fuel being injected. The driver requests the torque or engine speed requirements via accelerator pedal potentiometer thereby sending a signal to the engine ECU which then, depending on its mapping and data collected from various sensors, calculates in real time the quantity of injected fuel required, thus altering the fuel rack to the required position.The driver can also input additional commands such as idle speed increase to compensate e.g. for PTO operation which can be either variably set or has a preset speed which can be recalled. The road speed function can be used to evaluate vehicle speed and possibly activate a speed limiter (Heavy Vehicles), or maintain or restore a set speed (cruise control). Further functions can include exhaust brake operation which, when activated, will result in the fuel pump rack position being set to zero delivery or idle. The engine ECU can also interface with various other vehicle systems e.g. traction control and carry out self monitoring duties and self diagnostic functions to keep the system working at an optimal level. To ensure the safe operation in case of failure, the limp home mode functions are also integrated into the system, e.g. should the pump speed sensor fail the ECU can use an alternator speed signal function for engine <b>RPMs</b> <b>counter</b> as a backup signal.|$|R
30|$|To {{avoid the}} product defects mathematically {{contoured}} cosine profiled die {{was used for}} the thermomechanical treatment. Improvement of mechanical characterization like density, hardness, compression test and three-point-bend test was inquired. Two body dry sliding wear behaviour of the prepared AMCs before and after extrusion were investigated by using a pin-on-disc wear testing method by varying the variable parameters like load (N), track diameter (mm) and <b>RPM</b> of the <b>counter</b> disc.|$|R
5000|$|For in-line 4's {{there are}} 3 types of crankshaft. No counter weights, fully counter {{weighted}} (FCW) and semi-counter or half-counter weighted (SCW/HCW). Cranks without counter weights ("bent sticks") were used on in-line 4's {{up to the}} mid 1930s for auto-mobiles but are still {{to be found in}} agricultural use with attendant problems. Without counter weights an in-line 4 crank is balanced for primary forces, primary and secondary couples but not for secondary forces. Secondary force out balance can not be balanced on the crank, requiring 2 contra-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine speed. These will only be fitted on premium quality cars that demand very smooth running or on large engines in excess of 2.4L where the level of secondary vibration becomes obtrusive. The primary couples bend the crank to a S shape with the deflection increasing with <b>rpm.</b> Without <b>counter</b> weights this deflection causes fatigue and main bearing failures when the deflection exceeds the bearing clearance resulting in rubs. These failures have resulted in a public perception that high rpm is bad for the engine that lingers to this day. FCW cranks have 2 counter weights on each crank throw. SCW cranks have one counter weight on each crank throw, these are on each end of the crank and both sides of the centre main. The counter weights produce moment couples in the crank that counter the primary couple and pull the crank straighter to enable repeated and sustained high rpm with long fatigue and bearing life. The moment couple is proportional to mass x radius of centre of gravity x distance from pivot, the [...] "pivots" [...] being between 1-2 and 3-4. As they are close to the [...] "pivot", the counter weights adjacent to the pivots on a FCW crank only contribute about 1/4 to 1/3 of the moment. The counter weights balance each other completely for primary forces and couples and have no secondary forces/couple. Counter weights do not affect overall engine balance and vibration. There is no benefit in having FCW crank over SCW. The SCW crank is always lighter and allows more rapid engine and vehicle acceleration but may need a heavier flywheel. FCW cranks are used on engines to save space as the piston has to clear the counter weight at bottom dead centre, SCW although only 25-33% larger to obtain the required couple would make the engine taller and the crankcase wider. For automotive use the switch from SCW to FCW is typically around 1.8-2.2L engine capacity. There are a few [...] "hybrid" [...] cranks (Nissan Z22, LD20), these have large counter weights in the SCW position that are as big as the crankcase and piston clearance permits and small counterweights in the remaining positions to produce the required couple. This gives the lightest crank that the crankcase space permits.|$|R
