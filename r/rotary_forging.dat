This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|E

Conical die with include angle of 170 0, i. e. skew angle of 5 0 was fabricated and experiments were performed using these dies on radial drilling machine.

The author has invented the <b>rotary</b> hammer <b>forging</b> (RHF) process to reduce such defects. RHF is a multi-axes compression process where the material is partially and incrementally deformed by the action of several repeated hammering blows, while the produced deformation region is swept through the whole area of the workpiece. The aim of the present work is to study the effects of rotational speed on the forgings produced by RPF and RHF to compare between the two processes. It has been found that as the rotational speed increases the mushroom effect is constant in RHF while it is greater and increases in RPF. As the rotational speed increases, the twist angle increases in both RHF and RPF, but it is bigger in RPF. These results demonstrate the benefits of using RHF instead of RPF...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two computer {{packages to}} simulate the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> process, {{by means of a}} mathematical model. The results are displayed in a graphical and numerical manner, showing the tool movement and the tool / workpiece interaction. The first package, PATH, is shown to be capable of simulating the motions of all known <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> systems. Its results show the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> tool path throughout a chosen process. The motions of any <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> system can be programed by a simple set of instructions displayed on the screen, and the results displayed quickly and graphically. The widely used motions of rocking - die <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> machines were investigated. From these investigations, formulae were put forward, which were shown to be capable of predicting the tool motion of any rocking - die <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> situation. The second package, PROFS, presents a meshed representation of the tools and workpieces used in <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> systems. The <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> tool is represented as a conic wire frame mesh, on which no forces or loads are considered to act. The workpiece is represented as a cylinder constructed from a number of hexahedral elements. The elements are treated in either a non - constant volume or a constant volume manner. The non - constant volume model workpiece is one which is simply cut away by the action of the tool on it. This model is similar to a process of 'rotary cutting'. Using the model, a technique of investigation into the progression of the contact geometries created during a real <b>rotary</b> <b>forging,</b> was developed. It enabled the progression and size of the contact geometry to be followed from start to finish of the forging cycle. No consideration of the loads or forces occurring during the process was taken into account. The constant model workpiece requires that its volume remains fixed during the simulation. This is achieved by a radial expansion of the elements of the workpiece as it is being 'deformed' by the tool. Again no consideration of the loads or forces occurring in <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> was taken into account. Investigations, using the model, enabled the instantaneous contact geometries, contact areas, and displaced volumes of material to be predicted during two real <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> processes. Results revealed the potential of PROFS, to determine areas of workpiece instability {{in the early stages of}} forging, and reveal ares of insufficient die fill. The potential of data from the simulations, to control a <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> machine, is discussed, and is seen as the first step towards the design and manufacture of <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> parts and dies by a C. A. D. - C. A. M. route. Contact areas produced during the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> process are essential for any calculations of the forces and stresses occurring in the die and workpiece. The possibility of PROFS to be used as a die / design tool and in pre production trials for new parts is discussed. A physical simulation of a non - constant volume model workpiece was carried out using a 'short lead milling' technique to cut away a solid workpiece. This revealed the instantaneous contact geometries and areas of the workpiece, which were shown to be accurately predicted by PROFS using the non - constant volume. The results confirmed the accuracy and validity of the simulated instantaneous geometries, allowing a large degree of confidence to be assumed in the accuracy of the package. A data base of radial, circumferential, and custom die profiles has been built up and incorporated into PROFS. From the data base a chosen profile can be used to generate a conic meshed representation of a <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> die. Investigations, using a die generated from a custom profile, revealed areas of possible workpiece instability. The two packages put forward in this thesis have been shown to be capable of simulating the motions and contact geometries of the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> process, and confirmed using physical and real <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> comparisons...|$|E

Using a quantitative approach, the software is shown to be capable of calculating the tool/workpiece instantaneous contact zone and the volume of material being removed. The software has been developed and used to produce an analysis of radially configurated conic tools. This is believed to be a unique approach to the simulation of the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> process. Various types of <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> machines can be identified by the motion of the conic tool and the hypothetical workpiece. A mathematical/ geometrical model is developed which can be used to simulate all possible <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> die motions. The model is used to determine the position in space of any point on the die, regardless of its motion and geometry. The software development has been used to graphically simulate the loci of points on a die, during movement of the die. The mathematical model is used to simulate a non-constant volume workpiece consisting {{of a large number of}} concentric cylinders of specified height and radius, with infinitesimal thickness. The interaction between tool and workpiece is achieved by using a method of geometric comparison. This allows an assessment of changes in the shape of the workpiece. Extension of the program, using a generated mesh, results in a numerical analysis of the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> process. The data generated from the simulation phase, incorporating some previously developed software, is used to calculate the instantaneous area of contact and the volume of material being removed.

40|$|Cold <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> is an {{innovative}} incremental metal forming process whose main characteristic {{is that the}} workpiece is only partially in contact with a conical tool, reducing therefore the required forging loads. However, in spite of many benefits of such a process, wide industrial implementation of <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> is not possible without proper understanding of material behaviour. In the present work, the capability of <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> process was explored for the manufacturing of flared cylindrical parts by cold forming. Another main aim {{was to assess the}} cold formability of high-strength materials for aerospace applications (martensitic stainless steels) under incremental processes. In order to understand the impact of <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> on the final properties of formed components, microstructural and mechanical analysis were performed. Microstructural and hardness analysis were conducted on both axial and transverse sections along the cold formed flange in order to study the grain flow orientation and strain distribution. In a similar fashion, mechanical test specimens were machined from different positions and orientations along the rotary forged component. Further analysis was performed on the components in the as-treated condition {{in order to understand the}} response of cold-worked Jethete M 152 components to subsequent heat treatments. Microstructural and hardness analysis clearly reveals a strong grain reorientation and strain localization around “pickup” defects (material attached to the upper tool) observed on the flange top surface, close to the flange edge. These results suggest that an excessive deformation is localized during the early stages of the flange formation. Another characteristic feature found in the rotary forged parts is the presence of a buckling phenomenon which appears in later stages of the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> process. Strain hardening along with the increasing flange length requires higher levels of forging loads to keep forming the flange. This results into a significant accumulation of compressive stresses in the transition region between the flange and the straight region. Gradually the resultant compressive force exceeds the critical buckling load, leading to the occurrence of the buckling phenomenon. This latter issue determines the limit of the cold flaring process. This can help to determine the maximum length of the flange part, achievable in this process, which is of great importance for the design of these manufacturing technologies. From the mechanical testing results, large differences were found as a function of both position and orientation (axial, transverse) throughout the rotary forged components (anisotropic properties). Concerning the impact of heat treatments on cold-worked components, no differences were found in the as-treated condition, in terms of microstructural and mechanical properties between regions with a large difference in strain distribution. These results denote the normalizing effect of conventional hardening treatments on cold-worked Jethete M 152 components, restoring the homogenous and isotropic properties across the whole componen...|$|E

The ceramic recuperator consists of 1. 5 inch outside diameter silicon carbide tubes with internal cruciform baffles to enhance heat transfer. A recuperator system for a 20 MM Btu/hr furnace was designed, fabricated, and installed in the flue gas of a <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> furnace at Cameron Iron Works, Inc., Houston, Texas. The system has operated successfully for about 2500 hours in the six months starting in November 1985. A maximum air preheat temperature of about 1900 ?F was achieved with a flue gas temperature of about 2100 ?F...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tantalum has {{characteristics}} such as excellent ductility, high corrosion resistance, high mechanical strength at high temperatures and high resistance to etching of acids and bases. Its high ductility allows the realization of large reductions {{without the need for}} intermediate heat treatment. A process for the production of tantalum wire is drawing. However, when using this process, the high ductility of the tantalum (Ta) metal causes a retention/accumulation of the Ta in the spinneret. Therefore, to be drawn is necessary that the tantalum is encapsulated in a copper tube. In this work was produced a Ta wire by means of <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> and drawing process. In the drawing process of the tantalum encapsulated in copper tube, was the appearance of striation on the surface of tantalum, when applied to an area reduction (AR) of approximately 22 %. This fact is possibly related to the different sliding systems with consequent formation of non-hydrostatic stress fields at the interface Cu / Ta. After an area reduction (AR) of 94 % the Cu was removed {{from the surface of the}} wire, through chemical etching, and this wire was drawn up to 0. 43 mm without retention/accumulation of the Ta in the spinneret...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to achieve Ti-β alloys without {{considerable}} toxic elements (Al and V) with lower elastic moduli to improve the mechanical compatibility with the bone (17 GPa- 35 GPa) [1, 2]. Ti- 35 Nb- 7 Zr and Ti- 41, 1 Nb- 7, 1 Zr alloys were produced in fusion by arc melting under argon atmosphere. The ingots, with the initial diameter of 18 mm were submitted to solution heat treatment, cool <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> and recrystallization treatment until 6 mm of diameter. The microstructural analyses were performed using Optical Microscopy, X-ray diffraction and hardness. The mechanical characterization was evaluated through uniaxial tensile tests. The results showed that properties are dependent on the compositions studied. Microstructure results indicated that both alloys are Ti-β. Ti- 35 Nb- 7 Zr in β-solution treated condition posses the lowest value of hardness (157 HV). Vickers hardness values for alloys within 35 Nb and 41, 1 Nb, in the recrystallization condition were very close 161 and 169 HV, respectively. The Ti- 35 Nb- 7 Zr alloy presented the lowest elastic modulus (54 GPa) and the highest ductility, based on reduction of area and elongation without change tensile strengt...|$|E
40|$|In a {{cooperative}} program with industrial superconducting wire manufacturers {{for the purpose}} of studying billet preparation and extrusion, a total of twenty billets were assembled. Fourteen of these contained no superconductor but were ''dummy'' billets to evaluate methods of stacking to achieve the best packing density. These billets were not extruded but were sectioned transversely and longitudinally for evaluation of billet preparation techniques. The remaining six billets were assembled with NbTi stacking elements in a copper/copper nickel matrix using a standard conductor configuration. Two of these billets were instrumented with thermocouples and used to evaluate preheating techniques. The other four were extruded and drawn to finished conductor size for critical current measurement. This study showed that hexagonal stacking elements, contoured billet jackets and hot isostatic pressing resulted in high density uniform billets for extrusion. <b>Rotary</b> <b>forging</b> was found to be unacceptable for billet compacting. Fast billet heating was achieved in both the salt bath and by induction heating, but the induction method gave a more uniform temperature distribution during the heating cycle. Asymmetry from poor packing density in the billet resulted in nonuniform filament size distributions and poor critical current performance. Billet yield was increased as much as 16 percent by contouring the stacking element positions within the billet. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The rotary {{compressor}} (crimping machine) is a machine designed for making hollow forgings. The {{rotary compressor}} is a prototype device {{designed and built}} at the Technical University of Lublin. The compressor is dedicated to perform laboratory tests related to the hollow forgings of various shapes using different materials. Since the rotary compressor is an experimental device, there is no control and acquisition data system available. The article presents the concept and {{the capabilities of the}} computer control and data acquisition system supporting rotary compressing process. The main task of software system is acquisition of force and kinetic parameters related to the analysed process of the <b>rotary</b> <b>forging</b> compression. The software allows the user to declare the course of the forming forgings. This system allows current recording and analysis of four physical values: feed rate (speed of working head movement), hydraulic oil pressure at inlet and outlet of hydraulic cylinder and the torque of engine. Application functions can be divided into three groups: the configuration of the pressing process, the acquisition and analysis of data from the pressing process and the recording and presentation of stored results. The article contains a detailed description about hardware and software implementation of mentioned functions...|$|E
