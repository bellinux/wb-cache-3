40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess {{the effect of the}} {{dissemination}} of scientific knowledge on HIV / AIDS in three aspects: knowledge about the disease, attitudes toward condom use and social representation of AIDS risk. The research was carried out with high school students and consisted of two studies: one on receipt of an informational video (active and passive reception) and one on a simulated case of a scientific controversy. The results showed that the video information, in the <b>condition</b> of active <b>reception,</b> is effective in increasing knowledge, but does not affect participants' attitudes regarding condom use. In the simulated case there was a significant increase in scientific knowledge and a favorable attitude was generated on the part of students. As for the social representations of AIDS risk, this research showed independent effects on the activation of elements of these representations. In the active <b>reception</b> <b>condition</b> participants associated AIDS risk with sex and prevention; in the passive reception, with sex and risk behaviors; and in the simulated case, with sex, treatment and prevention.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} {{electric}} field measurements recorded by DEMETER/ICE experiment above {{very low frequency}} (VLF) transmitter stations. The sun-synchronous orbits of the DEMETER satellite lead us to cover an invariant latitude range between- 65 • and + 65 • in a time interval of about 40 minutes. We select three ground-based transmitter stations localised in Australia (NWC, 19. 8 kHz), in Germany (DFY, 16. 58 kHz) and in Japan (JP, 17. 8 kHz). We analyse the complete set of data recorded from August 2004 to December 2010. We distinguish between the VLF signals observed when the satellite was on day-or night-sides of the Earth at about 22 LT and 10 LT, respectively. We characterize the <b>reception</b> <b>condition</b> of the VLF signal taking into consideration the satellite position above the transmitter stations. We find that the signal amplitude is increasing (up to a maximum) and decreasing (down to a minimum) in a time interval of about 12 days. This 'regular' reception of the VLF signal is a signature of quiet ionosphere behaviour above the transmitter stations. We discuss in our contribution about the time intervals where the VLF signals were almost not detected. The origins of the signal attenuation seem {{to be linked to}} the ionospheric perturbations due to the solar activity, the earthquake occurrences and the geomagnetic activity...|$|R
40|$|Emblematic (or symbolic) {{gestures}} allow {{individuals to}} convey a variety of thoughts and emotions ranging from approval to hostility. The use of such gestures involves the execution of a codified motor act by the addresser and its perception and decoding by the addressee. To examine underlying common and distinct neural correlates, we used fMRI tasks in which subjects viewed video clips of emblematic one-hand gestures. They were asked to (1) take {{the perspective of the}} addresser and imagine executing the gestures (“expression” condition), and to (2) take the perspective of the addressee and imagine being confronted with the gestures (“reception” condition). Common areas of activation were found in inferior frontal, medial frontal, and posterior temporal cortices with left-hemispheric predominance {{as well as in the}} cerebellum. The distinction between regions specifically involved in the expression or <b>reception</b> <b>condition</b> partly resembled the dorsal and ventral stream dichotomy of visual processing with junctions in inferior frontal and medial prefrontal cortices. Imagery of gesture expression involved the dorsal visual stream as well as higher-order motor areas. In contrast, gesture reception encompassed regions related to semantic processing, and medial prefrontal areas known to be involved in the process of understanding the intentions of others. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for a dissociation in representations of emblematic gesture processing between addresser and addressee in addition to shared components in language-related areas...|$|R

The performance of MISO in TU 6 for CD 3 [15] receiver is also given in [15]. A number of studies have discussed the performance evaluations and shown the benefit of Alamouti MISO transmission [11]. Actually, there are not any performance evaluations of SFN– MISO for 0 dB echo and TU 6 channel in DVB-T 2. The study in this article is targeted at this goal. More precisely, this article gives performance evaluations and comparison between a classical SFN network and a distributed SFN–MISO network depending on the number of transmitters using different coding rate and QAM modulation for a DVB-T 2 system and different <b>reception</b> <b>condition</b> (fixed and mobile). Our study and evaluation results seek to determine the transmission topologies, for which the usage of the Alamouti technique in an SFN network of different number of transmitters is efficient. Indeed, these results are very important for the broadcaster to be used for optimal network planning and management. Our obtained simulation results show the value of using the Alamouti technique in an SFN network based on two or three antennas in DVB-T 2.|$|R

At the output of the discriminator in the FM receiver, a deemphasis network restores the original signal power distribution.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} Chinese {{translations}} of Hoshi Shinichi’s fiction published between 1980 and 2014 with the publishing {{condition of the}} Japanese versions and discusses how the Chinese versions were received in China from three standpoints. 　First of all, by investigating the change or distribution type of the conditions of Hoshi Shinichi’s fiction over different years, which means the given examples of the Chinese translation collection, magazines and fiction in other publications, we can deduce how his fiction was received in China. Next, we put forward two features of the Chinese translations, namely, the translating boom period and the sudden change in the genre of works translated. Here we see the translation and publication of Hoshi’s works undergo boom and stagnation periods, and the works are categorized as either science fiction of short-short stories. Investigating the reasons behind these two features, we can put light {{on the characteristics of}} Chinese translations and their publication. In addition, the fact that Hoshi’s fiction is taken up in Chinese school 2 5 textbooks suggests the uniqueness of how it has been received in China. That is to say, Hoshi’s fiction is highly regarded in Chinese educational circles and his audience is becoming younger. By comparing the adoption of Hoshi’s fiction in both Chinese and Japanese school textbooks, we were able to analyze the reasons why the works were adopted and thus discuss the characteristics of his Chinese readers. 　To a conclusion, based on the materials which collected during 30 years from now on and produced by the Chinese translation and <b>reception</b> <b>condition</b> of Hoshi Shinichi’s fiction in China, this article is to interpret the 3 characters: the boom of the translating, the change of the works’ genera and the younger-age trend of the reception readers. 本論文は 1980 年から 2014 年までに中国で出版された中国語訳の星新一小説の状況と，日本における星新一小説の出版状況とを比較し，星新一小説の中国における受容の特徴を三つの面に分けて論ずるものである。第一に，中国語訳の作品集，雑誌及びその他の出版物に収録された星新一小説の翻訳点数と出版点数を挙げ，星新一小説出版の年代による変化や類型分布などの状況の分析を行い，それを通して中国における星新一小説の出版現状を明らかにする。第二に，星新一小説の中国における翻訳時期の集中及び翻訳された作品のジャンル区分の突然の変化という二つの特徴を取りあげる。すなわち，中国における星新一小説の翻訳及び出版には明らかにブームと停滞期があり，彼の作品を「SF」に分類するか「ショートショート」に分類するかという区分の変化も中国における独特の現象である。この二つの特徴の原因を分析し，星新一小説の中国語訳出版の特徴を論ずる。第三に，星新一の小説は中国で教科書に収録されたことに見られるように，中国における星新一小説の受容対象には顕著な特徴がある。すなわち，教育界からの高い評価を受けたことで，星新一小説の受容対象もより若くなる傾向があるのである。中日両国における星新一作品の教育用図書における採用状況を比較し，その原因を分析し，中国における星新一小説受容対象の特徴を論ずる。以上，本論文は，現在までの 30 年間に，中国における星新一小説の中国語訳及びその受容状況には，中国社会国有の特徴，すなわち，翻訳時期の集中，作品ジャンル区分の変化，および受容対象の低年齢化という三つの顕著な特徴が存在したことについて論述したものである...|$|R

Their <b>reception</b> and <b>conditions</b> present a case to depict the difference between the protection that Syrians receive in comparison to the other refugees, though they are all in need of humanitarian assistance. The number of Iraqis have increased following the IS incursions with the arrival of Yazidis and Christians (BGST, 2015). It is difficult to obtain exact figures in terms of their numbers. Nurcan Baysal proposed that the number of Yazidi refugees in Turkey would be around 18, 000 to 30, 000 – mostly hosted by the local governments in the region as well as the Yazidi communities who are Turkish citizens. Similarly, the Armenians of Syria leaving their lands in the face of IS incursions have been hosted by the Armenian community in Vakıflıköy, the only Armenian village in Turkey. Turkish security forces issued them with a type of a foreign-national certificate with which they can have access to healthcare services for births and operations, but only in hospitals within the region unlike nation-wide access for Sunnite Syrians.

A custom procedure of autonomous GPS positioning has been developed, boosting the positioning performance through appropriate processing of code and Doppler observations. Besides the common positioning procedures, robust estimation methods have been used to minimise the effects of gross observation errors. In normal conditions, differential GNSS yields good results, however, under adverse conditions, it fails to improve significantly the receiver 2 ̆ 7 s position. Therefore, a so-called conditional DGPS has been developed which determines the position differentially by using data from the strong signals only. These custom-developed procedures have been tested in different conditions in static and kinematic cases and the results have been compared to those processed by the receiver...|$|R
