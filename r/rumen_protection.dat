40|$|Six nonlactating Holstein cows {{fitted with}} rumen and {{duodenal}} cannula {{were used to}} determine the efficacy of pH sensitive fatty acid polymer encapsulation as a means protecting amino acids from rumen fermentation and as a post-ruminal amino acid delivery system. The cows were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial in a latin square design. Treatments were 1) the basal ration, and 2) basal ration plus rumen-protected lysine, methionine, and threonine at 10 g each per day. Rumen parameters measured were pH, ammonia, volatile fatty acids, protozoa, liquid, and dry matter rate of passage, total viable bacteria, and viable cellulolytic bacteria. Duodenal parameters measured were crude protein, ammonia, and amino acid concentrations. Total tract apparent digestibility of nutrients was measured. In addition, rumen degradation of the three amino acid products was measured by loss from nylon bags, in the rumen. Loss of product from nylon bags suggested the lysine and threonine products had no significant <b>rumen</b> <b>protection,</b> but that the methionine product had 3 ̆e 50...|$|E
40|$|Ruminants {{possess a}} unique {{digestive}} system. Using the high metabolic {{potential of the}} symbiotic microflora of the rumen, ruminants are capable of digesting plant material and obtaining nutrients and energy from this process. Because of the ruminal fermentation, the most bioactives are not stable in the harsh ruminal environment. Therefore {{there is a need}} to improve the bioavailability of a bioactive by protecting it from the ruminal digestion. The formulation of protected bioactive can be delivered in the rumen in a controlled manner and over a long period of time. In this project the degree of <b>rumen</b> <b>protection</b> was estimated using model substrates (sugar pellets and granules). These materials were coated with the pH-sensitive polymer Eudragit E. The model bioactive (phloridizin) was coated using the coating methodology adopted from exploratory studies with model substrates. The bioavailability of protected (coated) phloridizin was assessed by administering directly into the abomasum of fistulated cows. Formulation of protected phloridizin was used to demonstrate the feasibility of bioactive controlled delivery based on ART (Active Rumen Technology). This technology uses an elevated gas pressure created by a hydrogen-producing cell to drive a plunger which extrudes bioactive formulation from an intraruminal controlled-release device. Four groups of devices filled with formulation containing different amounts of protected phloridizin were tested. The bioactive was released in a controlled manner over several days. The formulation release profiles were reproducible suggesting that in principle the technology can be further developed to use in a commercial sense or for research purposes. The limitations of the technology, including formulation issues and gas diffusion through barrel walls, were identified...|$|E

Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 62, (2), 329 - 336. The declining consumption of ruminant products has been partly associated with their high proportion (but not necessarily content) of saturated fatty acids. Recent {{studies have focused on}} the less prominent fact that they are also important sources of beneficial fatty acids, including n- 3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids. ?-Linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) is of particular interest because it also contributes to improved flavour of beef and lamb. Many recent studies showed large effects of special concentrates on levels of fatty acids in milk and meat. However, the ?<b>rumen</b> <b>protection?</b> treatments, needed to ensure a worthwhile level of fatty acid in products, are expensive. Herbage lipids are the cheapest and safest source of these fatty acids and so breeding to increase delivery of fatty acids from plants into ruminant products is an important long-term strategy. Plant lipids usually contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3 which are the precursors of beneficial fatty acids. Whilst some plants are particularly rich in individual fatty acids (e. g. 18 : 3 n- 3 in linseed), there are also useful levels in grass and clover (Trifolium Spp.). Levels of fatty acids in forages in relation to species and varieties are considered, as well as management and conservation methods. Relationships between levels of fatty acids and existing traits and genetic markers are identified. The effects of forage treatments on the fatty acid content of ruminant products are reviewed. The higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk from cows fed clover silages show that the level of fatty acids in herbage is not the only factor affecting levels of fatty acids in ruminant products. Further effort is needed to characterise susceptibility of unsaturated fatty acids to oxidative loss during field wilting and biohydrogenation losses in the rumen, and the relative importance of plant and microbial processes in these losses. The pathways of lipolysis and lipid oxidation are reviewed and other plant factors which offer potential to breed for reduced losses are considered. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} given to {{ruminants}} are {{to a large}} extent hydrogenated to more saturated forms by microbial metabolism. Numerous protection technologies have been developed to overcome this hydrogenation process in order {{to increase the amount of}} unsaturated fatty acids bypassing the rumen and resulting in an effective transfer to the peripheral tissues. This review gives an overview of the current state of the art in rumen lipid bypass technologies, with the focus on both patent-described protection mechanisms, possible advantages or drawbacks of the technologies, and protection results being described in recent scientific literature. Lipid bypass techniques which are dealt with include calcium salts, fatty acyl amides, aldehyde treatment, non-enzymatic browning, lipid composite gels, and encapsulation within lipids. Further, the potential of a novel <b>rumen</b> lipid <b>protection</b> technology, based on interfacial cross-linking of emulsions, is explored. Therefore, an overview is given on current knowledge of different types of enzymatically induced cross-linking of protein at emulsion interfaces, both for existing food and possible ruminal bypass applications. Practical applications: Both from a human and animal health care as well as from a resource-saving and economic perspective, protection of PUFA from ruminal BH is of interest. Protection, release, and absorption principle of a lipophilic rumen bypass product: As polyunsaturated fatty acids (P) are hydrogenated to more saturated fatty acids (S) upon ruminal passage (panel A), P sources administered to ruminants have to be protected against microbial turnover to transfer them to the peripheral tissues (panel B) ...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryBarry J. BradfordDairy cows undergo many homeorhetic adaptations {{during the}} {{transition}} to lactation. Although many of the physiological processes - including increased lipolysis and postpartum inflammation - are adaptive, exaggerated responses can contribute to metabolic disease and reduced milk production. L-carnitine {{has been shown to}} increase hepatic oxidation of fatty acids and reduce hepatic lipid accumulation in early lactation cows; however, L-carnitine is degraded in the rumen. An experiment using 4 ruminally-cannulated Holstein heifers in a split plot design demonstrated that the relative bioavailability of L-carnitine was greater when delivered abomasally than ruminally. There was a dose × route interaction and a route effect for increases in plasma carnitine above baseline, with increases above baseline being greater across all dose levels (1, 3, and 6 g L-carnitine/d) when infused abomasally compared to ruminally. A second experiment used 56 lactating Holstein cows in a randomized complete block design to evaluate 2 rumen-protected products (40 COAT and 60 COAT) compared to crystalline L-carnitine at doses targeting 3 and 6 g/d carnitine. Although crystalline and 40 COAT were effective in linearly increasing carnitine concentrations, only subtle responses were seen for the 60 COAT, which were less than that for crystalline carnitine in plasma, milk, and urine. Ineffectiveness of rumen-protected products to increase carnitine concentrations beyond crystalline may have been due to over-encapsulation that hindered liberation of the carnitine and its absorption in the small intestine. Although L-carnitine has the potential to reduce postpartum hepatic lipidosis, effective <b>rumen</b> <b>protection</b> of L-carnitine while maintaining intestinal availability needs further investigation. Plant polyphenols have anti-inflammatory properties and when administered {{during the transition}} period, have been shown to increase milk production. An experiment used 122 multiparous Holstein cows in a randomized block design to determine the effect of short term (5 -d; SBE 5) and long term (60 -d; SBE 60) administration of Scutellaria baicalensis extract (SBE) on whole-lactation milk yield, 120 -d milk component yield, and early lactation milk markers of inflammation. Whole-lactation milk yield was increased for SBE 60 compared to control, but was not different for SBE 5 compared to control. Greater total pellet intake, milk lactose yield, and reduced SCC during wk 1 - 9 for SBE 60 compared to control, all could have contributed to the observed sustained increase in milk yield. Milk production parameters were not different for SBE 5 compared to control. No treatment effects were observed for BCS or milk markers of inflammation (haptoglobin) and metabolic function (β-hydroxybutyrate). Overall, long term administration of S. baicalensis effectively increased milk production, however the mechanism by which this was achieved is unknown. Although routes of administration to effectively achieve their physiological responses were different between L-carnitine (abomasal delivery) and SBE (feeding), both bioactive nutrients can improve the metabolic function of early lactation dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|Current gas-based {{in vitro}} {{evaluation}} systems are extremely powerful research techniques. However {{they have the}} potential to generate a great deal more than simple fermentation dynamics. Details from four experiments are presented in which adaptation, and novel application, of an in vitro system allowed widely differing objectives to be examined. In the first two studies, complement methodologies were utilised. In such assays, an activity or outcome is inferred through the occurrence of a secondary event rather than by direct observation. Using an N-deficient incubation medium, the increase in starch fermentation, when supplemented with individual amino acids (i. e., known level of N) relative to that of urea (i. e., known quantity and N availability), provided an estimate of their microbial utilisation. Due to the low level of response observed with some arnino acids (notably methionine and lysine), it was concluded, that they may not need to be offered in a rumen-inert form to escape rumen microbial degradation. In another experiment, the extent to which degradation of plant cell wall components was inhibited by lipid supplementation was evaluated using fermentation gas release profiles of washed hay. The different responses due to lipid source and level of inclusion suggested that the degree of <b>rumen</b> <b>protection</b> required to ameliorate this depression was supplement dependent. That in vitro inocula differ in their microbial composition is of little interest per se, as long as the outcome is the same (i. e., that similar substrates are degraded at comparable rates and end-product release is equivalent). However where a microbial population is deficient in a particular activity, increasing the level of inoculation will have no benefit. Estimates of hydrolytic activity were obtained by examining fermentation kinetics of specific substrates. A number of studies identified a fundamental difference between rumen fluid and faecal inocula, with the latter having a lower fibrolytic activity, which could not be completely attributed to microbial numbers. The majority of forage maize is offered as an ensiled feed, however most of the information on which decisions such as choice of variety, crop management and harvesting date are made is based on fresh crop measurements. As such, an attempt was made to estimate ensiled maize quality from an in vitro analysis of the fresh crop. Fermentation profiles and chemical analysis confirmed changes in crop composition over the growing season, and loss of labile carbohydrates during ensiling. In addition, examination of degradation residues allowed metabolizable energy (ME) contents to be estimated. Due to difficulties associated with starch analysis, the observation that this parameter could be predicted by difference (together with an assumed degradability), allowed an estimate of ensiled maize ME to be developed from fresh material. In addition, the contribution of the main carbohydrates towards ME showed the importance of delaying harvest until maximum starch content has been achieved. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
