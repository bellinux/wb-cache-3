They are often augmented by fans in the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> ("return fans") pushing the air into the AHU.|$|E
50|$|Sound masking {{speakers}} can {{be placed}} under raised floors in offices that utilize them. To carry the weight above, the floor material is structurally strong and offers high attenuation of any sound below it. Experience has shown {{that not only is}} the uniformity of the sound above exceptionally good, but occupants are hard pressed to determine where the sound source is located (good diffusion -See Section 3.7.6). The figure on the right shows masking sound levels at 48 inches above the floor; they are all within 1 dB of each other. One direction is a line between the speakers; the other direction is a line lateral to the speakers starting at the midpoint. If the depth of the cavity is sufficient, normal sound masking speakers can be used, otherwise small speakers can be used; they fit into a cavity as small as 2 inches and radiate sound horizontally. If the cavity is used as a <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct,</b> care must be taken to shield the opening.|$|E
50|$|The plenum is {{the space}} between a {{suspended}} ceiling and the structural deck above it. Since most offices have such spaces, sound masking speakers are commonly added there. For open offices, uniformity of the sound masking in the inhabited area is important and is largely determined by the horizontal spacing of the masking speakers as described above. Speaker arrays are generally rectangular. They generally face upwards to reflect sound from the deck and broaden {{the distribution of the}} sound to create a more uniform sound field. The diagram on the right shows an example. For closed offices, uniformity of sound level is not an issue. Generally, ceiling tiles with a high transmission loss are recommended, those with CAC (Ceiling Attenuation Class) ratings of 30 or greater. This reduces the impact of sound masking in adjacent open areas which would have excessive levels in those offices. Typically the ceiling plenum is used as a <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> requiring an open grill. Sound masking in the plenum above a closed office can generate excessive levels. There are simple metal covers that are placed above the grille to reduce the impact of the hole. Available ones are sufficiently large so do not impede air flow. The upper figure n the left shows a masking speaker that mounts directly on the ceiling tile grid. The two lower figures are examples of speakers that are hung in the ceiling plenum. If the ceiling plenum is shallow, a low profile speaker is required. This speaker radiates sound horizontally rather than vertically to improve the uniformity of the masking in the occupied area below. An example is shown in the lower left figure.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{overhead}} mixing systems usually locate {{both the}} supply and <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> {{at the ceiling}} level. Supply air is supplied at velocities higher than typically acceptable for human comfort and the air temperature may be lower, higher, or the same as desired room temperature depending on the cooling/heating load. High-speed turbulent air jets incoming supply air mix with the room air.|$|R
50|$|Electric heaters {{are usually}} {{part of a}} fan oil {{which is part of}} a central air conditioner. They {{circulate}} heat by blowing air across the heating element which is supplied to the furnace through <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts.</b> Blowers in electric furnaces move air over one to five resistance coils or elements which are usually rated at five kilowatts. The heating elements activate one at a time to avoid overloading the electrical system. Overheating is prevented by a safety switch called a limit controller or limit switch. This limit controller may shut the furnace off if the blower fails or if something is blocking the air flow. The heated air is then sent back through the home through supply ducts.|$|R
50|$|Humidity {{occurs in}} indoor environments due to {{building}} related causes. Porous walls, rising damp, and leaks {{in the building}} are determinants for structural dampness due to elevated humidity levels. The construction of the building {{can also lead to}} humidity and unwanted moisture in the indoor environment. Wet materials, such as lumber stored unprotected outdoors before construction, can lead to increased humidity indoors for up to the second year of occupancy in the building. Most commonly in residences, elevated relative humidity is produced by poor drainage systems. This leads to dampness in substructures such as crawlspaces and basements. The dampness results in vaporization where water vapor is transmitted into the building's interiors. Water vapor may enter the building through supply <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> in building slabs and circulated by warm forced air. Water vapor can also enter a building through leaky <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> in homes with crawlspaces.|$|R

On the other hand, in {{the case that the}} sensors were equipped in the plant growing area, radiation to the sensors caused measurement error, and resulted in disturbing control action. To remove the influence of radiation, two types of shelter shielding the sensors against radiation were developed for feedback detection and equipped at the center of plant growing area.

50|$|UFAD systems {{capitalize}} on the natural stratification that occurs when warm air rises due to thermal buoyancy. In a UFAD design, conditioned air stays in the lower, occupied part of the room, while heat sources such as occupants and equipment generate thermal plumes, which carry the warm air and heat source generated pollutants towards the ceiling where they are exhausted through the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts.</b> The temperature stratification created by the UFAD system has implication for space setpoints. Most of an occupant's body is {{in an area that}} is colder than the temperature at the thermostat height; therefore, current practice recommends raising thermostat setpoints compared to traditional overhead systems. The optimal ventilation strategy controls the supply outlets to limit the mixing of supply air with room air to just below the breathing height of the space. Above this height, stratified and more polluted air is allowed to occur. The air that the occupant breathes will have a lower concentration of contaminants compared to conventional uniformly mixed systems.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore energy saving potential when wireless temperature sensor network is used in room temperature control when the room uses a mixing or displacement ventilation system. A typical classroom is selected for this study, inside which a number of wireless sensors will be installed at the breathing level to investigate the temperature profiles. By comparing with a traditional design of temperature control (i. e. temperature sensor is installed inside a <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct),</b> 22 % (216 m 3 /h) and 32 % (205 m 3 /h) of supply airflow rate can be saved in fully and half occupied conditions in the mixing ventilation without scarifying thermal comfort. In the displacement ventilation, even though there was no supply airflow rate saving in fully occupied condition, 15 % (86 m 3 /h) reduction in the supply airflow rate was achieved in half occupied condition. Therefore, the use of wireless temperature sensor network in a room temperature control may lead to a significant energy saving of the air-conditioning system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a project to resolve comfort problems created by high indoor humidity in a 3, 400 sq. ft. house in Bryan, Texas. The case study house had been certified by the local utility to meet their energy efficiency standards. However, the resident of the house complained that the house felt too humid although the desired temperature conditions were being maintained. Several HVAC contractors had been previously hired to resolve the problem without success. The field measurements undertaken to diagnose the problem are typical of those that could be undertaken by a house inspector and include an inspection {{of the construction of}} the house, short-term monitoring of temperature and humidity, blower door tests and whole-house pressurization tests. To perform the analysis both floors of the house were instrumented with portable data loggers and monitored for a period of two weeks to measure the temperature and relative humidity of the supply, return and ambient conditions. Analysis procedures applied to the house include comparing the measured data against the ASHRAE comfort zone (ASHRAE, 1997) which confirmed adequate zone temperatures with high humidity conditions, and inadequate supply air delivery temperatures for humidity removal. Combined results of the blower door tests and whole-house pressurization tests indicated a potential for leakage through the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> After the recommendations were presented to the homeowner, a new contractor was hired and retrofits applied on the house (i. e., cleaning the cooling coils, enlarging the compressor and relining of the return duct).

50|$|Smoke dampers are passive fire {{protection}} products used in air conditioning and ventilation ductwork or installed in physical smoke barriers (e.g., walls). This may be done {{to prevent the spread}} of smoke from the space of fire origin to other spaces in the same building.

Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|R

40|$|Background: High-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is the {{government}} program to supply electricity needs. However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT. Conclusion: Electromagnetic wave radiation of High-Voltage <b>Air</b> <b>Ducts</b> is not exceeded the allowed limit, so it will not cause a direct risk to health. ...|$|R
