60|$|Welch {{went to the}} door, and listened. The House was still. They {{settled down}} once more to work. Charteris lit the spirit-lamp, and began to prepare the meal. The others toiled painfully on at their <b>round-hand.</b> They {{finished}} almost simultaneously.|$|E
6000|$|That such {{should be}} the first letter that Nuttie ever {{addressed}} to Mr. Dutton, since the <b>round-hand</b> one in 'which Miss Ursula wished Mr. Duton to have the onner of a tee with me on my birthday, and I am your affected little Nuttie'! ...|$|E
60|$|But Theodora wished herself less {{necessary}} at home, when, in a {{few weeks}} more, she had to gather that matters were going on well from the large <b>round-hand</b> note, with nursery spelling and folding, in which Johnnie announced that he had a little brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Sublime and Beautiful are the Real; {{the only}} Ideal is the Ridiculous and Homely. Let us always {{remember}} this. Let us through life endeavor to personify the virtues, and always begin 'em {{with a capital}} letter. Let us, whenever we can find an opportunity, deliver our sentiments {{in the form of}} <b>round-hand</b> copies. Respect the Aged. Eschew Vulgarity. Admire Ourselves. Regard the Novelist." ...|$|E
60|$|The love of {{his home}} may be {{gathered}} {{from the fact that}} his letters have been preserved in an unbroken series, beginning from a country visit in 1834, after a slight attack of scarlet fever, written in the <b>round-hand</b> of a boy of seven years old, and finished off with the big Roman capitals FINIS, AMEN, and ending with the uncompleted sheets, bearing as their last date September 19, 1871.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe Fulmort {{sat in her}} own room. The {{little round}} clock on the mantelpiece pointed to eleven. The fire was low but glowing. The clear gas shone brightly on the toilette apparatus, and on the central table, loaded with tokens of occupation, but neat and orderly as the lines in the clasped volume where Phoebe was dutifully writing her {{abstract}} of the day's reading and observation, in childishly correct miniature <b>round-hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|In {{the large}} shining {{mahogany}} escritoire Mr. Osborne had a drawer especially {{devoted to his}} son's affairs and papers. Here he kept all the documents relating to him ever since {{he had been a}} boy: here were his prize copy-books and drawing-books, all bearing George's hand, and that of the master: here were his first letters in large <b>round-hand</b> sending his love to papa and mamma, and conveying his petitions for a cake. His dear godpapa Sedley was more than once mentioned in them. Curses quivered on old Osborne's livid lips, and horrid hatred and disappointment writhed in his heart, as looking through some of these papers he came on that name. They were all marked and docketed, and tied with red tape. It was--"From Georgy, requesting 5s., April 23, 18--; answered, April 25"--or [...] "Georgy about a pony, October 13"--and so forth. In another packet were [...] "Dr. S.'s accounts"--"G.'s tailor's bills and outfits, drafts on me by G. Osborne, jun.," [...] &c.--his letters from the West Indies--his agent's letters, and the newspapers containing his commissions: here was a whip he had when a boy, and in a paper a locket containing his hair, which his mother used to wear.|$|E
6000|$|So {{that when}} the day of {{departure}} came, between her two customs of laughing and crying, Miss Sedley was greatly puzzled how to act. She was glad to go home, and yet most woefully sad at leaving school. For three days before, little Laura Martin, the orphan, followed her about like a little dog. She had to make and receive at least fourteen presents--to make fourteen solemn promises of writing every week: [...] "Send my letters under cover to my grandpapa, the Earl of Dexter," [...] said Miss Saltire (who, by the way, was rather shabby). [...] "Never mind the postage, but write every day, you dear darling," [...] said the impetuous and woolly-headed, but generous and affectionate Miss Swartz; and the orphan little Laura Martin (who was just in <b>round-hand),</b> took her friend's hand and said, looking up in her face wistfully, [...] "Amelia, when I write to you I shall call you Mamma." [...] All which details, I have no doubt, JONES, who reads this book at his Club, will pronounce to be excessively foolish, trivial, twaddling, and ultra-sentimental. Yes; I can see Jones at this minute (rather flushed with his joint of mutton and half pint of wine), taking out his pencil and scoring under the words [...] "foolish, twaddling," [...] &c., and adding to them his own remark of [...] "QUITE TRUE." [...] Well, he is a lofty man of genius, and admires the great and heroic in life and novels; and so had better take warning and go elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|A {{man who has}} any {{heart in}} him values a genuine, little bit of home more than {{anything}} else you can give him. He can get French cooking at a restaurant; he can buy expensive wines at first-class hotels, if he wants them; but the traveler, though ever so rich and ever so well-served at home, is, after all, nothing but a man as you are, and he is craving something that doesn't seem like an hotel,--some bit of real, genuine heart life. Perhaps he would like better than anything to show you the last photograph of his wife, or to read to you the great, <b>round-hand</b> letter of his ten-year-old which he has got to-day. He is ready to cry when he thinks of it. In this mood he goes to see you, hoping for something like, home, and you first receive him in a parlor opened only on state occasions, and that has been circumstantially and exactly furnished, as the upholsterer assures you, as every other parlor of the kind in the city is furnished. You treat him to a dinner got up for the occasion, with hired waiters,--a dinner which it has taken Mrs. Smilax a week to prepare for, and will take her a week to recover from,--for which the baby has been snubbed and turned off, to his loud indignation, and your young four-year-old sent to his aunts. Your traveler eats your dinner, and finds it inferior, as a work of art, to other dinners,--a poor imitation. He goes away and criticises; you hear of it, and resolve never to invite a foreigner again. But if you had given him a little of your heart, a little home warmth and feeling,--if you had shown him your baby, and let him romp with your four-year-old, and eat a genuine dinner with you,--would he have been false to that? Not so likely. He wanted something real and human,--you gave him a bad dress rehearsal, and dress rehearsals always provoke criticism.|$|E
60|$|Rebecca, too, being now a relative, {{came in for}} {{the fullest}} share of Mrs. Bute's kind inquiries. This indefatigable pursuer of truth (having given strict orders that the door was to be denied to all emissaries or letters from Rawdon), took Miss Crawley's carriage, and drove to her old friend Miss Pinkerton, at Minerva House, Chiswick Mall, to whom she {{announced}} the dreadful intelligence of Captain Rawdon's seduction by Miss Sharp, and from whom she got sundry strange particulars regarding the ex-governess's birth and early history. The friend of the Lexicographer had plenty of information to give. Miss Jemima was made to fetch the drawing-master's receipts and letters. This one was from a spunging-house: that entreated an advance: another was full of gratitude for Rebecca's reception by the ladies of Chiswick: and the last document from the unlucky artist's pen was that in which, from his dying bed, he recommended his orphan child to Miss Pinkerton's protection. There were juvenile letters and petitions from Rebecca, too, in the collection, imploring aid for her father or declaring her own gratitude. Perhaps in Vanity Fair there are no better satires than letters. Take a bundle of your dear friend's of ten years back--your dear friend whom you hate now. Look at a file of your sister's! how you clung to each other till you quarrelled about the twenty-pound legacy! Get down the <b>round-hand</b> scrawls of your son who has half broken your heart with selfish undutifulness since; or a parcel of your own, breathing endless ardour and love eternal, which were sent back by your mistress when she married the Nabob--your mistress for whom you now care no more than for Queen Elizabeth. Vows, love, promises, confidences, gratitude, how queerly they read after a while! There {{ought to be a}} law in Vanity Fair ordering the destruction of every written document (except receipted tradesmen's bills) after a certain brief and proper interval. Those quacks and misanthropes who advertise indelible Japan ink should be made to perish along with their wicked discoveries. The best ink for Vanity Fair use would be one that faded utterly in a couple of days, and left the paper clean and blank, so that you might write on it to somebody else.|$|E

5000|$|From the italic scripts {{after the}} 16th century, more cursive forms evolved and {{were known as}} Copperplate script due to way the {{calligraphy}} books were printed and reached their height in the 18-19th century. The main examples were the Italian hand and the English <b>round-hand,</b> which in Britain were taught {{to men and women}} respectively, these scripts feature flowing letters which could be written with a single pen lift (with the exception of x and the marks added after writing the word which were dots on i and j and the bar of the ascender of t) with straight or looped ascenders and descenders. In Italy Italian hand is instead known as [...] "posata" [...] (posed).Several national styles of cursive were developed, such as Spencerian Script in the US. Despite the recent decline, in several countries cursive scripts are still taught in schools today, often modified to be more similar to roman type letters (tailless z, w-like instead of a 90° CW turned s for w, capitals without [...] "belly" [...] or swashes, forward-facing capital F etc.).|$|E
