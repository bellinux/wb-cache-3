40|$|The triple-axis {{equipment}} under X-ray {{grazing incidence}} diffraction {{was applied for}} the first time in order to realise high-resolution investigations of the morphology and the strain state in a free-standing lateral nanostructure on GaAs [001]. Because the defined wires containing a thin GaInAs single quantum well (SQW) are aligned along [110] we were able to determine the wire shape and their strain profile separately running either angular or radial scans across the (2 2 0) and (2 2 0) in-plane Bragg reflection. Assuming a trapezoedric shape, the inclination of the wire side walls and the etching depth became available <b>running</b> <b>rod</b> scans at different angular positions of the grating side peaks. All these information were obtained from different depths below the surface. The thickness of the GaAs layer covering the buried SQW was determined at the weak (2 0 0) reflection. For this particular sample we determined the lateral spacing D=(320 ± 4) nm and the etching depth te=(54 ± 2) nm from reciprocal space maps within the (q[220],q[001]) plane. The wire side walls are inclined by an angle γ= 18 ° with respect to the surface. The 5 nm thick GaInAs SQW buried under a tcap=(20 ± 2) nm thick GaAs cover layer induces dilatative strain mainly on top but rather compressive strain at the bottom of the wires...|$|E

50|$|All {{vertebrates}} {{are built}} along the basic chordate body plan: a stiff <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> through {{the length of}} the animal (vertebral column and/or notochord), with a hollow tube of nervous tissue (the spinal cord) above it and the gastrointestinal tract below.|$|R
50|$|This {{system is}} used on steam {{locomotives}} with fixed outer frames and coupled axles. Typically the conventionally driven wheels are in the centre and there are outer Klien-Lindner axles, front and rear. In this way the wheels, which are fixed to the hollow axles, are 'steered' by shafts that pivot on the frame when the locomotive is curve <b>running.</b> Coupling <b>rods</b> from the conventional driving wheels in the centre act on drive cranks on the inner axles fixed to the frame.|$|R

50|$|This {{treatment}} is only used when {{an orthopedic surgeon}} assigns it to restore the fractured bone to its original function. This method positions the bones to their exact location, {{but there is a}} risk for infection and other complications. The procedure involves the orthopedist performing surgery on the bone to align the bone fragments, followed by the placement of special screws or metal plates to the outer surface of the bone. The fragments can also be held together by <b>running</b> metal <b>rods</b> through the marrow {{in the center of the}} bone.|$|R
2500|$|However, the Panthers' {{strength}} {{on offense}} was their running game, led by running backs Stephen Davis and DeShaun Foster. Davis was the team's leading rusher with a franchise record 1,444 yards and 8 touchdowns, while Foster rushed for 429 yards and caught 26 passes for 207 yards. Carolina also had <b>running</b> back <b>Rod</b> Smart on their roster, who became widely {{known for his}} XFL debut jersey name [...] "He Hate Me" [...] during that league's only season in 2001. During 2003, Smart was primarily used as the Panthers' other kickoff returner, recording 947 yards and one touchdown.|$|R

25|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines with pistons, the camshaft {{is used to}} operate poppet valves. It consists of a cylindrical <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> {{the length of the}} cylinder bank with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The cam lobes force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism, as they rotate.|$|R
50|$|In piston engines, {{the valves}} are grouped into 'inlet valves' which admit the {{entrance}} of fuel and air and 'outlet valves' which allow the exhaust gases to escape. Each valve opens once per cycle {{and the ones that}} are subject to extreme accelerations are held closed by springs that are typically opened by <b>rods</b> <b>running</b> on a camshaft rotating with the engines' crankshaft.|$|R
5000|$|Quarter pipe - Literal {{quarter of}} a pipe. There is usually a narrow metal <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> {{the length of the}} top edge; this is called the coping.

50|$|The sword {{featured}} a 32.5 inches (826mm) long, slightly curved blade {{of what was}} known as the “pipe-back” or “quill-back” design. This consisted of a flat, un-fullered, single edged blade with a nearly straight <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> along the back of the blade, with a “false edge” being formed near to the tip. The blades were generally extensively decorated with etched, or occasionally blued and gilt, patterns.|$|R
50|$|Blahak {{was one of}} ten Huskers {{selected}} in the 1973 NFL Draft, taken in the eighth round by the Houston Oilers, the 183rd overall pick. He was claimed off waivers the next year by the Minnesota Vikings, where he played two years {{before going to the}} newly formed Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1976 NFL Expansion Draft. Blahak was an opening-day starter for the Bucs, but only played with the team for two games. He was one of two players cut to make room for newly signed receiver Morris Owens, and <b>running</b> back <b>Rod</b> McNeill. He was picked up {{toward the end of the}} season by the New England Patriots, and returned to the Vikings in 1977 before retiring.|$|R

In all vertebrates, the mouth is found at, or right below, the anterior end of the animal, while the anus opens to the exterior {{before the end of the}} body. The remaining part of the body continuing aft of the anus forms a tail with vertebrae and spinal cord, but no gut.|$|R
50|$|The SKS {{is easily}} field {{stripped}} and reassembled without specialized tools and the trigger group and magazine {{can be removed}} with an unfired cartridge. The rifle has a cleaning kit stored in a trapdoor in the buttstock, with a cleaning <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. The cap for the cleaning kit {{also serves as a}} cleaning rod guide, to protect the crown from being damaged during cleaning. In common with some other Soviet-era designs, it trades some accuracy for ruggedness, reliability, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost.|$|R
50|$|The two {{walkways}} {{were suspended}} from {{a set of}} 1.25 in diameter steel tie rods, with the second floor walkway hanging directly under the fourth floor walkway. The fourth floor walkway platform was supported on three cross-beams suspended by steel rods retained by nuts. The cross-beams were box girders made from C-channel strips welded together lengthwise, with a hollow space between them. The original design by Jack D. Gillum and Associates specified three pairs of <b>rods</b> <b>running</b> from the second floor to the ceiling. Investigators determined eventually that this design supported only 60% of the minimum load required by Kansas City building codes.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{arrangement is}} to use long coupling <b>rods,</b> <b>running</b> horizontally. A large vertical movement at the wheel end gives rise to only a small horizontal movement at the jackshaft drive. For a diesel-mechanical locomotive this can be compensated for by horizontally compliant mounting of the transmission. The heavy engine is carried over the drive wheels for adhesion weight, but the relatively lightweight gearbox can be mounted at one end, beyond the coupled wheelbase. A final drive casing is also narrow enough to mount between the frames, allowing it to be mounted low down and level with the driving axles.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{consists of}} one large room that was partitioned {{on the south}} end in the 1950s to create two Sunday school rooms. The roof support system is unique to southwest Alabama, and consists of a single truss with vertical tie <b>rods</b> <b>running</b> {{the length of the}} building, which is notched to be attached to the ceiling joists and diagonal trusses. This has caused the bottom chord to crack, and wood columns were added underneath the cracked portion. The original lath and plaster walls have been replaced with drywall, but the original heart pine flooring is intact.|$|R
50|$|No day {{has been}} {{established}} as to when the first bicycle pump was invented, but it {{is believed to have}} been in or around 1887, which is when the first inflatable tire or pneumatic tire was produced by John Boyd Dunlop of Scotland. The first bicycle pump consisted of a metal cylinder that had a metal <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> down the middle of it. This would have forced the air out of the cylinder and then sucked in new air when the metal rod was pulled up again. Many modern pumps use a very similar method, while some, such as the electric pumps, use an automated pumping mechanism.|$|R
40|$|This {{work will}} further {{investigate}} {{the validity of}} Damage Avoidance Design systems through an experimental and computational study of a 80 % scale sub-assembly. A coupler system is implemented whereby high strength unbonded threaded <b>rods</b> <b>running</b> through the beams are coupled to rods within the columns. The threaded rods are post-tensioned and additional energy dissipation devices are installed. Precast and cast insitu solutions are considered. A multi-level seismic performance assessment is conducted considering three performance objectives related to occupancy and collapse prevention. Bi-directional quasi-static cyclic tests and quasi-earthquake displacement tests are performed. Critical earthquakes are selected using a probabilistic computational method. Results indicate the DAD system satisfies all performance objectives. Further design improvements are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{steam railcar}} had a driving {{position}} {{at both ends}} so it could run in either direction without been turned, or for a locomotive to run round its carriages at a terminus. Control from the rear end was normally by a wheel connected to the regulator by a continuous wire in or above the roof space or a <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> under the floor. The driver was provided with brake and whistle controls, and some means of communicating with the fireman, who stayed on the footplate. This was normally by a bell code and required a 'passed fireman' who was qualified to act as driver. Unpowered carriages could also be attached and some had control equipment.|$|R
5000|$|DR, damper rod. This is a <b>rod</b> <b>running</b> {{from the}} left or bass end of the action to the right {{as far as the}} dampers are {{continued}} in the treble. It is acted upon by the [...] "loud" [...] or damper pedal, which raises the outer projection, and by being hinged to the main rail about the same height as this projection, the entire rod is thrown outward against the lower ends of the damper levers, releasing all the dampers simultaneously. This being the only office of the right pedal, it is readily seen that this pedal does not increase the loudness, but simply sustains any number of tones struck successively, giving the effect of more volume.|$|R
50|$|Grambling <b>running</b> back <b>Rod</b> Tureaud {{opened the}} scoring with {{touchdown}} runs {{of one and}} 56-yards to give the Tigers a 14-0 lead. Tureaud was injured later in the period, and his replacement Lee Fobbs answered with a 55-yard touchdown run to give Grambling a 21-0 lead {{at the end of}} the first quarter. Central opened the second quarter with their only points of the game coming on an eight-yard Garvin Stone touchdown pass to Jeff Inmon to cut the lead to 21-6 only to see Grambling respond with another pair of touchdowns before the half. Matthew Reed hit Jackie Jefferson for a 14-yard touchdown reception and Steve Dennis intercepted a Stone pass and returned it 70-yards for a score as time expired to give the Tigers a 35-6 lead at the half. After extending their lead to 42-6 in the third on a five-yard Reed pass to Oliver Alexander, Grambling scored another pair of touchdowns in the fourth. Herman Christophe scored on a 24-yard run and Eartha Reeves scored the game's final points in a one-yard run to make the final score 56-6. For their performances, Reed was selected as the offensive MVP and linebacker Walt Baisy was selected as the defensive MVP of the game.|$|R
