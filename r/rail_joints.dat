5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach {{blame to}} the Southern Railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No.A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> although the entire class operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success in operating the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder Wclass of 1932.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} reasons for railway traffic accidents is the fatigue failure of the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bolt. Therefore, the research on the fatigue properties of <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bolt has important practical significance. This paper analyzed the influence of different pre-tightening torque on the fatigue life of the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bolt. Besides, the best pre-tightening torque of the bolt was acquired through theoretical calculations. Finally, the fatigue life of the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bolt was predicted according to the relevant basic theory and methods of fatigue life analysis, which applied numerical simulation technology...|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, it {{points out that}} the {{magnetic}} field above the normal <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> is not homogeneous, and this magnetic field inhomogeneity will affect running performance of the levitated vehicle. Therefore, the mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> are put forward to improve the magnetic field to ensure the vehicle operate stable in a comparatively homogeneous magnetic field, as shown in Fig.  3 b, c, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Realizing an {{appropriate}} structure parameter {{is a significant}} way to improve homogeneity of magnetic field above a <b>rail</b> with certain <b>joint</b> gap. In order to improve the magnetic field as homogeneous as possible, structure optimizations of the mitered <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> and the overlapped <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> are further explored.|$|R
25|$|Maintenance of {{the line}} was improved, {{inspection}} techniques and jointing methods were revised, and plans for replacing jointed track by continuous welded rail were accelerated. Concrete sleepers were banned at <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> on the Southern Region.|$|E
25|$|The R22s were {{fitted with}} {{different}} types of brake shoes, to see which one would negotiate the <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> better. It was eventually found that the automated trip took 10 seconds longer than manual operation (about 95 seconds, compared to 85 seconds). As the tests on the Sea Beach line progressed, grade time stops were added to ensure safety on the line, and on the 42nd Street line. The train was dubbed SAM, and was to operate on Track 4 of the shuttle line.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track was}} of the Winby and Levick system and {{consisted}} of flat-bottomed, grooved tramway-type rails laid longitudinally on broad iron plates, which in turn rested on consolidated macadam or other road material; this was believed {{to make up a}} sufficient foundation without concrete. Nottingham was the first installation of this newly patented system. The base plates were 12inches wide and inch thick in lengths 11 feet 11inches long, and were laid continuously {{in order to avoid the}} plate joints and the <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> coming together, as the rails were in [...] lengths. [...] The base plate length of 11ft 11inches and track length of [...] would allow a run of nearly two miles of track before the plate joints and the <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> came together] ...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue life {{estimates}} {{can be used}} {{to guide}} the selection of inspection intervals for <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bars in service. A three-dimensional finite element model for <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bars is developed and dynamic load is applied to estimate the fatigue life of the joint bars. Different components of the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bars are being created separately and assemble in Autodesk Inventor. The model consists of assembly of the <b>rail,</b> <b>joint</b> bars, bolts, nuts, washers, and wheel. A three-dimensional finite element analysis of <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> bars is carried out in ANSYS after importing from Autodesk Inventor. The static and dynamic loads are being applied to estimate fatigue life and endurance strength at the section. The material properties of the rail and wheel are assumed to be same. The material properties of the wheel and rail are considered to be bilinear kinematic hardening in ANSYS. All the material properties and boundary conditions are being applied strictly as per the guidelines made available by the Indian Railways in their manual...|$|R

2500|$|Another use for battery {{locomotives}} is {{in industrial}} facilities where a combustion-powered locomotive (i.e., steam- or diesel-powered) {{could cause a}} safety issue due to the risks of fire, explosion or fumes in a confined space. Battery locomotives are preferred for mines where gas could be ignited by trolley-powered units arcing at the collection shoes, or where electrical resistance could develop in the supply or return circuits, especially at <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground. An early example was at the Kennecott Copper Mine, Latouche, Alaska, where in 1917 the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two battery locomotives of [...] tons.|$|E
2500|$|Fishplates {{are usually}} [...] long, used in pairs {{either side of}} the rail ends and bolted {{together}} (usually four, but sometimes six bolts per joint). The bolts may be oppositely-oriented so that {{in the event of a}} derailment and a wheel flange striking the joint, only some of the bolts will be sheared, reducing the likelihood of the rails misaligning with each other and exacerbating the seriousness of the derailment. This technique is not applied universally, European practice being to have all the bolt heads on the same side of the rail. Small gaps which function as expansion joints are deliberately left between the rail ends to allow for expansion of the rails in hot weather. European practice was to have the <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> on both rails adjacent to each other, while North American practice is to stagger them.|$|E

50|$|Whether or {{not there}} is {{cancellation}} of indebtedness income can sometimes be ambiguous and controversial. In Commissioner v. <b>Rail</b> <b>Joint</b> Co., a corporation issued its own bonds as a dividend to its shareholders. When the bonds declined in value, <b>Rail</b> <b>Joint</b> repurchased them for less than their face amount. Ordinarily, retiring bonds for less than the issue price would result in taxable canceled debt. However, in holding that there was no COD for <b>Rail</b> <b>Joint,</b> the court noted that, unlike in a normal issuance of corporate debt for cash consideration, the original issuance of these bonds as dividends did not increase the capital of the corporation and did not create burdened assets to be later freed by the cancellation.|$|R

50|$|Unlike track circuits, axle {{counters}} {{do not require}} insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> to be installed. This avoids breaking the continuity of long welded rails for insulated joints to be inserted.|$|E

In particular it focuses on the results of data obtained through field strain gauge and accelerometer measurements of in-service Insulated <b>Rail</b> <b>Joint</b> Tie Plates. These measurements have identified a significant variability in the strains present in similar joints operating under identical load conditions. This variability in stress invariably has a significant influence on the life of the joints. The results of rainflow counting and a fatigue analysis are also presented...|$|R

50|$|The IRS has {{formally}} non-acquiesced to the <b>Rail</b> <b>Joint</b> doctrine, {{arguing that}} what really happens {{in these situations}} is a constructive dividend and purchase: The corporation constructively issues a cash dividend to shareholders, who then contribute that cash back to the corporation {{in exchange for the}} bonds; the burdened asset is thus the constructively re-contributed cash. <b>Rail</b> <b>Joint</b> is nonetheless good law, and has been expanded to encompass other situations where the taxpayer received nothing of value in exchange for the debt, such as when a guarantor of a loan who did not enjoy the benefit of the loan settles it for less than the face amount.|$|R
50|$|Even though {{fishplates}} {{strengthen the}} weak points represented by <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> improvements {{can still be}} made. For example, the joints can be welded together using the thermite welding process. In 1967, at Hither Green on the Southern Region of British Railways, a major disaster occurred when a rail fractured at its fishplate joint. Welded Rail installation was sped up due to this error, with strict procedures on concrete and wooden Sleepers.|$|E
50|$|From {{the very}} start of light rail service, in 1959, there were {{complaints}} about rough riding followed by continual improvements to the track. While the ride was generally satisfactory at 30 MPH, many operators went faster. At least one news report, in response to riders encountering almost violent side-to-side swaying of the cars, mentioned a 35 MPH speed limit imposed by the MBTA management. (A PCC car can reach nearly 50 MPH on level track.) Also, continuously welded <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> were gradually introduced.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effects of axle load and train speed at <b>rail</b> <b>joint.</b> A three-dimensional finite element analysis of a rail/wheel contact is conducted on the <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> section of track and dynamic load is applied to develop an estimate respective stresses at the section. In Autodesk Inventor, different components of wheel/rail assembly i. e. wheel, <b>rail,</b> <b>joint,</b> bars, nuts, bolts, and washers are created separately then all components are assembled, and create a complete model of wheel/rail assembly. The finite element program ANSYS is used to model the contact analysis. This ANSYS is used to simulate the loading and boundary conditions of the rail and wheel contact for a stress analysis. Material properties are assumed to be same for rail and wheel, and considered to be bilinear kinematic hardening in ANSYS. A 3 -D finite element model for element model for wheel/rail rolling contact is developed on the most critical section of rail track i. e., <b>rail</b> <b>joint</b> to calculate elastic-plastic finite element analysis and 3 D stress response in the contact region. These models should be accurately calculating the 3 D stress response in the contact region. The reason for this study is to investigate possible changes in rail and wheel contact design in order to improve the performance of the rail track. Obtained results indicate that the von mises stresses, the maximum shear stress and the Equivalent elastic strain are increases linearly with increasing axle load and the effect of train speed on abov...|$|R
