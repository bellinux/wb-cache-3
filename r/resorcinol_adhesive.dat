50|$|The soft red-brown timber has a tight, {{straight}} grain and few knots. It is valued for its distinct appearance, aroma, and its high natural resistance to decay, being extensively used for outdoor {{construction in the}} form of posts, decking, shingles, and siding. It is commonly used for the framing and longwood in lightweight sail boats and kayaks. In larger boats it is often used in sandwich construction between two layers of epoxy resin and/or fibreglass or similar products. Due to its light weight— dried—it is about 30% lighter than common boat building woods, such as mahogany. For its weight it is quite strong but can be brittle. It glues well with epoxy resin or <b>resorcinol</b> <b>adhesive.</b>|$|E

30|$|Glued {{laminated}} timbers (glulam) or planks 50 mm thick {{were added}} to structural steel columns and beams as covering materials. The wood used in the glulam was sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) laminated with <b>resorcinol</b> resin <b>adhesive</b> between woods and epoxy resin adhesive between wood and steel. The 50 mm thick planks of sugi around the steel were fixed with spirally threaded nails (screws), and 25 mm long wood plugs were used to cover {{the tops of the}} nails. The 50 mm thick glulam showed 1 h of fire resistance. The temperatures of the flanges and webs of steel were 100 °C at 1 h and 200 °C after 4 h. The epoxy resin used to bond the wood and steel was an appropriate adhesive from a recycling perspective because it is easy to separate or peel from the steel.|$|R
30|$|Sugi five-ply glued-laminated-timbers (GLT) were {{manufactured}} using 3 <b>resorcinol</b> resin <b>adhesives,</b> 3 water-based-polymer-isocyanate resin adhesives, and vinyl-acetate {{emulsion adhesive}} (VAE). GLTs {{were treated with}} wood preservative, ACQ (Alkaline Copper Quaternary), and exposed under outdoor conditions with their glue-layers positioned horizontally for 10  years. After 1, 3, 5, and 10  years of exposure, block-shear test were conducted and deterioration of GLT according to position was investigated. Residual ratio of shear-strength increased in order of south-side, north-side, and middle of south-side and north-side positions. Deterioration rates of shear-strength at south-side were larger than those at north-side. Decrease and deterioration rate of shear-strength were large at upper glue-layers, and this was conspicuous in VAE with low adhesion durability. Wood-failure ratio decreased at the first glue-layer of VAE after 5  year of exposure. However, in other adhesive resins, differences of wood-failure ratio among position or glue-layers were small regardless of exposure duration.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluated}} the structural behavior of porticos made from eucalyptus glued boards, using wood of Eucalyptus sp and <b>resorcinol</b> formaldehyde <b>adhesive.</b> Three units, in real scale, of tri-articulated straight porticos, with a 5 meter porthole and a 26 º inclination, capable to support tiles covering placement were designed, constructed {{and subjected to}} load testing, until rupture. The amount of adhesive used {{in the construction of}} the porticos was 250 g/m 2 and the bonding pressure of 1. 3 MPa. The Hankinson model was employed as an estimator of the glued joints strength, under different angles between the fibers. The average value for the last resistance of the structures was 4. 63 times the design load, according to the criteria established by the ABNT, 1997.

30|$|Five-ply sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D.Don) glued-laminated timbers were {{manufactured}} {{using three}} <b>resorcinol</b> resin <b>adhesives,</b> three aqueous polymer-isocyanate resin adhesives, and a vinyl acetate-based resin emulsion adhesive (VAE). They were impregnated with wood-preservative (ACQ), and exposed under outdoor conditions with their glue-layers at level position for ten years. Block-shear {{tests were conducted}} after 1, 3, 5, and 10  years of exposure. After 10  years of exposure, significant differences were recognized for shear-strength among adhesive resins {{as the result of}} analysis of coefficient variance (AOCV). Results for pair-comparison of AOCV between adhesive resins, showed significant differences in four pair-comparisons and those included VAE. Standard deviations of shear-strength tend to increase with exposure year, and for VAE they were larger than for the others. Results of goodness-of-fit tests of shear-strength for normal, log-normal, 2 P-Weibull, and 3 P-Weibull distributions, showed that none of these forms fit VAE after 1  year of exposure. Wood-failure ratio decreased gradually with exposure duration; however, even after 10  years of exposure, it was more than 80 % regardless of adhesive resin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} predict the service life of plywood heating floors, {{dry-heat}} exposure test of lauan plywood made with each of six type of typical wood adhesives was carried out at 50 °, 70 °, 100 ° and 150 °C for 250 days. Internal bond strength and location of failure of the exposed specimens were measured at selected intervals. Data were plotted {{as a function of}} the exposed time. Confidence limit was applied on the regression and the service life was calculated by extraporating the lower confidence limit curve to the half-strength. The apparent mechanism of dry-heat degradation of plywood in 1500 and 100 °C seemed to differ from the lower temperature exposures. On 70 ° and 50 °C, more conservative estimation was made by the kinetic method on the Arrhenius relationship. The result showed the detrimen-tal effect of the acid catalyst on polyvinyl-acetate cross-linked and urea resin adhesives. Plywood specimens produced with melamine, phenol, phenol-resorcinol, and <b>resorcinol</b> resin <b>adhesives</b> showed excellent durability in dry-heat exposure at temperature normally found in service of floor heating...|$|R

30|$|Thirty-five-year-old Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) {{plantation}} timber was {{harvested from}} Hsinchu Forest District, Taiwan Forestry Bureau. The size of laminae was 38  ×  140  mm after being sawn, kiln-dried, and planed. The average width of growth ring was 5.5  ±  2.2  mm, and moisture {{content of the}} sawn lumber was 11.0  ±  0.3  % with density of 480  ±  60  kg m− 3. A <b>resorcinol</b> phenol formaldehyde <b>adhesive</b> (RPF) and a hardener of para-formaldehyde mixed {{at a ratio of}} 15 : 100 to RPF were used for the glulam lamination.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the formulae and {{finite element analysis}} models for predicting the Modulus of Elastic (MOE) and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) of Cathay poplar finger-jointed glulam. The formula of the MOE predicts the MOE of Cathay poplar glulam glued with one-component polyurethane precisely. Three formulae are used to predict the MOR, and Equation (12) predicts the MOR of Cathay poplar glulam precisely. The finite element analysis simulation results of both the MOE and MOR {{are similar to the}} experimental results. The predicted results of the finite element analysis are shown to be more accurate than those of the formulae, because the finite element analysis considers the glue layers, but the formulae do not. Three types of typical failure modes due to bending were summarized. The bending properties of Cathay poplar glulam were compared to those of Douglas fir glulam. The results show that Cathay poplar glulam has a lower stiffness, but a marginally higher strength. One-component polyurethane adhesive is shown to be more effective than <b>resorcinol</b> formaldehyde resin <b>adhesive</b> for Cathay poplar glulam.

40|$|Finger {{jointing}} of unseasoned Norway Spruce was {{studied with}} respect to tensile strength, adhesive penetration and durability. Finger joints were manufactured with 1) unseasoned wood and one component polyurethane (PUR) adhesive, 2) dried wood and PUR adhesive and 3) dried wood and phenol <b>resorcinol</b> formaldehyde (PRF) <b>adhesive.</b> Two levels of wood density were used. The tensile strength of the finger joints was determined and the deformations within the joint were studied with an optical measurement system (ARAMIS). The penetration of the adhesive was studied with x-ray microtomography. The durability of the joints was determined according to the standard ASTM D 4688. The {{results show that the}} tensile strength and the durability of green glued finger joints are on the same level as that of dry glued PUR joints. The penetration of the PUR adhesive is high in the unseasoned wood and cavities within the bonds seem to be smaller than in dry glued PUR joints. The tensile strength of the finger joints is dependent on density, independent on the adhesive system used. The strength of the green glued PUR adhesive bonds in finger joints measured with small scale specimens did not differ from the strength of the dry glued PUR bonds. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the adhesive properties of an in-house amino-propyltrimethoxysilane-methylenebisacrylamide (APTMS-MBA) siloxane system and compare them with a commercially available adhesive, n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA). The ability of the material to perform as a soft tissue adhesive was established by measuring the physical (bond strength, curing time) and biological (cytotoxicity) properties of the adhesives on cartilage. Complementary physical techniques, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and infrared imaging, enabled the mode of action of the adhesive to the cartilage surface to be determined. Adhesion strength to cartilage was measured using a simple butt joint test after storage in phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37 °C for periods up to 1 month. The adhesives were also characterised using two in vitro biological techniques. A live/dead stain assay enabled a measure of the viability of chondrocytes attached to the two adhesives to be made. A water-soluble tetrazolium assay was carried out using two different cell types, human dermal fibroblasts and ovine meniscal chondrocytes, in order to measure material cytotoxicity as a function of both supernatant concentration and time. IR imaging of the surface of cartilage treated with APTMS-MBA siloxane adhesive indicated that the adhesive penetrated the tissue surface marginally compared to nBCA which showed a greater depth of penetration. The curing time and adhesion strength values for APTMS-MBA siloxane and nBCA adhesives were measured to be 60 s/ 0. 23 MPa and 38 min/ 0. 62 MPa, respectively. These materials were found to be significantly stronger than either commercially available fibrin (0. 02 MPa) or gelatin <b>resorcinol</b> formaldehyde (GRF) <b>adhesives</b> (0. 1 MPa) (P < 0. 01). Cell culture experiments revealed that APTMS-MBA siloxane adhesive induced 2 % cell death compared to 95 % for the nBCA adhesive, which extended to a depth of approximately 100 - 150 μm into the cartilage surface. The WST- 1 assay demonstrated that APTMS-MBA siloxane was significantly less cytotoxic than nBCA adhesive as an undiluted conditioned supernatant (P < 0. 001). These results suggest that the APTMS-MBA siloxane may be a useful adhesive for medical applications...|$|R
