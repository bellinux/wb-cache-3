40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new satellite-based propagation experiment, planned {{to start in}} the 2011, foreseeing the collection of simultaneous attenuation and depolarisation measurements during a 3 -years period in Italy and possibly in many locations in Europe; the experiment, called TDP# 5 /Alphasat, is the initiator of a more comprehensive roadmap that will arrive to a Final Operational Mission (MOR) consisting in a very large Telecommunication infrastructure (called Broadband Distributed Users Access - BDUA) whose radio-bases will operate in the Q/V bands (service links) while the final users terminals in the ka bands (user links). This roadmap foresees a second milestone (after the TDP# 5 /Alphasat one) called "Missione Sperimentale Combinata" (MSC) whose task {{will be the one}} to test the critical technologies and techniques of the MOR. The whole program, called TRANSPONDERS, aims at demonstrating the effectiveness of a new TLC systems design philosophy foreseeing the application of a set of "propagation impairment mitigation techniques" to contrast the strong atmospheric attenuations foreseen at mm waves without resorting to excessive (and expensive) power expenditures. The present paper concentrates on the TDP# 5 /Alphasat mission which will carry on a set of significant propagation experiments. Its baseline design foresees a transmit-only payload radiating two beacon signals in the ka and Q bands from a geostationary platform; the coverage area will be the continental Europe and the North Africa; the polarization of the Q-band beacon will be circular and the reception shall be possible with antennas with diameter of the order of one meter. The coherency between the Ka and Q/V beacons will allow a wide dynamic range of measurements by facilitating the carrier recovering and will permit the assessment of the correlation of attenuation in distant sites, the correlation between attenuation and BER (measured separately), the attenuation frequency scaling error (for open-loop up-link power control) and will put the grounds for the implementation of future adaptive fade mitigation techniques. ASI assumed directly the commitment to realize the deployment and realization of the Earth terminals in Italy while ESA, on behalf and with the financial support of the ASI, is carrying out the realization of the payload. One of the Earth terminals will be located in the station of Spino d' Adda where the Operational Centre of the entire propagation experiment will be located as well. Another receiving station will be located in the <b>Roma</b> <b>area</b> (Tor Vergata) where also the coordination Centre for the Telecommunication experiments is foreseen; moreover, in order to enlarge the significance of this experiment, the development of one or a few prototypes of a propagation ground terminal is currently in the plans of the ESA with the aim of fostering the involvement of as many European experimenters as possible...|$|E

Education is perceived being a remedy for a social exclusion if only Roma people accept the value of education as being valid. Otherwise the integration strategies implemented in education system do not produce any results. Empirical part of the bachelor degrese thesis presents the Roma attitudes towards education.

There is a well-established linkage between oral health and HIV/AIDS with many of the early symptoms of HIV manifesting in the oro-facial region. However, the lack of oral health personnel at primary health care levels in Lesotho makes Primary Health Care Nurse Practitioners (PHCNPs) often the first health care providers to consult, manage and refer patients with such oral lesions.

40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years the {{increasing}} public sensibility for the urban noise, {{the relevance of}} the transport noise sources and the complexity of their interaction have pushed on the research in this sector. The contribution of the railway traffic to the acoustic environment may be relevant in the urban areas where the railway infrastructure enters to increase its accessibility.

The key operational procedure for an integrated preventing and resolving action is the overlapping of a noise cadaster, summarising the acoustic effects of the railway traffic, to the acoustic zoning, resulting from land use and regulations.

40|$|Housing {{affordability}} is {{a complex}} issue that relates supply and consumption costs of housing {{to the ability of}} the household to pay for housing costs. A regulation and policy framework sets the direction for attaining housing affordability. This paper contends that the direction created by current regulation and policy is inappropriate, and that it will not lead to meaningful progress in housing affordability in Roma, {{as well as in the}} wider context. A detailed analysis of the relevant literature, regulation and policy governing housing provision in <b>Roma</b> has highlighted <b>areas</b> of conflict within the regulation and policy framework. Using Roma as a case study, the disparities in regulation and policy were examined in depth to gauge what impact the conflicting elements might have on housing affordability. Regulation and policy roadmaps were produced to enable the relationships within the framework to be visualised. The volume, complexity and lack of coordination between the various elements of regulation and policy were shown to detract from the execution of the framework. The major conclusion resulting from this paper is that accurate and realistic predictions of housing demand and available supply are needed to ensure that the shortcomings of the regulation and policy framework do not impact negatively on the affordability of housing in <b>Roma</b> and other <b>areas</b> under the jurisdiction of this framework. The second conclusion is that Roma will require additional residential land to be developed at higher densities than currently exist, to maintain or improve current relative levels of housing affordability. The recommended higher densities are the result of the regulatory constraints, recent and impending changes in development of land prone to flooding and projected economic and population growth in Roma. ...|$|R
