50|$|In {{many areas}} of the DRC, land use changes are {{associated}} with degradation of drinking water sources. The main threat to drinking water sources poses the unregulated growth of urban and rural areas. The nonexistence of drinking water protection zones results in the exposure of vulnerable source areas to pollution and land degradation. Springs, <b>river</b> <b>intake</b> zones, wellheads, priority lake and reservoir segments as well as aquifer recharge areas comprise the most endangered water source areas, which typically lack any form of identifiable demarcation and protection. Modification of runoff patterns, increased erosion and environmental degradation are the consequences of unregulated expansion of inhabited and agricultural areas. Development of housing, poor road construction, pit latrines, septic tanks, mining operations, and tailings are important contributors to pollution of water sources. In urban areas, industry, fuel stations, garages, abattoirs and storm water runoff are further sources of contamination. Biological contamination from sewage and solid waste disposal and increased suspended sediment loads are the two main sources of pollution.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) {{model of the}} water resources system supplying Genoa, in northern Italy. The system presently features five reservoirs, three main <b>river</b> <b>intakes,</b> and two well fields. The hydrological regime is typically Mediterranean; water availability is however relatively abundant, so that drought issues are limited, especially now that water demand from the supply sources has decreased due to reduced population, deindustrialization and to improvement in the operation and maintenance of the water distribution network. In this context, it is worthwhile considering the possibility to relax an over-conservative management of resources, justified by the experience of previous drought events, and to explore the viability of exploiting resources from reservoirs for hydropower production. 	The MINLP model expresses cost minimization over a 40 year time period on a monthly basis, subject to physical constraints. Costs include scarcity costs (the economic value of possible water deficits) and extraction costs from wells, minus hydropower production. The model has been written in GAMS and solved through the SBB (Simple Branch and Bound) solver. 	Results show {{that the system is}} able to meet demand over the 40 year hydrologic scenario with negligible water deficits and that hydropower production may be enhanced compared to present by increasing releases from reservoirs, which ultimately implies accepting keeping reservoirs emptier than presently done...|$|R
50|$|In {{this period}} the local {{inflation}} rate climbed {{and this was}} accompanied by a fall {{in the value of the}} Kenyan Shilling. Together with the cost escalation, the part which Kenya had to finance grew bigger and bigger and this alarmed the government. A few new donors (Finnida and the World Food Programme) committed funds, but these funds amounted only to a few million dollars. Also OPEC and Kuwait committed funds for the intake and the ginnery, but since their funding financed only part of these components, these funds did not solve the crisis but would actually increase it. Subsequently, a special government committee was established to control the cost. The committee advised, following earlier advice from the consultants, to postpone and later to cancel the <b>river</b> <b>intake</b> structure. A temporary pumping station designed to operate for a few years, pending the completion of the river works, would become permanent. Other project components, e.g. the ginnery, were also cancelled. To further reduce the cost, the quantity and quality of the houses and roads was reduced. The forest component of the project was drastically trimmed down from 3,900 ha to 650 ha. All the cost saving measures still did not reduce the financial burden for the government of Kenya to an acceptable level and the government decided to reduce the project area to 3,900ha and later to 2,500ha. After these decisions the Bura project still took about 40% yearly of the investment budget of the Ministry of Agriculture.Especially the decision to cancel the river works was later criticised as this would jeopardise the supply of water to the project. However, in 1979 the consultants had calculated that a project with a pumping station would have a much lower capital cost and, subsequently, a much higher rate of return than a project with a gravity intake. The implicit recommendation was that a gravity intake was not only very costly, but also unnecessary. This conclusion was embraced by the government and subsequently it shelved the gravity intake. However, there was serious catch in this, which was not included in the analysis of the consultant: the high, projected yields of cotton and maize were partly based on the fact that the project had a gravity and thus a secure supply of irrigation water. Therefore, when calculating the rate of return for the project with a pumping station the consultants should have used lower yields for cotton and maize in their economic analysis. They did not do this and in this way they got the advantages of both gravity (higher yields) and pumping (low investment costs).|$|E

An initial arrangement of barrage and <b>river</b> <b>intake</b> with four desander basins on the right bank of the Teesta River, tributary to the Brahmaputra, has been proposed. During high Monsoon floods, river bed load and suspended sediments shall be diverted through the spillway openings.

In order to study flow conditions and evaluate the <b>river</b> <b>intake</b> and desander design, LSPIV and UVP measurements were performed at several locations within the basins and the intake zone. The measurements were conducted for two different <b>river</b> <b>intake</b> designs. UVP allowed to measure mean flow velocity and evaluate the retention efficiency of the basins. Overall flow field comparisons for different scenarios over the entire model surface are reported by LSPIV technique [...] The mean flow velocity is the main parameter to design a desander and it {{is directly related to the}} sediment grain size diameter to be removed.

40|$|Projected {{changes in}} {{precipitation}} and evapotranspiration under {{climate change and}} their impacts on the reliability of six water storage reservoirs and two <b>river</b> <b>intake</b> schemes in Scotland are examined. A conceptual rainfall–runoff model was used to simulate catchment runoff which, together with evapotranspiration, served as inputs into a reservoir model. Outputs from a regional climate model coupled with a weather generator indicate an increase in rainfall variability and evapotranspiration throughout the 21 st century, resulting in a decrease in both the time-based and volumetric reliability of the reservoirs under the assumption of an unchanging demand, albeit with a less drastic reduction for the volumetric approach. It {{was found that the}} variability of rainfall had the greatest effect on reservoir reliability, outweighing the positive effect of an increase in total annual precipitation, while evapotranspiration had a lesser impact. A more drastic reduction in reliability was observed for the <b>river</b> <b>intake</b> schemes given their lack of storage capacity. The increase in water demand based on demographic projections further reduced reservoir reliability, especially when monthly variations in demand were taken into account.

The velocity field, both upstream of the intake in the main channel and in front of the intake in the sluiceway, were measured under various discharge combinations of the <b>river,</b> <b>intake</b> and sluice gate. In addition, velocity profiles both upstream and downstream of the intake and the amount of sediment entering it were measured. Analysis of the velocity data showed that the discharge of the sluice gate {{played an important role in}} determining the velocity profile and also the mechanism of sediment entry. All velocity profiles where the sluice gate was closed had an inflection point, where the flow direction changed, leading to a return velocity near the bed. The elevation of this point was a function of the intake discharge and approximately equal to the height of the entrance sill. Experimental observation showed that sediment entered the intake by a tornado-like vortex. The strength and frequency of the vortices depended on the intake and sluice gate discharges. Analysis of the sedimentation data showed that the amount of sediment entering the intake increased with increasing intake discharge.
