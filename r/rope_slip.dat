60|$|Foot by {{foot the}} {{soldiers}} let the <b>rope</b> <b>slip,</b> until probably two hundred had been let out, {{and there were}} scarcely a hundred feet left.

60|$|We ran {{more and}} more lines, and {{more and more}} lines {{continued}} to part, {{and more and more}} the pretty boat went over on her side. We bent all our spare lines; we unrove sheets and halyards; we used our two-inch hawser; we fastened lines part way up the mast, half way up, and everywhere else. We toiled and sweated and enounced our mutual and sincere conviction that God's grudge still held against us. Country yokels came down on the wharf and sniggered at us. When Cloudesley let a coil of <b>rope</b> <b>slip</b> down the inclined deck into the vile slime and fished it out with seasick countenance, the yokels sniggered louder and it was all I could do to prevent him from climbing up on the wharf and committing murder.|$|E
60|$|It was ticklish {{work for}} a greenhorn. Joe threw off all the turns save the last, which he held with one hand, while with the other he {{attempted}} to bring in on the painter. But at that instant it tightened with a tremendous jerk, the boat sheering sharply into {{the crest of a}} heavy sea. The <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> from his hands and began to fly out over the stern. He clutched it frantically, and was dragged after it over the sloping deck.|$|R

They could see nothing but the <b>rope</b> <b>slipping</b> past their feet, inch by inch. Sometimes it was stationary, sometimes it was drawn taut. The first great wave that came flung a yard or so of slack amongst them. Then, after the roar of its breaking had died away, they saw the rope suddenly tighten, and pass rapidly out, and the excitement began to thicken.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDynamic rope brakes are {{integral}} {{elements of the}} standard belaying equipment. They multiply the hand force of the belayer and convert {{a fraction of the}} falling climber’s kinetic energy into thermal energy. As the rope is deflected by the brake, the thermal energy is produced by belt friction. This paper introduces a brake model based on static and viscous belt friction. The contact angles of three different brakes (figure-of-eight, ATC and HMS [Munter hitch]) were determined. These data as well as data taken and/or derived from the literature served as input for the model. The static and viscous belt friction coefficients range between 0. 2 – 0. 3 and 0. 015 – 0. 04, respectively, for the three brakes. Depending on the magnitude of the friction coefficients, three conditions can be distinguished: (1) no <b>rope</b> <b>slip</b> at high friction; (2) <b>rope</b> <b>slip</b> and stop; (3) critical braking; and (4) continuous <b>rope</b> <b>slip</b> (no stop). The window of the friction coefficients between no slip and critical braking is independent of the hand force. However, the smaller the hand force is, the larger are the friction coefficients at no slip and critical braking. Belayers with smaller hand forces should therefore avoid rope brakes with small static and viscous friction coefficients (like the Figure-ofEight) and apply the ATC or HMS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory measurements on the determination of rut parameters resulting from the operation of a pneumatic drive wheel with a different slip. The experiment was performed on the test bench consisting of the researched wheel load simulator, a mobile soil tub and the <b>rope</b> <b>slip</b> control system. Ruts were made at the wheel slip s= 6 %, 25 %, 43 %, 62 %, 81 %, 100 %, and when the wheel rolled along the ground with s close to 0 %. The obtained ruts were mapped to the computer using the non-contact laser measuring station. Based on the mapping for the rut fragment, the surface area was calculated in a simplified variant, as a horizontal projection of a rut on the surface area and as a real three-dimensional surface area; moreover, the rut volume was measured. It was found that using a simplified method for determination of the surface area of the rut, i. e. a rut horizontal projection, a significant error is committed. For studies with only rolling a wheel, a simplified surface area accounted for only 0. 6 of real surface area, and for the wheel slip s= 25 % is was only 0. 5 of actual surface area. Increase of the slip results in significant increase of the rut volume. With an increase of the slip s= 25 %, the volume of the rut increased by 1. 4 in relation to the variant of s close to 0 %, and when the slip was s= 43 %, as much as 2. 2. Key words: surface mapping, surface area of a rut, rut volume, rut dept...|$|E

Down went the rope, and with a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together, we hoisted poor Sally half-way up to the window, when, sad to tell, the <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> and down she fell, only being saved from broken bones by the hay-cock under the window.|$|R
50|$|A {{few weeks}} later, during low tide at Queenscliff the crew {{encountered}} problems {{because of the}} depth of the water and the strong winds. As one of the deckhands attempted to take control by winching the boat in to its berth, the <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> and jumped and he was thrown to the deck. By the time he attempted to regain his footing the Peninsula Princess had been taken hold of by the wind. She was thrown against the edge of the creek and broke a propeller and had a bent shaft. The ferry had to be dry docked for repairs. The business had financial issues and could not afford for this to happen again.|$|R
5000|$|His final public {{execution}} {{took place}} in 1866, once again at Stafford Gaol.

Unfortunately for Collier the <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> from the overhead beam of the gallows on Smith's first attempt and Collier fell through the trap to the ground with the halter still around his neck. There was a five-minute delay before a replacement could be rigged and Collier executed. A newspaper report referred to the event as a [...] "shocking scene on the scaffold" [...] and reported that the crowd cried [...] "Shame!"

Then came the realisation that the monster was almost consciously disentangling itself for escape, and then the light leap of its rebound. The <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> out of reach of my hand. I remember running knee-deep in a salt pool in hopeless pursuit of the airship.|$|R
50|$|The incline {{section was}} worked by {{stationary}} engine and cable haulage: an 80 hp (60 kW)hp high pressure steam engine was constructed at Cowlairs, and a continuous hemp rope {{was used to}} pull trains up the gradients. Special brake vehicles were attached to downwards trains to control the descent. There was soon difficulty with the hemp <b>rope</b> <b>slipping</b> in damp weather, and two banking engines named Samson and Hercules, were introduced in 1844, but they {{were found to be}} damaging to the track, and the powerful exhaust caused vibrations in the roof, leading to leakage of the canal water. The banking engines were sent to the Monklands area in 1848, and wire rope haulage with the stationary engine was used instead.|$|R

Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s.

50|$|Later, while Olive repairs the wheel, Popeye starts {{pulling up}} the anchor, which gets the ship moving again, but one ghost paints grease {{on the last}} few yards of the rope and another ghost tangles some of the anchor rope around Popeye's leg. As soon as the anchor is almost aboard, the greased part of the <b>rope</b> <b>slips</b> through Popeye's hands and the anchor stops the ship again and pulls Popeye {{overboard}} into the water. While Popeye struggles underwater trying to free himself from the rope, Olive tries to pull the anchor back up, but isn't strong enough. The ghosts (now invisible) {{take the opportunity to}} blindfold Olive and force her to the plank. Back underwater, Popeye manages to grab a swordfish and use its snout to cut the rope, allowing him to swim back to the surface and back on to the ship, which has now started moving again.|$|R

60|$|The hired {{carriers}} paced along over Chaldon Down with {{as little}} hesitation {{as if it had}} been day, avoiding the cart-way, and leaving the village of East Chaldon on the left, so as to reach the crest of the hill at a lonely trackless place not far from the ancient earthwork called Round Pound. An hour's brisk walking brought them within sound of the sea, not many hundred yards from Lulstead Cove. Here they paused, and Lizzy and Stockdale came up with them, when they went on together to the verge of the cliff. One of the men now produced an iron bar, which he drove firmly into the soil a yard from the edge, and attached to it a rope that he had uncoiled from his body. They all began to descend, partly stepping, partly sliding down the incline, as the <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> through their hands.|$|R
2500|$|Fowler's {{ploughing}} engine dragged itself {{across the}} field on rollers, pulling the mole plough as it went. [...] The engine was driven {{by a team of}} horses that walked round a capstan, winding in a rope which was passed through a pulley securely anchored {{at the far end of}} the field. The mole would have a string of drainage pipes attached at the rear end and these would be dragged through the channel created by the mole. On completing each length of drains, the engine would be turned, the rope would be let out and the pulley repositioned ready for the next length. Fowler had trouble with the capstan gears and with the <b>rope</b> <b>slipping</b> on the capstan, but was able to demonstrate his engine at a meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England at Exeter in 1850. He was able to lay a drain at a depth of [...] in heavy clay. His invention was awarded a silver medal and was reported as [...] "altogether the most important feature of the exhibition." ...|$|R
5000|$|The tension [...] in {{the rope}} {{in the final}} {{situation}} is increased {{with respect to the}} initial state. Therefore, the rope is elongated a bit. This means that not all surface particles of the rope can have held their initial position on the bollard surface. During the loading process, the <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> a little bit along the bollard surface in the slip area [...] This slip is precisely large enough to get to the elongation that occurs in the final state. Note that there is no slipping going on in the final state; the term slip area refers to the slippage that occurred during the loading process. Note further that the location of the slip area depends on the initial state and the loading process. If the initial tension is [...] and the tension is reduced to [...] at the slack side, then the slip area occurs at the slack side of the contact area. For initial tensions between [...] and , there can be slip areas on both sides with a stick area in between.|$|R

50|$|Emil Zsigmondy was {{the friend}} and {{companion}} of Ludwig Purtscheller, the great pioneer of guideless Alpine climbing. Emil and Otto climbed with Purtscheller in 1882 and 1884, including an ascent without guides of the Marinelli Couloir on Monte Rosa {{and the first}} guideless traverse of the Matterhorn. Zsigmondy's outstanding achievements include the first ascent by the east arête of the 3983 m high Meije in the Massif des Écrins range, made by Zsigmondy, his brother Otto, and Purtscheller on 26 July 1885. A few days later he died on the same mountain. He {{was killed in an}} attempt to climb the south face of the Meije on 6 August 1885, probably {{as a result of his}} <b>rope</b> <b>slipping</b> off a rock. The face was only conquered in 1912 by the South Tyrolese climbers Angelo Dibona and Luigi Rizzi with the brothers Guido and Max Mayer. Emil Zsigmondy's grave is a few miles away from the accident site in the small cemetery of Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans in the Dauphiné Alps. He had graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1884, less than a year before his death.|$|R
60|$|Up he went, {{hand over}} hand, and putting his toes into nicks {{every now and}} then, thereby helping himself very much. He took it slowly and easily, and I felt sure he would be all right. As I looked at him, {{climbing}} {{up there in the}} darkness, while I was standing below, holding the rope so that it should not swing, I could not help thinking that I was a pretty curious kind of a tutor for a boy. However, I was taking all the care of him that I could, and if he came down he'd probably hurt me worse than he would hurt himself. Besides, I had no reason to suppose that old Mr. Colbert objected to a little fun. Then I began to think of Mrs. Colbert, and while I was thinking of her, and looking up at Rectus, I was amazed to see him going up quite rapidly, while the end of the <b>rope</b> <b>slipped</b> through my fingers. Up he went, and when I ran back, I could see a dark figure on the wall, above him. Somebody was pulling him up.|$|R
