50|$|Circa 1985, Mr. Brooks (age 90 at the time), {{was visiting}} the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum's {{restoration}} facility in Silver Hill, Maryland {{with a family}} member. Upon entering a storage hangar {{as part of the}} tour, he spotted a tattered World War I vintage SPAD XIII airplane, the type he flew during the war. As he drew nearer the aircraft, he was astonished to discover it was his very aircraft. He climbed into the cockpit and was immediately approached by a <b>restoration</b> <b>technician</b> who advised him in a very stern manner that these aircraft are delicate pieces of American history and visitors are not permitted to touch, much less sit in them. When Mr. Brooks explained that this was his airplane, the technician’s first thought was of a doddering old veteran, longing for the real or imagined glory days of yesteryear. While Mr. Brooks' speech and external mannerisms were befitting of a nonagenarian, his mind was as sharp as it was 30 or 40 years past. He spoke to the technician as if reading from a history book about the last time this aircraft was in action over France. Included in the lesson was the name and serial number of the plane, which was not readily visible. The technician was aware of the aircraft's history and asked the old gentleman to stay right where he was while he summoned the NASM curator emeritus, Paul E. Garber. Less than two years after this meeting, Ray Brooks' fully restored SPAD Smith IV was unveiled with great fanfare at the National Air and Space Museum's 'Great War in the Air' exhibit (Gallery 206). Mr. Brooks was in attendance as a guest of honor at the ribbon cutting ceremony and treated those present to a first-person history of several World War I missions in which he participated.|$|E

40|$|Silenciosamente, alguns materiais cromáticos omitem qualidades potentes. Um simples olhar mais demorado pode ativá- -las. Outras vezes, é necessário o envolvimento de todo o corpo, numa relação de aproximação e convivência, para que o potencial se apresente. O pau-brasil - ou ibirapitanga, como denominada pelos indígenas - é uma árvore cujo cerne do tronco possui uma matéria orgânica, a brasilina, que produz cor, primeiro por entrar em contato com o oxigênio, depois por outros processos químicos. Uma cor? Não, diversas, a depender do {{modus operandi}} das ações e reações escolhidas. Essas cores podem ser fixadas e ter certa permanência quando usadas como corante para têxteis e papéis ou como pigmento em diferentes suportes. Por quanto tempo? Segundo os especialistas em tingimento, não muito. Numa perspectiva histórica, a ibirapitanga foi apreciada e utilizada como corante por conta de uma herança cultural: o gosto pelo púrpura e pelo carmim, tonalidades adoradas pelos povos antigos. Sua exploração no território brasileiro se deu de maneira agressiva, conflituosa e cheia de contradições a partir do éncontro,́ não apenas do homem com o material, mas de homens com homens, quando os navegantes europeus do século xvi fizeram as primeiras viagens para a América do Sul e entraram em contato com os povos locais. O estudo de documentos antigos, o toque no papel amarelado dessas publicações e o abrir o {{envelope}} de uma carta assinada pelo rei numa biblioteca em Lisboa adensaram o conteúdo teórico desta pesquisa, assim como contribuíram enquanto dado sensorial e imagético. De fato, resquícios do corante do pau-brasil em pinturas ou tecidos de acervos históricos não foram encontrados presencialmente apesar das tentativas. Foi somente a partir da reprodução de receitas, com as necessárias adaptações ao contexto contemporâneo, e dos desdobramentos destes experimentos em outros processos análogos, que o sentido da investigação poética se deu. Produzir cor com uso da ibirapitanga foi o centro das experimentações em ateliê. Como podemos atualizar a presença desse material cromático hoje? Foi por meio de diversas leituras, dos processos práticos no ateliê e de importantes conversas que o conteúdo da pesquisa ganhou sentido e se tornou possível estruturar este texto, que contém um breve histórico do pau-brasil, um caderno de receitas e a produção poética com o uso da ibirapitanga. Selecionamos ainda quatro conversas relevantes para a atualização do tema: a primeira realizada com Ana Cristina de Siqueira Lima, presidente da Funbrasil - Fundação Nacional do Pau-Brasil, que realiza ações de preservação da espécie; a segunda, com Eva Eis, pesquisadora e técnica em restauro da Universidade Técnica de Munique (tum), que desenvolve no momento pesquisa acerca de receitas de pigmentos de pau-brasil e que trabalha na fábrica Kremer Pigmente; com o artista Carlos Vergara, que se utiliza de materiais naturais para a produção de suas telas, valendo-se da monotipia e outros processos para revelar a presença da cor; e com a pintora e escultura Amelia Toledo, que evidencia sutis diferenças cromáticas enquanto matéria construtiva e propositiva de suas obras de arte. Esta publicação é fruto destes e de outros encontros que aconteceram nos últimos anos, e, por meio de diferentes materiais, tonalidades e palavras, celebra de maneira ambivalente (já que tratamos da ibirapitanga e sua memória de ásperos conflitos) essas aproximações, que imprimem e deixam seus rastros. Silently, some chromatic materials omit powerful qualities. A simple, longer look may activate them. In other situations, {{the involvement of}} the whole body is necessary, in a closer relationship, during some days or weeks, for the potential to present itself. The brazilwood - or ibirapitanga, as it was called by the natives - is a tree which has a heartwood with an organic material, the brazilin. It produces colour, first by coming into contact with oxygen, then by other chemical processes. One colour? No, several, depending on the modus operandi, the actions and reactions that are chosen. Colours that can be fixed and have certain permanence when used as a dye for textiles and papers, or as pigment in different supports. How long? According to experts in dyeing techniques, not much. Ibirapitanga was appreciated and used as a dye because it produces purple and carmine. Historically, ancient peoples adored those colours. The exploration of ibirapitanga in the Brazilian territory took place in an aggressive, conflictive way, full of contradictions from the ḿeetingńot only of men with this material, but of men with men: when European navigators of the sixteenth century made the first voyages to South America and came into contact with local people. The study of ancient documents, the touch on the yellowish papers of those publications and the opening of the envelope of a letter signed by the king, in a library in Lisbon, added theoretical content to this research and contributed as sensorial and imaginary data. In fact, we could not find and see residues of brazilwood in paintings or fabrics from historical collections, despite the attempts. It was only from the reproduction of recipes - with the necessary adaptations to the contemporary context - and from the development of these experiments in other similar processes, that the meaning of poetic investigation occurred. Producing colour with the use of ibirapitanga was the centre of experimentation in the atelier. How can we update the presence of this chromatic material today? It was through reading, practical processes in the atelier and through important conversations that the content of this research made sense and it became possible to structure this text, which contains a brief chapter about the history of brazilwood, a recipe book and the poetic production with the use of ibirapitanga. We selected four relevant conversations to update the subject: the first one held with Ana Cristina de Siqueira Lima, president of Funbrasil - Brazilwood National Foundation, which works to preserve the species; the second, with Eva Eis, researcher and <b>restoration</b> <b>technician</b> at the Technical University of Munich (tum), who is currently developing studies on the production of brazilwood lake pigments and works at the Kremer Pigment factory; with the artist Carlos Vergara, who uses natural materials for the production of his paintings, using monotype prints and other processes to reveal the presence of colour; and with the painter and sculptor Amelia Toledo, who shows delicate chromatic differences as constructive material and as a purpose of her art. This publication is the result of these and other meetings that have taken place in the last years, and, through different materials, shades and words, celebrates in an ambivalent way (since we are talking about ibirapitanga and its memory of conflicts) the approximations, which imprint and leave traces...|$|E

50|$|The short {{was long}} {{believed}} to be a lost film, and its unavailability fueled the misconception that Jolson's first sound film was the famous feature-length milestone The Jazz Singer, which premiered almost exactly one year later. A mute print of A Plantation Act was eventually found in the Library of Congress, mislabeled as a preview for The Jazz Singer. A copy of the corresponding soundtrack disc also came to light, but it had been broken into four pieces and glued back together so imperfectly that it would not play through. After some careful surgery, <b>restoration</b> <b>technicians</b> succeeded in making a usable dub from the disc and digitally removing the pops and clicks resulting from the damage. The restored film was included on a LaserDisc published in the 1990s and as a bonus feature on the 2007 3-disc DVD release of The Jazz Singer.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present three {{experiences}} about combining 3 D digitalization techniques for cultural heritage documentation. Retable of Bouro (Portugal) {{is a big}} and complex wood structure from the XVII th century part of the Monastery of Santa Maria do Bouro. An urgent conservation and restoration program was promoted {{in order to prevent}} further damage in the retable. A complete 3 D graphical record was needed to support this intervention. The main objective was to keep control of the main structures and to detect wood deformations. This was the reason why laser scanner and direct measurement methods were used. The Gävle theatre is a XIX th century building which was recorded for virtual tourism. Thus, this 3 D model was made with laser scanner and photo texturing. The third case consists of a highly accurate 3 D-reconstruction of parts of Santo Domingo Church, an XV th century building, {{in order to get a}} detailed graphical record. Accurate laser scanning, photorealistic texture modelling and monoscopic photogrammetry methods were necessary for a complete and accurate 3 D model of each part of the recording. The final outputs for each of these cases were adjusted to the needs of the conservation and <b>restoration</b> <b>technicians.</b> Bidimensional vector drawings, 3 d models, orthophotographs and TIN surface orthoimages were produced in order to achieve this goal. 1...|$|R

Fig. 1 : Overview model of the cenotaph derived from scanned data * Corresponding author. Different methods can be used to visualize the meshed surface model. Line plots from the photogrammetric stereo models do not really give an adequate representation of this object. 3 D visualization using the scanning results can achieve a much better impression of the complicated geometry after data modeling, error correction, and filling in remaining ‘holes’. In order to model the complex geometry, it is necessary to use huge amounts of data. The model in its highest resolution consists of more than 1. 000. 000. 000 triangles. Because of restrictions in the hard- and software presently available, the high resolution model has to b...|$|R

5000|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine requires regular maintenance to ensure its continued function. Engine oil, power steering and brake fluid are examples of engine maintenance that must be kept and checked at regular intervals. Often wear and tear over time can leave an engine totally unusable, {{in which case the}} restorer might remove the existing engine {{and replace it with a}} similar or modern engine substitute. In order to conduct an engine <b>restoration</b> first a <b>technician</b> will conduct a thorough inspection. Often pre-restored vehicle have engines that have gone without maintenance for years and therefore require engine restoration to return them to working order. The engine is removed from the car and inspected for broken and non-functional parts. Typical parts that require replacing include the pistons, spark plugs, fuel lines battery, fuses, timing belt and various gaskets. All are subject to deterioration over time. Structural components like the engine block, cam shaft and crank shaft are less likely to require repair but not uncommon. [...] Typically, after all required parts are gathered, the disassembled pieces will be cleaned, lubricated (if required), and reassembled. The engine is then replaced within the car. A mechanic will then perform a series of tests to ensure that the engine is in working, road worthy condition. [...] This is known as a pre-start engine check. First all the lines and hoses are checked for breaks and leaks. Second the radiator is topped off with water to ensure that the system is sealed off. Next the oil level is replenished. Finally the battery charge is checked and the ignition system is inspected. The engine is then ready to be started.|$|R
