25|$|Most of the Barossa Valley makes {{extensive}} use of irrigation to supplement the region's low rainfall supply during the growing season. However, concerns about water supply in the late 20th and early 21st century {{led to the development}} of strict regulations on the numbers and locations of irrigation boreholes as well as the amount of water that can be used by vineyards. Some of the region's oldest vineyards, especially those on the slightly cooler west side of the valley, practice dryland farming. The increased water stress of the practice, coupled with the naturally <b>reduced</b> <b>yields</b> of old vines, tends to produce the most deeply concentrated grapes in the valley which often go into the Barossa Valley 's most expensive and sought after wines. Harvest usually begins in February and may be conducted in the cooler temperatures of night to help maintain acid levels.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{animals are}} {{higher on the}} trophic level, they are less {{efficient}} sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high-meat diets {{similar to that of}} the United States. Genetically modified food (GMF) a conventional solution to the problem, presents numerous problems [...] Bt corn produces its own Bacillus thuringiensis toxin/protein, but the pest resistance is believed to be only a matter of time. The overall effect of GMF on yields is contentious, with the USDA and FAO acknowledging that GMFs do not necessarily have higher yields and may even have <b>reduced</b> <b>yields.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With {{dramatically}} <b>reduced</b> <b>yields,</b> even {{urban areas}} suffered much reduced rations; however, mass starvation was largely {{confined to the}} countryside, where, {{as a result of}} drastically inflated production statistics, very little grain was left for the peasants to eat. Food shortages were bad throughout the country; however, the provinces which had adopted Mao's reforms with the most vigor, such as Anhui, Gansu and Henan, tended to suffer disproportionately. Sichuan, one of China's most populous provinces, known in China as [...] "Heaven's Granary" [...] because of its fertility, is thought to have suffered the greatest absolute numbers of deaths from starvation due to the vigor with which provincial leader Li Jinquan undertook Mao's reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, cases of cannibalism also occurred in the parts of China that were severely affected by famine.|$|E

50|$|Downy mildew left {{uncontrolled}} has {{the ability}} to <b>reduce</b> <b>yields</b> by up to 55% and infest up to 80% of plants. Downy mildew is primarily controlled through the use of several fungicides applied during midseason. The fungicides used include azoxystrobin, copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and maneb. Farmers in Florida who regularly use fungicides have been shown to <b>reduce</b> <b>yield</b> losses due to downy mildew to as low as 2%.|$|R

50|$|The disease causes {{defoliation}} which increase year on year. This <b>reduces</b> <b>yield</b> {{of timber}} growth and weakens the tree, {{serving as a}} predisposing factor to other diseases. In several cases of infection, the disease can lead to complete mortality of the tree. Infection may take several years to severely <b>reduce</b> <b>yield,</b> as crown infection under 40% is directly proportional to the reduction in yield. Once crown infection has reached 80% there is no growth at all.|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} the effects of alloy purity on the {{mechanical}} properties of NiAl single crystals are presented. Two stoichiometric NiAl single crystals with different impurity contents were studied. It is concluded that reductions in the interstitial and substitutional levels cause <b>reduced</b> <b>yield</b> strengths in NiAl. Heat treatment also results in <b>reduced</b> <b>yield</b> and flow stresses in both CP-NiAl and Hp-NiAl which are considered to be due to a reduction in the concentration of thermal vacancies due to vacancy coalescence during heat treatment...|$|R

50|$|After {{the repeal}} of alcohol {{prohibition}} in Canada in 1927, provinces strictly limited the number of licences to produce wine. A nearly 50-year moratorium on issuing new winery licences was finally dropped in 1974. During the same decade, demonstration planting began to show that Vitis vinifera could be successfully grown in Canada. Other growers found that high quality wines could be produced if Vitis vinifera vines were grown with <b>reduced</b> <b>yields,</b> new trellising techniques, and appropriate canopy management.|$|E
50|$|Phomopsis obscurans (leaf blight) is {{a common}} disease-causing fungus {{affecting}} strawberry plants. Although the fungus infects leaves early in the growing season, leaf blight symptoms are most apparent on older leaves near or after harvest. The disease can weaken strawberry plants through the destruction of older foliage. Weakened plants can result in <b>reduced</b> <b>yields</b> the following year. In years highly favorable for disease development, leaf blight can cause defoliation and, in some cases, death of plants.|$|E
50|$|The soil on {{headlands}} {{is subject}} to greater levels of soil compaction because it receives more traffic per unit of area than the field as a whole. Yields are generally lower than in the field itself due to additional implement traffic and crop damage from implements turning on {{them as well as}} compaction. Soil fertility levels are frequently higher than in {{the main part of the}} field due to overlapping applications of fertilizer coupled with <b>reduced</b> <b>yields.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Witchweed parasitizes maize, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, legumes, and a {{range of}} weedy grasses. [...] It is capable of {{significantly}} <b>reducing</b> <b>yields,</b> in some cases wiping out the entire crop.|$|R

25|$|Basil {{suffers from}} several plant {{pathogens}} that can ruin the crop and <b>reduce</b> <b>yield.</b> Fusarium wilt is a soil-borne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants. Seedlings may {{be killed by}} Pythium damping off.|$|R
50|$|Although air and {{sunlight}} are available everywhere on Earth, crops also depend on soil nutrients {{and the availability}} of water. Monoculture is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from <b>reduced</b> <b>yields.</b> Monoculture can also cause the build-up of pathogens and pests that target one specific species. The Great Irish Famine (1845-1849) is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Bhutanese farmers first {{experienced}} agricultural fluctuations due to climate change, including higher temperatures, prolonged seasons, and increased erosion due to retreating glaciers in Bhutan. Double harvests in late autumn prevent {{production of a}} single mature crop and raise the specter of <b>reduced</b> <b>yields</b> in the following summer. Similar patterns in neighboring Indian regions project yield losses between 10 and 40 percent due to these changes. Some Bhutanese had changed crops {{as a result of}} these environmental changes.|$|E
50|$|Though organic cotton is {{considered}} a more sustainable choice for fabric, as it uses fewer pesticides and chemical fertilizers, it remains less than 1% global cotton production. Hurdles to growth include cost of hand labor for hand weeding, <b>reduced</b> <b>yields</b> in comparison to conventional cotton and absence of fiber commitments from brands to farmers before planting seed. The up front financial risks and costs are therefore shouldered by the farmers, many of whom struggle to compete with economies of scale of corporate farms.|$|E
50|$|Ripgut brome can {{substantially}} <b>reduce</b> <b>yields</b> when it invades wheat fields. It has naturalized in {{some areas}} and is considered a troublesome noxious weed in others. Bromus diandrus is an invasive species in California native habitats.|$|R
25|$|Despite mediocre yields, intermolecular cycloadditions of indole {{derivatives}} {{have been}} well documented. One example is the Pictet-Spengler reaction between tryptophan derivatives and aldehydes, which produces a mixture of diastereomers, leading to <b>reduced</b> <b>yield</b> of the desired product.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four cultivars of {{chickpea}} {{were evaluated}} for their susceptibility to the grey mould fungus Botrytis cinerea using foliar, seed and soil inoculation at 2, 4 and 8 g fungus per plant, per kg seed or per kg soil. At 8 g the inoculum caused necrotic lesions to all 24 cultivars with foliar inoculation, to 23 cultivars except cv. CH- 2007 - 22 with seed inoculation and to 17 cultivars with soil inoculation, and <b>reduced</b> <b>yield</b> by 7 â€“ 43 % (foliar inoculation), 3 â€“ 34 % (seed inoculation) and 3 â€“ 26 % (soil inoculation). Foliar or seed inoculation with 4 g of the fungus significantly <b>reduced</b> the <b>yield</b> of all cultivars tested except CH- 2007 - 22 with foliar inoculation, and 4 cultivars with seed inoculation. Soil inoculation at 4 g fungus kg - 1 soil, significantly <b>reduced</b> the <b>yield</b> of eight cultivars. Foliar and seed inoculations at 2 g of the fungus significantly <b>reduced</b> the <b>yield</b> of 16 and 7 cultivars of chickpea respectively; but soil inoculation at this concentration, {{did not significantly}} <b>reduce</b> <b>yield</b> in any cultivar. The greatest significant decline in yield was recorded with foliar inoculation in the cv. BG- 256, 43 % at 8 g, 40 % at 4 g and 26 % at 2 g inoculum level. The cv. CH- 2007 - 22 was tolerant to B. cinerea as it exhibited only 3 â€“ 7 % yield loss at 8 g inoculum. The fungal population, especially that on the phylloplane, increased exponentially from January to March and declined drastically in April. At the high inoculum level of 8 g fungus kg - 1 soil, B. cinerea may initiate infection through the soil.
