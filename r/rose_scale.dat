40|$|Mealybugs and {{armoured}} {{scales are}} major pest species in ornamental crops in greenhouses. The {{first part of}} this report focuses on mealybug detection. The research presented here builds on previous study in which it was shown on laboratory scale that the odour profile released by plants after damage by mealybugs differs from the odour profile released by undamaged plants and plants that suffer from spider mite or mechanical damage. In the present study the change of several compounds in response to mealybug infection was shown to depend on a number of different factors: the growth stage of the plant (flowering/non-flowering), the time of the day sampling took place, the mealybug density and the duration of the mealybug infection. Although in each of the laboratory experiments several plant volatiles were found to significantly differ between mealybug-infested plants and control plants, so far no candidate indicator-volatiles have been found that always reacted significantly and in the same manner to a mealybug infection. The screening of new pesticides showed one pesticide to be effective against both the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri and the <b>rose</b> <b>scale</b> Aulacapsis rosae. Several isolates of entomopathogenic fungi were able to infect mealybugs in the laboratory, but results obtained in the greenhouse were disappointing. Lacewing larvae of the species Chrysoperla lucasina were able to control mealybugs when released repeatedly. The addition of Ephestia eggs disrupted this control in some cases...|$|E

50|$|There {{are clear}} {{differences}} between the four scales shown in the table. Both the second and fourth scales place cysteine as the most hydrophobic residue, unlike the other two scales. This difference {{is due to the}} different methods used to measure hydrophobicity. The method used to obtain the Janin and <b>Rose</b> et al. <b>scales</b> was to examine proteins with known 3-D structures and define the hydrophobic character as the tendency for a residue to be found inside of a protein rather than on its surface. Since cysteine forms disulfide bonds that must occur inside a globular structure, cysteine is ranked as the most hydrophobic. The first and third scales are derived from the physiochemical properties of the amino acid side chains. These scales result mainly from inspection of the amino acid structures. Biswas et al., divided the scales based on the method used to obtain the scale into five different categories.|$|R

30|$|Although {{a similar}} action-oriented {{approach}} has been adopted when the constructs of the CSE and the CEFR were defined, the operationalization of the constructs has differed depending on the socio-educational {{context in which the}} frameworks are developed (Jin and Jie 2017). Intended mainly for Chinese learners of English, the CSE gives priority to descriptors of learners’ achievement and categorizes its descriptors based on language functions: narration, description, explanation, argumentation, instruction, and discussion (Halliday 1978; Martin and <b>Rose</b> 2003). The <b>scales</b> of the CEFR were developed primarily to serve the interests of adult language learners in Europe. As noted in Green et al. (2012), the CEFR scales “are not organised around notions and functions, but around more broadly defined competences, strategies and language activities” (p. 40). The descriptors of the CEFR “may be used both with a retrospective view towards the content of a learning programme at a given level that learners have completed (achievement) and a prospective view towards the level(s) of tasks that learners will be able to carry out beyond the classroom (proficiency)” (p. 45).|$|R

40|$|The {{first half}} of the nineteenth century was a {{critical}} juncture regarding the emergence of female participation in the market economy, the increase in the wage of females relative to that of adult males, and the evolution of large scale firms in both mechanized and non-mechanized industries. We present the first systematic and comprehensive description of these events as they evolved in the states of the Northeast to 1850. Our sources are primarily samples taken from three early censuses and reports of manufacturing, 1820, 1832, and 1850. Our principal findings are: (1) that women and children composed a large share (over 40 % in 1832) of the entire manufacturing labor force during the initial period of industrialization in the U. S., but that this share began a secular decline as early as 1840; (2) that the wage of females (and boys) relative to that of adult males <b>rose</b> wherever large <b>scale</b> manufacturing establishments spread and that by 1850 this ratio had risen to almost 90 % its long-term level; (3) that the labor force participation of young unmarried women in the industrial counties of the Northeast was, in 1832, high by late nineteenth century standards; and (4) that the employment of females and boys was closely associated with production processes used by large-scale establishments. Women and children had been a previously under-utilized and large segment of the potential labor force, and their harnessing by manufacturing was a critical factor in the industrialization of the Northeast. ...|$|R

We hypothesized that ranolazine would reduce anginal symptoms or dyspnea in optimally treated ICM patients. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, crossover-design pilot study, 28 patients with ICM (ejection fraction less or equal 40 %) were included after providing informed consent. A total of 24  patients completed both placebo and ranolazine treatments and were analyzed. All patients were on treatment with a beta blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker), {{and at least one}} additional antianginal drug. After randomization, patients received up to 1, 000 mg ranolazine orally twice a day, as tolerated, versus placebo. The primary end point was change in angina as assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), or in dyspnea as assessed by the <b>Rose</b> Dyspnea <b>Scale</b> (RDS). Change in the RDS and SAQ score from baseline was compared, for ranolazine and placebo, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test or paired t-test. Results: Patients had the following demographic and clinical variables: mean age of 71. 5 years; male (82. 1 %); prior coronary bypass surgery (67. 9 %); prior coronary percutaneous intervention (85. 7 %); prior myocardial infarction (82. 1 %); diabetes (67. 9 %); and mean ejection fraction of 33. 1 %. No statistical difference was seen between baseline RDS score and that after placebo or ranolazine (n= 20) (P≥ 0. 05). There was however, an improvement in anginal frequency (8 / 10 patients) (P= 0. 058), quality of life (8 / 10 patients) (P= 0. 048), and mean score of all components of the SAQ questionnaire (n= 10) (P= 0. 047) with ranolazine compared with placebo. Conclusion: In optimally treated ICM patients with continued chest pain or dyspnea, ranolazine possibly had a positive impact on quality of life, a reduction in anginal frequency, and an overall improvement in the mean SAQ component score compared with baseline. Ranolazine did not change the dyspnea score compared with baseline. Keywords: controlled study, ischemic heart disease, reduced ejection fraction, microvascular disease, angin...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between career development and locus of control as they relate to barriers encountered in career development. The sample included 144 students in the engineering program at Oregon State University. The Rotter Internal- External Scale and the Career Development Inventory (Form CU) were employed. Analyses included the use of multiple regression models. Correlations were performed to build a table of relationships between variables. Two-way analyses of variance provided information on the relationships and interactive effects between scale scores and demographic variables. Based on the results of the study, the following conclusions were reached: 1. Males' scores rose from the pre-professional to the professional level on all scales of the career development measure. Females' scores on attitude <b>scales</b> <b>rose</b> between the levels; however, there were significant decreases in females' performance on scales measuring knowledge about careers and about their chosen career. 2. There were no significant differences in grade-point average among the four subsamples defined by sex and level. 3.

Professional-level females showed an inverse relationship between knowledge about their career field and attitude toward careers. They also showed an inverse relationship between grade-point average and knowledge about their career field. This may indicate difficulties related to the women's non-traditional status.

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, eminent {{scholars}} such as David Wilkins have paid considerable attention to the “new black corporate bar” as a phenomenon worthy of treatment. This Article builds on that work by introducing a fascinating law practice reality that developed in a unique setting in the early 1900 s American South. What if Wall Street had been black? What if its elite feeder institutions had been black? What if the black bar were, in a corporate economy of scale, relatively sizable? These questions might make for fascinating counter-factuals, {{if not for the}} concrete reality that such a community—albeit small—actually existed, expanded, and prospered in mid-century Durham, North Carolina. Coining the term “old black corporate bar” to stand in distinction to the “new black corporate bar,” the Article analyzes the world in which that exceptional and heretofore unexamined black bar germinated and influenced a relatively sophisticated legal landscape in a moderate, midsized southern city back-dropped by a laissez-faire white leadership class that proved progressive for racial relations. Part I briefly sets forth the economic and social landscape during America’s Jim Crow era, identifying the three most prominent historical examples where observable black economies of <b>scale</b> <b>rose</b> and fell with the whims of white commercial insecurities. Part II presents the exceptional history of the African American community in Durham, North Carolina, including the founding of its “Black Wall Street. ” Part III chronicles a watershed event in the histories of Durham and North Carolina: the establishment and rise of the North Carolina Central University School of Law, the first public institution to offer formal training for black lawyers in North Carolina. Part IV uncovers and analyzes the achievements of and challenges to the African American legal community in the “Black Wall Street” of Durham and discusses the establishment of African American lawyers’ professional associations nationally during this time. Part V, relying on historical examples of advocacy in the courts of North Carolina, establishes the old black corporate bar within the social engineering frameworks envisioned by legendary legal theorist and litigator Charles Hamilton Houston and others. Finally, a brief conclusion places this study’s examination in the contemporary discourse on blacks in the legal profession, joining the subjects of this Article to the group of newly empowered so-called “social engineers” treated in the recent scholarship in this area...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} {{inclusion}} of the compass <b>rose</b> and the <b>scale</b> bar on the Selden map indicates European influence. The identification of gum Arabic but not animal glue is further evidence of its unusual origin. While the broad appearance of the map and the painting style appears to be Chinese or East Asian, the use of gum Arabic (and not animal glue) as a binding medium in paintings from China of this period is unheard of and equally the combination of orpiment, indigo and a basic copper chloride to form a green colour in a painting from Ming China has not been reported so far. In the early seventeenth century, gum Arabic is the common binding medium used for paper-based works of art in Europe [24] and in South and West Asia, e.g. Persian or Indo-Persian illuminated manuscripts [25, 26]. It is interesting that in the Indo-Persian tradition there was a practice of adding sheep milk to gum Arabic to improve the texture of a paint [26]. It is worth noting that a trace amount of casein was detected in the HPLC–MS analysis of a fragment from the Selden map. The combination of orpiment and indigo to create a green colour is common in European and Islamic manuscripts of this time [39 – 41], but in China the common mixture for a green is indigo and gamboge [23, 28, 42]. While orpiment is mentioned as a source of pigment in Chinese historical sources, it is rarely detected on paper-based paintings from China except for some scroll paintings from Dunhuang on the Silk Road [23]. However, {{there is at least one}} alternative explanations for the detection of orpiment. It is known from historical sources that orpiment was sometimes used to protect the paper substrate from insect attacks [23, 37], though material examples of such treatment is rare. It is more common to find paper treated with berberine (or Huangbo) giving it a yellow appearance [36 – 38]. In a large survey conducted by the Freer Gallery, orpiment was not found on any of the Japanese Ukiyo-e paintings until after the seventeenth century [43]. In China orpiment is also used to make corrections owing to its good hiding power, but in the Persian tradition lead white is more commonly used for corrections [25]. The corrections on the Selden map (Fig.  13) were made with a white paint. While basic copper chlorides such as atacamite are known to have been used on wall paintings and as architectural paint in China [23, 29, 30], its use on paper-based paintings from China is rarely reported except for silk paintings found in Dunhuang along the Silk Road [23]. It is worth noting that during the time of the Ming, Dunhuang was outside the Chinese border. Atacamite and its isomers are not usually found on paper-based paintings in the western European tradition [31]. However, atacamite seems to be commonly used in Persian or Indo-Persian manuscripts of this period [25, 39]. Basic copper chlorides were not found on Japanese Ukiyo-e paintings before the eighteenth century in the Freer Gallery survey of ~ 500 such paintings from the late sixteenth to nineteenth century [43]. Overall the binding medium and pigment use appear to be more consistent with a Persian or Indo-Persian tradition than that of Chinese, Japanese or European in this period.|$|R
