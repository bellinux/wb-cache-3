2500|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} was there was no simple way to recombine them on the <b>receiver</b> <b>end.</b> If each image was sent {{at the same time}} on different frequencies, the images would have to be [...] "stacked" [...] somehow on the display, in real time. The simplest way to do this would be to reverse the system used in the camera; arrange three separate black-and-white displays behind colored filters and then optically combine their images using mirrors or prisms onto a suitable screen, like frosted glass. RCA built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on February 5, 1940, [...] privately shown to members of the US Federal Communications Commission at the RCA plant in Camden, New Jersey. This system, however, suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set, as well as having very dim pictures, the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era. Projection systems of this sort would become common decades later, however, with improvements in technology.|$|E

50|$|Value Cache: This {{is another}} form of Bus encoding, {{primarily}} used for external (off-chip) Busses. A dictionary (value cache) is maintained at both the sender and <b>receiver</b> <b>end</b> {{about some of the}} commonly shared data patterns. Instead of passing the data patterns each time, the sender just toggles one bit indicating which entry from value cache to be used at the <b>receiver</b> <b>end.</b> Only for values which are not present in the value cache, the complete data is sent over the bus. There has been various modified implementations of this technique with an intent to maximize the hits for the value cache, but the underlying idea is the same.|$|E

40|$|Random {{linear network}} coding (RLNC) {{has been shown}} to {{efficiently}} improve the network performance in terms of reducing transmission delays and increasing the throughput in broadcast and multicast communications. However, it can result in increased storage and computational complexity at the <b>receivers</b> <b>end.</b> In our previous work we considered the broadcast transmission of large file to N receivers. We showed that the storage and complexity requirements at the <b>receivers</b> <b>end</b> can be greatly reduced when segmenting the file into smaller blocks and applying RLNC to these blocks. To that purpose, we proposed a packet scheduling policy, namely the Least Received. In this work we will prove the optimality of our previously proposed policy, in terms of file transfer completion time, when N = 2. We will model our system as a Markov Decision Process and prove the optimality of the policy using Dynamic Programming. Our intuition is that the Least Received policy may be optimal regardless of the number of <b>receivers.</b> Towards that <b>end,</b> we will provide experimental results that verify that ntuition.
