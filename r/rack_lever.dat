50|$|Peter Litherland (1756-1805) was a British watchmaker and inventor. He {{was born}} in Warrington and later moved to Liverpool, which was then {{the centre of the}} watchmaking trade. In 1791 he {{patented}} the <b>rack</b> <b>lever</b> escapement for watches, which was more accurate than the commonly used verge escapement. One of his watches is in display in the World Museum Liverpool.|$|E

Its advantages are (1) it is a [...] "detached" [...] escapement; unlike the cylinder or duplex escapements the balance wheel is only in contact with the lever during the short impulse period when it swings through its centre position and swings freely the rest of its cycle, increasing accuracy, and (2) it is a self-starting escapement, so if the watch is shaken so that the balance wheel stops, it will automatically start again. The original form was the <b>rack</b> <b>lever</b> escapement, in which the lever and the balance wheel were always in contact via a gear rack on the lever. Later, it was realized that all the teeth from the gears could be removed except one, and this created the detached lever escapement. British watchmakers used the English detached lever, in which the lever was at right angles to the balance wheel. Later Swiss and American manufacturers used the inline lever, in which the lever is inline between the balance wheel and the escape wheel; this is the form used in modern watches. In 1867 Georges Frederic Roskopf invented an inexpensive, less accurate form called the Roskopf or pin-pallet escapement, which was used in cheap [...] "dollar watches" [...] in the early 20th century and is still used in cheap alarm clocks and kitchen timers.|$|E

60|$|The {{scene of}} his new labours was an {{elevated}} box {{at the side of}} the line, not far from Gertie's home. As this box was rather curious we shall describe it. It was a huge square sentry-box, with three of its sides composed of windows; these commanded a view of the line in all directions. On the fourth side of the box hung a time-piece and a framed copy of signal regulations. There was a diminutive stove in one corner, and a chest in another. In front of the box facing the clock were two telegraphic instruments, and a row of eight or ten long iron levers, which very much resembled a row of muskets in a <b>rack.</b> These <b>levers</b> were formidable instruments in aspect and in fact, for they not only cost Sam a pretty strong effort to move them, but they moved points and signals, on the correct and prompt movements of which depended the safety of the line, and the lives of human beings.|$|R
40|$|An order (n) {{algorithm}} is developed {{for use in}} the industry-standard DISCOS (Dynamics Interaction Simulation of Controls and Structures) program for flexible multibody system dynamics simulation. This version should be more computationally efficient than conventional DISCOS for problems where a large number of bodies are involved. Program-dependent changes to DISCOS are described for reducing the number of bodies required to model gear reduction and nonlinear stiffness as internal effects. The gear reduction modification can be extended to general applications, such as gear box, <b>rack</b> and pinion, <b>lever</b> joint, and screw rotation models. Upgrading DISCOS for future use include the addition of robotics capabilities such as event-driven topology changes, surface sliding, pick-and-place, and multiarm hand-off...|$|R
