40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a model of}} {{endogenous}} R&D in vertical product innovation by an original manufacturer facing Bertrand competition from parallel importer(s). We show that if parallel imports are prohibited among the distributors' countries and {{there is at least}} one country other than the manufacturer's homeland in which there is only one distributor, then allowing <b>reimports</b> reduces the manufacturer's incentive to innovate. Otherwise, permitting <b>reimports</b> has no effect on the manufacturer's incentive to invest in R&D. Moreover under the assumption of Bertrand competition, either delegating more than one distributor in each country outside the manufacturer's homeland or allowing parallel imports among the distributors' countries enables the manufacturer to maximize his total profit regardless of whether innovation is successful.

50|$|The {{first major}} {{expansion}} of hydroelectric facilities started in 1975 on the Wang Chhu between Thimphu and Phuntsholing. Known as the Chukha Hydel Project, it helped boost the nation's fledgling industrial development. The 336-megawatt Chukha Hydropower Station came on line in 1986 and was synchronized with the Indian grid that same year, and additional capacity became available in 1988. The Nu2.44 billion Chukha project was 60 percent {{paid for by}} India and budgeted outside the normal development plan process. It was planned that Bhutan would sell at low cost all excess power to West Bengal. At the same cost, Bhutan also hoped to <b>reimport</b> some of that power through the Indian power grid into southern districts. The Chukha project was important {{not only because it}} supplied electric power to western and southern districts but also because it provided a major source of income for the government. In 1981 Bhutan generated 22 million kilowatt-hours of energy from hydroelectric sources. The project's gross annual income was projected at Nu380 million in 1989. Another major plant in southwest Bhutan — the 18,000-kilowatt Jaldhaka hydroelectric plant — furnished electricity locally and exported the balance to India's West Bengal. In 1989 nearly 95 percent of Bhutan's government-installed power generation — a total of 355 megawatts — was supplied by Chukha, and a total of some 20 principal towns and 170 villages had been electrified. By 1990 Thimphu's commercial district had an underground cable system for its power supply.|$|E

40|$|The {{influenza}} virus nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M 1), and ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) undergo regulated nuclear import and export during infection. Their trafficking was analyzed by using interspecies heterokaryons containing nuclei from infected and uninfected cells.

In {{influenza virus}} mutant ts 51, in which M 1 is defective, direct <b>reimport</b> took place but was inhibited by heterologous expression of wild-type M 1. These data confirm M 1 's role as the inhibitor of premature nuclear import and as the main regulator of nuclear transport of vRNPs.

Nevertheless, especially when coming to commercial use, the challenges for manufacturing {{are difficult to}} handle. The optical quality of a system is perturbed by typical deformations, such as localized figure errors and regular mid-spatial-frequency ripples, that come from the diamond-turning process. In this proposal, we investigated a workflow for analyzing the impact of real optical surfaces on the optical performance for even complex systems. Based on a simple and robust description, the surface is implemented back into the design. While the more localized deviations are analytically described by radial basis functions, the residual ripple structures are covered by a new approach based on the power spectral density.

40|$|SummaryMutations in the {{mitochondrial}} kinase PINK 1 and the cytosolic E 3 ligase Parkin {{can cause}} Parkinson's disease. Damaged mitochondria accumulate PINK 1 {{on the outer}} membrane where, dependent on kinase activity, it recruits and activates Parkin to induce mitophagy, potentially maintaining organelle fidelity. How PINK 1 recruits Parkin is unknown. We show that endogenous PINK 1 forms a 700  kDa complex with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) selectively on depolarized mitochondria whereas PINK 1 ectopically targeted to the outer membrane retains association with TOM on polarized mitochondria. Inducibly targeting PINK 1 to peroxisomes or lysosomes, which lack a TOM complex, recruits Parkin and activates ubiquitin ligase activity on the respective organelles. Once there, Parkin induces organelle selective autophagy of peroxisomes but not lysosomes. We propose that the association of PINK 1 with the TOM complex allows rapid <b>reimport</b> of PINK 1 to rescue repolarized mitochondria from mitophagy, and discount mitochondrial-specific factors for Parkin translocation and activation...|$|E
