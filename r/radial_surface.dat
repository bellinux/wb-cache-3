The main object of this project is to test the durability under outdoor exposure of wood sawn according to two different sawing patterns.

To compute the Brown and York (B-Y) quasi-local energy (QLE), one must isometrically embed S into R^ 3. On the other hand, the Wang and Yau (W-Y) QLE embeds S into Minkowski space. In this paper, we examine the W-Y QLE for surfaces {{that may or may not}} be globally embeddable in R^ 3. We show that their energy functional, E[τ], has a critical point at τ= 0 for all constant <b>radial</b> <b>surfaces</b> in t=constant hypersurfaces using Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. For τ= 0, the W-Y QLE reduces to the B-Y QLE. To examine the W-Y QLE in these cases, we write the functional explicitly in terms of τ under the assumption that τ is only a function of θ. We then use a Fourier expansion of τ(θ) to explore the values of E[τ(θ) ] in the space of coefficients. From our analysis, we discovered an open region of complex values for E[τ(θ) ]. We also study the physical properties of the smallest real value of E[τ(θ) ], which lies on the boundary separating real and complex energies. Comment: 25 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

To our detection limit, these data are well modeled by a spherically symmetric component having an exponential <b>radial</b> <b>surface</b> brightness profile plus a sech(z) disk. The exponential <b>radial</b> <b>surface</b> brightness profile suggests an unusually faint and extended spiral bulge. A ae / r Γ 3 : 5 spheroid plus sech(z) disk is nearly as good a fit.
