5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south polar region {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the <b>relative</b> <b>surface</b> age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E

2500|$|Nanotechnology is {{an example}} of a new, {{relatively}} unstudied technology. A Swiss survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires. [...] Sixty five per cent of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter. Nanotechnology already presents new issues for OSH professionals that will only become more difficult as nanostructures become more complex. [...] The size of the particles renders most containment and personal protective equipment ineffective. [...] The toxicology values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the unique nature of nanoparticulate matter. [...] As nanoparticulate matter decreases in size its <b>relative</b> <b>surface</b> area increases dramatically, increasing any catalytic effect or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the macro substance.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{is presented to}} estimate <b>surface</b> <b>relative</b> humidity and boundary layer depth from multispectral satellite measurements using the AVHRR sensor on TIROS-N generation satellites. A sensitivity study quantifies {{the effect of a}} combination of input measurement errors of sea-surface temperature, optical depth and total water vapor used in the technique to produce outputs of <b>surface</b> <b>relative</b> humidity and boundary layer depth under simulated conditions and model atmospheres. Technique verification is then accomplished with satellite data compared to ship and aircraft vertical soundings and sea-surface temperature measurements. The root mean square differences between the <b>surface</b> <b>relative</b> humidity/boundary layer depth satellite-measured estimates and verified measurements are 6 % and 75 m respectively. Finally, synoptic-scale mapping of the <b>surface</b> <b>relative</b> humidity and boundary layer depth fields based on the satellite derived estimates is accomplished with monochromatic and color enhanced satellite images. Horizontal variability of <b>surface</b> <b>relative</b> humidity and boundary layer depth on the order of kilometers can be visually detected from these images.

5000|$|Fesenko {{discovered}} a new adelic structure on <b>relative</b> <b>surfaces,</b> called an analytic adelic structure. He studied zeta functions in higher dimensions using higher adelic zeta integrals which he defined using his higher measure. The zeta integral of a surface {{is closely related to}} the square of the zeta function of the surface. Using the higher adelic zeta integral Fesenko generalized Iwasawa-Tate theory and Tate's thesis from 1-dimensional global fields to 2-dimensional objects such as proper regular models of elliptic curves over global fields. Using higher adelic duality and higher harmonic analysis, this theory reduces the study of the zeta function of the surface to the study of a boundary integral and its analytic properties.|$|R
