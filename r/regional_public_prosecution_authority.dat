40|$|As a society, we are bombarded {{every day}} by news {{from all over the}} world, which inform us about terror threats, illegal immigrants, {{refugees}} and asylum seeker and various types of cybercrime. The police are often criticized for not being prepared enough and able to respond adequately to these threats. As a public institution, the Police produces annual reports and these are often scrutinized and criticized. However, result do not just happen, they are a consequence of planning and prioritizing. Thus, one cannot expect the Police to deliver on an area of crime if they are not asked to prioritize it first. This spiked my interest in looking at the “orders” the police get and see if they change accordingly. This study examines the way globalization affects police management and priorities. This is achieved by a document study of central governing documents for the Police for the period 2000 – 2010. The analysis looks at three sets of documents: the circulars that the Director of <b>Public</b> <b>Prosecutions</b> (DPP) that instructs the Police and the <b>Regional</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Prosecution</b> <b>Authorities</b> (PPO) on how to handle criminal cases and which targets and priorities to select; the general instructions to the police districts by the Police Directorate on what to prioritize; and the district specific instructions for Oslo police district. The analysis shows that there is a change in this period that can be attributed to globalization. These changes can be divided into two groups: changes in how the police is organised and managed and changes in what types of crime the Police prioritize. There are three major changes in the organization of the Police: 1) The police district are reduced from 54 to 27; 2) The Police Directorate was established in 2002 {{as a result of the}} spreading of New Public management (NPM) and the need to a body to coordinate international police cooperation; 3) The Norwegian Immigration Police Services (NIPS) were established as a result of the changed nature of police work and the increased need for dedicated authority to deal with asylum seeker registrations and deportations. The second group that I have identified is changes in what the Police are asked to prioritize. Crime types that can be related to the increased migration and technological development become an inseparable part of the priorities. Among those we find racially motivated crimes, international crimes, human trafficking, illegal work and others. Though I view these changes as attributed to globalization, there is no one to one cause-result relation to these and understanding them is much more complex than the scope of this project...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{investigation}} of the alleged crime, a <b>regional</b> <b>public</b> <b>prosecution</b> or law enforcement officials will decide how {{to proceed with the}} case. If there is a decision not to prosecute on behalf of the police, and therefore not proceed to a court trial (closure of the case), the victim can appeal the decision before a <b>regional</b> <b>public</b> prosecutor. If the <b>regional</b> <b>public</b> prosecutor has initially decided to close the investigation, then the next avenue is a submission of appeal is to be directed towards the Director of <b>public</b> <b>prosecutions.</b>|$|R

An internal audit of Ferrostaal by American-based law firm Debevoise and Plimpton, who was hired after the German <b>Public</b> <b>Prosecutions</b> <b>Authority</b> arrested {{of one of its}} board members in 2010, reportedly places the amount paid in bribes at R300 million, or over $40 million.

50|$|The {{government}} prosecuted {{no human}} trafficking offenses in 2009. Police investigated and forwarded for prosecution {{at least two}} cases of suspected child trafficking; as of March 2010, the National <b>Public</b> <b>Prosecution</b> <b>Authority</b> was still investigating these cases, both of which involved adults apprehended with children at the border with Uganda. Labor inspectors issued warnings and levied fines against those illegally employing children; no cases of forced labor were brought to court. While the government provided training on sex crimes and crimes against children {{as part of the}} standard police training curriculum, law enforcement officials received no trafficking-specific training. Police officers, however, made two presentations on trafficking to district police commanders and senior police officials in 2009.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{supervisory}} and controlling activities of the public prosecutor {{against a background of}} the historical developments since 1948 up to the present day in Czechoslovakia and its successor states. It focuses on the key changes that have taken place within the <b>public</b> <b>prosecution</b> institutions and depicts the specific forms these bodies have taken along the years. Subsequently it points out the most recent forms of the <b>public</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>authorities</b> performing in the Czech and Slovak republics and compares them. The thesis marginally looks at the discussions accompanying the adoption of a new <b>public</b> <b>prosecution</b> law and it maps their course so far. While compiling the thesis, analytical, historical and comparative methods were being used, with the thesis relying prevailingly on books, legal regulations and technical papers as sources of information. Having processed all the background materials and having carried out a subsequent comparison {{within the framework of the}} historical developments since 1948 along with a comparison of the Czech and Slovak republics, I have eventually arrived at a conclusion that the notions of supervising and controlling are not interchangeable and that the goal of the thesis, which consisted in their delimitation and mutual differentiation in the first place, has been reached...|$|R

30|$|At this point, it is {{important}} to discuss how realistic the content of the above clause is and the reasons for specifically using assault as a crime in our experiment for our fictitious ex-offenders. According to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, assault {{is one of the most}} common types of offences in society (Granath 2012). The Swedish Penal Code defines assault as a crime in which an offender inflicts bodily injury, illness, or pain to another person or renders a person powerless or in a similar helpless state (Swedish Code of Statutes 1962 : 700). The law specifies penalties that vary from fines for minor assault to imprisonment for up to 10  years for severely aggravated assault. An inquiry published by the Swedish <b>Public</b> <b>Prosecution</b> <b>Authority</b> (2007) shows that the most common penalty for assault of intermediate degree (neither minor nor severe) is a suspended sentence in combination with community service or fines. Hence, we chose to declare a history of assault of an intermediate degree for our ex-offenders in order to make our case as realistic and believable as possible both in terms of crime type and in terms of penalty. We wanted the type of crime to be serious enough so that employers would not regard the crime as negligible and we also wanted the type of crime to be not too serious so that employers would not disregard an application from an ex-offender too easily. Further, we wanted the penalty of the crime to be such that the penalty did not require any absence from work and such that the ex-offender did not lose any work experience. Courts can sentence between 40 and 240  h of community service according to the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. 11 We chose to use 90  h of community service, which roughly corresponds to 3  months of imprisonment (Andersson and Wahlin 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{independence}} {{of the mass media}} has been regularly restricted {{over the past two years}} in Ukraine. Following a period of relative freedom in 2005 – 2010, the scope of direct and indirect government control of the press has increased, cancelling out the achievements of the Orange Revolution in this area. The press in Ukraine is less and less able to perform its role as watchdog on the government and politicians and as a reliable source of information on the situation in the country to the public. This is mainly due to: (1) the concentration of the most important mass media in the hands of Ukraine’s most powerful oligarchs, whose business interests depend on the government; (2) the use of the press as instruments in political and business competition; (3) the ruling class’s subordination of the institutions which supervise the press; (4) repression used against media critical of the government and (5) the lack of an independent public broadcasting corporation. As a consequence, the press has hardly any impact on the political processes taking place ahead of the parliamentary election scheduled for 28 October. This is also an effect of a passiveness present in the Ukrainian public, who are tired of politics and are focused on social issues. Cases of abuse or corruption scandals revealed by the press do not provoke any response from the public and are rarely investigated by the <b>public</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>authorities.</b> The more popular a given medium is, the more strongly it is controlled by the government. At present, television has to be recognised as the least reliable of the mass media. In turn, Internet news journals are characterised by the greatest pluralism but also have more limited accessibility. The political conditions in which the mass media operate in Ukraine lead to various forms of pathology. The most serious of them are censorship by the owners and self-censorship performed by journalists, and a great share of political advertorials. As the parliamentary election is approaching, the pathologies of the Ukrainian media market have been showing up with greater intensity...|$|R
