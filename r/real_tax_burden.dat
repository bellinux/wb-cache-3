40|$|Inflation {{can alter}} the {{structure}} of tax systems and lead to higher <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burdens.</b> The ‘automatic stabiliser’ argument assumes that increasing <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> reduce consumption and thereby aggregate demand, acting as an automatic stabiliser which helps to ‘cool down’ the economy in times of inflation. This argument, however, only looks at the demand side, ignoring any effects that higher <b>tax</b> <b>burdens</b> may have {{on the cost of}} production. If employees bear less then the full <b>burden</b> of higher <b>taxes</b> then <b>real</b> labour costs will also go up, generating a cost-push upwards pressure on prices and opening up the possibility of a wage-price spiral.

40|$|In {{relationship}} with the changes of tax regulations in surrounding countries and {{last but not least}} in connection with the reform of public finances again the question of the further development of the Czech tax system is getting forward. The primary reason for the existence of taxes is fiscal, i. e. to ensure sufficient sources of public budgets for financing public property, however the tax policy must be provided in parallel with measures on the expenditure side of public budgets, that means it is necessary to perceive the tax policy {{in the context of the}} whole financial and economic policy of the state. In the sphere of direct taxes the most important external factor is the tax competition between single countries and that is also in the frame of the expanded European Union. The comparison of the income tax of legal entities shows in the last three years unambiguously the decreasing <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> of firms. However, beside that economic behaviour of companies in connection with positioning their capital abroad reacts on comparability of tax conditions in single countries. Statutory corporate income tax rates are not the right indicator for the comparison of the <b>real</b> economic <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> of various companies both in the frame of the one state and between the states. That is why for these purposes are used so-called effective corporate income tax rates discussed in this paper, which describes three methodologies for assessing these rates used in the European Union. These methodologies are using either real data from accounting on the national macro level or on the individual company micro level concerning realized entrepreneurial intentions by now or the hypothetical data concerning investments of these companies planed in the future.

The {{purpose is to}} establish the actual tax so {{that the effect of}} the changes to income tax law (intended to reduce the tax burden) can be evaluated. Income tax policy in Korea has focused on reducing the tax burden through a reduction in the statutory tax rate that allows a greater level of allowance and deduction. However, the <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> is moving in the opposite direction to that intended, as there was an increase in effective and marginal tax rates from 1998 - 2005.

Marginal tax rates increased from 5. 12 % in 1998 to 6. 67 % in 2005, despite the changes in the income tax law that were meant to reduce the tax burden on the taxpayer.

The fiscal variables used are: the debt to GDP ratio, government purchases (government consumption plus government investment), government wage bill (compensation of employees), current government transfers, current revenue, net taxes (which equals current revenue minus current transfers) direct taxes, indirect taxes, tax burden, social security contributions (actual and total, i.e. including imputed). The government spending and revenue variables were first expressed in logarithmic terms (ln), next we transformed them in differences (Δln) from t to t- 4 : real government spending, real government consumption spending, real government gross fixed capital formation, real net government transfers, real government compensation of employees, real net taxes, <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden,</b> real direct and indirect taxes.

40|$|A primary {{benefit of}} {{unfettered}} capital markets {{operating in a}} free economy is the outcome for allocating capital. Ignoring externalities, the resulting capital stock reflects the &dquo;most efficient&dquo; use of resources, {{and the amount of}} capital reflects the aggregate desires of individual units to forego present for future consumption. This view-point is intended to serve as a benchmark against which public policy should be measured and evaluated. There are numerous existing public policies which, for better or worse, affect the formation and allocation of capital. The recent public rhetoric of &dquo;supply-side economics&dquo; has focused attention on the most potent of these policies, the federal income tax code. A socially optimal federal income tax code, consistent with the viewpoint stated above, would exactly offset &dquo;externalities&dquo; in the formation and allocation of capital but otherwise not interfere with competitive market outcomes. The <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> imposed on all tax-paying units by such a code would be neutral with respect to inflation, but there is overwhelming evidence that the U.

The aim of this work is to model the real impact of legislative changes in the Czech Republic on the actual tax burden of employees with different incomes and propose optimal solution of tax calculation.

For the other years, the data are modelled from the given set using inflation. For comparison of the actual tax burden I use the effective tax rate, implicit tax rate and net implicit tax rate. The results of the calculations show that the tax deductions and the minimum and maximum base for social and health security contributions have the biggest effect on the tax rate. In the absence of tax deductions, the <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> for most employees according to the effective tax rate would have been almost constant over time.

40|$|Income {{taxation}} {{may affect}} the regional allocation of population when prices vary over space. Our contribution is to compare different income tax systems in a migration equilibrium model for Norway using improved measure of regional wage differences. We apply register data of individual wages for the entire population to identify wage differences, while controlling for both observable and unobservable worker characteristics and allowing for dynamic learning effects on wages. We estimate regional differences in cost of living based on detailed data on housing prices. The model is calibrated to the current nominal income tax system and compared to an undistorted equilibrium without income tax. We investigate two alternative tax systems: Real income taxation where the <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> is proportional to real wages and equal real taxes across regions motivated by taxation of amenities. The numerical simulations document large shifts in the regional distribution of the population {{as the result of}} income taxation. The elasticity of population with respect to tax payments comes out with a value of - 2. 64. Nominal income taxation creates a disincentive to locate in productive high-wage regions, and generates a deadweight loss due to locational inefficiencies equal to 0. 028 % of income. Real income taxation gives a geographic distribution of the population closer to the undistorted equilibrium, and hence with lower deadweight loss, while equal real taxes is the least efficient tax system...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, the {{empirical}} {{literature on the}} effects of taxation on business behaviour has addressed key questions for growth and for revenue collection: firms ’ investment, financing decisions, and avoidance behaviour have been investigated in their relationship to taxation. In general, despite variation in the magnitude of estimated effects, the literature agrees on the direction of the effects. Three elements are missing from this vast literature, though. First, we know very little about the heterogeneity of firms ’ responses to various features of the corporate tax system. Most of the results derived in the literature focus on larger businesses, generally in the US but most European economies are characterised by a considerable proportion of smaller firms. The focus of the literature on larger companies has been determined by data availability. Second, to summarize the effects of the corporate tax system, the literature has generally employed two types of tax rates: either country-level or firm-level average tax rates. Country-level rates cannot account for the heterogeneity of tax positions across firms. Firm-level rates are mostly calculated as the ratio between the accounting tax expense and the accounting pre-tax profit, whereby the variables are derived from publicly available accounts. They are generally endogenous and they may not reflect the <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> <b>burden</b> of the firm, as accounting and tax data may differ substantially. The literature is therefore likely to estimate the real effective tax rate with measurement error. The third element missing from the literature is research on the financial sector.
