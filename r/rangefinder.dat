5|$|A Westinghouse laser <b>rangefinder.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} director and the <b>rangefinder.</b> They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye.|$|E
5|$|Havelock was {{completed}} without a director-control tower (DCT) so the three remaining 4.7-inch low-angle guns fired in local control using ranges {{provided by a}} <b>rangefinder.</b> She was fitted with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.|$|E
50|$|Laser <b>rangefinders</b> {{are divided}} into four classes and several subclasses. Laser <b>rangefinders</b> {{available}} to consumers are usually laser class 1 or class 2 devices and are considered relatively eye-safe. Regardless of the safety rating, direct eye contact should always be avoided. Most laser <b>rangefinders</b> for military use exceed the laser class 2 energy levels.|$|R
5000|$|... for the 152 mm battery, two 8 m {{stereoscopic}} duplex OPL <b>rangefinders</b> in {{the fire}} control directors, atop and abaft the after tower, and three 8 m stereoscopic duplex OPL <b>rangefinders</b> in the three Modèle 1936 DP turrets.|$|R
50|$|Other devices measure {{distance}} using trigonometry (stadiametric <b>rangefinders</b> and parallax, or coincidence <b>rangefinders).</b> Older methodologies {{that use}} {{a set of}} known information, usually distances or target sizes, to make the measurement, have been in regular use since the 18th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{base model}} Su-25 {{incorporates}} {{a number of}} key avionics systems. It has no TV guidance but includes a distinctive nose-mounted laser <b>rangefinder,</b> that is thought to provide for laser-based target finding. A DISS-7 doppler radar is used for navigation; the Su-25 can fly at night, in visual and instrument meteorological conditions.|$|E
5|$|While in drydock in July 1943, a Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter <b>rangefinder</b> at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on her mainmast.|$|E
5|$|A <b>rangefinder</b> was {{installed}} on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
50|$|Special laser <b>rangefinders</b> {{are used}} in forestry. These devices have anti-leaf filters and work with reflectors. Laser beam {{reflects}} only from this reflector and so exact distance measurement is guaranteed. Laser <b>rangefinders</b> with anti-leaf filter are used for example for forest inventories.|$|R
50|$|Early in World War II, {{the range}} {{to the target}} was {{measured}} by optical <b>rangefinders.</b> Though some night operations were conducted using searchlights and star shells, in general optical <b>rangefinders</b> were limited to daytime operation. During {{the latter part of}} World War II, radar was used to determine the range to the target. Radar proved to be more accurate than the optical <b>rangefinders</b> (at least under operational conditions) and was the preferred way to determine target range during both night and day.|$|R

5|$|As far as is known, no radars were {{installed}} aboard Mutsu before her loss. While in drydock in May 1943, a Type 21 air-search radar was installed aboard Nagato {{on the roof}} of the 10-meter <b>rangefinder</b> at the top of the pagoda mast. On 27 June 1944, two Type 22 surface-search radars {{were installed}} on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radars were fitted on her mainmast.|$|E
5|$|Most ships {{had their}} director-control tower and <b>rangefinder</b> above the bridge removed in {{exchange}} for a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast.|$|E
5|$|Musashi {{was built}} with a Type 0 {{hydrophone}} system in her bow. It was only usable while stationary or at low speed. In September 1942 a Type 21 air-search radar was {{installed on the}} roof of the 15-metre <b>rangefinder</b> at the top of the forward superstructure. Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version and a Type 13 early-warning radar was fitted.|$|E

500|$|Turrets 2 and 3 had optical <b>rangefinders</b> and {{ballistics}} computers. [...] (The <b>rangefinders</b> are {{the boxes}} on the turret's rear corners). If in a surface action the GFCSs were damaged, the Turret Officer {{could turn the}} Auto-Local rotary switch to Local and continue the action using the turret's fire control equipment.|$|R

5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various rangefinders, especially the fifteen-foot <b>rangefinder</b> above the aft torpedo control tower, and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the torpedo TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the lower deck. However the Dreyer table was removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} torpedo control position in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|This {{involved}} {{the replacement of}} 'A' gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, the removal of her director-control tower and <b>rangefinder</b> above the bridge {{in exchange for a}} Type 271 target indication radar, exchanging her two 2-pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to 98 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|While in drydock in July 1943, Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter <b>rangefinder</b> at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on the funnel. Fusō was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel.|$|E
50|$|Laser <b>rangefinders</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in 3-D object recognition, 3-D object modelling, {{and a wide}} variety of computer vision-related fields. This technology constitutes the heart of the so-called time-of-flight 3D scanners. In contrast to the military instruments described above, laser <b>rangefinders</b> offer high-precision scanning abilities, with either single-face or 360-degree scanning modes.|$|R

500|$|The {{two older}} ships mounted Zeiss [...] <b>rangefinders</b> on each conning tower, but Volia was given four [...] Barr and Stroud <b>rangefinders,</b> {{one for each}} turret. These would provide data for the central {{artillery}} post to calculate, using the standard Geisler mechanical computer, and then transmit to the guns for the gun crew to follow.|$|R
5|$|While {{the ships}} were in drydock in July 1943, Type 21 air search radar was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter <b>rangefinder</b> at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted. Yamashiro mounted hers on the mainmast, while Fusō was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and <b>rangefinder</b> above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, Provence and Bretagne went to Le Havre for a naval review, {{and were}} back in Toulon in September. In 1922, Provence and Lorraine were placed in reserve, leaving Bretagne {{the only member of}} her class in service; while out of service, Provence {{underwent}} a significant refit. The work lasted from 1 February 1922 to 4 July 1923, and was carried out in Toulon. The ship had her armament improved; her main guns were given greater elevation to increase their range, and four 75mm M1897 guns were installed on the forward superstructure. A heavy tripod mast with a fire control station and a <b>rangefinder</b> for the ship's anti-aircraft guns were also added.|$|E

50|$|The {{two older}} ships mounted Zeiss 5 m <b>rangefinders</b> on each conning tower, but Volia was given four 18 ft Barr and Stroud <b>rangefinders,</b> {{one for each}} turret. These would provide data for the central {{artillery}} post to calculate, using the standard Geisler mechanical computer, and then transmit to the guns for the gun crew to follow.|$|R

5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical <b>rangefinder</b> (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E
5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo <b>rangefinder</b> was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{parliamentary}} {{discussion of}} the design focused less on the anticipated cost of the ships than the idea that France was being {{left behind in the}} technological arms race, particularly in regard to the innovative Parsons steam turbines used by HMS Dreadnought. In response the navy sent a technical mission to inspect the Parsons factory, several shipyards, and gun factories as well as the Barr & Stroud <b>rangefinder</b> factory in May 1906 and concluded that the turbines offered more power in a smaller volume than triple-expansion steam engines at a significant increase in fuel consumption at low speeds. Two ships had already been ordered from the naval dockyards three months previously when the navy decided to use the turbines in July. To further complicate things, Gaston requested a study using the heavier and more powerful 45-caliber 305-millimeter Modèle 1906 gun on 3 August while not endorsing the navy's decision to use turbines. On 6 October the director of naval construction, M. Dudebout, urgently requested a decision while recommending that three ships use steam engines and the others turbines. He felt that this would minimize delays and expense as the design needed to be modified to accommodate the turbines and their four propeller shafts, no company in France knew how to build the turbines, and the latter were three times as expensive as steam engines. Gaston was inclined to accept Dudebout's recommendation, but prevaricated until December, after parliamentary debates showed overwhelming support for turbines in all six ships. Contracts for the remaining four ships were signed on 26 December, the day after the conclusion of the debate. Gaston also delayed in deciding on which boilers to use. He sent another technical mission to Britain to look at Babcock & Wilcox's design in April 1907, but did not make a decision in favor of French-built boilers until 3 June 1908, after all the ships had been laid down.|$|E
