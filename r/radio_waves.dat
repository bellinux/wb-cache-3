5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of <b>radio</b> <b>waves,</b> whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. <b>Radio</b> <b>waves</b> with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of the decimeter <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> pulses in the {{frequency}} range of 1. 4 GHz have been made for the data observed at Awara <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> station of Fukui University of technology from April to July, in 2008. Results show that there are pulses in wide period range from 0. 3 sec to 1600 sec in the data from our Galaxy center. Basically the appearance of pulses in the decimeter range corresponds to that of decameter <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> pulses. Based on the hypothesis that these <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> pulses are generated in the region extremely close to the event horizon of Kerr black hole, we have expected a wider spreading of the pulse period for the case of decimeter <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> pulses compared with the spreading of the decameter <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> pulses. In several cases of the pulse periods results support this difference of the pulse periods spreading between decameter and decimeter <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> pulse...|$|R

5|$|According to Tough, it is {{unlikely}} that the avoidance of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
5|$|Although some <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> are emitted {{directly}} by astronomical objects, {{a product of}} thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed {{is the result of}} synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} measurements campaign carried out at a carrier frequency of 24 GHz {{with the help of}} TP-LINK router in indoor line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios. Firstly, the <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> propagation strategies are analyzed in some rooms with router of point to point Ad hoc network. Then floor attenuation is defined for 3 floors in experimental region. The free space model and dual slope models are modified by considering the influence of corridor conditions on each floor. Using these models, indoor signal attenuation can be estimated in modeling of indoor <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> propagation. These results and modified models can also be used in planning the networks of future personal communications services.

There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and <b>radio</b> <b>waves,</b> and inspection of radioactive debris.

5|$|GRB970508 {{was also}} the first burst with an {{observed}} radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> had expanded almost at the speed of light. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions.|$|E
5|$|Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when {{a charge}} is {{accelerated}} it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear {{transition to a}} lower energy level, photons of various energy will be emitted, ranging from <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> to gamma rays. Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated (for example, electron–positron annihilation).|$|E

5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for <b>radio</b> <b>waves,</b> radio telescopes in space are of most use for Very Long Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes.

5|$|Over {{the next}} month, Frail {{observed}} that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter {{is responsible}} for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and {{the energy is transmitted}} out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.|$|E
