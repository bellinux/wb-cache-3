5|$|Written by David A. McIntee, {{this was}} a four-part Lovecraftian horror story set in Arkham, New England in 1927, {{although}} McIntee later began a <b>rewrite</b> <b>to</b> shift the action to Cornwall. The story involved alien bodysnatchers who could only inhabit {{the bodies of the}} dead. The villain of the piece would discover the remains of a Silurian god and try and clone itself a new body from the fossilized body.|$|E
25|$|HD DVD-RW is the rewritable disc {{variant of}} HD DVD with equal storage {{capacity}} to an HD DVD-R. The primary advantage of HD DVD-RW over HD DVD-R {{is the ability}} to erase and <b>rewrite</b> <b>to</b> an HD DVD-RW disc, up to about 1,000 times before needing replacement, making them comparable with the CD-RW and DVD-RW standards. This is also of benefit if there are writing errors when recording data, as the disc is not ruined and can still store data by erasing the faulty data.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{development}} {{after work}} finished on Xenoblade Chronicles, Xenoblade Chronicles X features multiple returning staff from earlier Xeno titles, including series creator Tetsuya Takahashi {{as executive director}} and scenario co-writer. The staff also included Xenoblade Chronicles director Koh Kojima and producer Shingo Kawabata, Xenoblade Chronicles scenario co-writer Yuichiro Takeda, and Xenosaga artists Kunihiko Tanaka and Kouichi Mugitani. The team set themselves the challenge of creating an expansive world for players to explore within a tight development budget. The implementation of online multiplayer both proved challenging due to the team's inexperience, and required a comprehensive story <b>rewrite</b> <b>to</b> recast the protagonist as a player-created avatar. The music was created by anime composer Hiroyuki Sawano.|$|E

500|$|Chris Farley was {{initially}} hired to voice Shrek, {{and he had}} recorded {{nearly all of the}} dialogue for the character, but died before completing the project. A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015. DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script <b>rewrite,</b> <b>to</b> leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek. According to Myers, he wanted to voice the character [...] "for two reasons: I wanted the opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg; and [...] a great story about accepting yourself for who you are." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Zaillian (writer of Schindler's List) {{was offered}} the chance to write the {{adaptation}} after Tally passed, but he also declined. He explained that [...] "I was busy. And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel." [...] David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Ridley Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and MGM) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: [...] "There's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available {{to work on the}} script day-to-day." [...] Mamet was preparing to direct his own film. Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: [...] "It's hard to say no to Dino once and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice." [...] A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as [...] "stunningly bad" [...] but found Zaillian's <b>rewrite</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "gripping entertainment".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, British {{publisher}} Scion published dozens {{of science fiction}} (sf) novels by John Russell Fearn under the pseudonym [...] "Vargo Statten". [...] These were very successful, and Scion decided {{to take advantage of}} the popularity of the name by issuing a monthly sf magazine. [...] The first issue was dated January 1954 and was edited by Alistair Paterson. [...] The target audience included long-time fans: Scion had notified established science fiction fan groups before the launch, so there was a letter column in the first issue, and a column by Vincent Clarke, a well-known fan, covered fan news. [...] Scion's stated intention was to have at least 10% of the magazine devoted to the sf fan community, and also to publish only stories by British writers. [...] Paterson's editorial policy for the fiction was aimed at younger readers, which led him to return a story by Brian Aldiss with a request for a <b>rewrite</b> <b>to</b> make it more suitable for teenaged readers. [...] Aldiss, then right at the start of his career, refused, and never submitted a story to the magazine again. [...] The stories in the early issues were mostly written by Fearn, E.C. Tubb, and F. Dubrez Fawcett, who also wrote gangster fiction for Scion.|$|E

500|$|Writer David Fisher {{had contributed}} two scripts to Doctor Whos sixteenth season– The Stones of Blood and The Androids of Tara– and {{was asked by}} {{producer}} Graham Williams for further story ideas. Fisher submitted two proposals; {{the first of these}} became The Creature from the Pit while the other, The Gamble with Time, concerned a plot to rig the casinos in Las Vegas to finance time travel experiments. Williams asked Fisher to rework The Gamble With Time as a spoof of Bulldog Drummond, a fictional detective from the 1920s. Fisher's draft script centered around Scarlioni, a member of the Sephiroth race, who had become fractured in time in an accident. The script was mainly set in the year 1928 with the Doctor and Romana, aided by Drummond-esque detective [...] "Pug" [...] Farquharson, on the trail of the stolen Mona Lisa, pursuing Scarlioni from Paris to Monte Carlo where his partner, the Baroness Heidi, is using time travel technology to cheat at roulette at the casino to fund Scarlioni's time travel experiments. Other settings included Paris in 1979, Leonardo da Vinci's studio in the year 1508 and prehistoric Earth. At this point, production unit manager John Nathan-Turner had worked out that the production team could afford to film on location in Paris with a stripped-down crew. This necessitated a <b>rewrite</b> <b>to</b> Fisher's scripts to move the action to Paris and, for cost reasons, to drop the 1920s setting. The Doctor's robotic dog companion K9 also had to be removed from the script as the cost of bringing the robot dog and his operators to Paris was prohibitive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene in}} which Marcus changes his mind while with Jacqueline was a major <b>rewrite</b> <b>to</b> the script. According to Hudlin, in the {{original}} draft, Eddie's character Marcus [...] "never decides anything, things are decided for him by the different women. So, we finally realized {{he had to make}} an affirmative choice. Going through the script with a buddy of mine, we talked about it, and my buddy Tre said 'look, he's got to make a decision.' And I said, 'you're right. He's got to reject her, and choose her.' And it seems so obvious now, I'm like 'what's wrong with me? What was wrong with all of us that it took us so long to figure out what we really needed to do to fix the movie?' ...|$|E

40|$|When {{students}} first learn programming, {{they often}} {{rely on a}} simple operational model of a program’s behavior to explain how particular features work. Because such models build on their earlier training in algebra, students find them intuitive, even obvious. Students learn-ing type systems, however, have to confront an entirely different notation with a different semantics that many find difficult to understand. In this work, I begin to build the theoretical underpinnings for treating typechecking in a manner like the operational semantics of execution. Intuitively, each term is incrementally <b>rewritten</b> <b>to</b> its type. For example, each basic constant <b>rewrites</b> directly <b>to</b> its type and each lambda expression <b>rewrites</b> <b>to</b> an arrow type whose domain {{is the type of}} the lambda’s formal parameter and whose range is the body of the lambda expression which, in turn, <b>rewrites</b> <b>to</b> the range type. ii CHAPTER...|$|R
