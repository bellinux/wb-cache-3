25|$|The {{investigation}} {{following the}} crash, especially regarding {{the failure of}} the pilot to respond to crew concerns about the deicing procedure, led to a number of reforms in pilot training regulations. Partial blame was placed on the young, inexperienced flight crew, who had a combined age of only 65 and had begun their careers as commercial pilots less than five years earlier. Typical of upstart low-cost carriers, Air Florida frequently hired youthful pilots who worked for less money than veterans and were for the most part seeking to gain flight experience prior to joining a major airline. It became a widely used case study for both air crews and rescue workers. Another result of the accident was the development of an improved <b>rescue</b> <b>harness</b> for use in helicopter recoveries.|$|E
5000|$|Made with {{suitable}} rope by {{qualified personnel}} this knot {{can be used}} as a <b>rescue</b> <b>harness</b> capable of supporting a person while being hoisted or lowered to safety. One loop supports the body, around the chest and under the arms, and the other loop supports the legs, under the knees. Tied towards the middle of a line, one end is used for lowering and the other end can serve as a tagline, to control the victim's position with respect to hazards during the descent. [...] A snug fitting of this knot should restrain the victim, even if unconscious. [...] The fireman's chair can also be used to move a victim laterally when used as a part of a tensioned horizontal highline system.|$|E

40|$|Fabric {{products}} {{protected from}} raveling by coating threads and filling stitching holes with silicone rubber. Uncored silicone rubber applied to stitching lines with air-pressurized sealant gun. Next, plastic release film placed on coated side, and blanket flipped over so release film lies underneath. Blanket then bagged and adhesive cured under partial vacuum of about 3. 5 psi or under pressure. Applications include balloons, parachutes, ultralight aircraft, sails, <b>rescue</b> <b>harnesses,</b> tents, or other fabric products highly stressed in use...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the performance of quick-release harness buoyancy aids in water rescue. Design/methodology/approach – The assumption is questioned that the performance of water <b>rescue</b> <b>harnesses,</b> in what is perceived as benign, low-flow conditions (< 1. 85 [*]km/s) is acceptable. Increasingly, rescue personnel are deployed to flooding events during which low-flow, but high-hazard conditions may prevail. A range of commercially available buoyancy aids manufactured in the UK were tested under “real world conditions” and the nature of the release rated. Findings – The primary data illustrate that 25 per cent of releases where incomplete in low-flow conditions. By analogy a karabiner in a rope rescue system with a 1 : 4 chance of failure would be unacceptable. Consequently, harness testing, design, manufacture, use and deployment may all be in need of reconsideration if the harness is to remain suitable for its current deployment. Originality/value – A group of international experts from the USA, Europe and the UK have reviewed the findings and highlight possible reasons for these failures. These comments form the basis for research in future papers...|$|R

50|$|The {{deck of the}} Antietam {{served as}} the {{launching}} pad for the stratospheric balloon flight of Commander Malcolm D. Ross and Lieutenant Commander Victor A. Prather, both of the United States Navy, on 4 May 1961. This flight set an absolute official altitude record for manned balloons of 113,740 ft. The flight took place over the Gulf of Mexico.

The orange coloured buttstock has been modified so that it can fold along the left hand side of the stock and it also can hold six additional rounds of ammunition. The rifle is issued with a special case that has been designed to attach to the search and <b>rescue</b> technicians' parachute <b>harnesses.</b>|$|R
