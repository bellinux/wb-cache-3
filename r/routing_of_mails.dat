40|$|The last {{twenty-five years}} have seen {{major changes in the}} nature and scope of {{geographical}} information. This has happened in one way in society at large, where computers, satellites and global positioning systems have made geographical information more extensive, more detailed and more available. It has happened in another way within the university, where rapidly evolving geographic information systems have been touted as tools useful {{in a wide range of}} disciplines, tools that will resolve problems as different as the nature of global climate change and the <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> In both settings the move from manual to computer-based systems is viewed as having a natural trajectory, from less powerful to more powerful technologies. These systems are held to be increasingly able to model and represent all that is important in geographical knowledge and behaviour. They are seen as fitting into and supporting traditional scientific and social practices and institutions. Digital Places: Living with Geographic Information Technologies shows that on each score the systems have been misunderstood and their impacts underestimated. By offering an understanding of Geographic Information Systems within the social, economic, legal, political and ethical contexts within which they exist, the author shows that there are substantial limits to their ability to represent the very objects and relationships, people and places, that many believe to be most important. Focusing on the ramifications of GIS usage, Digital Places shows that they are associated with far-reaching changes in the institutions in which they exist, and in the lives of those they touch. In the end they call for a complete rethinking of basic ideas, like privacy and intellectual property and the nature of scientific practice, that have underpinned public life for the last one hundred years...|$|R

The Chinese postman problem on mixed networks (MCPP), {{is an extension of}} the CPP, in which some streets from the network are allowed to be traversed in both directions, and others may be traversed in one specified direction only. Applications of the MCPP include: <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> newspaper or <b>mail</b> delivery vehicles, parking meter coin collection or household refuse collection vehicles, street sweepers, snow plows, and school buses; spraying roads with salt, inspection of electric power lines, or oil or gas pipelines, and reading electric meters.

Abstract [...] The Chinese postman problem on mixed networks (MCPP), is a practical generalization f the classical Chinese postman problem (CPP), which has many real-world applications. The MCPP has been shown to be NP-complete. Therefore, it is difficult to solve the problem exactly.

Mail art is an international phenomenon that evolved over the past sixty odd years due {{to the efforts of}} a dedicated and growing group of individuals. American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network, making it a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art today...|$|R
