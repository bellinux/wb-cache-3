40|$|<b>Rosacea</b> is {{a chronic}} skin disorder, {{characterized}} by redness and flushing of the cheeks, nose, chin or forehead. It {{has been proposed}} that <b>rosacea</b> {{is a result of}} frequent blushing (Miller, 1921; Klaber & Whittkower, 1939). However, the relationship between <b>rosacea</b> and blushing is uncertain. The aim of the present research was to investigate the relationship between psychological stress and vascular disturbances in <b>rosacea.</b> Five studies were conducted. The first study explored the relationship between <b>rosacea</b> and mental health while the next two investigated vascular responses in <b>rosacea</b> sufferers and controls to acetylcholine (which induces endothelial vasodilatation and axon reflexes) and psychological stress (embarrassment). The fourth study aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} psychological indicators and <b>rosacea</b> symptoms on a daily basis. The fifth study consisted of three case studies looking at the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Task Concentration Training (TCT) with <b>rosacea</b> sufferers presenting with social anxiety and fear of blushing symptoms. In study 1, sixty-two participants were asked to complete the Blushing Propensity Scale (BPS), Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS). Outcomes from the first study indicated that Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers (n= 12) perceived themselves as blushing more frequently and intensely than Type 1 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers (n= 19) or controls (n= 31). This suggested that Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers experiencing frequent blushing may have a lower sensitivity threshold to blushing episodes. In addition, Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers perceived themselves as more stressed than Type 1 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers or controls, possibly indicating that managing the condition can be stressful. Contrary to previous reports (Gupta et al., 2006; National <b>Rosacea</b> Society, 2005) severity of <b>rosacea</b> was not associated with depression, social anxiety or fear of negative evaluation. However, a few participants who reported high social anxiety and stress scores were offered psychological intervention (Study 5). The aim of the second study was to investigate vascular responses in <b>rosacea</b> sufferers. Cutaneous endothelial and axon reflex function was assessed using an acetylcholine dose response curve. The axon reflex was assessed by inducing a flare with ACh iontophoresis. Outcomes from this study indicated that Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers had a greater axon reflex response than Type 1 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers. Thus over-reactivity of the axon reflex in Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers might contribute to prolonged vasodilatation. However, cutaneous endothelial responses to ACh were similar in <b>rosacea</b> and control groups. The results suggested that neural pathways mediated the flushing response rather than cutaneous endothelial function. The third study investigated facial blood flow while participants attempted laboratory induced embarrassment tasks. Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers were found to have a greater blood flow in the facial region than Type 1 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers during singing and speech tasks, suggesting that Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers blushed more than type 1 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers or controls. Furthermore, Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers reported higher embarrassment and blushing ratings than Type 1 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers. This indicated that Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers perceived themselves as emotionally more aroused than other participants. Taken together, it would appear that a combination of physiological and cognitive factors increased facial blood flow in Type 2 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers in laboratory induced embarrassment tasks. The fourth study explored the relationship between stress and symptoms of <b>rosacea.</b> Using a diary, 15 <b>rosacea</b> sufferers recorded their stress, anxiety and mood and their intensity of <b>rosacea</b> symptoms daily. Stress was associated with increased stinging/facial redness on the same day for 1 to 2 months. Furthermore, it was associated with increased stinging ratings the next day. However, feeling anxious or having low mood was not related to increase stinging the next day. The presence of increased stress found in <b>rosacea</b> participants on the day where stinging and redness occurred should be taken into consideration when formulating psychological interventions for <b>rosacea</b> sufferers. In study 5, individual psychological intervention was provided to three participants experiencing stress, fear of blushing and social anxiety symptoms. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Task Concentration Training (TCT) were helpful in managing stress, anxiety and fear of blushing symptoms in individual <b>rosacea</b> sufferers. Encouragingly, all participants reported a gain in their repertoire of strategies and showed a decrease in anxiety symptoms on assessment questionnaires following their intervention. Replication of the intervention protocol and investigation of other psychological approaches are required to establish best practise outcome for <b>rosacea</b> sufferers who require psychological interventions. The present findings suggest that over-reactivity of axon reflexes contributes to facial flushing. In addition, emotional flushing in <b>rosacea</b> sufferers appears to be maintained by a combination of cognitive and physiological factors. On a clinical level, the study recommends that emotional stress associated with facial flushing in <b>rosacea</b> sufferers to be targeted for psychological intervention...|$|R

25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and <b>Rosaceae</b> (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and <b>Rosaceae.</b> Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E

25|$|Two species {{similar to}} Bifrenaria, but {{that showed a}} highly salient claw {{at the base of}} the {{labellum}} and lateral lobes abruptly divided were then classified under this genus. In 1914, Rudolf Schlechter suggested they should be classified under the genus Lindleyella, with Lindley's Bifrenaria aurantiaca (which presented the mentioned differences) as the type. However this genus name was already occupied (It is a synonym of Lindleya, in the <b>Rosaceae).</b> Just thirty years later, in 1944, Frederico Carlos Hoehne, working on the first revision of genus Bifrenaria, corrected the suggestion of Schlechter. Hoehne initially proposed the genus Schlechterella for these species but, coincidentally, this name was also taken, this time by African Asclepiadaceae. Finally a genus with an available name in homage to Schlechter was erected in the very next issue of the journal, Rudolfiella, by which time the number of species had increased to seven. On this revision, besides Rudolfiella, Hoehne divided Bifrenaria into two genera, accepting Lindley's Stenocoryne but calling attention to the existence of Rafinesque's Adipe, which should have nomenclatural priority, while also raising doubts about the identity of several described species. In 1990, Manfred Wolff formally resurrected the genus Adipe and transferred to it ten Bifrenaria species, besides the two already described by Rafinesque; his change was purely nomenclatural and he did not revisit the species.|$|E
