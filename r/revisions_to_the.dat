5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition. The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified <b>revisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dingley Act, and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions. Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E

5|$|The first {{published}} score was the four-hand piano arrangement (Edition Russe de Musique, RV196), dated 1913.

5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's <b>revisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wedding cantata is not known. It is likely that he revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E

5|$|It is rumoured that Briatore {{arranged}} {{an agreement}} with Red Bull that, if they offered Webber a race seat, Renault would supply them with engines. On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove the car in a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day. The car featured heavy <b>revisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team's previous cars and looked very much like designer Adrian Newey's previous cars which had either won or {{come close to the}} World Title.

Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of.|$|E

Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Computer User's Manual for Payload Acoustics Environment for Shuttle (PACES), the analytical model was validated by means of measured data from the first three shuttle lift-offs.

They are: a <b>revision</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recommended exterior sound pressure levels, a <b>revision</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recommended payload bay acoustic absorption coefficients, and a <b>revision</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vertical station datum for the payload bay. The two other changes do not involve the user. The changes are associated with the output of confidence limits for the predicted space-average sound pressure levels in the payload bay, and a modification <b>to</b> <b>the</b> analytical representation of the payload bay door. The changes are discussed briefly in this Addendum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Computer User's Manual...|$|R

5|$|When {{the highway}} was first {{designated}} {{in the late}} 1910s, it extended farther south than it does today and ended well short of its current northern terminus. The southern end was added to another state highway, truncating M-18's length to roughly its current southern terminus in 1926. The northern end was also simultaneously extended {{for the first time}} with these <b>revisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highway's routing. In the 1940s, the northern extension was reversed and then reinstated. M-18's course was last changed with the opening of three different freeways in the area in the 1960s and 1970s. The last extension in 1973 supplanted the M-144 designation from Roscommon north to Luzerne.|$|E
5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with <b>revisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st United States Congress, {{following}} the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills {{of rights and}} English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in private homes. Several <b>revisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed {{in the way in}} which peace and war were distinguished (including the possibility of a situation, such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize quartering. However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.|$|E
