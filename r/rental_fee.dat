A ramp to the New Haven would have {{permitted}} NYW trains to run directly to Grand Central Terminal (GCT): provisions {{for such a}} ramp were designed into the overpass, but no track connection was constructed. The NH would have discouraged running trains into GCT, since it paid a <b>rental</b> <b>fee</b> to the NYC for each movement into the terminal.|$|E

Workers lived in tents in the hot summer sun on a barren hillside, paying Durst 75 cents per week for the privilege as a <b>rental</b> <b>fee.</b> More workers were on hand than could be accommodated in these tents, however, forcing some to make do in the elements under crude structures constructed from poles and burlap sacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{business model}} for video rental stores had traditionally been {{to pay a}} large flat fee per video, approximately $65, and offer unlimited rentals for the lifetime of the medium itself. Sumner Redstone, whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept a 60% of the <b>rental</b> <b>fee,</b> paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through Rentrak. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized {{on the fact that}} movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher manufacturer's suggested retail price targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70–$100 per title.|$|E

2500|$|The Province of Manitoba charges Manitoba Hydro a water <b>rental</b> <b>fee</b> {{proportionate}} to {{the total}} volume of water passed through the generating stations. Increases in this rental have provided an important stream of non-tax revenue to the Provincial government. [...] While at first glance it may seem [...] for the provincial government to collect such fees from a company it owns, the government argues that such fees help ensure that Manitobans receive a direct return on that portion of energy resources that is exported. More controversially, in 2002-2004 the New Democratic Party provincial government collected a direct dividend from Manitoba Hydro. This was criticized by the provincial opposition parties for various reasons but mostly as evidence that Hydro rates were unnecessarily high with the excess amounting to a hidden tax.|$|E
2500|$|After {{winning the}} league {{for the first}} time, the Everton Committee and President John Houlding became embroiled in deep and bitter conflict. Houlding {{originally}} rented Anfield from the Orrell family and sublet to Everton FC. [...] In 1885 Houlding bought the land from Orrel and rented directly to Everton FC. The Liberal-leaning committee viewed Conservative councillor Houlding as having a personal financial and political agenda and there was disagreement over the club's business model {{and the issue of}} selling refreshments, to which Houlding had sole rights. Houlding had increased the club's rent by 150% after the 1889–90 season to £250 per annum. John Orrell, who owned the adjacent land, then attempted to legally run a road through the new main stand to access his land. [...] This would require Everton to buy both Anfield and Orrell's land or to rent both. Everton committee members accused Houlding of knowing of the legal right of way and allowing the new stand to be built. [...] The committee wanted Houlding to negotiate on the combined Anfield and Orrell's land rent of £370 or the purchase of both, but were told the <b>rental</b> <b>fee</b> was non-negotiable. Houlding refused to give Everton FC a contractual rental lease.|$|E

After outgrowing its previous venues, the revival meetings moved to an air-conditioned tent that seated 10,000. On August 3, the revival meetings returned to Ignited Church. [...] "A spokeswoman for the revival, Lynne Breidenbach, said the offerings have covered their enormous operating costs. Before the move to the airport grounds, she said the ministry paid a daily <b>rental</b> <b>fee</b> of $15,000 for the local convention center, as well as comparable fees for use of a stadium. His spokesperson didn’t know how much the current setup costs. The offerings, said Breidenbach, have not contributed to a significant infusion of cash for Bentley or his ministry." [...] During the revival, Bentley's spokesperson said that Bentley continued [...] "to draw his standard salary, set by his board, from his office in Canada. It is a modest salary and is in the five-figure range", and that Fresh Fire Ministries is audited annually.
