50|$|Kirigi has a {{seemingly}} superhuman resistance to pain and injury. He {{is capable of}} lifting at least 1,000 pounds. Both a weapons master and an accomplished martial artist, his various areas of expertise {{include the use of}} the Katana, Shuriken, Kyoketsu Shogi (<b>rope</b> <b>knife),</b> and sai. In addition, the use of a form of meditation allows him to recover from otherwise-mortal wounds. As a result, he is virtually impervious to all but devastating wounds.|$|E
5000|$|Kirigi is an {{opponent}} of both The Chaste, a group commanded by Stick, and two of Stick's former pupils, Daredevil and Elektra Natchios. This hatred eventually prompts the Hand to resurrect him in order to destroy Elektra. This plot eventually reaches its climax as Elektra, walking into a trap laid by the Hand, attempts to kill the Hand's Jonin (ninja master) {{with the assistance of}} Daredevil. Instead of meeting the Jonin, she meets Kirigi. In response, she stabs him with two sai; however, he merely pulls them out effortlessly. He then dupes her into going for her sai, only to choke her with his <b>rope</b> <b>knife.</b> However, she manages to impale him with her blade, forcing him to break off the fight. A day later, however, he returns to attack Elektra again after recovering from his wounds using meditation and mystic ointments. Once again, a fierce battle ensues. Elektra flees into a semi-rig and smashes into him at a high speed. She then leaps out of the semi-rig before it explodes. In spite of this, Kirigi merely stands back up, though his skin is still engulfed in flames. Finally, Elektra simply decapitates him as he tries to regain his bearings, saying: [...] "God or demon, Kirigi had a neck and that was human enough." ...|$|E

50|$|An izba (изба́) is a {{traditional}} Russian countryside dwelling. Often a log house, it forms the living quarters of a conventional Russian farmstead. It is generally built close to the road and inside a yard, which also encloses a kitchen garden, hay shed, and barn within a simple woven stick fence. Traditional, old-style izba construction involved the use of simple tools, such as <b>ropes,</b> axes, <b>knives,</b> and spades. Nails were not generally used, as metal was relatively expensive, and neither were saws a common construction tool. Both interior and exterior are of split pine tree trunks, the gap between is traditionally filled with river clay, not unlike the Canadian log cabin.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Scipio {{prepared}} to besiege Numantia. He asked the allied tribes in Hispania for specified numbers of troops.

He built an embankment of the same dimensions as the wall around the adjoining marsh, and two towers by the River Durius (Douro) to which he moored large timbers with <b>ropes</b> full of <b>knives</b> and spear heads, constantly kept in motion by the current. This prevented the enemy from slipping through covertly. He managed to force Numantia into starvation. The Numantines surrendered. Some killed themselves. Scipio kept fifty men for his triumph, sold the rest into slavery and destroyed the city.|$|R

They made a great effort to turn the boat's head into the eddy behind it, but as the line touched the rock its sharp edge severed the <b>rope</b> like a <b>knife,</b> and the boat shot away down the rapid. Those on the ledge watched it with breathless anxiety. Two or three dangers were safely passed, then to their horror they saw the head of the canoe rise suddenly as it ran up a sunken ledge just under the water. An instant later the stern swept round, bringing her broadside on to the stream, and she at once capsized.|$|R

These two worthies kept themselves concealed in the secret parts of the island, until {{the departure of the}} two vessels.

Then, with short focus, he stared at the hang-nail and the finger with a new comprehension. In a minute, or a few minutes at best, that hang-nail, that finger, cunningly jointed and efficient, might be part of a mangled carcass {{at the bottom of the}} crevasse. Conscious of his fear, he hated himself. Bear-eaters were made of sterner stuff. In the anger of self-revolt he all but hacked at the <b>rope</b> with his <b>knife.</b> But fear made him draw back the hand and to stick himself again, trembling and sweating, to the slippery slope.

The dangers of the narrow and rapid Yellowstone River, and the absence of game may explain the quick dissolution of the trapping party. After reaching a point where the Gallatin, Jefferson and Madison Rivers meet, known today as Three Forks, Montana, the trio managed to maintain their partnership for only about two months. [...] There is much speculation as to where the party, at that point only consisting of Colter and Hancock following a falling out with Dixon, spent the winter of 1806-1807.

This stepson, Dave Fleming, accompanied his stepfather on a hunting trip to Clark’s Fork Canyon as a boy, and was informed that his stepfather had made camp in this exact spot while trapping with Colter many years earlier. Fleming reportedly remembered and passed on this detail as his stepfather asserted that during winter of 1806-1807, Colter had grown restless with taking shelter and ascended the canyon into the Sunlight Basin of modern-day Wyoming, which would make him the first known white man to have ever entered this region.|$|R
6000|$|A small {{thicket of}} trees was in sight, {{and they were}} making for it, when sounds of angry voices were heard, and Spring, bristling up the mane on his neck, and giving a few premonitory fierce growls like thunder, bounded forward {{as though he had}} been seven years younger. Stephen darted after him, Ambrose rushed after Stephen, and {{breaking}} through the trees, they beheld the dog at the throat of one of three men. As they came on the scene, the dog was torn down and hurled aside, giving a howl of agony, which infuriated his master. Letting fly his crossbow bolt full at the fellow's face, he dashed on, reckless of odds, waving his knotted stick, and shouting with rage. Ambrose, though more aware of the madness of such an assault, still hurried to his support, and was amazed as well as relieved to find the charge effectual. Without waiting to return a blow, the miscreants took to their heels, and Stephen, seeing nothing but his dog, dropped on his knees beside the quivering creature, from whose neck blood was fast pouring. One glance of the faithful wistful eyes, one feeble movement of the expressive tail, and Spring had made his last farewell! That was all Stephen was conscious of; but Ambrose could hear the cry, [...] "Good sirs, good lads, set me free!" [...] and was aware of a portly form bound to a tree.

Among the band were George Drouillard, John Potts, and Peter Weiser. Colter once again decided to return to the wilderness, even though he was only a week from reaching St. Louis. At the confluence of the Yellowstone and Bighorn Rivers, Colter helped build Fort Raymond, and was later sent by Lisa to search out the Crow Indian tribe to investigate the opportunities of establishing trade with them.|$|R

The research was conducted by mean of Factorial Randomized Block Design with 16 replications. Each potted plant was applied with NPK and KNO 3 fertilizers with such varying dosages as control (H 0 E 0), with no NPK + 16 grams KNO 3 (H 0 E 1), with no NPK + 20 grams KNO 3 (H 0 E 2), with no NPK + 24 grams KNO 3 (H 0 E 3), 40 grams NPK + with no KNO 3 (H 1 E 0), 40 grams NPK + 16 grams KNO 3 (H 1 E 1), 40 grams NPK + 20 grams KNO 3 (H 1 E 2), 40 grams NPK + 24 grams KNO 3 (H 1 E 3), 48, 5 grams NPK + with no KNO 3 (H 2 E 0), 48, 5 grams NPK + 16 grams KNO 3 (H 2 E 1), 48, 5 grams NPK + 20 grams KNO 3 (H 2 E 2), 48, 5 grams NPK + 24 grams KNO 3 (H 2 E 3), 58 grams NPK + with no KNO 3 (H 3 E 0), 58 grams NPK + 16 grams KNO 3 (H 3 E 1), 58 grams NPK + 20 grams KNO 3 (H 3 E 2), 58 grams NPK + 24 grams KNO 3 (H 3 E 3). The observation was made after the plant {{reached the age of}} 14 to 35 days after planting (DAP). The variables, therefore, included in the observation were vegetative and yield observations. The vegetative observation consists of plant height, leaf number, leaf width, stem diameter, whereas the yield observation includes fruit weight, fruit diameter, fruit length, fruit flesh thickness, sugar content, total fresh matter, and total dry matter. All parameters were then analyzed with ANOVA. The results of observation showed that NPK and KNO 3 fertilizers addition was significantly different only for plant height of 14 days after planting. Observation on 21 to 35 days after planting, on the other hand, was unsignificantly different. Similarly, the observation on leaf number, leaf width, stem diameter, fruit weight, fruit diameter, fruit length, fruit flesh thickness, sugar content, total fresh matter, total dry matter, respectively, was unsignificantly different for observation of each age...|$|R
