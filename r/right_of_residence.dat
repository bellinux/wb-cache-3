5|$|On 24 April 2009, the Brown {{government}} announced a long-awaited decision on Gurkhas' rights {{to settle in}} the UK, leading to criticism of its decision to apply five criteria to any Gurkha soldier applying for British citizenship. On 29 April 2009, {{with the support of}} both opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 to live in the UK. Following the Government defeat, the Minister for Immigration Phil Woolas announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July. This was followed by a high-profile campaign by actress Joanna Lumley, which included a meeting with Brown at 10 Downing Street and a confrontation with Phil Woolas at the BBC Westminster studios, leading to an impromptu press conference in which she pressured Woolas into further talks over the issue. Finally, after a Commons Home Affairs Committee meeting between campaigners, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office on 19 May, Brown announced to the House of Commons on 20 May that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would make a statement on the issue the following day. Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the war, about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled the {{territory}} and Georgia proper, most across the border into North Ossetia. A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia to other parts of Georgia. Many South Ossetians were resettled in uninhabited areas of North Ossetia from which the Ingush had been expelled by Stalin in 1944, leading to conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush over the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in former Ingush territory.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{citizens}} and residents {{from other parts}} of the nation now have automatic <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> on the island after meeting these criteria (Immigration (Amendment No. 2) Act 2012). Australian citizens can carry either a passport or a form of photo identification to travel to Norfolk Island. The Document of Identity, which is no longer issued, is also acceptable within its validity period. Citizens of all other nations must carry a passport to travel to Norfolk Island even if arriving {{from other parts of}} Australia. Holders of Australian visas who travel to Norfolk Island have departed the Australian Migration Zone. Unless they hold a multiple-entry visa, the visa will have ceased; in which case they will require another visa to re-enter mainland Australia.|$|E
25|$|In the {{isolation}} he felt after the Börne debacle, Marx's friendship {{came as a}} relief to Heine, since he did not really like the other radicals. On the other hand, he did not share Marx's faith in the industrial proletariat and remained {{on the fringes of}} socialist circles. The Prussian government, angry at the publication of Vorwärts, put pressure on France to deal with its authors and in January 1845 Marx was deported to Belgium. Heine could not be expelled from the country because he had the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> in France, having been born under French occupation. Thereafter Heine and Marx maintained a sporadic correspondence, but in time their admiration for one another faded. Heine always had mixed feelings about communism. He believed its radicalism and materialism would destroy much of the European culture that he loved and admired.|$|E

40|$|While {{much has}} been written about {{children}} who arrive in Australia seeking asylum and children in immigration detention, little attention has been given to the question of how Australia's migration and citizenship laws affect children in general. This chapter is a modest attempt to begin a discussion directed at filling the silence in the discourse. Australia's immigration and citizenship laws operate together as a legal mechanism to determine which persons are accepted into the Australian community. Formally, the laws confer legal statuses which correspond to a hierarchy <b>of</b> legal <b>rights</b> and benefits such as <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> access to government services in the form of social welfare, education and health, and even the right to vote. Informally, the bestowal <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and citizenship is a reflection of who we want to include within the Australian polity...|$|R

500|$|The Falkland Islands are a {{homogeneous}} society, {{with the majority}} of inhabitants descended from Scottish and Welsh immigrants who settled the territory in 1833. The 2006 census listed some Falklands residents as descendants of French, Gibraltarians and Scandinavians. That census indicated that one-third of residents were born on the archipelago, with foreign-born residents assimilated into local culture. The legal term for the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> is [...] "belonging to the islands". The British Nationality Act of 1983 gave British citizenship to Falkland Islanders.|$|E
500|$|Restoration {{work was}} {{undertaken}} in 1903 by the Duke of Argyll, the castle's owner.

Works were delayed by World War I, and the planned total restoration was never completed. In 1958, the 21st Captain and the Duke agreed to hand the castle into state care, and it remains a Historic Scotland property. Both the castle and chapel are Scheduled Ancient Monuments.|$|E

The court found that it did have discretion to hear the case: while the Crown was divisible, the actions of the BIOT were clearly the actions of the British government, since every BIOT action was ordered and dealt with by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. Laws J found that the Magna Carta did apply to foreign nations, as it was [...] "the nearest approach to an irreplaceable 'fundamental statute' that England has ever had... For in brief it means this, that the King is and shall be below the law". This did not alone validate Bancoult's case, since it did not mean that the government's actions were illegal.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} link between the <b>residence</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> Union {{citizens}} and their family members and the Court of Justice of the European Union’s development of the concept of Union citizenship. The Court has not approached this development in a predictable or linear fashion, and the cementing of Union citizenship as a status capable <b>of</b> leading to <b>residence</b> <b>rights</b> in the form of Directive 2004 / 38 made the continuation of a flexible and expansive approach more difficult. This thesis examines the UK’s implementation of both the Citizens’ Directive and other EU sources <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and compares the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> UK citizens with links to EU law to those without any possibility of relying on EU provisions within the UK. It is contended that Union citizenship has had a greater impact upon <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> for Union citizens and their family members than would have been anticipated from either the Treaty provisions or Directive 2004 / 38. The importance <b>of</b> EU <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> is particularly high in the UK, given the stringent requirements of the Immigration Rules concerning non-EU immigration. Treaty rights can circumvent restrictive UK provisions, and the approach of the UK judiciary in applying EU concepts in cases concerning the UK Immigration Rules is important in this respect. The fundamental <b>rights</b> implications <b>of</b> the Lisbon Treaty are assessed, and it is argued that the Court's continuing activism in relation to family rights is only in respect <b>of</b> Treaty <b>rights,</b> and that this has not been applied to the new Charter <b>of</b> Fundamental <b>Rights.</b> As such, the Court has failed to link Union citizenship and the Charter, which could have made for a more coherent sense of citizenship within the EU, but instead separates the application <b>of</b> fundamental <b>rights</b> from the unique concept of Union citizenship...|$|R
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the [...] "Gibraltarians" [...] {{were given}} an {{official}} identity for the first time. It was only in the 1830s that Gibraltar-born residents began to outnumber foreign-born, but by 1891 nearly 75% of the population of 19,011 people were Gibraltar-born. The emergence of the Gibraltarians as a distinct group owed much to the pressure on housing in the territory and the need to control the numbers of the civilian population, as Gibraltar was still first and foremost a military fortress. Two Orders in Council of 1873 and 1885 stipulated that no child of alien parent could be born in Gibraltar, no foreigners could claim a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and that only Gibraltar-born inhabitants were entitled to reside there; everyone else needed permits, unless they were employees of the British Crown. In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions. There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.|$|E

2500|$|Ottoman {{power was}} also used by the French in the {{religious}} conflicts on the European scene. In 1566, under Charles IX, the French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire intervened in favour of the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Empire, after a request for Ottoman help by William I of Orange, so that a Dutch-Ottoman alliance was considered and a letter was sent from Suleiman the Magnificent to the [...] "Lutherans" [...] in Flanders, offering troops {{at the time they}} would request, and claiming that he felt close to them, [...] "since they did not worship idols, believed in one God and fought against the Pope and Emperor". The Ottoman Empire was indeed known at that time for its religious tolerance.

Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. They have served Britain for almost 200 years with over 50,000 dying in service, and 13 have been awarded the Victoria Cross. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all party group including Gurkhas starting from Parliament Square to 10 Downing Street with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the Gurkha Justice Campaign.
