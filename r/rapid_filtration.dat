5000|$|The name {{solid support}} implies that {{reactions}} {{are carried out}} {{on the surface of}} the support, but this is not the case. Reactions also occur within these particles, and thus the term [...] "solid support" [...] better describes the insolubility of the polymer. The physical properties of the solid support, and the applications to which it can be utilized, vary with the material from which the support is constructed, the amount of cross-linking, as well as the linker and handle being used. Most scientists in the field believe that supports should have the minimum amount of cross-linking to confer stability. This should result in a well-solvated system where solid-phase peptide synthesis can be carried out. Nonetheless, the characteristics of an efficient solid support include: it must be physically stable and permit the <b>rapid</b> <b>filtration</b> of liquids, such as excess reagents; it must be inert to all reagents and solvents used during SPPS; it must swell extensively in the solvents used to allow for penetration of the reagents; and it must allow for the attachment of the first amino acid.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} for treatment—crushed and roasted ore, or tailings, {{as the case}} may be—are put into the hopper above the revolving barrel, or chlorinator. This latter is made of iron, lined with wood and lead, and sufficiently strong to bear a pressure of 100 lb. to the square inch, its capacity being about 30 cwt. of ore. The charge falls from the hopper into the chlorinator. Water and chlorine-producing chemicals are added—generally sulphuric acid and chloride of lime—the manhole cover is replaced and screwed down so as to be gas tight. On {{the opposite side of the}} barrel there is a valve connected with an air pump, through which air to about the pressure of four atmospheres is pumped in, to liquefy the chlorine gas that is generated, after which the valve is screwed down. The barrel is then set revolving at about ten revolutions a minute, the power being transmitted by a friction wheel. According to the nature of the ore, or the size of the grains of gold, this movement is continued from one to four hours, during which time the gold, from combination with the chlorine gas, has formed a soluble gold chloride, which has all been taken up by the water in the barrel. The chlorinator is then stopped, and the gas and compressed air allowed to escape from the valve through a rubber hose into a vat of lime water. This is to prevent the inhalation of any chlorine gas by the workmen. The manhole cover is now removed and the barrel again set revolving, by which means the contents are thrown automatically into the filter below. This filter is an iron vat lined with lead. It has a false bottom, to which is connected a pipe from a vacuum pump working intermittently. As soon as all the ore has fallen from the chlorinator into the filter, the pump is set going, a partial vacuum is produced in the chamber below the false bottom in the filter, and very <b>rapid</b> <b>filtration</b> results. By this means all the gold chlorides contained in the wet ore may be washed out, a continual stream being passed through it while filtration is going on. The solution running from the filter is continually tested, and when found free from gold, the stream of water is stopped, as is also the vacuum pump. The filter is then tipped up into a truck below, and the tailings run out to the waste heap. The process of washing and filtration occupies about an hour, during which time another charge may be in process of treatment in the chlorinator above. The discharge from the filter and the washings are run into a vat, and from this they are allowed to pass slowly through a tap into a charcoal filter. During the passage of the liquid through the charcoal filter, the chloride of gold is decomposed and the gold is deposited on the charcoal, which, when fully charged, is burnt, the ashes are fused with borax in a crucible, and the gold is obtained.|$|E

40|$|Total {{suspended}} solids (TSS) are all particles in water {{that will not}} pass through a glass fiber filter with a pore size less than 2 μm, including sediments, algae, nutrients, and metals. TSS is an important water quality parameter because of its adverse effects on aquatic species and wildlife. The EPA has proposed a regulation for turbidity, a related water quality parameter, which has been stayed pending further testing. TSS is regulated through the EPA via the NPDES in many states. Since there are no accepted field tests for TSS, projects with TSS regulations must send samples to a laboratory for analysis, which can delay projects for days. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a rapid, cost-effective, and consistent method for direct measurement of TSS in the field.

The raw water is surface water from lake Bolmen which is transported through an 80 km long tunnel in the bedrock before it enters the waterworks. The method used for purification is a combination of coagulation-flocculation and filtration in sand filters. Two different purification lines are currently in use, one using Al 2 (SO 4) 3 as a coagulant and one using FeCl 3. After coagulation and flocculation the precipitate is removed and the water is passed through two different sand filters (<b>rapid</b> <b>filtration</b> and slow filtration).

40|$|The {{main goal}} of a {{drinking}} water treatment plant is to provide safe drinking water for its consumers. Historically, this was accomplished through monitoring the influent and effluent water quality {{to ensure that the}} water quality met a set of guidelines and regulations. However, as the limitations of relying on compliance monitoring become more evident, water utilities and drinking water treatment plants are beginning to utilize risk management frameworks to help provide safe drinking water and to mitigate potential risks. Applying a risk management framework requires an evaluation of potential risks. This systematic evaluation can be performed through using risk analysis methods. The overall goal of this research is to analyze and evaluate risk analysis methodologies that are used in a variety of engineering fields, select two risk analysis methods, and use them to evaluate the probability of producing non-compliant drinking water from a <b>rapid</b> gravity <b>filtration</b> unit with respect to turbidity. The risk analysis methodologies that were used in this research were the consequence frequency assessment and computer modelling combined with probabilistic risk analysis. Both of the risk analysis methodologies were able to determine the probability of producing non-compliant water from a <b>rapid</b> gravity <b>filtration</b> unit with respect to turbidity. However, these methodologies were found to provide different numerical results with respect to each other. The consequence frequency assessment methodology was found to be easier to implement; however, the consequence frequency assessment was only able to be performed on one parameter at a time. Computer modelling and probabilistic risk analysis enabled the inclusion of multiple parameters which provided a more comprehensive understanding of the filtration unit. The primary conclusion from this research is that the risk analysis methods, as they are described in this thesis, are not sufficient to use directly on a <b>rapid</b> gravity <b>filtration</b> unit without further modification. Furthermore, although the risk analysis methods provided some guidance, these methods should only be used {{as a part of a}} complete risk management process...|$|R

The organic carbon flow (adsorption + biodegradation) was calculated from the biomass detected in iron sludge. The influence of the filtration process on BOM was investigated by AOC and BDOC determinations. The results showed that the decrease of the organic carbon content by TFI and WFsep was caused by adsorption onto iron flocks and biodegradation. The bioprocesses in TFI and WFsep were responsible for BDOC reduction. Predominant production of AOC by TFI and predominant AOC reduction by WFsep suggested that the AOC was effected by chemical reactions depending on the oxygen concentration in the filter layer and the contact time in the filter column. Thus, for groundwater treatment by <b>rapid</b> sand <b>filtration</b> wet type filtration should always be preferred.
