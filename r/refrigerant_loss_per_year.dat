40|$|This paper {{discusses}} different {{measures for}} quantifying regional hurricane loss. The main measures {{used in the}} past are normalized percentage loss and dollar value loss. In this research, we show that these measures are useful but may not properly reflect the size of the population influenced by hurricanes. A new loss measure is proposed that reflects the hurricane impact on people occupying the structure. For demonstrating the differences among these metrics, regional loss analysis was conducted for Florida. The regional analysis was composed of three modules: the hazard module stochastically modeled the wind occurrence in the region; the vulnerability module utilized vulnerability functions developed in this research to calculate the loss; and the financial module quantified the hurricane loss. In the financial module, we calculated three loss metrics for certain region. The first metric is the average annual loss (AAL) which represents the expected <b>loss</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> in percentage. The second is the average annual dollar loss which represents the expected dollar amount <b>loss</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> The third is the average annual population-weighted loss (AAPL) —a new measure proposed in this research. Compared with the AAL, the AAPL reflects the number of people influenced by the hurricane. The advantages of the AAPL are illustrated using three different analysis examples: (1) conventional regional loss analysis, (2) mitigation potential analysis, and (3) forecasted future loss analysis due to the change in population...|$|R

Pretherapeutic assessment of kidney absorbed dose could help {{to minimize the risk}} of renal toxicity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the contribution of patient-specific adjustments to the standard dosimetric models, such as the renal volume and dose rate, for estimating renal absorbed dose during therapy with (90) Y-DOTATOC. In particular, we investigated the correlation between dose estimates and effect on renal function after therapy. METHODS: Eighteen patients with neuroendocrine tumors (9 men and 9 women; median age, 59 y) underwent treatment with (90) Y-DOTATOC (8. 1 - 22. 9 GBq) after pretherapeutic biodistribution study with (86) Y-DOTATOC. Kidney uptake and residence times were measured and the absorbed dose (KAD) was computed using either the MIRDOSE 3. 1 software assuming a standard kidney volume (KAD(StdVol)) or the MIRD Pamphlet 19 values and the actual kidney cortex volume determined by pretherapeutic CT (KAD(CTVol)). For each patient, the biologic effective dose (BED) was calculated according to the linear quadratic model to take into account the effect of dose rate and fractionation. Renal function was evaluated every 6 mo by serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLR) during a median follow-up of 35. 5 mo (range, 18 - 65 mo). The individual rate of decline of renal function was expressed as CLR <b>loss</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> RESULTS: KAD(CTVol) ranged between 19. 4 and 39. 6 Gy (mean, 28. 9 +/- 5. 34 Gy). BED, obtained from KAD(CTVol), ranged between 27. 7 and 59. 3 Gy (mean, 40. 4 +/- 10. 6 Gy). The CLR <b>loss</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> ranged from 0 % to 56. 4 %. In 12 of 18 patients, CLR <b>loss</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> was 20 % received a BED > 45 Gy. Patients who were treated with low fractionation were those with the highest rate of renal function impairment. Conclusion: Radiation nephrotoxicity after (90) Y-DOTATOC therapy is dose dependent.
