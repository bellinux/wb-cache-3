It was formerly regarded as conspecific with the grey-throated martin (R. chinensis) under the name [...] "plain martin".|$|E

50|$|It {{prefers to}} prey on birds found in open areas {{and some of}} the species it has been {{recorded}} to hunt are Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), white-browed wagtail (Motacilla madaraspatensis), rosy starling (Sturnus roseus), chestnut-tailed starling (Sturnus malabaricus), Indian cuckoo (Cuculus micropterus), Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus), little ringed plover (Charadrius dubius), ashy-crowned finch-lark (Eremoptrix griseus), besides robins, quails, babblers, swifts, bulbuls, pipits, larks (mainly Calandrella, Alauda, Galerida sp.), pied cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus), rock pigeon (Columba livia), collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto), laughing dove (Streptopelia senegelensis), brown crake (Lanius cristatus), tailor bird (Orthotomus sutorius), brown shrike (Lanius cristatus), white-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis), little stint (Calidris minuta), plain martin (<b>Riparia</b> <b>paludicola)</b> and pied bushchat (Saxicola caprata). In addition mice, lizards, large insects are also taken. In one study in Bangladesh, adults fed mainly on small sparrow sized birds (72%) and Pipistrellus bats (28%). They may sometimes pirate prey obtained by other medium-sized raptors. Prey may sometimes be cached and eaten subsequently.The red-necked falcon drinks water where available during the afternoons. This has been observed both in India and in Africa, where it sometimes visits waterholes.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{data on the}} {{distribution}} of birds in the Cape Verde Islands are presented, including records of six species new to the archipelago, viz. Pintail Anas acuta, Least Sandpiper Calidris minutilla, Snipe Gallinago gallinago, Red-rumped Swallow Hirundo daurica, African Sand Martin <b>Riparia</b> <b>paludicola,</b> and Song Thrush Turdus philomelos. Also included are data on extentions in range and time within the islands of migrant visitors as well as observations of rare and threatened resident species. Extralimital records of migrant Cape Verde seabirds are summarized and news and views relating to the conservation of threatened endemic taxa are discussed. In addition, some recent studies bearing on the systematics of endemic Procellarids are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Observations of 15 species, {{made during}} {{a survey of}} {{wetlands}} on Iran's Arabian Gulf coast, in January-February 2000, are presented. These included two potential first records in Iran, Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris and Brown-throated Sand Martin <b>Riparia</b> <b>paludicola,</b> an apparently important wintering area for Dead Sea Sparrow Passer moabiticus, records of several vagrants and scarce winter visitors, and a potentially significant range extension for the near endemic Iraq Babbler Turdoides altirostris. In addition, the area surveyed appears to be of considerable significance to wintering waterbirds, particularly waders. More than 53, 000 waterbirds of 82 species were counted during the survey, including globally threatened species such as Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus, Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris, Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca, and White-tailed Haliaeetus albicilla, Greater Spotted Aquila clanga and Imperial Eagles A. heliac...|$|E
