50|$|<b>Rimcazole</b> is an {{antagonist}} of the sigma receptor {{as well as}} a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Sigma receptors {{are thought}} {{to be involved in the}} drug psychosis that can be induced by some drugs such as phencyclidine and cocaine, and <b>rimcazole</b> was originally researched as a potential antipsychotic with a different mechanism of action to traditional antipsychotic drugs. Trials proved inconclusive and <b>rimcazole</b> was not pursued for this application, but other sigma antagonists continue to be researched for a variety of potential applications. <b>Rimcazole</b> has been shown to reduce the effects of cocaine, and analogues of <b>rimcazole</b> have been shown to be highly effective at blocking the convulsions caused by cocaine overdose in animal models.|$|E

5000|$|Noscapine's {{antitussive}} effects {{appear to}} be primarily mediated by its σ-receptor agonist activity. Evidence for this mechanism is suggested by experimental evidence in rats. Pretreatment with <b>rimcazole,</b> a σ-specific antagonist, causes a dose-dependent reduction in antitussive activity of noscapine.

50|$|The {{function}} of these receptors is poorly understood though an exogenous ligand, dimethyltryptamine, {{was found to}} interact with σ1. Activation of σ-receptors by an agonist ligand may induce hallucinogenic effects and also {{may be responsible for}} the paradoxical convulsions sometimes seen in opiate overdose. Drugs known to be σ-agonists include cocaine, morphine/diacetylmorphine, opipramol, PCP, fluvoxamine, methamphetamine, dextromethorphan, and the herbal antidepressant berberine. However the exact role of σ-receptors is difficult to establish as many σ-agonists also bind to other targets such as the κ-opioid receptor and the NMDA glutamate receptor. In animal experiments, σ-antagonists such as <b>rimcazole</b> were able to block convulsions from cocaine overdose. σ-antagonists are also under investigation for use as antipsychotic medications.|$|E
40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the functional coupling of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor with the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel, we investigated the effects of various σ ligands on the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor in Xenopus oocytes co-injected with the cloned nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor and GIRK 1 mRNAs. Carbetapentane and <b>rimcazole,</b> which induced no current response at 100 [*]μM, reversibly suppressed the inward K+ current responses induced by nociceptin in a concentration-dependent manner, and the IC 50 values (μM) for these compounds were 9. 0 and 12. 6, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sigma () -receptor {{agonists}} attenuate {{brain injury}} after experimental focal cerebral ischemia in several species. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} the potent, prototypical 1 -receptor agonist, 4 -phenyl- 1 -(4 -phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP), protects neurons by a mechanism involving the antiapoptotic protein bcl- 2. METHODS: Primary cortical neuronal cultures were exposed to either 2 h of oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) or glutamate (100 M). PPBP treatment was initiated either 15 min prior to the insult or at 15 min postinsult then continued for 24 h. In another set of experiments, cultured neurons were preincubated for 2 h prior to PPBP treatment with 1 -receptor antagonist, <b>rimcazole,</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Alive and dead cells were detected with calcein-AM and propidium iodide respectively. Bcl- 2 and bax expression were determined by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, and DNA damage was detected by TUNEL staining. RESULTS: PPBP pretreatment attenuated neuronal injury induced by OGD or gluta-mate (50 or 100 M). This protection was reversed with <b>rimcazole</b> (cell death: OG...|$|E
40|$|Both {{dopamine}} uptake inhibitors and σ 1 receptor antagonists {{have been}} implicated as potential pharmacotherapeutics {{for the treatment}} of cocaine abuse. While the dopamine uptake inhibitors may share with cocaine neurochemical mechanisms underlying reinforcing properties, σ 1 antagonists have been shown to attenuate some behavioral actions and toxic side effects associated with cocaine overdose. <b>Rimcazole,</b> a σ 1 receptor antagonist that binds to the DAT (Ki) 224 nM), is not behaviorally cocaine-like and attenuates some of the behavioral actions of cocaine. To determine the roles of both DAT and σ 1 receptors in the behavioral actions of <b>rimcazole,</b> a series of analogues was synthesized. Initial studies identified two analogues (1 and 4) that showed high to moderate affinities for both DAT and σ 1 receptors and failed to show cocaine-like discriminative stimulus (DS) effects. A second series of bis(4 ′-fluorophenyl) amine analogues have now been prepared in which the most potent DAT compound, 19 (Ki) 8. 5 nM), was selective over serotonin transporter (SERT/DAT) 94), norepinephrine transporter (NET/DAT) 63), and σ 1 receptor binding (σ 1 /DAT) 44). In addition, two other analogues 10 and 17 showed superior selectivity for DAT over SERT (170 - and 140 -fold, respectively) and DAT over NET (219 - and 190 -fold, respectively) but were essentially equipotent at DAT an...|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{cells can}} be {{selectively}} killed by application of sigma-ligands; high concentrations (20 - 100 mu M) are often required, however, because either diffusion barriers must be passed to reach intracellular sites or the entire sigma-receptor population should be occupied to induce cell death. We measured receptor occupancies {{associated with the}} cytotoxic effect and dose-dependent changes of cellular metabolism in a tumor cell line. Methods: C 6 cells (rat glioma) were grown in monolayers and exposed to (+) -pentazocine (sigma- 1 agonist), AC 915 (sigma- 1 antagonist), <b>rimcazole</b> (sigma- 1 /sigma- 2 antagonist), or haloperidol (sigma- 1 /sigma- 2 antagonist). Occupancy of sigma-receptors by the test drugs was measured by studying the competition of the test drugs with cellular binding of the ligand (11) C-SA 4503. Metabolic changes were quantified by measuring cellular uptake of (18) F-FDG, (18) F-FLT, (11) C-choline, or (11) C-methionine. Cytotoxicity was assessed by cellular morphology observation and cell counting after 24 h. Results: IC(50) values (drug concentrations resulting in 50 % occupancy of the available binding sites) of the test drugs for inhibition of cellular (11) C-SA 4503 binding were 6. 5, 7. 4, 0. 36, and 0. 27 mu M for (+) -pentazocine, AC 915, <b>rimcazole,</b> and haloperidol, respectively. EC(50) values (dose required for a 50 % reduction of cell number after 24 h) were 710, 819. 31, and 58 mu M, for pentazocine, AC 915, <b>rimcazole,</b> and haloperidol, respectively. Cytotoxic doses of sigma-ligands were generally associated with increased uptake of (18) F-FDG, decreased uptake of (18) F-FLT and (11) C-choline, and little change in (11) C-methionine uptake per viable cell. Conclusion: IC(50) values of the test drugs reflect their in vitro affinities to sigma- 2 rather than to sigma- 1 receptors. Because cytotoxicity occurred at concentrations 2 orders of magnitude higher than IC(50) values for inhibition of cellular (11) C-SA 4503 binding, high (99 %) occupancy of sigma- 2 receptors is associated with loss of cell viability. (18) F-FLT, (11) C-choline, and (18) F-FDG responded most strongly to drug treatment and showed changes corresponding to the cytotoxicity of the test compounds...|$|E

40|$|Abuse of psychostimulants such as {{cocaine and}} amphet-amines has a {{tremendous}} social and economic impact. Al-though replacement therapies are offered for addiction to opi-oids, nicotine, and alcohol, there is no approved replacement treatment for psychostimulant addiction. Recent studies on an emerging group of benztropine- and rimcazole-based com-pounds provide hope that replacement therapies for cocaine and amphetamine addiction may come in the near future. A new study (p. 813) now investigates the molecular interaction of the benztropine and <b>rimcazole</b> compounds with their target, the dopamine transporter, and provides an intriguing explanation as to why use of these compounds, unlike cocaine, do not lead to locomotor stimulation and drug discrimination behaviors in animal models...|$|E
40|$|Cocaine exerts its {{stimulatory effect}} by {{inhibiting}} the dopamine transporter (DAT). However, novel benztropine- and rimcazole-based inhibitors show reduced stimulant effects compared with cocaine, despite higher affinity and selectivity for DAT. To in-vestigate possible mechanisms, {{we compared the}} subjective effects of different inhibitors with their molecular mode of in-teraction at the DAT. We determined how different inhibitors affected accessibility of the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent [2 -(tri-methylammonium) ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate to an inserted cysteine (I 159 C), which is accessible when the extracellular transporter gate is open but inaccessible when it is closed. The data indicated that cocaine analogs bind an open conforma-tion, whereas benztropine and <b>rimcazole</b> analogs bind a closed conformation. Next, we investigated the changes in inhibitio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Advanced {{melanoma}} {{is characterized}} by a pronounced resistance to therapy leading to a limited patient survival of ~ 6 - 9 months. Here, we report on a novel bifunctional therapeutic fusion protein, designated anti-MCSP:TRAIL, that is comprised of a melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) -specific antibody fragment (scFv) fused to soluble human TRAIL. MCSP is a well-established target for melanoma immunotherapy and has recently been shown to provide important tumorigenic signals to melanoma cells. TRAIL is a highly promising tumoricidal cytokine with no or minimal toxicity towards normal cells. Anti-MCSP:TRAIL was designed to 1. selectively accrete at the cell surface of MCSP-positive melanoma cells and inhibit MCSP tumorigenic signaling and 2. activate apoptotic TRAIL-signaling. Results Treatment of a panel of MCSP-positive melanoma cell lines with anti-MCSP:TRAIL induced TRAIL-mediated apoptotic cell death within 16 h. Of note, treatment with anti-MCSP:sTRAIL was also characterized by a rapid dephosphorylation of key proteins, such as FAK, implicated in MCSP-mediated malignant behavior. Importantly, anti-MCSP:TRAIL treatment already inhibited anchorage-independent growth by 50 % at low picomolar concentrations, whereas > 100 fold higher concentrations of non-targeted TRAIL failed to reduce colony formation. Daily i. v. treatment with a low dose of anti-MCSP:TRAIL (0. 14 mg/kg) resulted in a significant growth retardation of established A 375 M xenografts. Anti-MCSP:TRAIL activity was further synergized by co-treatment with <b>rimcazole,</b> a σ-ligand currently in clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers. Conclusions Anti-MCSP:TRAIL has promising pre-clinical anti-melanoma activity that appears to result from combined inhibition of tumorigenic MCSP-signaling and concordant activation of TRAIL-apoptotic signaling.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, to {{evaluate}} the role that sigma receptors play in the physiology of the pineal gland, we assessed {{the effects of the}} sigma receptor ligand (+) -N-allylnormetazocine on the gland activity during either the day or the night. As compared to saline, (+) -N-allylnormetazocine enhanced the physiological increases in both pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin content at night, but it did not affect the biosynthetic activity of the gland during the day. Moreover, (+) -N-allylnormetazocine potentiated the enhancement of NAT activity and pineal melatonin content induced by isoproterenol administration during the day. The nocturnal stimulation of pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels by (+) -N-allylnormetazocine was prevented by pretreatment with <b>rimcazole,</b> a specific sigma receptor antagonist.

40|$|Because sigma receptors are richly {{concentrated}} in the rat pineal gland, {{the present study was}} performed to investigate their possible role in the modulation of melatonin production. To this purpose, we assessed in vivo the effects of the sigma-receptor ligands 1, 3 -di(2 -tolyl) guanidine and (+) -N-allylnormetazocine on the rat pineal gland activity during either the daytime or the nighttime. Compared with vehicle, 1, 3 -di (2 -tolyl) guanidine and (+) -N-allylnormetazocine potentiated the enhancement of N-acetyltransferase activity and pineal melatonin content induced by isoproterenol administration during the daytime, whereas they did not affect the diurnal basal biosynthetic activity of the gland. Conversely, at night, 1, 3 -di(2 -tolyl) guanidine and (+) -N-allylnormetazocine enhanced significantly the physiological increases in both pineal N-acetyltransferase activity and melatonin levels.

These findings suggest that, in rats, the activation of pineal sigma-receptor sites does not affect the biosynthetic activity of the pineal gland during daytime, whereas it pontentiates the production of melatonin when the gland is noradrenergically stimulated either by isoproterenol administration or by the endogenously released norepinephrine at nighttime...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of present knowledge regarding the relationship between the cholinergic system and sigma- 1 receptors, and discusses potential applications of sigma- 1 receptor agonists in the treatment of memory deficits and cognitive disorders. Sigma- 1 receptors, initially considered as a subtype of the opioid family, are unique ligand-regulated molecular chaperones in the endoplasmatic reticulum playing a modulatory role in intracellular calcium signaling and in the activity of several neurotransmitter systems, particularly the cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways. Several central nervous system (CNS) drugs show high to moderate affinities for sigma- 1 receptors, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil), antipsychotics (haloperidol, <b>rimcazole),</b> selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluvoxamine, sertraline) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (clorgyline). These compounds can influence cognitive functions both via their primary targets and by activating sigma- 1 receptors in the CNS. Sigma- 1 agonists show powerful anti-amnesic and neuroprotective effects in a large variety of animal models of cognitive dysfunction involving, among others (i) pharmacologic target blockade (with muscarinic or NMDA receptor antagonists or p-chloroamphetamine); (ii) selective lesioning of cholinergic neurons; (iii) CNS administration of beta-amyloid peptides; (iv) aging-induced memory loss, both in normal and senescent-accelerated rodents; (v) neurodegeneration induced by toxic compounds (CO, trimethyltin, cocaine), and (vi) prenatal restraint stress.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} {{aggressive}} brain tumor in adults, and despite state-of-the-art treatment, survival remains poor and novel therapeutics are sorely needed. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify new synergistic drug pairs for GBM. In addition, we aimed to explore differences in drug-drug interactions across multiple GBM-derived cell cultures and predict such differences by use of transcriptional biomarkers. We performed a screen in which we quantified drug-drug interactions for 465 drug pairs in each of the 5 GBM cell lines U 87 MG, U 343 MG, U 373 MG, A 172, and T 98 G. Selected interactions were further tested using isobole-based analysis and validated in 5 glioma-initiating cell cultures. Furthermore, drug interactions were predicted using microarray-based transcriptional profiling in combination with statistical modeling. Of the 5 465 drug pairs, we could define a subset of drug pairs with strong interaction in both standard cell lines and glioma-initiating cell cultures. In particular, a subset of pairs involving the pharmaceutical compounds <b>rimcazole,</b> sertraline, pterostilbene, and gefitinib showed a strong interaction in a majority of the cell cultures tested. Statistical modeling of microarray and interaction data using sparse canonical correlation analysis revealed several predictive biomarkers, which we propose could be of importance in regulating drug pair responses.

40|$|The sigma- 1 {{receptor}} is {{a unique}} orphan receptor, strongly expressed in neurons and glia. Sigma- 1 receptors are involved in several central nervous system (CNS) disorders like depression, anxiety, psychosis, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, addiction and neuropathic pain. Several CNS drugs like haloperidol, donepezil, <b>rimcazole,</b> fluvoxamine, sertraline and clorgyline have moderate to high sigma- 1 receptor affinity. Pharmaceutical companies currently involved in R&D and clinical trials of sigma- 1 drugs include Anavex Life Sciences Corp., M’s Science Corp. and Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve S. A. The studies presented in this thesis demonstrated the usefulness of 11 C-SA 4503 and microPET to evaluate sigma- 1 receptors in the rat brain. Decreased and increased binding of the tracer to sigma- 1 receptors was estimated in normal aging brain and spontaneous pituitary tumor respectively. REM sleep deprivation was found to cause reduced sigma- 1 expression in the brain, while treatment with cutamesine (SA 4503) was shown to overcome REM sleep deprivation induced cognitive deficits. The receptor occupancy by agonist drugs, donepezil and cutamesine, at doses effective in behavioral studies of cognition could be estimated using 11 C-SA 4503. The kinetics of the drug cutamesine in plasma and brain could be modeled using classical and non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) for the cold drug and its radioactive form (11 C-SA 4503) respectively.
