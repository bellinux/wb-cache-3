5|$|On May 2, 1947, General Douglas MacArthur {{lifted the}} {{restrictions}} on displaying the Hinomaru in {{the grounds of the}} National Diet Building, on the Imperial Palace, on the Prime Minister's residence and on the Supreme Court building with the ratification of the new Constitution of Japan. Those <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> further relaxed in 1948, when people were allowed to fly the flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> abolished and anyone could fly the Hinomaru at any time without permission. As a result, schools and homes were encouraged to fly the Hinomaru until the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the statute's {{enactment}} in 1710, copying <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> {{authorized by}} the Licensing of the Press Act 1662. These <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> enforced by the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers given the exclusive power to print—and the responsibility to censor—literary works. The censorship administered under the Licensing Act led to public protest; as the act had to be renewed at two-year intervals, authors and others sought to prevent its reauthorisation. In 1694, Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act, ending the Stationers' monopoly and press restrictions.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{pioneering}} efforts by Olav Selvaag and others, archaic and otherwise unnecessary <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences. Norwegians often undertake home improvement projects on their own, and many have built most of their own homes.|$|E

5|$|Burger's Daughter is a {{political}} and historical novel by the South African Nobel Prize in Literature-winner Nadine Gordimer, first published in the United Kingdom in June 1979 by Jonathan Cape. The book {{was expected to be}} banned in South Africa, and a month after publication in London the import and sale of the book in South Africa was prohibited by the Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the banning and the <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> lifted.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{rationing}} {{was imposed}} almost immediately. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>were</b> immediately more stringent {{than in the}} Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration. By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence. Posters encouraged kitchen waste {{to be used for}} feeding animals, primarily swine but also poultry.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> {{taken from}} FRC {{for the purpose}} of {{balancing}} the power of colorbound bishops. The second <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> based upon the first restriction but extrapolated to the piece set used by CRC. The third <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> taken from FRC to preserve castling ability. The fourth restriction helps to minimize the advantage held by White in having the first move. The fifth <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> to avoid possible legal issues in America with Gothic Chess, which was formerly protected by a US patent. The sixth <b>restriction</b> <b>was</b> introduced later upon discovery by Scharnagl that such positions might increase the advantage of first move for White.|$|R

5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E

The tree faces several threats, including soil compaction from foot and vehicle traffic due to tourism and special events in the park, drought, and the interruption of irrigation due to courthouse renovation. New <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> imposed in 2000 after the health of the tree began to decline. common myna birds (Acridotheres tristis) roost in the branches of the tree at sunset, causing a cacophony of bird cries as the evening approaches.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{had been}} ineligible {{to serve in}} Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn {{allegiance}} to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> removed {{at the suggestion of}} the Freedmen's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate.|$|E
30|$|Non-finite {{complements}} {{are reduced}} clauses that lack an overt subject; the embedded verbs are not inflected for TAM. In the literature (Tang 1999), an AV-only <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> often {{treated as a}} non-finite <b>restriction</b> that <b>is</b> imposed on the complement clause. However, this study revealed that some reduced complement clauses, which were not characterized by an AV-only <b>restriction,</b> <b>were</b> still non-finite, with the embedded verbs unable to take any TAM markers. In this sense, an AV-only <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> not the only indication of non-finiteness in Mayrinax Atayal.|$|R

50|$|Waller, Kennerley and Ohanian (2007) {{argued that}} both bingeing-vomiting and <b>restriction</b> <b>are</b> emotion {{suppression}} strategies, {{but they are}} just utilized at different times. For example, <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> used to pre-empt any emotion activation, while bingeing-vomiting is used after an emotion has been activated.|$|R

The coughing symptoms {{have been attributed to}} acceleration atelectasis ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, Medvedev ordered Russia's government agency devoted to consumer protection, Rospotrebnadzor, to ban all sales of non-food items {{with more than}} 25 percent alcohol. Their order came into effect on 26 December and was scheduled to run for one month before being extended for a further 60 days in January; the restrictions did not cover perfumes and glass-cleaning products. Further <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> possibly considered, with one top health official announcing that a state monopoly may be imposed on Russia's perfume and pharmaceutical industries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Restrictions</b> <b>were</b> {{imposed on}} the {{advertisement}} of tobacco products, enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or {{as an expression of}} masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new measures}} of restrictions on inward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) for OECD countries. Several different types of <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> considered: limitations on foreign ownership, screening or notification procedures, and management and operational <b>restrictions.</b> These <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> computed for nine sectors and eleven sub-sectors, {{most of which are}} in services, and then aggregated into a single measure for the economy as a whole. According to the aggregate indicators, the last two decades, and especially the 1990 s, have witnessed dramatic liberalisation in FDI <b>restrictions.</b> OECD countries <b>are</b> now generally open to inward FDI, although there remain substantial differences between countries and across industries. The most open countries are now in Europe, {{at least as far as}} statutory <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> concerned.

5|$|Sergio de Castro, a Chilean Chicago School graduate, {{became the}} nation's Minister of Finance in 1975. During his six-year tenure, foreign {{investment}} increased, <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> placed on striking and labor unions, and GDP rose yearly. A foreign exchange program was created between the Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chicago. Many other Chicago School alumni were appointed government posts {{during and after}} the Pinochet years; others taught its economic doctrine at Chilean universities. They became known as the Chicago Boys.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival {{supersonic transport}} programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested that}} opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E

Regulation of pipeline water crossings has been directed through the application of allowable construction methods, timing constraints and numerical turbidity restrictions on construction permits. Past applications of turbidity <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> criticized for the following reasons: duration of exposure or sediment deposition effects are not considered; some applied <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> for the protection of primary productivity in lakes; and, defined mixing zones do not appear to incorporate expected levels of sediment generation, or sediment transport principles.

5|$|The dispute {{initially}} {{took the}} form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar. Further <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> imposed in 1964, and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles. In 1969, after the passing of the Gibraltar Constitution Order, to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.|$|E
5|$|The {{work and}} life of Joyce is celebrated {{annually}} on 16 June, known as Bloomsday, in Dublin {{and in an}} increasing number of cities worldwide, and critical studies in scholarly publications, such as the James Joyce Quarterly, continue. Both popular and academic uses of Joyce's work were hampered by restrictions placed by Stephen J. Joyce, Joyce's grandson and executor of his literary estate. On 1 January 2012, those <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> lessened by the expiry of copyright protection for much of the published work of James Joyce.|$|E
