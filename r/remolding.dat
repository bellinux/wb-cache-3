These cells include epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal cells. They are called non-professional phagocytes, to emphasize that, in contrast to professional phagocytes, phagocytosis is not their principal function.

That sale, valued at $7.4 million (...) , added 40 locations to Heartland's portfolio. The deal, part of Burger Kings sell off of corporate owned stores, included a stipulation that the Heartland update 275 of its locations to current appearance standards. The <b>remolding</b> provision helped generate a 15% sales increase in those locations for Heartland. As of January 2013, Heartland is the second largest franchises of Burger King in North America. The Downers Grove, Illinois-based company owns and operates over 425 restaurants in The United States and Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Minifig {{customisation}} is {{the practice}} of modifying Lego minifigures. This {{can be as simple}} as mixing and matching parts, or as complex as <b>remolding</b> plastic. Some custom minifigures are made by affixing stickers or decals to the figures. There are also businesses which sell custom decals and molded minifigure accessories, many of which are inspired from popular media such as films and video games. While a relatively recent phenomenon, minifigure customisation has rapidly become popular within the wider building community, although some maintain a [...] "purist" [...] approach, using only elements produced by Lego.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{influences of}} normal stress, shear displacement rate, consolidation and shear stress histories on residual strength of undisturbed and artificially cemented clays having cementation. A series of reversal box shear tests {{was carried out}} on undisturbed and <b>remolded</b> samples of 3 landslide clays, <b>remolded</b> sample of kaolin, <b>remolded</b> and intact samples of kaolin mixed with ordinary Portland cement. As a result, the residual strength of the samples with cementation is as same as those without cementation. The residual strengths of the undisturbed and the cemented samples, {{as well as the}} <b>remolded</b> sample, linearly increase with increasing the shear displacement rate. The residual strengths of the undisturbed and the cemented samples are not affected by consolidation stress history...|$|R

50|$|The LPDR {{established}} {{four different}} types of detention centers: prisons, reeducation centers or seminar camps, rehabilitation camps, and <b>remolding</b> centers. Social deviants or common criminals were considered less threatening to the regime than persons accused of political crimes, who were considered potential counterrevolutionaries; social deviants were confined in rehabilitation camps. According to MacAlister Brown and Joseph J. Zasloff, prisons were primarily reserved for common criminals, but political prisoners were also held there for usually six to twelve months. Ideologically suspect persons were sent to <b>remolding</b> centers. Reeducation centers were for those deemed politically risky, usually former RLG officials. Political prisoners usually served three- to five-year terms or longer. At the prisons, inmates worked hard under rugged conditions and had limited supplies of food. Bribery {{in order to secure}} food and medicine was reported.|$|E
