The combination of intense radiation fluxes and high temperatures in nuclear reactors creates an extraordinary environment. Therefore, {{a number of}} material challenges arise at {{a nuclear power plant}} that needs to be solved {{in order to maintain the}} nuclear power production, safety and reliability. Dissimilar metal welds can be found at a lot of places in nuclear power plants and due to reparations or replacement some dissimilar metal welds need to be welded on site. The technical regulations for the Swedish nuclear power plants specifies that welding of dissimilar joints shall be made with gap of at least 1. 5 mm and in horizontal position. Welding a dissimilar joint on site makes it difficult to follow the technical regulations, therefore, the aim with this study is to determine if different welding positions of dissimilar metal welds affect the structure and composition of the weld metal in a negative way and to investigate the importance of a gap in the root. In this study six samples were welded in three different welding positions, horizontal, vertical and reversed vertical with or without a gap of 1. 5 mm in the root. The samples were evaluated by non-destructive testing, optical microscopy, chemical analysis, tensile testing, bend testing and hardness measurements. The results shows that two of the samples welded without gap failed the transverse <b>root</b> <b>bend</b> test, the same samples did also have high hardness values in the root bead. The conclusions are that the welding position, horizontal, vertical or reversed vertical does not affect the weld negative in a noticeable way. However, the gap and a good dilution with the filler metal are important...|$|E

The equations of tooth surface with helix slope and form deviation were established by the given forming rack-cutter tool and the path for processing rack-cutter tool. And various kinds of engaged helical gear models with helix slope and form deviation were developed using finite element method software. Finally, tooth surface load distribution and tooth <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> stress were numerically calculated. The effects of the helix slope deviation, different shape, period, and amplitude of helix form deviation on tooth surface load distribution and tooth <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> stress were investigated {{and the results were}} compared to each other as specified by grades 5 and 7.

Qualification was to be performed using both 1 G (flat) and 3 G (vertical) positions for Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) processes. Required qualification procedures included two face and two <b>root</b> <b>bend</b> tests coupled with a visual inspection for cracks within the weld region greater than ⅛” long, along with two reduced section tensile tests to ensure the tensile strength exceeded 58 ksi if the sample broke within the weld region or 55. 1 ksi if the sample broke outside of the weld region. Tests were standardized by using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Cracks greater than 1 / 8 ” {{were found in the}} weld region of bend tested samples in each process except for the 3 G GTAW, disqualifying them. The failed samples were broken open at the crack and examined using optical microscopy in conjunction with polarized light as well as stereo microscopy to determine the inclusion and porosity content of the base and weld metal. The microscopic examination revealed a high degree of porosity and a lack of fusion in a 1 G GTAW root bent sample as indicated by the presence of back gouging marks found in the areas of the weld having lack of fusion. This was the result of improper back gouging procedures. Microscopic examinations of GMAW fracture surfaces showed signs of heavy oxidation and inclusion content within the weld metal as well as a lack of fusion between the weld passes. Both 3 G GTAW samples passed tensile tests with tensile strengths greater than 64 ksi, and the 3 G GTAW process was therefore qualified...|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal and {{circumferential}} welds in transportable {{pressure vessels}} {{are produced by}} submerged-arc welding using a single vee preparation and multiple weld runs. Quenched and tempered (QT) steels, which are commonly used for transportable pressure vessels, require mandatory postweld heat treatment (PWHT) regardless of the plate thickness. During their life transportable pressure vessels may have up to four PWHT cycles, and concerns have emerged about possible effects on material properties such as hardness, tensile strength, impact toughness and fracture toughness. This thesis reports on the weld procedure, microstructural evaluation and various mechanical properties (bend, yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, fatigue, impact toughness, CTOD fracture toughness and hardness) for 11 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm QT steel weldments. The 11 mm and 20 mm base plates investigated were BIS 80 PV, which is a pressure vessel grade steel. The 12 mm plate was BIS 80, which is structural grade steel but deemed a possible candidate for pressure vessels due to superior impact and fracture toughness properties over currently used QT pressure vessel steels. The parent metal, heat affected zone and weld metal regions of each weldment were examined, and then exposed to temperatures and times in the PWHT range. Although there was no apparent change in microstructure at an optical level and little change in hardness for up to four postweld heat treatments, there was a marked decrease in hardness of the parent metal for more extensive heat treatments (increasing Holloman parameter). There was also evidence of minor secondary hardening in the 11 mm and 20 mm BIS 80 PV parent plate following short heat treatment times. The weld metal (WM) and HAZ hardness typically decreased with one PWHT cycle and subsequently stabilised with further PWHT cycles. For all test plates, results are also presented for Charpy V-notch impact tests in the parent metal, HAZ and weld metal region, and CTOD fracture toughness tests in the PM region. The effect of exposure to multiple PWHT cycles on these properties is discussed. A decrease in impact energy and fracture toughness {{with an increase in}} the number of heat treatments was evident in the parent metal. In contrast, the weld metal showed a decrease in impact energy after two PWHT cycles, and then an increase towards the original impact energy after a further two cycles. In PM samples, which have been extensively tempered in the manufacturing process, the mechanism by which toughness properties are affected by cumulative PWHT holding time is through the coarsening and coalescence of second phase carbide particles. These particles decrease impact energy by the formation of larger voids in the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip or by the initiation of cleavage fracture. These two phenomena decrease the energy required for fracture. In WM with an as-solidified structure, ductile failure in the form of void coalescence is initiated by non-metallic inclusions. This leads to an initially high impact toughness, which then decreases after PWHT because of the nucleation and coarsening of metastable Fe 3 C precipitates that promote quasi-cleavage type fracture. Upon exposure to further PWHT cycles the impact energy begins to increase again due to the dissolution of the metastable carbides and the formation of finer, more stable carbides based on elements such as Cr, Mo, Ni and Nb. This change in the form of the carbide promotes localised fracture by micro-plasticity, with void formation and coalescence. Additionally, cross-weld <b>root</b> <b>bend</b> (180 °) and tensile tests were carried out before and after PWHT. None of the bend samples showed any evidence of cracking or tearing, hence confirming the ductility of the weldment. The tensile properties of the BIS 80 PV cross-weld samples complied with the Australian Standards, but the tensile properties of the BIS 80 cross-weld samples only complied in the as-welded condition. Tensile properties of the PM showed no significant trends with the number of PWHT cycles and the fatigue crack growth rate increased slightly in relation to the number of PWHT cycles or PWHT holding time. One of the primary roles of PWHT is to reduce residual stresses caused by the welding process. Residual stress measurements using the hole drilling method were made to ascertain the need for PWHT. Residual stresses, measured in the weld centre-line by the hole drilling technique, were compressive along both the longitudinal and transverse directions and were no greater than 250 MPa (between 0. 2 - 0. 5 times the yield strength at room temperature). Although, the presence of residual stresses (tensile and compressive) of greater magnitude is not excluded, the residual stress measurements demonstrated that PWHT significantly reduced the magnitude of the residual stresses. The ability to predict the impact energy of a pressure vessel steel subjected to various cumulative PWHT holding times is beneficial to pressure vessel inspectors, who are misguidedly instructed to be wary of the mechanical properties of vessels after 6 hours of cumulative PWHT holding time. The original impact energy of the steel, which is determined by its chemical composition, microstructure and thermo-mechanical treatment determines the cumulative PWHT time before the impact properties of the QT steel decrease below the specified 40 J limit at – 20 °C. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed using an artificial neural network to predict the effect of PWHT time and other variables such as composition and test temperature on impact energy. This ANN model provides a valuable design tool for predicting impact toughness as a function of composition, heat treatment and testing conditions. Finally, the performance of BIS 80 was evaluated and its superior impact oughness and fracture toughness properties over BIS 80 PV were confirmed. However, the tensile properties of postweld heat-treated 12 mm BIS 80 cross-weld samples did not comply with AS 3597, the Australian Standard for QT steels; and the PM stress ratio exceeded the specified limit of 0. 93. These ‘deficiencies’ could be remedied by (i) discarding PWHT or (ii) using a high strength WM; and (iii) abandoning or relaxing the stress ratio requirement, which is of questionable significance, under conditions of high strain rate impact loading (road collision) ...|$|E
40|$|Gravitropism is {{required}} for the appropriate alignment of the plant root and shoot. According to the Cholodny-Went hypothesis, gravity induces asymmetric accumulation of auxin in the lower side of the root tissue. More recent studies on root gravitropism have also shown asymmetric accumulation of nitric oxide (NO) in response to gravity, and suggested the involvement of ethylene and NO signalling as well as auxin. Hence, this project aimed to investigate how NO, auxin and ethylene signalling interact in root growth, development and gravitropism. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in these hormonal signals were used in gravistimulation experiments. As expected, Col- 0 (WT) plants displayed <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> 2 h after gravistimulation, but auxin mutants (aux 1, axr 2 and axr 3) did not exhibit any <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> in response to gravistimulation. Roots of ethylene mutants showed reduced <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> compared to WT. Nitrate reductase mutants nia 1 and nia 2 also revealed reduced <b>root</b> <b>bending,</b> and nia 1 showed slower bending than nia 2. Exogenous application of the auxin NAA and the NO donor SNAP increased gravitropic bending. The application of the ethylene precursor ACC reduced <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> in the presence of NO, but increased bending in the absence of NO. The localization of NO in response to gravitropism was investigated using confocal microscopy. Gravitropism induced asymmetric accumulation of NO in WT in the lower side of the <b>bending</b> zone of <b>roots,</b> whereas auxin mutants aux 1 and axr 2 localised NO ubiquitously in the root. NIA 1 (nitrate reductase 1) transcript levels in WT root tips were measured using qPCR. The NIA 1 transcript starts to accumulate after gravistimulation, reaching a two fold higher level after 2 h, before gradually subsiding. The findings suggested that functional auxin signalling is a prerequisite for NO signalling, and that NIA 1 mediated NO induces the <b>root</b> <b>bending.</b> To ascertain the sub-cellular localization of NIA 1 in response to gravity and other hormonal interactions, NIA 1 transcriptional and translational mGFP 4 reporter constructs were made and transformed into the WT and auxin, ethylene and NR mutant plants. Integration of the reporter construct in the plant genome was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Initial confocal experiments showed the successful expression of NIA 1 -driven mGFP 4 fluorescence in roots and stomatal guard cells. Further experiments with these transgenic lines will be needed to examine the role of NO in gravitropism and cross-talk with other phytohormones...|$|R

As an indicator of {{the importance of}} static nonlinearity, the <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> moment is used. A relatively accurate prediction of the bending moment of a flexible wing is important in early design stages, since it largely determines the wing box weight. A linear Timoshenko beam element in a corotational framework is used as a nonlinear structural model. For the aerodynamics, Weissinger’s method is used. The nonlinearly coupled structural and aerodynamical equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method. The load distribution is obtained for the aircraft trimmed at a range of load factors. Results for <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> moment, trimmed angle-of-attack, and wing tip deformation are presented for a high aspect ratio composite wing of a high performance open class sail plane. It is shown that the <b>root</b> <b>bending</b> moment obtained using nonlinear analysis differs significantly from the results of a linear analysis at high load factors. The reasons for the difference are found to be (i) end shortening, (ii) stiffening of the wing, (iii) change in trimmed angle-of-attack, and (iv) load redistribution. Therefore, it is concluded that nonlinear static aeroelastic effects are significant for the structural design of flexible high aspect ratio wings and ought {{to be included in the}} preliminary design stage.

For a single aircraft configuration, variations from the elliptic, minimum drag optimum load distribution can produce wing weight savings that result in airplane performance benefits.

During root illumination, flavonols rapidly accumulate at the side closer to light in the transition zone. This accumulation promotes asymmetrical cell elongation and causes differential growth between the two sides, leading to <b>root</b> <b>bending.</b> Furthermore, <b>roots</b> illuminated {{for a long period of}} time accumulate high levels of flavonols. This high flavonol content decreases both auxin signaling and PLETHORA gradient as well as superoxide radical content, resulting in reduction of cell proliferation. In addition, cytokinin and hydrogen peroxide, which promote root differentiation, induce flavonol accumulation in the root transition zone. As an outcome of prolonged light exposure and flavonol accumulation, root growth is reduced and a different root developmental zonation is established. Finally, we observed that these differentiation-related pathways are required for root light avoidance. We propose that flavonols function as positional signals, integrating hormonal and reactive oxygen species pathways to regulate root growth direction and rate in response to light...|$|R
