The regulatory and economical optimization problems are solved by a QP (Quadratic Programming) algorithm at the same frequency and in two steps (two-layer structure). The economical objective function was a quadratic function based on the energy supplied to an air heater. The best operational conditions are found {{and the use of}} energy is minimized. Future stationary outputs and stationary control actions are calculated from the inverse of the process gain matrix based on predictions upon a constraint QDMC (Quadratic Dynamic Matrix Control). The <b>regulatory</b> <b>objective</b> is to maintain the exit temperature of the spouted bed and the difference between outlet and inlet air humidity under control. The manipulated variables are the flow rate of paste and the power supplied to air heater. The algorithm was able to keep the controlled variables close to the best operational conditions.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{pros and cons}} of {{different}} models for financial market regulation and supervision and we present a proposal for the re-organisation of regulatory and supervisory agencies in the Euro Area. Our arguments are consistent with both new theories and effective behaviour of financial intermediaries in industrialized countries. Our proposed architecture for financial market regulation is based on the assignment of different objectives or "finalities" to different authorities, both at the domestic and the European level. According to this perspective, the three objectives of supervision - microeconomic stability, investor protection and proper behaviour, efficiency and competition - should be assigned to three distinct European authorities, each one at the centre of a European system of financial regulators and supervisors specialized in overseeing the entire financial market with respect to a single <b>regulatory</b> <b>objective</b> and regardless of the subjective nature of the intermediaries. Each system should be structured and organized similarly to the European System of Central Banks and work in connection with the central bank which would remain the institution responsible for price and macroeconomic stability. We suggest a plausible path to build our 4 -peak regulatory architecture in the Euro area. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{industrial}} practice, constrained {{steady state}} optimisation and predictive control are separate, albeit closely related functions within the control hierarchy. This paper presents a method which integrates predictive control with on-line optimisation with economic objectives. A receding horizon optimal control problem is formulated using linear state space models. This optimal control problem {{is very similar}} to the one presented in many predictive control formulations, but the main difference is that it includes in its formulation a general steady state objective depending on the magnitudes of manipulated and measured output variables. This steady state objective may include the standard quadratic <b>regulatory</b> <b>objective,</b> together with economic objectives which are often linear. Assuming that the system settles to a steady state operating point under receding horizon control, conditions are given for the satisfaction of the necessary optimality conditions of the steady-state optimisation problem. The method is based on adaptive linear state space models, which are obtained by using on-line identification techniques. The use of model adaptation is justified from a theoretical standpoint and its beneficial effects are shown in simulations. The method is tested with simulations of an industrial distillation column and a system of chemical reactors...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the pricing of the initial public offerings (IPOs) that follow insurance company demutualizations. Insurers that convert from mutual to stock form typically cite the need for capital as a key motivation. Given that capital adequacy is a primary <b>regulatory</b> <b>objective</b> for insurers, {{one would expect that}} for a given number of shares to be sold, these firms would price their offerings to maximize proceeds. However, the vast literature on IPO pricing suggests various theories as to why it may be in the issuing firm's best interest to underprice its offering. By examining the initial and long-run stock returns for these conversion IPOs, the existence and degree of underpricing, as characterized by large initial returns, can be determined. It is observed that on average demutualization insurer IPOs post significantly higher first-day returns than nondemutualization insurer IPOs. These gains would accrue to the initial investors and to those policyholders who receive compensation in the form of shares in the newly created stock insurer. Attractive returns are sustained for both groups of insurers during the first few years after IPO. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2006. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} credit risk {{transfer}} (CRT) {{in an economy}} with endogenous financing (by both banks and non-bank institutions). Our analysis suggests that the incentive of banks to transfer credit risk is aligned with the <b>regulatory</b> <b>objective</b> of improving stability, and so the recent development of credit derivative instruments is to be welcomed. Moreover, we find the transfer of credit risk from banks to non-banks to be more beneficial than CRT within the banking sector. Intuitively, this is because it allows for the shedding of aggregate risk which must otherwise remain within the relatively more fragile banking sector. Therefore, regulators should act to maximize the benefits from CRT by encouraging the development of instruments favorable to the cross-sectoral transfer of aggregate credit risk (including basket credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations). Finally, we derive the optimal regulatory stance for banks relative to nonbank financial institutions. We show that {{a level playing field}} approach is sub-optimal. Regulatory stances should be set to actively encourage cross-sector CRT, first because of the higher fragility of the banking sector and second to induce banks to incur the costs of CRT which otherwise lead them to undertake an insufficient amount of CRT...|$|E

Concerns about these negotiations {{have led to the}} Queensland Government attempting to regulate aspects of these processes.

The analysis and recommendations can inform the design of new regulatory regimes or the refinement of existing arrangements in Australian and international jurisdictions where there are co-existent UGR development activities and private land use, particularly in New South Wales and Western Australia which are yet to finalize their regulatory regimes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Following {{the onset}} of the August 2007 {{subprime}} mortgage crisis, bank regulators suggest that the old definition of bank may be too narrow – that banking has partially escaped their purview. Perhaps, but this may be partly the regulators’ own doing. We develop this proposition through identification of a measure of differences among financial institutions that drives a bank-specific risk priced by bank shareholders. We find the most profitable banks are also the least regulated. Yet we find that the least profitable regulated banks in our sample were the most exposed to hazards related to the first subprime mortgage crisis. Thus the risk bared by the subprime mortgage crisis was different from the rent-generating risk associated with profitable banking. Our proposed resolution to this conundrum distinguishes between opaque rent-generating risks taken by profitable private institutions, and transparent taxpayer-subsidized risks taken by large banks that are thinly disguised wards of the state. The eventual result of the crisis adjustments can be framed as the redistribution of wealth from regulated institutions to unregulated institutions as the world awakes to the reality of this regulatory failure. Regulators now seek to seize control of the part of the banking system they have not yet suffocated. With great discomfort and considerable trepidation, we support this evolving <b>regulatory</b> <b>objective,</b> but only if regulation is reformed rather than simply expanded...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between competition policy regulation and sector-specific regulation in the regulation of media markets. It takes as its starting point the stated intention of the EU Commission in its proposal for regulatory reform of electronic communication services, i. e. to "roll back" sector-specific regulation to general competition policy regulation of markets for electronic communication services, and discusses the relevance of this policy proposition for the regulation of media markets. Following a description of characteristics of approaches and instruments of sector-specific and competition regulation, respectively, models for organising the division of labour and responsibility between the two policy areas are discussed. The analysis is then applied to the Norwegian case of media regulation; in particular, the ownership regulation of media as practiced in Norway. A fundamental issue is how to reconcile the <b>regulatory</b> <b>objective</b> of economic efficiency in competition policy regulation with safeguarding the objectives of freedom of expression and independence of media from ownership and political influence in media regulation. This is discussed in the paper in relation to new legislation proposed by the Norwegian government with regard to Article 100 in the Constitution and writing the self-regulation of the "Redaktørplakaten" into law. On this basis it is tentatively concluded that economic sector-regulation can be separated form other forms of media regulation and that the former could be rolled back to competition regulation, as a long-term proposition...|$|E

In many cases, regulators may support such responses because they advance <b>regulatory</b> <b>objectives.</b> In the context of risk-based regulation and compliance, especially the model implemented by the Financial Action Task Force to combat money laundering and financing of terrorists, that may, however, not necessarily be the case. With this risk-based approach, regulated institutions are required to respond to higher risks by adopting enhanced risk mitigation measures and are allowed to simplify those measures where the risks are assessed as low. Failure in the latter cases to simplify risk mitigation measures where appropriate, may be inefficient and, in some instances, may even undermine <b>regulatory</b> <b>objectives.</b> This article investigates the drivers of conservative responses by South African banks to statutory anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws...|$|R
