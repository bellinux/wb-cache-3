To conform with zoning regulations, the original intention of four separate apartments over two adjoining lots was adapted to two houses built with shared gardens and central external circulation space. This created a combined scale that visually matches the surrounding houses. The houses reference Japanese courtyard houses.

50|$|In 1978, Colin Rowe's Collage City, {{a highly}} {{influential}} text for architects and urban planners, claimed urban renewal’s city of jumbled disparate objects {{was just as}} problematic as the city it set out to remedy - the dense traditional city of slums. During the urban renewal architects and planners believed that a building could only be understood as an object when in field space, but Rowe disagreed, arguing that the increasing value of urban real estate in the modern city did not allow for the ample green space required to support Le Corbusier's “towers in the park.” Rather, this <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> is paved for parking lots that detach buildings {{from the rest of}} the city fabric. Hence, Rowe called for a transcendence of space fixation and object fixation to create an urban environment where building and space achieve balance and a figure ground with shared dialogue between solid and void.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} non-transport {{functions}} of the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> generated by elevated transport infrastructure and its relationship with abutting neighborhoods The space under the Chicago Brown Line, among all other elevated train lines, is often considered as an undesirable and useless urban eyesore. As part of the transit authority's right of way, such space is usually labeled "mass transportation corridor" on planner's land use maps. However, more careful observations reveal that a considerable portion of the land underneath the train tracks has been actively used by the adjacent residents or business owners {{for a variety of}} purposes other than providing transit service. These observations place an interesting question mark on the stubborn negative common perception of the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> associated with the elevated train lines and other large scale transport infrastructure: why the fact that such <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> is actually being used cannot change the notion that it is not usable? By categorizing the observed activities under the Brown Line into private, quasi-public, and public use types, it is clear that most of the spontaneous reclamation actions are intended for private activities. (cont.) This in a sense indicates that private activities have limited contribution to the entire image of the social character of the <b>residual</b> <b>space.</b> Analysis of the physical characteristics of the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> shows that although the physical condition of a given plot of <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> does not determine the occurrence of activities on it, the quality of the physical environment is an important factor {{of the quality of the}} social activity. Therefore, this thesis argues that one effective way to reclaim the residual spaces both physically and psychologically is to showcase a series of key projects that transform them into delightful places well-programmed for public/quasi-public activities. Following this argument, the main body of the thesis explores strategies of reclaiming the <b>residual</b> <b>space</b> by presenting cases of similar practice in other places and proposing implementation prototypes designed for the Brown Line. The lessons learned from the case studies and the design exercises are conceptualized into guidelines that cover a broad range of considerations from engaging participants, programming activities to spatial design and temporal planning. (cont.) In all, this thesis attempts to provide alternative view points for the transit authority to upgrade, manage, and maintain its right of way, to urge city planners to look into flexible and overlapped land use patterns, and to express my strong belief in good urban environment. by Jing Su.

40|$|OSA {{has a long}} {{standing}} interest in the diffused landscape of Flanders. This resulted amongst others in the test of various design strategies to activate the latent structures of this diffused landscape. Instead of superimposing newly invented structures, OSA indeed unfolded the capacity of existing figures, patterns, and structures that bring clarity in its spatial structure and demonstrate its capacity to canalize the needs of today and tomorrow. The Flemish diluted urban constellation is conventionally considered neither a typical, nor a qualitative urban system. OSA advocates the thesis {{that the quality of}} the diffused city is largely determined by its open spaces. If there’s is any quality in this diluted urban structure it’s in the omnipresence, availability and usually accessibility of open space to begin with, and within the potentiality of this open, often <b>residual,</b> <b>spaces,</b> to enrich and structure spatially. Apart from the conventional and consolidated open spaces the Flemish landscape consists indeed for a large part of rather banal, obscure and fragmented open spaces. They very often are underused or negated spaces, sometimes derelict and often abandoned and/or isolated by infrastructures. As such these open space are not designed. They are often the collateral by-product of a mismatch between regional projects, regional logics and local spatial qualities. One tends to consider these <b>spaces</b> as neglected, <b>residual</b> <b>spaces</b> of which we take the derelict and banal character for granted. The residuality gives these spaces a certain degree of vagueness in use or identity. They’re seldomly the object of strong claims, what allows spontaneous appropriations that often cleverly exploit the residual value. As loci of opportunity, these <b>residual</b> <b>spaces</b> offer Flanders latent structures that can be activated to address contemporary urban questions such as inclusion, ecology, mobility, water management, sustainability etc. Some of these spaces are or were water-sick areas. It is as if they were waiting for the regional water management to reactivate them as a working landscape integrated (cases Stiemerbeek and Turnhout). Locally, they often offer possibilities for complementary public space that allows various forms of appropriations. Some of them actually already function as uncontrolled free havens of public life and the design challenge then is how to safeguard this precious characteristic.

40|$|Abstract Postoperative air leaks {{associated}} with <b>residual</b> pleural <b>space</b> {{is a well}} known complication contributing to prolong hospitalization.

Between 1999 and 2009, 39 patients with air leaks {{associated with}} <b>residual</b> pleural <b>space</b> () 3 cm at chest X-ray) persisting over three days after major lung resection were enrolled in this study. All patients were treated with combined pneumoperitoneum and autologus blood patch. Pneumoperitoneum is obtained by the injection of 30 mlykg of air under the diaphragm, using a Verres needle through the periumbilical area. The blood patch is obtained by instillating 100 ml of autologus blood through the chest tubes. No patients experienced complications related to the procedure. Obliteration of pleural space was obtained in all the patients at a maximum of 96 h postoperatively. Air leaks stopped in all the cases at a maximum of 144 h from surgery. Chest tube was removed 24 h after the air leakage disappearance. Our 10 -year experience supports the early, combined use of pneumoperitoneum and blood patch whenever pleural space and air leaks present after major pulmonary resection. This approach may be recommended because of its easiness, safety, effectiveness, and the low costs. 2010 Published by European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. All rights reserved.

Introduction The occurrence of <b>residual</b> pleural <b>space</b> associated with air leaks after major lung resection is a well known complication experienced by all surgeons in the thoracic community. Improvements in surgical techniques and instrumentation have contributed to reduce the incidence of this complication over the last decades. Conservative approaches include prolonged period of drainage, physiotherapy, pleurodesis with various agents (tetracycline, quanacrine, talcum, silver nitrate), and the use of Heimlich valve w 1 – 6 x. The persistence of parenchymal air leaks and of <b>residual</b> pleural <b>space</b> may promote the occurrence of further serious complications, and especially of pleural infections. This determines longer hospitalization and increased patients’ discomfort w 7 x; furthermore, in patients with lung cancer, it may have a detrimental effect on the oncologic treatment, delaying adjuvant chemotherapy andyor radiotherapy. This report describes our experience with the sequential application of pneumoperitoneum w 8, 9 x and blood patch w 10 – 13 x in 39 patients with <b>residual</b> pleural <b>space</b> associated with air leaks persisting over three days after major pulmonary resections for lung cancer...|$|R
