40|$|The {{portfolio}} of impacts that are quantified in {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) has grown to include rather different stressors than those that were the focus of early LCAs. Some of the newest life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models are still in an early phase of development and {{have not yet been}} included in any LCA study. This is the case for <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> and noise impacts, which have been only recently modeled. <b>Sound</b> <b>emissions</b> are matter-less, time dependent, and bound to the physical properties of waves. The way <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> and the relative noise impacts are modeled in LCA can show how new or existing matter-less impacts can be addressed. In this study, we analyze, through the example of <b>sound</b> <b>emissions,</b> the specific features of a matter-less impact that does not stem from the use of a kilogram of matter, nor is related to the emission of a kilogram of matter. We take as a case study the production of energy by means of wind turbines, contradicting the commonly held assumption that windmills have no emissions during use. We show how to account for <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> in the life cycle inventory phase of the life cycle of a wind turbine and then calculate the relative impacts using a noise LCIA model...|$|R

Specifically the crack speed, the <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> and the fracture profile have been measured {{as a function of}} the applied stress. We find that the local velocity can be considered as a control parameter which determines the properties of the crack. The steady state velocity turns out to be a function of the applied stress. Several thresholds have been identified. One corresponds to the presence of a weak <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> associated with velocity oscillations and another one to the onset of the surface roughness associated with velocity oscillations and another one to the onset of the surface roughness associated with a strong <b>sound</b> <b>emission.</b> We also find a strong crosscorrelation between sound and velocity oscillations.

40|$|The {{hardenability}} {{of steel}} {{through the whole}} workpiece depends on several facts: chemical composition, the type of steel, {{the size and shape}} representing the mass of the workpiece, microstructure prior to heat treatment, the type of quenching medium applied, the quenching method and the quenching process itself. Most common difficulties encountered are caused by deviations due to a vapour film formation around the workpiece. The vapour film formed around the workpiece produces an uneven removal of heat and consequently, a different microstructure than the one expected. In order to control the hardening process, one should be able to monitor the quenching process in real time. The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> together with some results obtained in the course of quenching. Due to heat transfer from a specimen to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur around a heated specimen, which strongly affects sound-pressure signals emitted from the surface during quenching. Different amplitudes of emitted sound-pressure signals at different frequencies therefore mostly depend on the wetting behaviour around the surface of the specimen. It has turned out that an analysis of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> signals can provide useful information that confirms differences occurring in quenching specimens with different shapes in different quenching media under different quenching conditions. Analyses of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> demonstrated that <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> during the quenching process can be used for monitoring the hardening process...|$|R

The <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> is recorded simultaneously with a calibrated single element transducer.

Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: Tertiary academic hospital. Patients: We evaluated 11 men (mean age, 65. 7 years; age range, 53 - 82 years) who underwent laryngofissure, cordectomy, and laryngeal reconstruction with a vestibular fold flap. Interventions: Laryngeal electromyography with the insertion of a needle electrode {{for the assessment of}} the electrophysiologic activity of thyroartenoid muscle fibers and of the cricothyroid muscle on the operated on and nonoperated on sides. The thyroarytenoid muscle was evaluated by introducing a needle electrode through the thyroid cartilage and the cricothyroid membrane.

Final mechanical properties, such as residual stress and hardness profiles, therefore depend on optimum parameters of a quenching process and monitoring of the process itself. The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> in the course of quenching process. Due to heat transfer from a specimen’s surface to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur round a heated specimen, which strongly affects quenching. An investigation of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> in the quenching process was carried out with cylindrical specimens made of chrome-molybdenum heat-treatable steel 42 CrMo 4 quenched in different quenching media. Sound-pressure signals demonstrated by different amplitudes depending on time at different frequencies are shown in 3 D diagrams. It has turned out that an analysis of sound-emission signals can provide useful information that confirms differences occurring in quenching with different quenching media, different specimen’s shapes and under different quenching conditions. Analysis of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> signals can give useful information and confirm the differences caused by different quenching conditions. Analysis of the quenching results obtained from sound-emission signals during the quenching process can be confirmed by variations of residual stresses and hardness in the cross section. The results lead to the applicability of the new approach to the control of the hardening processes of steels. Keywords...|$|R
