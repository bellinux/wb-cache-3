First published September 3; 10. 1152 / ajpcell. 00257. 2003. —Striated muscles across phyla share a highly conserved sarcomere design yet exhibit broad diversity in contractile velocity, force, power output, and efficiency. Insect asynchronous flight muscles {{are characterized by}} high-frequency contraction, en-durance, and high-power output. These muscles have evolved an enhanced delayed force response to stretch that is largely responsible for their enhanced oscillatory work and power production. In this study we investigated the contribution of flightin to oscillatory work using sinusoidal analysis of fibers from three flightless mutants affecting flightin expression: 1) fln 0, a flightin null mutant, 2) Mhc 13, a myosin <b>rod</b> <b>point</b> mutant with reduced levels of flightin, and 3) Mhc 6, a second myosin <b>rod</b> <b>point</b> mutant with reduced levels o...|$|R

50|$|Bent-rod mesogens {{are special}} calamitic mesogens that contain a {{nonlinear}} rod-shaped or bent- rod shaped rigid core and organize to form ‘banana-phases.’ The rigid units of these phases pack {{in a way}} so that the highest density and polar order are achieved, typically with {{the apex of the}} bent <b>rod</b> <b>pointing</b> in one direction. When a layer of bent-rods points in the same polar direction as its adjacent layers the lamellar organization is known as the smectic PF (SmPF) phase, where the F subscript indicates ferroelectric switching, Figure 6.

40|$|A {{device was}} {{constructed}} to study dynamic penetration in crushed rock both in air and a high-vacuum (10 ^(- 5) mm Hg) condition. The apparatus {{is designed to}} drop cylindrical, metal <b>rods,</b> <b>pointed</b> on one end, into cohesion-less crushed rock material. Dynamic penetration is studied {{as a function of}} several particle sizes and mixtures of these particle sizes. Other factors considered are the density of packing, probe dimensions, vacuum pressure, and vacuum degassing rates. Experimental results show that the density of packing of the crushed rock particles is the dominant factor affecting the dynan 1 ic penetration. The maximum penetration occurs in air in the crushed rock with low-density packing. The 1 ninimum penetration occurs in air in densely packed material. Dynamic penetration in vacuum for the low-density and high-density packing lies between the results of penetration in air for the same packing conditions. At vacuum pressures above approximately 0. 1 mm Hg, all penetration values approach the air penetration measurements...|$|R
50|$|Hedley's Puffing Billy, a {{contemporary}} of Blücher, avoided the return connecting rod {{in favour of}} a grasshopper beam. The cylinders were now mounted side by side, but were still large, heavy and mounted {{as an integral part}} of the boiler. Although a beam engine has a similar layout to a return connecting rod engine, in that the piston <b>rod</b> <b>points</b> in one direction and the connecting rod runs backwards from this, beam engines are not considered as return connecting rod engines. Stephenson's manager Hackworth's locomotive Royal George inverted the design to having the cylinders, still vertical, face downwards directly onto the crankshaft. By the time of Stephenson's Rocket, particularly as the new fire-tube boiler locomotives became lighter and faster, it was recognised that vertical cylinders caused hammer blow on the flimsy fishbelly rails of the time. Rocket was built with cylinders inclined at 45° but was soon rebuilt to place them near-horizontally. Since then, almost all steam locomotives have had their cylinders placed close to horizontal.|$|R

40|$|Background and aims. Er:YAG laser {{irradiation}} {{has been}} claimed {{to improve the}} adhesive properties of dentin; therefore, it has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} acid etching. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the shear bond strength of an etch-and-rinse adhesive system to dentin surfaces following Er:YAG laser and/or phosphoric acid etching. Materials and methods. The roots of 75 sound maxillary premolars were sectioned below the CEJ and the crowns were embedded in auto-polymerizing acrylic resin with the buccal surfaces facing up. The buccal surfaces were ground using a diamond bur and polished until the dentin was exposed; the samples were randomly divided into five groups (n= 15) according to the surface treatment: (1) acid etching; (2) laser etching; (3) laser etching followed by acid etching; (4) acid etching followed by laser etching and (5) no acid etching and no laser etching (control group).

50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a ferrite rod aerial), made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The ferrite rod antenna has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the <b>rod</b> <b>points</b> exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|R
