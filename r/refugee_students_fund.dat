40|$|In the Netherlands {{refugees}} request asylum every year, in 2011 {{the amount}} of requests was 11. 590 (Vluchtelingenwerk, 2012). Among these refugees, there are individuals that pursue a degree in the higher education. For refugees {{it is often difficult}} to enter and stay in the Dutch education system, due to factors related to their refugee status. Therefore, the University Assistance Fund (UAF) helps refugees, because they believe that higher educated refugees can be of added value for the Dutch society. Due to specific barriers refugees encounter, dropout among this group is high and happens for different reasons than dropout among native Dutch students. The goal of this research is to find which constraints <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> encounter in certain higher education institutions, in order to be able to decrease the dropout rate. The research question is: How do specific barriers, functionings and capabilities lead to dropout among <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> in four Dutch higher education institutions? The four institutions are the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, the Universiteit Utrecht and Fontys Hogeschool Eindhoven. To answer the question an integrated theoretical framework, combining Sen’s capability approach (1979) and Bean and Metzner persistence theory (1985) has been used. The methods used are in-depth interviews with several employees from the four institutions and with twelve <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> who have dropped out at one of these institutions. The results of the interviews have been analyzed by applying the theoretical framework and is based on Boeije’s coding method for qualitative research (2005). The results of the interviews with the employees provide the vision on <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> and diversity of every institution. Due to the embedded core values of the institutions, the VU has a diversity policy and the HvA has arrangements for <b>refugee</b> <b>students.</b> The UU is a large university with a relatively small non-western and <b>refugee</b> <b>student</b> population. Therefore, they do not deem it necessary to provide special arrangements. Fontys has a decentralized way of policy-making. Only for the most important values they have policies on the institution level and <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> are a too small group to make policies for. The interviews with the dropouts show a diversity in reasons for dropout and opinions about arrangements at the institutions. The main reasons for dropout were care responsibilities, language problems and lack of counseling at institutions. <b>Refugee</b> <b>students</b> indicate the need for extra arrangements, but on the other hand <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> say that it is their own responsibility to succeed in their study. It turns out that at least part of the <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> would benefit from special arrangements. The recommendations of this study are mainly for the UAF, because the UAF, sometimes in cooperation with institutions, can provide the best resources for <b>refugee</b> <b>students.</b> The organization of an introduction day for new <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> at an institution, in collaboration with the UAF, is considered useful. Meeting fellow <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> and knowing where to find help is something the interviewees missed. Better communication between the institutions and the UAF can lead to better organized activities for <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> at institutions. Also, a mentor system were older UAF students help new students with adjusting to the new institution and prevent them from the mistakes they might have made is considered useful. Furthermore, keeping better track of their dropout students and the reasons for dropping out are the main recommendations for the UAF to decrease the dropout rate among their students...|$|R

Using a qualitative phenomenological approach, this study seeks to illuminate and understand {{the essence of the}} meanings that Iraqi <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> attach to their community college experiences in a new country and make sense of these experiences. <b>Refugee</b> <b>students</b> enrolled in postsecondary education face academic challenges vastly different from students that come from non-refugee backgrounds. Although there is some existing literature on refugee and immigrant students' experiences in elementary and secondary education, there is a paucity of research on the specific experiences of Iraqi <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> in higher education. This research addresses this gap in knowledge and focuses on exploring the experiences of Iraqi refugees as they transition into a community college in their new homeland. Data was collected by interviewing Iraqi <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> who were recruited from Educational Opportunity Programs and Services Department (EOPS). Purposive sampling was utilized and data was transcribed and then analyzed using software called Saturate. In exploring the process of transition for each student, the three themes that emerged were: 1) Navigating the System; 2) Academic Barriers; and 3) Sense of Belonging. Bourdieu's notion of habitus and forms of capital served as the theoretical framework for this research. The findings from this study may be utilized to enhance understanding of the barriers and support mechanisms that affect Iraqi refugee students' community college experiences.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 77 - 80). The {{ongoing process}} of acculturation constitutes {{a significant part}} of refugee students' interactions with volunteers. Communication functions to empower and create meaning for each individual in this relationship. My research was designed to investigate the ways that <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> construct resiliency through their communication with members of U. S. and international communities. The relationship between <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> and tutors is explored through thirteen interviews with students and tutors, one focus group discussion with students and tutors, and ethnographic observations of students' and tutors' communication behavior. Observations before, during, and after tutoring sessions focused on interactions that were designed to assist <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> in the college preparation and navigation process. The results of this research indicate that refugee students' construction of resiliency plays a vital role in their adjustment to college, and implicitly, U. S. culture. Through expressions of affiliation, diligence, and connectedness, <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> and their tutors communicatively construct resiliency. Each of the three expressions offer theoretical implications: affiliation reflects the tenets of social support, diligence exemplifies empowerment in action, and connectedness relates to the intercultural theory of uncertainty reduction. I posit that {{the findings of this study}} encourage all educators to communicate in a culturally competent way with <b>refugee</b> <b>students,</b> thus fostering students' construction of resiliency, and consequently, such students' smooth transition into the U.

40|$|The largest refugee group {{entering}} the United States {{in recent years}} is from Burma. <b>Refugee</b> <b>students</b> face a daunting set of challenges, from language and cultural differences to living in poverty, in becoming successful in their new homes. To be successful in schools and gain cultural and social capital, <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> must learn and internalize the specific norms of their classrooms. In middle school, students are particularly reliant upon their peers for support, making peer interactions especially important. In multicultural settings, students have ample opportunities for intercultural interactions, which can help <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> navigate their new settings and become more successful. Unfortunately, there has been little research on the experiences of Burmese <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> in classrooms in the United States. I used a qualitative, transcendental phenomenological approach to study how three female Burmese <b>refugee</b> <b>students</b> experienced multicultural middle school classrooms in the United States, especially their intercultural interactions, through interviews, observations, and stimulated recall.
