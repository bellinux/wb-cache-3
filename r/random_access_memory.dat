5|$|In PowerPC-based Macintoshes, {{the boot}} process {{starts with the}} {{activation}} of BootROM, the basic Macintosh ROM, which performs a Power On Self Test to test hardware essential to startup. On the passing of this test, the startup chime is played {{and control of the}} computer is passed to OpenFirmware. OpenFirmware initializes the <b>Random</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Memory,</b> Memory Management Unit and hardware necessary for the ROM's operation. The OpenFirmware then checks settings, stored in NVRAM, and builds a list of all devices on a device tree by gathering their stored FCode information.|$|E
5|$|The phase-amplitude {{converter}} {{creates the}} sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word {{received from the}} PA. The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed {{to reduce the amount}} of memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E
5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E

5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> {{is a type}} of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to static <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> and other static memory. In 1966 DRAM was invented by Robert Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.|$|E

25|$|ReadyBoost (codenamed EMD) is a disk caching {{software}} component developed by Microsoft for Windows Vista and included in later {{versions of the}} Windows operating system. ReadyBoost enables NAND memory mass storage devices, including CompactFlash, SD cards, and USB flash drives, {{to be used as}} a write cache between a hard drive and <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> in an effort to increase computing performance. ReadyBoost relies on the SuperFetch technology and, like SuperFetch, adjusts its cache based on user activity. Other features, including ReadyDrive, are implemented in a manner similar to ReadyBoost.|$|E
25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E

25|$|Famous inventions and {{developments}} by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM), Dynamic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (DRAM), {{the electronic}} keypunch, the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time. A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM {{has been one of}} the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2017, the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business, marking 24 consecutive years for the achievement.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was unable to unlock one of the mobile phones they had recovered because of the phone's advanced security features. The phone was an iPhone 5C owned by the county and issued to its employee, the shooter Farook. The FBI first asked the National Security Agency to break into the phone, but the NSA was unable to do so. As a result, the FBI asked Apple Inc. to create {{a new version of the}} phone's iOS operating system that could be installed and run in the phone's <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> to disable certain security features. Apple declined due to its policy to never undermine the security features of its products. The FBI responded by successfully applying to a United States magistrate judge, Sherri Pym, to issue a court order, mandating Apple to create and provide the requested software. The order was not a subpoena, but rather was issued under the All Writs Act of 1789.|$|E
500|$|The SG-1000 {{is powered}} by an 8-bit Zilog Z80 central {{processing}} unit running at 3.58 MHz for the SG-1000 and SG-1000 II, and at 4MHz for the SC-3000.

500|$|To {{obtain the}} graphic details {{seen in the}} game, Rubin, Gavin, and Baggett {{researched}} visibility calculation in video games that followed Doom and concluded that extensive pre-calculation of visibility would allow the game to render {{a larger number of}} polygons. Following experimentation in free-roaming camera control, the team settled with a branching rail camera that would follow along next to, behind, or in front of the character, generally looking at him, moving on a [...] "track" [...] through the world. Because only 800 polygons could be visible on the screen at a time, parts of the game's landscape would be hidden from view using trees, cliffs, walls, and twists and turns in the environment. Because the production used an entirely Silicon Graphics and IRIX-based tool pipeline, the programmers used $100,000 Silicon Graphics workstations instead of the $3,000 personal computers that were the standard at the time. Gavin created an algorithmic texture packer that would {{deal with the fact that}} the 512 × 240 video mode left too little texture memory. Meanwhile, Baggett created bidirectional 10x compressors that would reduce the 128-megabyte levels down to 12 megabytes and allow them to be compatible with the PlayStation's 2-megabyte <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory.</b> The levels proved to be so large that the first test level created could not be loaded into Alias PowerAnimator and had to be cut up into 16 chunks. Each chunk took about 10 minutes to load even on a 256-megabyte machine. To remedy the situation, Baggett created the DLE, a level design tool where component parts of a level were entered into a text file, with a series of Adobe Photoshop layers indicating how the parts were combined. To code the characters and gameplay of the game, Andy Gavin and Dave Baggett created the programming language [...] "Game-Oriented Object LISP" [...] (GOOL) using LISP syntax.|$|E
500|$|Yamamoto's group {{opted to}} use 3dfx Voodoo 2 and Voodoo Banshee {{graphics}} processors alongside a Motorola PowerPC 603e {{central processing unit}} (CPU), but Sega management later asked them to also use the SH-4 chip. Both processors {{have been described as}} [...] "off the shelf" [...] components. In 1997, 3dfx began its IPO, {{and as a result of}} legal obligations unveiled its contracts with Sega, including the development of the new console. This angered Sega of Japan executives, who eventually decided to use the Dural chipset and cut ties with 3dfx. [...] According to former Sega of America vice president of communications and former NEC brand manager Charles Bellfield, presentations of games using the NEC solution showcased the performance and low cost delivered by the SH-4 and PowerVR architecture. He further stated that [...] "Sega's relationship with NEC, a Japanese company, probably made a difference [...] too." [...] Stolar, on the other hand, [...] "felt the US version, the 3Dfx version, should have been used. Japan wanted the Japanese version, and Japan won." [...] As a result, 3dfx filed a lawsuit against both Sega and NEC claiming breach of contract, which would eventually be settled out of court. The choice to use the PowerVR architecture concerned Electronic Arts (EA), a longtime developer for Sega's consoles. EA had invested in 3dfx but was unfamiliar with the selected architecture, which was reportedly less powerful. As recounted by Shiro Hagiwara (a general manager at Sega's hardware division) and Ian Oliver (the managing director of Sega subsidiary Cross Products), the SH-4 was chosen while it was still in development and following a lengthy deliberation process because it was the only available processor that [...] "could adapt to deliver the 3D geometry calculation performance necessary." [...] By February 1998, Sega had renamed the Dural [...] "Katana" [...] (after the Japanese sword), although certain hardware specifications such as <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM) were not yet finalized.|$|E

[...] If no RAM is free, {{it may be necessary to}} choose an existing page (known as a [...] "victim"), using some replacement algorithm, and save it to disk (a process called [...] "paging"). With some MMUs, there can also be a shortage of PTEs, in which case the OS will have to free one for the new mapping.|$|E
