5|$|<b>Round</b> <b>one</b> of the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament was {{strictly}} Tag Team matches between {{each of the}} participating groups, with each victory being worth one point. Two matches were held during <b>round</b> <b>one.</b> The first match was between Team TNA and Team International on the June19 episode of Impact!. The Motor City Machine Guns represented Team TNA in the contest, while the team of Tyson Dux and Daivari fought for Team International. The Motor City Machine Guns won the encounter by pinfall at 13 minutes when Shelley forced Daivari head-first into the mat with his signature Sliced Bread#2 maneuver.|$|E
5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds themselves in an uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in <b>round</b> <b>one,</b> it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from <b>round</b> <b>one</b> if their second jump is not up to par.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin again or freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in <b>round</b> <b>one</b> reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in <b>round</b> <b>one,</b> and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} {{itself is}} composed of two rounds. In <b>round</b> <b>one,</b> all 40 qualified athletes complete a single jump in the aforementioned World Cup order. After points for distance and style are achieved, only the top 30 scorers from the first round proceed to the second, while the rest are eliminated from the event. In round two, the starting order is instead {{based solely on the}} points gained in the first round: the lowest scoring athlete jumps first, while the leader has the very last jump of the competition. The athlete with the most points from both rounds wins that competition. For the second competition, the starting order for <b>round</b> <b>one</b> uses the results from the first competition – no longer based on World Cup ranking – with athletes again jumping in ascending order of points. After the second (and final) round, the athlete with the most points accumulated from both competitions is declared the Ski Flying World Champion.|$|E

5|$|The {{conclusion}} to the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament {{was held at}} Victory Road with two matches completing the final two rounds. The World X Cup was a tournament consisting of teams competing against each other for points. There were four teams each made up of four men, with three teams representing a country and one representing TNA. These teams were Team TNA (Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Curry Man, and Kazarian), Team Japan (Masato Yoshino, Milano Collection A.T., Naruki Doi, and Puma), Team Mexico (Averno, Rey Bucanero, Último Guerrero, and Volador Jr.), and Team International (Alex Koslov, Daivari, Doug Williams, and Tyson Dux).

5|$|The tournament was {{scheduled}} to span over a two-day weekend, starting on February 5 and ending on February 6 at events recorded for later broadcast on Ring of Honor Wrestling. However, due to severe weather conditions in the Philadelphia area, {{the second day of}} taping was canceled. It was not until almost a month later, on March 5, that ROH held the second recorded event, which closed out the tournament. The first four seeds of eight in the tournament were announced on January 22, 2010: Rhett Titus (8), El Generico (7), Eddie Edwards (6), and Delirious (5). The other four seeds were announced on January 26, 2010: Kevin Steen (1), Kenny King (2), Colt Cabana (3), and Davey Richards (4). The first round was determined at the first event on February 5, with Steen, King, Richards, and Edwards all advancing to round two. On March 5, Edwards and Richards both advanced to the finals, where Edwards defeat Richards to be crowned the first ROH World Television Champion. The matches were scheduled to span over six episodes of Ring of Honor Wrestling. The first match from <b>round</b> <b>one</b> that aired pitted Steen against Titus, which Steen won, on the March 8 episode. On the same episode, King versus El Generico was featured, with King advancing. Cabana versus Edwards was the third match from <b>round</b> <b>one</b> to air, when it was broadcast on the March 15 episode.

5|$|Cotto's third {{championship}} defense {{took place}} on September 24, 2005 at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against Ricardo Torres of Colombia. In the first round Cotto had an offensive advantage and scored a knockdown on Torres. In the second round after trading hits Torres scored a knockdown on Miguel. The last seconds of the round were evenly matched with both boxers finishing the round injured. Cotto was apparently in better condition when the third round began and was dominating the fight at that point. With two minutes remaining in the <b>round</b> <b>one</b> of Cotto's punches landed in Torres' beltline. Following this Torres was granted thirty seconds to recover by the referee. Cotto dominated the fourth round and Torres won the fifth. Cotto won and scored a knockdown in the sixth round. At 1:24 of the seventh round a left hook by Cotto knocked Torres out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} the reality of Compact Groups of galaxies (CGs) is discussed. We {{separated}} two classes of groups: elongated, chain-like groups (I), and <b>round</b> <b>ones</b> (II). The number of chain-like groups among Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) is about twice as large as that of the <b>round</b> <b>ones.</b> In Shakhbazian Compact galaxy Groups (ShCGs) the proportion of chain-like groups is smaller than that of the <b>round</b> <b>ones.</b> It is shown that some parameters of both classes of HCGs are quite different. The radial velocity dispersion (σv) is smaller in chain-like groups, and the interaction and merging processes are more efficient in them. The magnitude difference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxies in HCGs is larger in groups of class I, and is smaller in groups with larger number of members. The surface distribution in round CGs is concentrated towards the center. The above-mentioned differences allow us to conclude that CGs are real physical entities...|$|R
