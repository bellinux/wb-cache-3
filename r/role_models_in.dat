25|$|Like the Soviet army, {{political}} and military officers formed a dual chain of command within the PVA, and this arrangement could be found as low as the company level. Political officers {{were in charge of}} the control and the morale of the troops, and they were often expected to act like <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> combat. Unlike other Communist armies of the same period, although the political officers had authority over military officers on combat decisions, the military officers could issue orders without political officers' approval. Similarly, the line between military and political officers were often blurred in PVA, since the political officers often had extensive military experiences while most military officers were senior Party members within a unit.|$|E

25|$|Greater issues {{arose in}} the 1990’s, when supermodel Kate Moss popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion {{industry}} pushed her image further with the ‘heroin-chic’ look, which dominated the catwalks during that time. This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure. Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000’s saw {{the rise of the}} Victoria’s Secret models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent thigh gaps. Hence, women started pursuing cosmetic surgery practices; on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance. Nevertheless, curves are back in season and positive measures are now being taken to promote a better body image. The emergence of fitness trends, plus-size models, and other better <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> the fashion and media industries are other factors at work too. Contrariwise, the advancement of technologies, and the pressures from the media, has unfortunately triggered an even greater societal importance on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.|$|E

Methods: This study {{was part of a larger}} study investigating the process of positive doctor <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>in</b> medical education.
