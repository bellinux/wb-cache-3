Much uncertainty surrounds the potential impacts of invasive waterbirds on native waterbird communities and wetlands. Understanding the processes and phases of population and range expansion of non-native waterbirds, and their environmental drivers, is an important research topic to inform management of these species. This study investigates the trajectories of population and range expansion of the Egyptian Goose (Alopachen aegypticus) across the UK between 1993 and 2014, and the environmental and spatial drivers of population density and site occupancy for three representative time periods, using the British Trust for Ornithology’s Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) data.

Moreover, for the areas suitable for afforestation, the potential for carbon sequestration was estimated considering different species of vegetation, both native (scenario 1) and exotic (formed by Pinus sp. and Eucalyptus sp. - scenario 2). The study was carried out through GIS techniques and two regions were considered.

Occupancy models greatly increase the robustness of inference that can be made from presence/absence data when species are imperfectly detected, and recent novel developments allow for the quantification of the strength of interaction between pairs of species. We used a two-species multi-season occupancy model to quantify the impact of the invasive American mink on the native European mink in Spain through the analysis of their co-occurrence pattern over twelve years (2000 - 2011) in the entire Spanish range of European mink distribution, where both species were detected by live trapping but American mink were culled. We detected a negative temporal trend in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> of European mink and a simultaneous positive trend in the occupancy of American mink. The species co-occurred less often than expected and the native mink was more likely to become extinct from sites occupied by the invasive species. Removal of American mink resulted in a high probability of local extinction where it co-occurred with the endemic mink, but the overall increase in the probability of occupancy over the last decade indicates that the ongoing management is failing to halt its spread. More intensive culling effort where both species co-exist as well as in adjacent areas where the invasive American mink is found at high densities is required in order to stop thedecline of European mink...|$|E

40|$|Aim The main aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{different}} methods for the determination of both areas of endemism (AoEs) and biotic elements by analysing all the endemic plant species of a region, using our own data on the distribution of such taxa in the Maritime and Ligurian Alps. Our other goals were to use indicator species analysis (INDVAL) to identify and compare the species significantly associated with the AoEs detected by cluster analysis and parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), to compare these species with the results obtained by biotic element analysis, and to discuss the biogeographical meaning of the results obtained by all three methods. Location Maritime and Ligurian Alps, bordering north-western Italy and southeastern France. Methods A presence/absence matrix of 36 endemic plant species was analysed using cluster analysis, PAE and biotic element analysis. INDVAL was used to compare the results obtained using these three methods. Results In an area such as the Maritime and Ligurian Alps, where the present distribution pattern of endemic taxa mainly reflects the influence of ecological factors, PAE and cluster analysis defined comparable AoEs characterized by the species that constituted the biotic elements. However, the biotic element analysis and AoE approaches revealed different relationships between the area/taxa congruence and the congruence among taxa ranges. Main conclusions The combined use of different methods seems to be useful for a complete description of the distribution patterns of taxa in a study area. INDVAL should be considered as a useful tool in biogeographical analysis for various reasons. It provides an objective criterion for dendrogram pruning based on the association rate between areas and taxon ranges. Because it identifies the strongest indicator species of each geographic unit, it allows comparison of the results of PAE and cluster analysis with those of biotic element analysis.

40|$|Cities are {{responsible}} for 70 % of global carbon emissions. As a result, cities worldwide have been met {{with the challenge of}} urban sustainability. Urbanization results mostly from the conversion of agricultural land into urban form; and to perform various functions, urban systems need to be put into place and maintained to keep them moving forward. Urban development, with its ability to deliver socioeconomic benefits, is a key to economic success, human development, eradication of poverty, and overall sustainable growth. The core infrastructure of a city, which includes roads, mass transit, airports, electricity production and distribution, and water/sewer systems, hold the utmost descriptive power for efficiency and joint necessity in fostering economic growth and in reducing poverty and income inequalities. Extensive public and private led infrastructure projects are critical for ensuring efficient economic function. Urban sustainability assessment indicators are based on economic, social and environment aspects which are integrated within rules, regulations, and polices. Urban design integrated in the natural environment {{plays a key role in}} shaping a city’s future. Compact design, density, walkability, quality of life, amenities, and economic development are several of the fundamental principles of urban sustainable development. Developing countries like Pakistan are facing very specific issues with respect to urban development due to lack of financial and performance capabilities. Although cities are growing and expanding in all respects, they are becoming more and more difficult to maintain. Despite the expansion of urban boundaries, issues, such as shortage of housing, quality of life, and financial constraints to adequately manage communities, are also increasing. In other words, urban boundaries are being pushed but are failing to be managed sustainably. Accordingly, the present study’s objective is to identify the forces and motivations that are driving land development in the city of Islamabad, Pakistan. Two questions are raised: 1) Is land development influenced by the element of financialization? And, 2) How do land development decisions influence urban sustainability in Islamabad? This paper’s objective is to first confirm whether the element of financialization does in fact influence urban land development, and then to explore its relationship with urban sustainability. This study uses assessment of urban land development patterns, market motivations and their relationship with utility of land development, and analyzes occupancy trend and sustainability in terms of Islamabad’s provision of basic amenities and walkability.

This is due partly {{to the fact that}} tropical amphibians are patchily distributed and difficult to detect. We tested three methods often used to monitor population trends in amphibian species in a remote lowland tropical forest of French Guiana. These methods are capture-mark-recapture (CMR), estimation of the number of calling males with repeated counts data and distance sampling, and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> inferred by presence/absence data. We monitored eight diurnal, terrestrial amphibian species including five Dendrobatidae and three Bufonidae. We found that CMR, the most precise way of estimating population size, can be used only with two species in high density patches where the recapture rate is high enough. Only for one of the species (Dendrobates tinctorius), a low coefficient of variation (CV = 0. 19) can be achieved with 15 to 20 capture events. For dendrobatid species with day-calling males, audio surveys yield a better probability of detection with only 8 audio surveys needed; quantitative estimates can be achieved by computing the number of calling males inferred from audio counts or distance sampling analysis. We therefore suggest that an efficient monitoring protocol for Neotropical amphibian species should include a combination of sighting and audio techniques, and we discuss the need of implementing a large-scale monitoring in orde...|$|R

On any given day, 33. 3 - 85. 7 % (mean = 60. 8 %, SD = 14. 2) of adult males roosted singly, with the remainder holding harems of 1 - 10 breeding females (mean = 3. 01, SD = 0. 79). Average harem sex ratio was 2. 8 -fold higher than the adult sex ratio of the total tent-roosting population within the study area, indicating the potential for a high variance in male mating success within a single breeding season. Bats of both sexes typically occupied one primary tent, interspersed with shorter periods of residency in alternate tents. Males exhibited a significantly higher degree of roost fidelity than females.

We also apply this analytical technique to the calculation of lattice modulation experiments. We compute the production <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> double <b>occupancy</b> induced by modulation of an optical lattice potential. Furthermore, we extend the analysis {{to take into account the}} trapping potential by use of the local density approximation. We find an excellent agreement with recent experiments on $^{ 173 }$Yb atoms. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures, published versio...|$|R
40|$|American pikas (Ochotona princeps) {{have been}} heralded as {{indicators}} of montane-mammal response to contemporary climate change. Pikas no longer occupy the driest and lowest-elevation sites in numerous parts of their geographic range. Conversely, pikas have exhibited higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> and persistence in Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada montane 'mainlands'. Research and monitoring efforts on pikas across the western USA have collectively shown the nuance and complexity with which climate will often act on species in diverse topographic and climatic contexts. However, to date no studies have investigated habitat, distribution, and abundance of pikas across hundreds of sites within a remote wilderness area. Additionally, relatively {{little is known about}} whether climate acts most strongly on pikas through direct or indirect (e. g., vegetation-mediated) mechanisms. During 2007 - 2009, we collectively hiked > 16, 000 km throughout the 410, 077 -ha Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, in an effort to identify topographic, microrefugial, and vegetative characteristics predictive of pika abundance. We identified 411 apparently pika-suitable habitat patches with binoculars (in situ), and surveyed 314 of them for pika signs. Ranking of alternative logistic-regression models based on AICc scores revealed that short-term pika abundances were positively associated with intermediate elevations, greater cover of mosses, and taller forbs, and decreased each year, for a total decline of 68 % during the three-year study; whereas longer-term abundances were associated only with static variables (longitude, elevation, gradient) and were lower on north-facing slopes. Earlier Julian date and time of day of the survey (i. e., midday vs. not) were associated with lower observed pika abundance. We recommend that wildlife monitoring account for this seasonal and diel variation when surveying pikas. Broad-scale information on status and abundance determinants of montane mammals, especially for remote protected areas, is crucial for land and wildlife-resource managers trying to anticipate mammalian responses to climate change...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{hospitals}} {{are examples of}} small organizations that have seen their environment change rapidly in the last decade. The {{purpose of this study}} has been to examine these changes and the abilities of small rural hospitals to adapt to these changes. Hospitals are organizations whose abilities to adapt to the stresses of change are enhanced by the use of strategic planning and strategic adaptation. This study used Shortell et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (1990) model of strategic adaptation to examine the conditions under which rural hospitals utilize the precepts of strategic adaptation to change {{to meet the demands of}} the rapidly changing health care environment. A survey and personal interviews of rural hospital administrators were used in this evaluation process. Environmental changes identified by the rural administrators included inadequate health care funding by the federal and state governments, low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy,</b> uncollectible health service payments, hospital cost increases, inadequate private reimbursement, and increased regulation. Hospitals with adequate resources were able to change their strategic orientation from a defender to proactive analyzer. Other rural hospitals remained in the analyzer or prospector orientation. Few rural hospitals had a formal plan of strategic adaptation, but their behaviors exhibited the ability to change to meet environmental stresses. ^ A large number of the surveyed and interviewed administrators identified areas of public policy that were creating environmental stress and making it difficult to develop adaptations. Inadequate funding by Medicare and Medicaid were problematic at the time of the study. The regulatory demands of state and federal government were burdensome in terms of requirements for services and staffing. This was particularly true with the limited financial and personnel resources in rural areas. The development of state and federal regulations and policies that allow flexibility in providing health care was identified as a critical need to ensure the survivability of rural hospitals. ...|$|R
