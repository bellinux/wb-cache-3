50|$|The test of foraminiferan {{initially}} {{consists of}} gradually mineralized organic matter, but also sometimes exogenous agglomerated particles (in particular for species {{living in the}} sediment or in great depth). It can be of many types, like agglutinated (exogenous agglomerate), microgranular (with calcite grains), porcelain-like (smooth calcite) or hyalin (lens). Foraminiferans develops by building new rooms in their test. These are arranged according to a geometry particular to each species: they can be <b>rectilinear,</b> <b>curved,</b> rolled up or cyclic, and every time uniserial or multiserial. These organizational types can also be mixed, or even more complex. Miliolids have a particular arrangement. The surface of the test can be smooth or textured.|$|R

In AD 352, the orchestra was probably transformed into an arena for aquatic shows, which had become fashionable. The stage, which is 12 ft high, had 5 doors and 6 niches. In front of these there were 10 marble columns, decorated with alternate <b>rectilinear</b> and <b>curved</b> segments. The wall behind the scene was decorated with three rows of columns one behind another. The columns on the front row do not have grooves and stood on octagonal bases.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} linear elastic {{fracture}} mechanics approach for {{the prediction of}} plate end debonding in <b>rectilinear</b> and <b>curved</b> plated beams. The analytical model results in simple equations, suitable for immediate design use. The load-deflection curve of a plated beam, from the onset of debonding up to the complete separation of the plate, is obtained by controlling {{the length of the}} interfacial debonding crack. Its shape clearly shows that snap-back or snap-through instabilities may arise when the beam is loaded under displacement or force control. Analytical predictions are also compared with finite element results based on an interfacial cohesive crack model. It is shown that the predictions of the proposed analytical model match closely the numerical solution, provided that an effective crack length accounting for the size of the fracture process zone is used in the calculations...|$|R
40|$|Curvature is {{a highly}} {{informative}} visual cue for shape perception and object recognition. We introduce a novel illusion—the Lemon Illusion—in which subtle illusory curvature is perceived along contour regions that are devoid of physical curvature. We offer several perceptual demonstrations and observations that lead us {{to conclude that the}} Lemon Illusion is an instance of a more general illusory curvature phenomenon, one in which the presence of contour curvature discontinuities lead to the erroneous extension of perceived curvature. We propose that this erroneous extension of perceived curvature results from the interaction of neural mechanisms that operate on spatially local contour curvature signals with higher-tier mechanisms that serve to establish more global representations of object shape. Our observations suggest that the Lemon Illusion stems from discontinuous curvature transitions between <b>rectilinear</b> and <b>curved</b> contour segments. However, the presence of curvature discontinuities is not sufficient to produce the Lemon Illusion, and the minimal conditions necessary to elicit this subtle and insidious illusion are difficult to pin down...|$|R
40|$|A nearly {{homogeneous}} uniformly sheared {{turbulent flow}} {{was subjected to}} curvature {{in the same direction}} as the mean shear and then to curvature reversal. The adjustment of the turbulence structure to a change of the value of the curvature parameter, S=Uc Rc∂U∂n, is investigated. The structural parameter, Kuv=uvq 2, adjusts faster when the effects of curvature are stronger. For the small values of S obtained in the present investigation the adjustment of Kuv depends on both the original and new values of S as the flow is subjected to curvature reversal. Qualitative and quantitative similarities between the present flow and curved turbulent boundary layers are identified. A thin ribbon is placed in <b>rectilinear</b> and <b>curved</b> nearly homogeneous uniformly sheared flows. The development of the wake of the thin ribbon is investigated. The mean flow characteristics of the wake of the thin ribbon developing in rectilinear shear flow present a certain degree of self similarity and some resemblance to the characteristics of the wake of a LEBU in the outer part of turbulent boundary layers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and {{proposed}} study: Numerous deforming syndromes of the craniofacial complex involve also the symmetry of the cranial base. This study considers a particular alteration, that of 'scoliosis', {{in which the}} line Nasion-Sella-Basion-Inion is not <b>rectilinear</b> but <b>curved,</b> due to a torsion of the cranial base in the horizontal plane. Materials: Plagiocephaly was studied in one patient, which was probably caused by altered timing or mechanism of closure of the cranial sutures. Methods: This study was carried out using CT images of the patient's craniofacial complex, using standard neuroradiological points. In order to study the forces that operated in the various complexes, a mathematical analysis was applied namely, a finite element system analysis (FESA). Results: From this mathematical study, which has enabled us to evaluate the forces that operate in determining the deformity, it has been possible to locate two sites of force concentration. They were located at different levels and on opposite sides. Conclusion: This finding could explain why the middle and lower thirds of the face were also involved. © 2004 European Association for Cranial-Maxillofacial Surgery...|$|R

Following reduction of the disulfides with tris-carboxyethyl- 2 -phosphine, a widely used method utilizes derivatization with ammonium 7 -fluorobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole- 4 -sulfonate (SBD-F) as a fluorogenic probe prior to reversed-phase HPLC analysis. We report the results of microwave-enhanced synthesis of the fluorescent derivatives at 90 °C in microcentrifuge tubes. Utilizing microwave heating, we reduced the derivatization time at all temperatures from 1 h to less than 2 min. Standard solutions produced <b>rectilinear</b> calibration <b>curves</b> with correlation coefficients 3 ̆e 0. 99 for all four aminothiols. We compared the results obtained for the four aminothiols extracted from chicken plasma and liver, and mouse heart using traditional heating and microwave heating.

40|$|A {{biosensor}} {{based on}} carbon paste modified with crude extract of zucchini (Cucurbita pepo) {{as a source}} of peroxidase is proposed for determining L-ascorbic acid in pharmaceutical formulations. This enzyme in the presence of hydrogen peroxide catalyses the oxidation of hydroquinone to p-quinone whose electrochemical reduction back to hydroquinone was obtained at peak potential of - 0. 14 V. Thus, when L-ascorbic acid is added to the solution, this acid can reduce chemically p-quinone to hydroquinone and/or reduce hydrogen peroxide, decreasing the peak current obtained proportionally to the increase of its concentration. The recovery of L-ascorbic acid from five samples ranged from 98. 1 to 102. 1 % and a <b>rectilinear</b> calibration <b>curve</b> for L-ascorbic acid concentration from 2. 0 x 10 - 4 to 5. 5 x 10 - 3 mol L- 1 (r= 0. 9992) was obtained.

This enzyme in the presence of hydrogen peroxide catalyses the oxidation of paracetamol to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine which the electrochemical reduction back to paracetamol was obtained at a peak potential of &frac 34; 0. 10 V.

40|$|The {{orbital decay}} curve of a {{satellite}} having constant cross-sectional area and in circular orbit can furnish valuable {{information regarding the}} dynamical state of the atmosphere. It is shown that a <b>rectilinear</b> decay <b>curve</b> having constant downward slope (zero curvature) should indicate that the atmosphere was undergoing compression during that period. A decay curve having concavity upwards (positive curvature) will strongly indicate that the atmosphere was in a contracting phase. A decay curve with downward concavity (negative curvature) may indicate an expanding, a stationary or a contracting atmosphere. This theory, when applied to the orbital decay of the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres (ODERACS) satellites, indicates that {{during the period from}} Day 90 through Day 240 in the year 1994, the atmosphere was very definitely in a compression mode. During this period, ODERACS Sphere 1 faced nearly constant densities while Sphere 6 actually encountered progressively smaller air densities as they descended. The atmospheric scale height as calculated from the orbital data of Spheres 1 and 6 diminished steadily during the same period. It is shown that Spheres 1 and 6 descended faster and slower respectively, than the level of constant air density equal to 5 x 10 kg/m. During a brief period from Day 240 through Day 290, the atmosphere reversed to a strongly expanding mode. Thereafter, the atmosphere reverted back to a compression mode from Day 290 through Day 390, 1994...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVery high spatial {{resolution}} (VHR) images allow to feature man-made {{structures such as}} roads and thus enable their accurate analysis. Geometrical characteristics can be extracted using mathematical morphology. However, the prior choice of a reference shape (structuring element) introduces a shape-bias. This paper presents a new method for extracting roads in Very High Resolution remotely sensed images based on advanced directional morphological operators. The proposed approach introduces the use of Path Openings and Path Closings in order to extract structural pixel information. These morphological operators remain flexible enough to fit <b>rectilinear</b> and slightly <b>curved</b> structures since they do {{not depend on the}} choice of a structural element shape. As a consequence, they outperform standard approaches using rotating rectangular structuring elements. The method consists in building a granulometry chain using Path Openings and Path Closing to construct Morphological Profiles. For each pixel, the Morphological Profile constitutes the feature vector on which our road extraction is based...|$|R

Unfortunately, their deterioration due to traffic causes severely uneven road surfaces, compromising the safety of those who ride on two-wheeled vehicles. The writers have developed a method to quantify the danger level in relation to actual road conditions by creating a mechanical model able to simulate two-wheeled vehicles on road discontinuities. Several combinations of road discontinuities and approach speeds were tested {{in order to determine}} transit safety. These model discontinuities, varying in kind and magnitude, were examined using both <b>rectilinear</b> trajectories and <b>curves.</b> Specific criteria and related thresholds were set up to identify hazardous situations. This method was used on stone element pavements with embedded tram tracks. The level of danger for each condition was thus evaluated using these criteria. Finally, we listed in a table the thresholds for the acceptable pavement discontinuities in order to formulate suggestions for maintenance management and speed limitations...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional {{transmission}} dosimetry in radiotherapy {{has been}} discussed in the literature for some time as being a potential method for in vivo dosimetry. However, it still remains to become a wide spread practice in radiotherapy clinics. This is most likely due to the variety in radiotherapy treatment sites and the challenges they would present in terms of detection and interpretation at the transmitted dose level. Thus, the full potential and limitations of applying transmission dosimetry {{in the presence of}} dosimetry errors still need to be demonstrated. This thesis is a theoretical evaluation of transmission dosimetry using the Pinnacle 3 treatment planning system. The accuracy of predicting reliable and accurate absolute transmitted dose maps using the planning system dose algorithm for comparison with measured transmitted dose maps was initially investigated. The resolution in the dose calculations at the transmitted level was then evaluated for <b>rectilinear</b> and <b>curved</b> homogeneous phantoms and rectilinear inhomogeneous phantoms, followed by studies combining both surface curvature and heterogeneities using anthropomorphic phantoms. In order to perform transmitted dose calculations at clinically relevant beam focus-to-transmitted dose plane distances using clinical patient CT data it was first necessary to extend the CT volume. Finally, the thesis explored the efficacy of applying transmission dosimetry in the clinic by simulating realistic dosimetry errors in the planning system using patient treatment plans for a prostate, head and neck, and breast CRT (Conformal Radiotherapy) treatment. Any differences at the transmitted dose level were interpreted and quantified using the gamma formalism. To determine whether the transmitted dose alone was a sufficient indicator of the dosimetry errors, the magnitude in transmission dose differences were compared with those predicted at the midplane of the patient. Dose-Volume Histograms (DVHs) were also used to evaluate the clinical significance of the dose delivery errors on the target volume and surrounding healthy tissue structures. Thesis (Ph.

30|$|We {{present a}} path {{morphology}} method to separate total rock pore space into matrix, fractures and vugs and derive their pore structure spectrum. Thus, {{we can achieve}} fine pore evaluation in fracture–vug reservoirs based on electric imaging logging data. We automatically identify and extract fracture–vug information from the electric imaging images by adopting a path morphological operator that remains flexible enough to fit <b>rectilinear</b> and slightly <b>curved</b> structures because they are independent of the structuring element shape. The Otsu method was used to extract fracture–vug information from the background noise caused by the matrix. To accommodate the differences in scale and form of the different target regions, including fracture and vug path, operators with different lengths were selected for their recognition and extraction at the corresponding scale. Polynomial and elliptic functions are used to fit the extracted fractures and vugs, respectively, and the fracture–vug parameters are deduced from the fitted edge. Finally, test examples of numerical simulation data and several measured well data have been provided for the verification of the effectiveness and adaptability of the path morphology method {{in the application of}} electric imaging logging data processing. This also provides algorithm support for the fine evaluation of fracture–vug reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|Mosaic {{knitting}} {{can produce}} many beautiful patterns, particularly geometrical or Grecian designs. Historically, mosaic patterns are rather rectilinear, being composed mainly of thin {{horizontal and vertical}} stripes that meet at right angles. However, mosaic knitting has limitations relative to other techniques for producing color patterns in knitting such as Fair-isle knitting. Depending on the pattern, a mosaic-knit fabric may be stiff and tense, due to the many slipped stitches; such fabrics may be better for coats and jackets, which do not require as much drape. The tension in the fabric may also distort the <b>rectilinear</b> lines into <b>curves.</b> These problems may be overcome by judiciously elongating the stitches. Some color patterns may be impossible for mosaic knitting, if they require too many slipped stitches or if the colors do not line up conveniently (as described above). Blocks of solid colors {{can be done in}} mosaic knitting, but require many slipped stitches in a row; hence, blocks of solid colors are usually broken up with stippling, i.e., with regularly spaces spots of the opposing color. On the other hand, mosaic knitting is significantly lighter than Fair-isle knitting, which is nearly twice as thick and bulky. Long horizontal bars of the same color are also more convenient in mosaic knitting than they are in Fair-isle knitting (where such bars require that the other colors be held at the back for long runs).|$|R
