40|$|Biosensors {{based on}} {{nanowire}} {{field effect transistor}} (FET) have received much attention {{in recent years as}} a way to achieve ultra-sensitive and label-free sensing of molecules of biological interest. The BioFET-SIM computer model permits the analysis and interpretation of experimental sensor signals through its web-based interface www. biofetsim. org. The model also allows for redictions of the effects of changes in the experimental setup on the sensor signal. After an introduction to nanowire-based FET biosensors, this chapter reviews the theoretical basis of BioFET-SIM models describing both single and multiple charges on the analyte. Afterwards the usage of the interface and its <b>relative</b> <b>command</b> line version is briefly shown. Finally, possible applications of the BioFET-SIM model are presented. Among the possible uses of the interface, the effects on the predicted signal of pH, buffer ionic strength, analyte concentration, and analyte relative orientation on nanowire surface are illustrated. Wherever possible, a comparison to experimental data available in literature is given, displaying the potential of BioFETSIM for interpreting experimental results...|$|E

In addition, we analyse policies and practices with respect to language support at a multicultural primary school on the basis of observations, interviews, and school documents (the perceived, operational and experiential curriculum).

The disturbance {{forces on the}} chaser and target spacecraft and the thrust forces on the chaser spacecraft are considered in the analysis. The control algorithm developed in this paper uses the relative distance and relative velocity between the target and chaser spacecraft as the inputs. A general formula of reference relative trajectory of the chaser spacecraft to the target spacecraft is developed and applied to four different proximity maneuvers, which are in-track circling, cross-track circling, in-track spiral rendezvous and cross-track spiral rendezvous. The closed-loop differential equations of the proximity relative motion with the control algorithm are derived.

Robust policies and appropriate institutional structures are essential to achieving sustainable development.

Rational policy must seriously consider the use of market-based instruments.

Two levels of task complexity were used, one requiring five inputs (simple) and one requiring 24 inputs (complex).

Results indicate that learning to use a DMI takes longer than learning to use a CLI. No significant difference was observed in time to complete the simple task. However, once a novice learns to use a DMI, a complex task requires less time, fewer errors are made, and references to help screens are required less often. With complex tasks, direct manipulation interfaces appear to help novices to be more productive than do command language interfaces. [URL] United States Navy Reserv...|$|R

String stability {{is a measure}} of how position errors propagate from one vehicle to another in a cascaded system.

A possible solution for meeting performance requirements with such a system is to allow string instability. This paper explores two results of string instability and outlines analysis techniques for string unstable systems. The three analysis techniques presented here are: linear, nonlinear formation performance, and ride quality. The linear technique was developed from a worst-case scenario and could be applied to the design of a string unstable controller. The nonlinear formation performance and ride quality analysis techniques both use nonlinear formation simulation.

40|$|International audienceWhen {{the eyes}} and arm are {{involved}} in a tracking task, the characteristics of each system differ from those observed when they act alone: smooth pursuit (SP) latency decreases from 130 ms in external target tracking tasks to 0 ms in self-moved target tracking tasks. Two models have been proposed to explain this coordination. The common command model suggests that the same command be addressed to the two sensorimotor systems, which are otherwise organized in parallel, while the coordination control model proposes that coordination is due to a mutual exchange of information between the motor systems. In both cases, the interaction should take into account the dynamic differences between the two systems. However, the nature of the adaptation depends on the model. During self-moved target tracking a perturbation was applied to the arm through the use of an electromagnetic brake. A randomized perturbation of the arm increased the arm motor reaction time without affecting SP. In contrast, a constant perturbation produced an adaptation of the coordination control characterized by a decrease in arm latency and an increase in SP latency <b>relative</b> to motor <b>command.</b> This brought the arm-to-SP latency back to 0 ms.

Second, the system {{takes into account the}} <b>relative</b> likelihood of <b>commands</b> being used when making its predictions. Initial testing suggested that a system that only predicted the most frequently used icon choices was better than one that predicted all choices.

These results suggest that a prediction system such as the one described here has the potential to reduce the time and effort required to issue commands. The utility of the system appears to be especially great in laptops and other devices that use trackpads as their primary pointing devices. 1...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundTurning is a {{challenging}} mobility task requiring coordination and postural stability. Optimal turning involves a cranio-caudal sequence (i. e., the head initiates the motion, {{followed by the}} trunk and the pelvis), which {{has been shown to}} be altered in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease as well as in fallers and frails. Previous studies have suggested that the cranio-caudal sequence exhibits a specific signature corresponding to the adopted turn strategy. Currently, the assessment of cranio-caudal sequence is limited to biomechanical labs which use camera-based systems; however, there is a growing trend to assess human kinematics with wearable sensors, such as attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS), which enable recording of raw inertial signals (acceleration and angular velocity) from which the orientation of the platform is estimated. In order to enhance the comprehension of complex processes, such as turning, signal modeling can be performed. AimThe current study investigates the use of a kinematic-based model, the sigma-lognormal model, to characterize the turn cranio-caudal signature as assessed with AHRS. MethodsSixteen asymptomatic adults (mean age[*]=[*] 69. 1 [*]±[*] 7. 5 [*]years old) performed repeated 10 -m Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) with 180 ° turns, at varying speed. Head and trunk kinematics were assessed with AHRS positioned on each segments. Relative orientation of the head to the trunk was then computed for each trial and relative angular velocity profile was derived for the turn phase. Peak relative angle (variable) and relative velocity profiles modeled using a sigma-lognormal approach (variables: Neuromuscular command amplitudes and timing parameters) were used to extract and characterize the cranio-caudal signature of each individual during the turn phase. ResultsThe methodology has shown good ability to reconstruct the cranio-caudal signature (signal-to-noise median of 17. 7). All variables were robust to speed variations (p[*]>[*] 0. 124). Peak <b>relative</b> angle and <b>commanded</b> amplitudes demonstrated moderate to strong reliability (ICC between 0. 640 and 0. 808).
