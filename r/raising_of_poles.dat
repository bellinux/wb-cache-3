25|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Pacific Northwest Coast were of many nations and tribal affiliations, each with distinctive cultural and political identities, but they shared certain beliefs, traditions and practices, such as the centrality of salmon as a resource and spiritual symbol. Their gift-giving feast, potlatch, is a highly complex event where people gather in order to commemorate special events. These events, such as, the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> a Totem <b>pole</b> or the appointment or election of a new chief. The most famous artistic feature of the culture is the Totem <b>pole,</b> with carvings <b>of</b> animals and other characters to commemorate cultural beliefs, legends, and notable events.|$|R

40|$|The Whiskey Rebellion is not {{generally}} {{a major focus}} in constitutional histories or casebooks. Given this fact, {{it is hardly surprising}} that the 1795 case Respublica v. Montgomery seldom figures as more than a minor footnote in scholarly writing about early American constitutional development, if it receives any attention at all. The case has little precedential value for modern First Amendment doctrine and only obliquely implicates larger jurisprudential questions about the rights of assembly and freedom of expression. In strictly doctrinal terms, Montgomery is primarily about the obligation of a justice of the peace to put down a riot, not an extended judicial disquisition on the meaning of early American freedom of association or expression. Montgomery was one of several cases that resulted from popular protest during the Whiskey Rebellion, specifically the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> liberty <b>poles</b> in sympathy with Western opponents of the unpopular tax. Yet, from the perspective of a new constitutional historicism, an approach to the constitutional past that unites elements of a traditional top-down, court-centered narrative and the bottom- up perspective inspired by social history and cultural history, Montgomery is precisely the type of case that can be most illuminating. Indeed Montgomery provides a perfect occasion to engage in a form of historically grounded “constitutional ethnography. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Sons of Liberty, {{a secret}} and {{sometimes}} violent patriot group, formed chapters in New York {{and other cities}} and frightened the royal officials. The [...] "Sons" [...] engaged in a running conflict with British authority in the City over the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> liberty <b>poles</b> in prominent public locations (see Battle of Golden Hill), from {{the repeal of the}} Stamp Act in 1766 until rebel control of the city in 1775. The poles, often when a signal device such as a red cap was placed atop the pole, served as rallying points for public assemblies to protest against the colonial government. The city was the main location of organized political resistance {{in the form of the}} Committee of Sixty and then later the New York Provincial Congress. Though the Sons of Liberty were active in the city and the lead statue of King George III in Bowling Green was torn down and melted into musket balls in a celebration of the Declaration of Independence for the new United States of America, the city however was a hotbed of Royal fervor and probably held a larger proportion of Tories than any other place in the colonies before hostilities - though likely still short of a majority.|$|R
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures <b>of</b> the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> the center <b>pole.</b> The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the application features of traction induction electric motors in transmissions of vehicles. It shows {{that one of}} important stages in their designing is to choose the number <b>of</b> <b>poles.</b> In traction electric drives engines with the <b>raised</b> number <b>of</b> <b>poles</b> without comprehensive assessment of such solution are often applied. The paper investigates dynamic and power characteristics of the multi-polar traction asynchronous engine (TAE) designed and made for using in the individual electric drive of heavy-load wheeled cars. The basic functional elements of the model to simulate the electric drive in Matlab environment with the Simulink and SimPower Systems applications in the structure with vector control are described, and the simulation modeling results of its dynamic mechanical characteristics are provided. It is established that because of increased alternating frequency of currents of the multi-polar engine {{in the range of}} high speeds there is an excessive decrease in the torque and the requirement for constancy of the target capacity, corresponding to the specified traction characteristic is not fulfilled. It is a consequence of the waveform distortion of engine phase current in the range of high speeds because of incapability of the power source to compensate an increasing EMF of movement as the speed continues to grow. The paper studies the influence of increased current frequencies on the additional losses in the engine. The analysis of electromagnetic field penetration depth in the copper conductor of stator winding at high frequency allowed us to establish a significant skin – effect. The quantitative assessment is given to this phenomenon by results of numerical calculation of electromagnetic field distribution in a stator groove. Significant increase in additional losses in the engine is established, and estimates of flow loss extent because of damping actions of eddy currents in the laminated steel of stator at increased frequencies are given. The alternative option of the traction asynchronous engine with the improved characteristics is proved. The attained results can be used to design the traction electric drives of vehicles based on the asynchronous engines. </p...|$|R
