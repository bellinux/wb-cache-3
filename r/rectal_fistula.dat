30|$|Urinary {{retention}} is {{the commonly}} observed complication after brachytherapy for prostate cancer. However, {{the majority of}} cases can be improved by urinary catheterization combined with alpha blockers; only a few require TURP intervention. TURP should be delayed 6 months after brachytherapy to avoid urinary incontinence. One of the patients in our study population who had repeated recurrence of urinary retention underwent TURP, with subsequent symptom improvement. Prostate <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> has a relatively low incidence, lower than 1 %; however, with a difficult intervention, these cases often require fecal and urinary diversion (Elebrezze & Medich 2003). No prostate <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> was observed in our patients because we were conservative about the radiation dose delivered to the prostate area adjacent to the rectum. The reduced local radiation dose might inevitably have led to relatively poorer treatment effect.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} a guideline approach of reconstructive surgery for complex perineal sinus or <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula.</b> METHODS: pre-, per-, and postoperative data of 28 patients undergoing transposition of rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM), gracilis muscle (GM), gluteal thigh flap (GTF), or omentoplasty (OP) for complex perineal sinus or <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> were analyzed. A fistula higher than 10 cm and a sinus with {{a length of}} > 10 cm were treated with TRAM or OP. If < 8 cm, the first choice was GM or GTF. The operative team made choice between 8 and 10 cm. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy was used as adjunct therapy before and after muscle transposition in huge sinus. Success was defined as no residual or recurrent sinus or fistula within 6 months, postoperatively. Long-term complaints of perineum and muscle donor site were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 28 patients (90 %) were treated according to the guideline. VAC therapy was done in six. Three patients died during mean follow up of 40 months (6 - 90). Initial success rate was 61 % (17 / 28). After secondary surgery in seven, four (57 %) were successful. Overall success rate, including VAC therapy, was 79 % (22 / 28). Success was highest with GM and GTF and in small sinus or fistula. CONCLUSION: A guideline approach to complex perineal sinus or fistula based on length or height of the sinus or <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula,</b> respectively, is successful in about 80 % of cases. Large defects may best be downsized by VAC therapy, followed by muscle flap. Long-term complaints are acceptable...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Operative repair for {{complicated}} pouch and <b>rectal</b> <b>fistulas</b> {{is often}} difficult. We present our experience with ten consecutive patients operated on for complicated pouch and <b>rectal</b> <b>fistulas</b> by transposition of the rectus abdominis muscle. METHODS: Ten patients with high and complex pouch and <b>rectal</b> <b>fistulas</b> {{were treated with}} the interposition of a vascularized rectus abdominis muscle flap. Air patients received standard bowel preparation and antibiotics. All were diverted by a temporary ileostomy. RESULTS: Causes of fistulas included Crohn's disease (n = 3), previous rectal surgery (n = 5), anal atresia (n = 1), and sphincter repair (n = I). Three patients had a third recurrence. The procedure was performed in combination with a plastic surgeon. AU fistulas healed. No special postoperative care was required. There were no cosmetic or functional complaints caused by transposition of the rectus abdominis muscle.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH) has implications which affect {{the majority of the}} adult male population. Although benign compared to prostate cancer, clinical symptoms can dramatically alter the quality of life. The hyperplastic tissue can cause constriction of the urethra and thus affect voiding of urine. Factors to consider for thermally-based treatments of the prostate include minimization of thermal injury to the urethra and rectum, and maximal delivery of thermal energy to target tissue. Minimizing temperature rise in the urethra allows for minimal or no anesthesia, and has been shown to reduce postoperative complications. Protection of the rectal wall is imperative since injury can lead to clinical complications as severe as a <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula.</b> Due to its location immediately dorsal to the prostate, the ventral aspect of the rectal wall is susceptible to overheating when a uniform radiating microwave heat source is applied transurethrally to treat the prostate.

However, not {{treating}} the original focus might preclude successful healing due to further spread of the causative microorganisms. Case report: An 80 -year-old woman presented with lumbar spondylodiscitis. She received surgical debridement and stabilization with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and tailored antibiotic therapy after isolation of Enterococcus spp. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient’s condition continued to worsen. An extensive search for the primary infection source finally revealed a <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> caused by a synthetic mesh that had been inserted 7 years before for abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Only after removal of the fistula and protective ileostomy did the patient’s condition improved, allowing successful healing of the spondylodiscitis.

Conclusion: In cases of spondyodiscitis that are resistant to adequate treatment, a search for infection source must be continued until the focus is found and treated.

40|$|One hundred four patients, 80 {{women and}} 24 men, with {{radiation}} injury of the rectum following treatment for gynecologic and urologic malignancy were studied. In 50 patients, the rectal injury was treated surgically; 54 patients were treated conservatively. The {{age and sex}} distributions were the same in each group. In 63 patients, symptoms developed one month to one year after radiotherapy. The longest latent interval was 17 years. Of the 50 surgical patients, 23 had associated small bowel injury. The indications for surgery for the rectal injury were 1) proctitis unresponsive to conservative measures in 14 patients, 2) <b>rectal</b> stricture or <b>fistula</b> or both in 32, and 3) rectosigmoid perforation in four. Forty-one patients had external diversions. Eleven had intestinal continuity restored; six of the 11 had required the stoma for proctitis unresponsive to medical measures.

DISCUSSIONThere are numerous cases presented in the literature on the use of bioglue for anal fistulas and rectovaginal fistulas with multiple cases of success. However, in looking at the literature failure appears to be due to ongoing inflammation from the previous disease process.

On {{the basis of}} the diagnosis of tumor of the bladder and right afunctional kidney, total right nephro-uretero-cystectomy and skin grafting of the left ureter were performed on August 2. The patient continued to have fever of unknown origin postoperatively. Repeat laparotomy, which was performed for <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> on August 25, revealed that the abdominal wall, colon, small intestine and mesenterium adhered to one another, producing a mass and that two sites in the rectum were perforated. A part of the small intestine was excised, the perforated sites were sutured, and an artificial anus was created at the transverse colon. Since the patient had intermittent fever and continued to complain of abdominal pain after creation of the artificial anus, nosotropic therapy was continued. However, the patient died from cardiac insufficiency on October 10. Erosion and ulcer were histologically observed over a wide range in the excised small intestine. In addition there was a defect in one area of the small intestine, penetrating the tunca muscularis propria, in which many cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusion bodies were observed. CMV inclusion bodies were also detected in the bladder with re-examination of specimens from the excised bladder. From these findings, it appears that endogenetic CMV may have been reactivated in the present case...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{evaluated}} the acute and late toxicity after high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with fiducial marker-based position verification for prostate cancer. Between 2001 and 2004, 331 patients {{with prostate cancer}} received 76 Gy in 35 fractions using IMRT combined with fiducial marker-based position verification. The symptoms before treatment (pre-treatment) and weekly during treatment (acute toxicity) were scored using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). The goal was to score late toxicity according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scale with a follow-up time {{of at least three}} years. Twenty-two percent of the patients experienced pre-treatment grade ≥ 2 genitourinary (GU) complaints and 2 % experienced grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. Acute grade 2 GU and GI toxicity occurred in 47 % and 30 %, respectively. Only 3 % of the patients developed acute grade 3 GU and no grade ≥ 3 GI toxicity occurred. After a mean follow-up time of 47 months with a minimum of 31 months for all patients, the incidence of late grade 2 GU and GI toxicity was 21 % and 9 %, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 GU and GI toxicity rates were 4 % and 1 %, respectively, including one patient with a <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> and one patient with a severe hemorrhagic cystitis (both grade 4). In conclusion, high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy with fiducial marker-based position verification is well tolerated. The low grade ≥ 3 toxicity allows further dose escalation if the same dose constraints for the organs at risk will be used. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{describe}} {{the use of}} a temporary spacer to reduce rectal dose prior to prostate radiation in a man with prior pelvic radiotherapy and review the relevant literature. Methods and MaterialsA healthy 57 -year-old man presented with high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score of 8, prostate-specific antigen level [PSA] 12. 6 ng/mL, T 3 a by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), only 2. 5 years after a low anterior resection followed by pelvic chemo-radiotherapy to 50. 4 Gy for a locally advanced rectal cancer. Due to the prior radiation, he was not felt to be a candidate for surgery or external beam radiation, so he chose long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy to 36 Gy in 6 fractions. To reduce the radiation dose to the anterior rectal wall, 10 mL of a polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacer was injected between the prostate and rectum and created between 1. 4 and 1. 5 cm of separation {{along the length of the}} prostate. ResultsTwo randomized trials demonstrating that local therapy plus ADT improves overall survival compared to ADT alone provided the rationale for additional prostate radiotherapy in this otherwise healthy patient. Salvage brachytherapy is associated with a 3. 4 % rate of <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> among the 251 cases reported in the literature from 2000 – 2007, with rates as high as 12 % in one series. The spacer allowed the rectal dose constraint goals to be easily met.

40|$|Abstract: Anorectal atresia, {{which is}} {{classified}} as a low anorectal malformation, is characterised {{by the absence of}} the anal verge and by variable rectal atresia. In some cases, which have been classified as rectal agenesis, the atresia is associated with the absence of the internal sphincter.

We present the case of an adult patient with congenital <b>rectal</b> agenesis, double <b>fistula</b> (cul-de-sac-urethra and cul-de-sac-perineum) and caecostomy since birth. The patient was treated with a resection of sigmoid-rectum for the presence of a 20 -cm faecaloma in the cul-de-sac, with a non-continent pull-through, and with implantation of an artificial bowel sphincter.

40|$|The {{transmural}} inflammation {{characteristic of}} Crohn's disease predisposes patients {{to the formation}} of fistulas. Up to 50 % of patients with Crohn's disease are affected by fistulas, which is a major problem given the considerable morbidity associated with this complication. Appropriate treatment of fistulas requires knowledge of specific pharmacological and surgical therapies. Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms, fistula location, the number and complexity of fistula tracts, and the presence of <b>rectal</b> complications. Internal <b>fistulas,</b> such as ileoileal or ileocecal fistulas, are mostly asymptomatic and do not require intervention. By contrast, perianal fistulas can be painful and abscesses may develop that require surgical drainage with or without seton placement, transient ileostomy, or in severe cases, proctectomy. This Review describes the epidemiology and pathology of fistulizing Crohn's disease. Particular focus is given to external and perianal fistulas, for which treatment options are well established. Available therapeutic options, including novel therapies, are discussed. Wherever possible, practical and evidence-based treatment regimens for Crohn's disease-associated fistulas are provided...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: The {{anorectal}} anomalies {{consist in}} a complex group of birth defects. Laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty improved visualization of the <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> {{and the ability to}} place the pull-through segment within the elevator muscle complex with minimal dissection. There is no consensus on how the fistula should be managed. Aim: To evaluate the laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty and the treatment of the rectal urinary fistula by a bipolar sealing device. Method: It was performed according to the original description by Georgeson 1. Was used 10 mm infraumbilical access portal for 30 º optics. The pneumoperitoneum was established with pressure 8 - 10 cm H 2 O. Two additional trocars of 5 mm were placed on the right and left of the umbilicus. The dissection started on peritoneal reflection using Ligasure(r). With the reduction in the diameter of the distal rectum was identified the fistula to the urinary tract. The location of the new anus was defined by the location of the external anal sphincter muscle complex, using electro muscle stimulator externally. Finally, it was made an anastomosis between the rectum and the new location of the anus. A Foley urethral probe was left for seven days. Results: Seven males were operated, six with rectoprostatic and one with rectovesical fistula. The follow-up period ranged from one to four years. The last two patients operated underwent bipolar sealing of the fistula between the rectum and urethra without sutures or surgical ligation. No evidence of urethral leaks was identified. Conclusion: There are benefits of the laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty for the treatment of anorectal anomaly. The use of a bipolar energy source that seals the rectal urinary fistula has provided a significant decrease in the operating time and made the procedure be more elegant...|$|E
40|$|Focal therapy (FT) is a tissuesparing {{treatment}} {{paradigm for}} localized prostate cancer (PCa) {{with the potential}} to improve functional outcomes while maintaining oncologic safety. This paper aims to provide an overview of important considerations and practical recommendations relating to the follow-up after FT. Literature review of papers related to FT in PCa derived from Medline/Pubmed database. The recommended minimum follow-up period after FT is 5 years. Standard history taking should include: signs of disease progression, treatment-related complications and psychological aspects. Oncological outcome is based on serial prostate specific antigen monitoring, follow-up imaging (most commonly with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging) and repeat biopsies (systematic from entire gland or targeted from treated zone). Significant PCa has been found at biopsy in up to 17 % of patients after FT. Functional outcomes are evaluated using standardized questionnaires that relate to urinary function, erectile function and quality of life. A systematic review reports urinary continence in 83 - 100 % of patients, erections sufficient for penetration in 54 - 100 %. Outcomes differ between ablative energies and treatment templates. The most common side effects after FT are urinary retention (0 - 17 %), urinary tract infection (UTI) (0 - 17 %) and urinary stricture (0 - 5 %). <b>Rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> is a rare complication occurring in up to 0. 1 - 2 % of patients.

40|$|Abstract Crohn's {{disease is}} a chronic illness that may often follow a relapsing-remitting course. Many {{of the factors that}} may be {{associated}} with the spontaneous remission of this disease (i. e. not related to specific treatment) remain to be determined. In the present report, we review the medical history of a patient with a long history of moderate to severe Crohn's whose complete remission immediately followed the development of a febrile infection. The patient first developed symptoms of Crohn's in her late adolescent years. At the time of diagnosis at age 23, she was placed on mesalamine - without effective control her disease symptoms. Due to progressive deterioration, the patient underwent a bowel resection at age 25. Soon afterwards symptoms recurred, gradually increasing in severity. In February 2005, at age 36, the patient developed a painful abscess associated with a <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula.</b> Other symptoms at the time included chronic bone and stomach pain, swollen joints, and debilitating fatigue. Surgical correction was scheduled in mid-March. In late February, the patient developed a respiratory infection associated with fevers of 103 - 104 °F. After the onset of fever, the abscess pain disappeared and this was soon followed by a disappearance of all other disease symptoms. By the time the corrective surgery occurred, she had no Crohn's symptoms. Her remission lasted 10 weeks when the previous symptoms then reappeared. The patient has subsequently used a variety of conventional therapies, but still suffers from severe symptoms of her disease. In recent years, a growing body of literature has emphasized the important role that innate immunity plays in the etiology of Crohn's disease; however, a key component of innate immunity, the febrile response, has been overlooked. Other cases of spontaneous remission following febrile infection in inflammatory bowel disease have been reported. Moreover, induction of a febrile response was in the past used as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, but was later replaced by surgery and corticosteroids. Further exploration of this arm of the innate immune response may provide new opportunities for patients where conventional therapies fail to secure relief. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Concerns {{have been}} raised {{regarding}} the potential risk of mesh complications after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the risk of mesh and nonmesh morbidity after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy and to compare the safety of synthetic meshes with biological grafts. DESIGN: This was a retrospective review. SETTINGS: The study used data collated from prospective pelvic floor databases in 5 centers (3 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Australia, and 1 in Italy). PATIENTS: All of the patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral rectopexy over a 14 -year period (1999 - 2013) at these centers {{were included in the}} study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was mesh morbidity, classified as vaginal erosion, <b>rectal</b> erosion, rectovaginal <b>fistula,</b> or perineal erosion. Secondary outcomes were nonmesh morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 2203 patients underwent surgery; 1764 (80. 1 %) used synthetic mesh and 439 (19. 9 %) used biological grafts. There were 2 postoperative deaths (0. 1 %). Forty-five patients (2. 0 %) had mesh erosion, including 20 vaginal, 17 <b>rectal,</b> 7 rectovaginal <b>fistula,</b> and 1 perineal. Twenty-three patients (51. 1 %) required treatment for minor erosion morbidity (local excision of stitch/exposed mesh), and 18 patients (40. 0 %) were treated for major erosion morbidity (12 laparoscopic mesh removal, 3 mesh removal plus colostomy, and 3 anterior resection). Erosion occurred in 2. 4 % of synthetic meshes and 0. 7 % of biological meshes. The median time to erosion was 23 months. Nonmesh complications occurred in 11. 1 % of patients. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study including patients with minimal follow-up. The study was unable to determine whether patients will develop future erosions, currently have asymptomatic erosions, or have been treated in other institutions for erosions. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is a safe operation. Mesh erosion rates are 2 % and occasionally require resectional surgery that might be reduced by the use of biological graft. An international ventral mesh registry is recommended to monitor mesh problems and to assess whether type of mesh has any impact on functional outcomes or the need for revisional surgery for nonerosion problems...|$|R

Once the perforation occurs and peritonitis results, death is usually inevitable. We describe two cases of <b>rectal</b> perforation and <b>fistula</b> caused by a GE. An 88 -year-old woman presented with a large rectal perforation and a fistula just after receiving a GE. Her case was further complicated by an abscess in the right rectal wall. The second patient was a 78 -year-old woman who suffered from a rectovesical fistula after a GE. In both cases, we performed direct endoscopic abscess lavage with a saline solution and closed the fistula using an over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) procedure. These procedures resulted in dramatic improvement in both patients. Direct endoscopic lavage and OTSC closure are very useful for pararectal abscess lavage and fistula closure, respectively, in elderly patients who are in poor general condition.

40|$|CROHN'S DISEASE IN STOCKHOLM COUNTY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PANORAMA AND ASSOCIATED GALLSTONE DISEASE Annika Lapidus, M. D. Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge University Hospital, SE- 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden Crohn's {{disease is}} a chronic {{inflammatory}} bowel disease of obscure etiology, affecting {{any part of the}} gastrointestinal tract but the ileocaecal region in particular. The annual incidence has gradually been increasing, and the clinical pattern has changed; a shift towards colorectal involvement as well as an increasing number of elderly patients has been observed. Gallstone disease has been a common extraintestinal complication among patients with Crohn's disease, but the true relative risk and the pathogenesis remain unclear. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the epidemiological time trends in Crohn's disease in Stockholm County during a 35 year period between 1955 - 1989, and to evaluate the clinical course of the expanding entity of colorectal Crohn's disease. Furthermore, relative risk and risk factors for developing gallstone disease in patients with Crohn's disease were assessed in patients born 1933 - 1935 and 1953 - 1955. An additional aim, in a separate study, was to investigate what type of gallstones these patients may be prone develop, by examining the bile composition in patients having had ileal resections due to Crohn's disease. The annual incidence of Crohn's disease in Stockholm County increased from 1. 4 to 4. 9 per 100, 000 inhabitants between the 1955 - 1959 and 1985 - 1989 periods, stabilizing at 4. 6 per year during the last two decades. The age specific incidence among those aged 15 - 29 years decreased, whereas the incidence in those aged > 60 years increased. The median age at diagnosis increased from 25 to 32 years. The annual incidence of colorectal Crohn's disease increased from 0. 2 to 1. 6 per 100, 000 inhabitants between 1955 - 1959 and 1985 - 1989. The overall proportion of colorectal Crohn's disease increased from 15 % to 32 % with a corresponding decrease of ileocaecal disease. The frequency of major surgery at first flare-up of colorectal Crohn's disease decreased over time, although the cumulative probability of resection remained unchanged. Half of the patients with colorectal Crohn's disease had at least one surgical resection within ten years from diagnosis and slightly more than half of those patients ultimately received an ileostomy. Patients with left-sided colorectal Crohn's disease were less likely to undergo major surgery, while patients with perianal and <b>rectal</b> <b>fistulas</b> had the highest probability of surgical intervention. A relapse-free course during the initial five years after the first flare-up implied a high probability of remaining in remission. Around 20 % of the patients with colorectal Crohn's disease subsequently developed changes also in the small bowel. Regardless of gender or age, patients with Crohn' s disease had almost twice the prevalence of gallstone disease compared to the general population. The number of previous intestinal resections was the only significant risk factor. Site of disease or type of intestinal resection were not found to be associated with an increased risk for gallstone formation. Short or long ileal resections due to Crohn's disease did not have any major influence on the biliary lipid composition. Nevertheless the cholesterol saturation of bile was significantly lower among the patients than the controls. The bile acid pattern after ileal resection was characterized by a significantly decreased proportion of deoxycholic acid and an increased proportion of ursodeoxycholic acid. Patients having undergone short or long ileal resections due to Crohn's disease had a 50 % higher ratio of bilirubin to bile acids compared with the controls. Patients with Crohn' s disease may therefore develop pigment rather than cholesterol gallstones. It still remains unclear whether the increased prevalence of gallstone disease in patients with Crohn's {{disease is a}}ttributed to secondary morbidity (i. e. surgical management) or Crohn's disease per se. Circumstances at the time of laparotomy, such as use of total parenteral nutrition and/or bowel rest must also be considered in the pathogenesis of gallstone formation in patients with Crohn's disease.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: Between 1987 and 2006, the Radiotherapy {{department}} of the Jean Monnet Hospital in inal (France) {{had a series of}} mistakes leading to overexposure of many patients. We report the second accident identified in March 2007, and describe its consequences, on the 409 affected patients. Materials: In 2000, the radiation therapy team implemented three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 D-CRT) to treat patients with prostate cancer. The quality control of patient repositioning was assessed with daily portal imaging (PI). The "Institut de Radioprotection et de Sretclre" (IRSN) reconstructed doses delivered by those PI after the discovery of the accident and found that each week, 4 sessions were conducted after 2 PI delivering 0. 17 Gy, and one session was conducted after 6 IP delivering 0. 36 Gy. These additional doses were not substracted from the prescribed fraction dose (2 Gy). Between October 2000 and October 2006, 433 patients were treated with 3 D-CRT for prostate cancer. Twenty-four of these patients were victims of the first accident, not described here, due to incorrect use of a treatment planning system, and are reported in another report. Results: For prescribed doses of 70 Gy to 78 Gy, total doses received by 409 patients ranged from 77 Gy to 81 Gy in 35 to 39 fractions, corresponding to 8 % to 10 % overexposure. All these patients were evaluated starting March 2007, and were informed of their irradiation conditions. Of 409 patients, 405 were evaluable for toxicity. A total of 155 patients (38 %) developed Grade 2 late gastrointestinal toxicities with rectal bleeding, and 66 patients (16 %) developed Grade 3 proctitis that was treated with argon plasma coagulation, or required blood transfusions for hematologic support. Two patients developed Grade 4 <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> and died. Of the 409 patients, 72 were irradiated for rising PSA after prostatectomy, 69 of them were evaluable for urinary toxicity. Thirty-six patients (54 %) had Grade 2 permanent urinary incontinence requiring protective padding, and 9 patients (13 %) developed Grade 2 hematuria. Of 330 evaluable patients treated with definitive radiotherapy, 56 (17 %) experienced Grade 2 chronic frequency and urgency, and 35 (11 %) had Grade 2 permanent urinary incontinence. Conclusions: This accident highlights the importance of the dose delivered with the PI controls during 3 D-CRT. Doses given by PI should be integratedin the dose calculation of each session. The complications observed in this cohort emphasize the importance of the dose per fraction (here 2. 17 to 2. 36 Gy) in the genesis of late complications after radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Brachytherapy is {{a common}} {{treatment}} modality used for treating prostate cancer. The radiation is emitted from within the prostate, which focuses the damage on the tumour rather than the surrounding healthy tissue. However, due to the close proximity of the rectum to the prostate, {{there is a possibility}} that the rectum will receive too much radiation dose during prostate treatment. This may lead to post-treatment rectal complications that range in severity from general rectal discomfort and bleeding, to the development of a <b>rectal</b> <b>fistula</b> that may require surgical intervention. Currently, there is no real-time quality assurance tool used to verify that the rectum does not receive too much radiation dose. The Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) at the University of Wollongong, Australia, has developed a new MOSFET dosimeter called the MOSkin with a unique packaging design that should demonstrate some benefits over other MOSFET dosimeters. The MOSkin can potentially serve as a real-time rectal dosimeter for use during a PDR or HDR brachytherapy treatment. The general aim of this research is to characterise the performance of the new MOSkin dosimeter, and to determine whether the unique design of the MOSkin demonstrates dosimetric advantages over other dosimeters for brachytherapy, and in certain other applications. The performance characteristics of the MOSkin were explored by exposing it to a 6 MV x-ray field delivered by a linear accelerator (LINAC), and also with an Ir- 192 PDR brachytherapy source. The MOSkin was irradiated with a 6 MV, 1010 cm 3 photon beam with the gantry set to 100 cm source-to-surface distance, and its dose response was compared to the response of a CC 13 compact ionization chamber, and a couple of fiber optic dosimeters. The fiber optic dosimeters had either a 0. 5 or 1 mm diameter scintillating crystal attached to one end of the optical fiber. The MOSkin’s ability to measure the skin dose to a depth of 0. 07 mm, which corresponds to the nominal depth of the basal cell layer of the epidermis, was compared to Attix chamber and fiber optic dosimeter measurements, along with skin dose measurements reported in other studies found in the literature. My research was primarily concerned with dosimetry at shallow depths in the phantom because it was believed that the MOSkin’s packaging design would prove advantageous over other dosimeters at such depths. With regards to brachytherapy, the dose response of the MOSkin was compared to the response of a RADFET dosimeter within a rectal phantom. Brachytherapy treatment planning systems (TPS) calculate the dose by assuming that the human body is a large, homogeneous water-equivalent material. The effect that a hollow, air-filled rectal cavity has on the anterior rectal dose was investigated by measuring the dose delivered to the inner wall of a rectal phantom while it was empty, and comparing dose measurement to the dose measured within a homogeneous rectal phantom, and the dose calculated by the TPS. The results were also corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations written with the Geant 4 toolkit. The results of an early stage, Phase II clinical trial at St. George Cancer Care Centre are discussed. The MOSkin was used to measure the dose delivered to the anterior wall of the patient’s rectum during PDR brachytherapy patients during treatment, and the results are compared to the dose calculated by the TPS. The results were also compared to the observations made during the phantom study...|$|E

40|$|A b s t r a c t Anorectal malformations (ARMs) {{occur in}} {{approximately}} 1 per 5000 live births. The {{most commonly used}} procedure for repair of high ARMs is posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP). This operation is performed entirely through a perineal approach. The first report of laparoscopically assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) for repair of ARMs was presented by Georgeson in 2000. The aim is presenting early experience with laparoscopically assisted anorectal pull-through technique in boys with high anorectal malformations. In the last 5 years 7 boys (9 months to 2 years old) with high ARMs were operated on using the LAARP technique. Laparoscopically the rectal pouch was exposed down to the urethral fistula, which was clipped and divided. Externally, {{the centre of the}} muscle complex was identified using an electrical stimulator. In the first 4 patients after a midline incision of 2 cm at the planned anoplasty site, a tunnel to the pelvis was created bluntly and dilated with Hegar probes under laparoscopic control. In the last 3 boys a minimal PSARP was done creating a channel into the pelvis. The separated rectum was pulled down and sutured to the perineum. Laparoscopic mobilization of the <b>rectal</b> pouch and <b>fistula</b> division was possible in all cases. There were no intraoperative complications except one ureteral injury. Patients were discharged home on post-operative day 5 to 7. The early results prove that LAARP, an alternative option to PSARP for treatment of imperforate anus, offers many advantages, including excellent visualization of the pelvic anatomical structures, accurate placement of the bowel int...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Posterior {{sagittal}} anorectoplasty (PSAKP) {{was introduced}} in 1982, by Repa and de Vries, as a new surgical procedure for patients with anorectal malformations. It was supposed to provide better chance for normal fecal continence. Meterial and methods Between 1991 and 2000, 50 patients with anorectal abnormalities underwent PSARP. In 43 patients PSARP was primary operation and in 7 it was a secondary procedure. At the time of study patients were not younger than 3, and not older than 13 years. Patients and their parents were interviewed, and fecal continence was graded as follows: voluntary bowel contractions, soiling less than once a week, soiling {{more than once a}} week, daily soiling and constipation. Results Amongst patients who underwent primary surgical correction, 74 % had voluntary bowel contractions. Babies with perineal <b>fistula,</b> <b>rectal</b> atresia and stenosis presented with best results in term of voluntary bowel contractions (100 %), as with vestibular fistula, ten of eleven patients. Only 18 % of patients (atresia without fistula, vestibular fistula and bulbourethral fistula) had soiling. Patients with perineal <b>fistula</b> and <b>rectal</b> atresia and stenosis 40 % were totally continent (voluntary bowel movements without soiling). The most frequent sequel was constipation, which appeared in 48 %, without coincidence with frequency of soiling. The problem of constipation was surprisingly more frequent in patients with expected better prognosis in fecal continence. Conclusion Although PSARP offers a good esthetic result, only two third of patients have voluntary bowel movements and in about half there exists a problem with constipation, with necessary further treatment...|$|R
