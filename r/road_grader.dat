25|$|David Ward King (October 27, 1857 – February 9, 1920) was an American {{farmer and}} {{inventor}} of the King road drag. His invention, which was the horse-drawn forerunner of the modern <b>road</b> <b>grader,</b> had a great influence on American life because his invention improved the widespread dirt roads of his day {{to the extent that}} they could accommodate the advent of the automobile, rural mail delivery and mail order catalogues.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the tooling of a few Holden models and other Utes is uncertain, as was the {{inclusion}} of the MGB which is not seen elsewhere in 'Matchbox' size (Ragan 2000, 56). Two different car trailers and a farm trailer were offered (Ragan 2000, 41, 81). Several of the Midget series including the Road Roller, two different Excavators, and <b>Road</b> <b>Grader</b> were offered in dark green military colors along with a Jeep, Half-track and trailer. Other models were sold in Fire Service gift sets and painted all in red.|$|E
2500|$|Technology {{has long}} since left the horse-drawn King Road Drag far behind. The King Road Drag made {{possible}} {{the use of the}} motor vehicle and, ironically, the motor vehicle doomed the King Road Drag, at least in its horse-drawn form. The motor-powered <b>road</b> <b>grader</b> quickly rendered its horse-drawn predecessor obsolete. However, without the road improvements brought about by the King Road Drag in its day and the subsequent advent of the automobile, American life would be different today in ways that cannot be easily imagined. For instance, how many people living today never would have been born, if bad roads and poor transportation had prevented so much as one set of their ancestors from meeting or even meeting later than they did? With that thought in mind, how many people living in America and elsewhere unsuspectingly owe their very existence to David Ward King and his King Road Drag? ...|$|E

2500|$|Like Model T {{cars and}} trucks, the Fordson tractor {{provided}} {{the basis for}} a large and varied aftermarket in accessories and conversions. A pair of articles in a 1922 issue of the Chilton Tractor Journal describes the business environment and gives photographs of many of the attachments and conversions available. As with most other tractors, farmers and construction contractors could buy aftermarket governors, ignition parts, hitches and drawbars; but with the Fordson especially, one could buy a crawler tractor, <b>road</b> <b>grader,</b> or self-propelled combine built by an aftermarket firm that used the Fordson essentially as a platform. For example, the original Gleaner self-propelled combines were built by attaching the combine to a Fordson. At least 3 companies offered crawler conversions, and others offered enlarged cleats, including the [...] "overgrown tire chain" [...] type that had led to crawler development not long before. Several companies converted Fordsons to road graders; the Wehr (...) is well remembered. [...] The first tricycle cultivator version of the Fordson was available as an aftermarket conversion by the Moline Implement Company as early as 1920 or 1921, [...] which was 3 to 4 years before the Farmall was introduced, a full decade before Dearborn prototyped the Fordson All-Around, [...] and a full decade and a half before Ford Ltd produced that model. It lacked those tractors' high clearance but was otherwise prescient.|$|E

50|$|The archaeological {{techniques}} were hurried {{because of the}} short window of time allowed for the site survey. <b>Road</b> <b>graders</b> were used to remove the upper levels of dirt, and work {{was done in the}} evenings by turning car headlights toward the areas that were worked and examined.|$|R

50|$|It spreads by seed or by resprouting {{from the}} tuber. The seeds float on water and hence may be {{conveyed}} {{far from the}} parent plant. Tubers may be broken up by tractors or <b>road</b> <b>graders</b> and each fragment {{may be able to}} regrow; they can also be difficult to find with removal of plants by hand. Acetosa sagittata may grow and smother other plants it covers.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Tet Offensive, the North Vietnamese showed signs of {{expanding}} and modernizing their logistical effort. The number of supply and maintenance personnel had fallen, mainly due to increased use of motor/river transportation and mechanized construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year that the 559th Group was using 20 bulldozers, 11 <b>road</b> <b>graders,</b> three rock crushers, and two steamrollers for maintenance and new road construction.|$|R
50|$|Gescha {{entered the}} realm of {{diecasting}} zamac around this time. The company began to specialize {{in a variety of}} cast metal heavy equipment vehicles like <b>road</b> <b>graders,</b> front loaders, bulldozers, etc. This began a new trend that exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, the making of sophisticated diecast vehicles as promotional items for heavy equipment manufacturers. Gescha appears to have blazed this trail as a new model toy specialty niche, with the newly established NZG Models close at its heels.|$|R

50|$|Special purpose {{vehicles}} {{were assigned to}} support Mt Hebo AFS. Two 4-wheel drive 40 passenger buses were used primarily for taking children to and from schools in Hebo and Cloverdale. An ambulance was available for emergencies. For winter weather conditions there was an arctic snow weasel with tracks, a towable 100 gallon water tank, a snow blower, 2 snow plows, a front end loader, and a <b>road</b> <b>grader.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Galion Iron Works Company of Galion, Ohio, {{was founded}} by David Charles Boyd and his three {{brothers}} in 1907. In its early years, the Galion name appeared {{on a wide range}} of road-building and other construction equipment, such as drag scrapers, plows, wagons, stone unloaders, rock crushers, and a variety of other [...] "experimental machines". By 1911, Galion had begun production of a light-duty, horse-drawn <b>road</b> <b>grader.</b>|$|E
50|$|Business {{collapsed}} suddenly {{after the}} death of President Noch in 1890 and the financial panic of the early 1890s dried up new orders. The company shut down in June 1891 and was reorganized as the Rome Locomotive and Machine Company. The new company announced its focus would be rebuilding steam machinery and general shop work. Some compressed air locomotives were constructed by the new company but only two new steam locomotives were built after the reorganization, the last in 1911. RL&MC merged into the Rome Manufacturing Company in 1916. Rome Manufacturing built trolley cars, French designed automobiles and a line of heavy construction equipment including <b>road</b> <b>graders</b> and continued rebuilding steam locomotives into the 1920s.|$|R
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven <b>road</b> <b>graders,</b> three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|R
50|$|Roads were {{provided}} and maintained through a committee formed in 1907 by Local Improvement District 15.B.3 around Hanley. The early challenges were the hilly area and creek to the east. Early prairie roads were trails which became so rutted {{that they could}} barely be crossed over. To make roads out of these trails horse drawn blade graders were used to level out hummocks and fill badger holes. Horse drawn slush scrapers filled in sloughs. More advanced fresno scrapers replaced the slush scrapers as they could make longer and wider swaths across the sloughs. By ploughing the prairie soil at the road allowance, and then using <b>road</b> <b>graders</b> to pull in the dirt roads could be made wide enough for the first cars of the area. The rural municipality of Rosedale No. 283 was incorporated December 13, 1909.|$|R
50|$|The bank {{sold the}} land it had {{acquired}} from the estate to William A. Shaw, {{a partner in}} the Shaw-Fear Company. Shaw-Fear was a local real estate development firm, and Mr. M. E. Blanton was a <b>road</b> <b>grader</b> for Shaw-Fear. Blanton purchased the lot where the house stands in 1911, and the next year a 2.5 story home was built on the property along what was Huber Road, today’s 170th Avenue, and what became Blanton Street.|$|E
5000|$|This {{invention}} was {{the horse}} drawn forerunner {{of the modern}} day <b>road</b> <b>grader.</b> It was a sensation in its day. States passed laws requiring its use. The design was so simple that King did not enforce his patent rights. However he did tour the country explaining to how to use it. He also wrote articles such as one {{that appeared in the}} May 7, 1910 issue of the Saturday Evening Post entitled “Good Roads Without Money.” ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the site}} was purchased, plans were quickly {{developed}} for the proposed town. With the help of Army engineers, by August 1950, the combined town site was platted. On September 10, 1950, a ground-breaking ceremony and celebration {{was held at the}} proposed town site. The official ground-breaking was a furrow cut by a county <b>road</b> <b>grader</b> in what was to become Main Street. The first building set up was for the relocation company. They held an auction to sell off lots in what was called New Town.|$|E
5000|$|M. D. Moody was {{established}} in 1913 by Maxey Dell Moody in Jacksonville, Florida {{as part of the}} Cyclone Fence Company of Waukegan, Illinois. Maxey was the only employee in its early years performing all duties as salesman, mechanic and parts manager. The purpose of M. D. Moody was to sell construction equipment to road builders giving an early slogan of the company as [...] "Road Building and Construction Machinery." [...] Lines represented by M. D. Moody in those early years included Adams <b>road</b> <b>graders,</b> Best Manufacturing Company tractors, Hesselman engines, Cummins and P&H cranes. In 1924 M. D. Moody sold 238 P&H Draglines. Also during the 1920s was when M. D. Moody entered the marine equipment business by manufacturing their own marine engines and then with the Waukesha Engine distributorship. During the Great Depression, the company suffered but still managed with 10 employees. In the 1930s, M. D. Moody's marine business expanded with the addition of barges and tugboats.|$|R
5000|$|Avery started {{building}} agricultural trucks in 1910. Early truck manufacturers were uncertain how to market their product {{and whether they}} should just be used to haul goods or should also be useful in the field. Avery described its truck as a 'gasoline farm wagon' and 'general farm power machine' for city, town, and country hauling. Their advertising suggested the farmer could use it to haul livestock, grain, hay, and other loads, as to pull plows, <b>road</b> <b>graders,</b> harrows, discs, binders, and other farm machinery, as well as loaded wagons. The truck weighed 1 ST and featured a four-cylinder engine, open cab and chain drive. Its wheels had wooden spokes and rims, while the steel tires were 1.5 inx5 in wide. [...] Avery figured farmers could get the most use out of the machines during the harvest season. Their tractor trucks included a large belt pulley that could {{be attached to the}} front crank shaft, useful for powering grain separators and other belt-driven machines. Early models had cast steel wheels with holes. Wooden plugs were driven into the holes to provide added traction. When the wooden plugs wore down, the owner simply replaced them with new wooden plugs.|$|R
5000|$|Lonnie Warneke, {{which was}} his baptismal name, was born March 28, 1909, {{the fourth of}} five {{children}} to Louis W. ("Luke") Warneke and Martha Belle Scott Warneke in Owley, Arkansas, six miles south of Mount Ida, the county seat of Montgomery County. Mount Ida had a population of 298 in 1920 and 512 in 1930. Luke Warneke (who stood [...] ) had homesteaded 160 acres and was a successful farmer in the farming community of Owley, which consisted of fifteen families. Montgomery County {{was one of the}} most rural and sparsely populated counties of Arkansas; by 1910 its population had peaked at 12,455. At the time of Lon Warneke's birth the county had no paved roads, no electricity, and no running water. Luke Warneke, from 1907 to 1913, was in charge of improving the county roads and, using the newly acquired <b>road</b> <b>graders</b> drawn by eight mules, he made major improvements to the roads throughout the county, transforming them from dirt trails often overgrown by brush, pocketed by mud holes, and punctured by tree stumps, to passable, graded two-lane (wagon) roads—although still unpaved. Electricity and running water would not come to most of the county until the 1930s.|$|R
