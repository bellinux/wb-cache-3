40|$|My paper links two {{different}} “dispositifs of representation” {{that in recent}} years have problematized the boundaries between cinema and performance. The first is known as “Real Time Film” and was proposed by Big Art Group {{for the first time in}} the <b>work</b> <b>Shelf</b> Life (2001), and then developed in Flicker (2002) and House of No More (2004). The making of Real Time Film involves the positioning of a series of screens that cut the stage horizontally. A certain number of cameras are positioned on the top of the screens, to frame the space behind them. The whole performance on stage that the spectator can only partially see behind between, under, over the screens, is functional to the shooting and the simulation of film language resources, and so to the production of images that are “edited” and screened live. Therefore the Real Time Film involves and, at the same time, rejects both the screen mode and the stage dispositif, as well as their respective viewing regimes. The screens hide the stage, but the “functionality” of these screens is continually interrupted by the actions taking place around the frames: product and production are forced to coexist, and the performative discourse produces an effect of opacity and “hypermediation. ” The space of Real Time Film is marked by plurality, discontinuity (space of the screen, space between/behind/above and below the screens) and heterogeneity (filmic space, stage space). On the contrary, the space proposed by the “Sensitive Environments” of Studio Azzurro appears to be unique, continuous (the video projection expands to fit the scenic space, rejecting the model of the cinematic frame) and homogeneous (the performer interacts with the image without the mediation of visible interfaces). These choices, as opposed to those of Big Art Group, produce an effect of transparency and “immediacy. ” Starting from these ideas, from a crisis of the “frame” through its multiplication or removal, the paper analyzes the ways in which Big Art Group and Studio Azzurro problematize the convergence of theatre and cinema as “dispositifs of representation. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} at 17 Braemar Gardens, West Wickham, Kent, in the United Kingdom (now {{a suburb of}} Greater London). Series art {{director}} Lia Kramer, who had helped create The 1900 House, identified the property and oversaw its restoration. The Tudorbethan house, originally built in 1932 by Bradfield Bros & Murphy, was retrofitted to reflect the technology and fashions of a middle-class English home of the late 1930s. It is a gable-ended, three-bedroom, semi-detached home. A boiler fueled by coke provided hot water, {{and there was no}} telephone or refrigerator. Sold for 875 pounds in 1932, the producers purchased the house for ₤187,000 in 1999. The house was in excellent structural condition, and no major renovations had occurred. Restoration included the removal of central heating and radiators, the custom-fitted kitchen cabinets and appliances, and the carpeting. Removal of the carpeting revealed checkerboard floor tiles. Several fireplaces were restored to working condition, and the original French doors which led outside to the patio were reinstalled. The producers discovered that the house had incurred bomb damage during World War II, and that the owner of the home had suffered a fatal heart attack putting out a fire caused by a bomb in the backyard garden in 1942. The home's original paint was uncovered, and discovered to be bright blues, pinks, and greens. 1940s-era floral wallpaper was purchased and reinstalled in some areas of the home (including the entryway). The house was decorated in a style typical of the 1930s, which included some used Victorian furniture and a small number of Art Deco pieces. The existing beds were replaced by iron bedsteads (including twin beds for Michael and Lyn). When neighbours learned of the project, many donated period home furnishings for free. A 1930s-style gas-fired cooking stove, Belfast sink, draining board, metal-topped table, and fold-down <b>work</b> <b>shelf</b> were installed in the kitchen. The garden was revamped to be typical of a victory garden.|$|R

In experimental part of this <b>work</b> the <b>shelf</b> life of unstabilized beer is being compared with beer stabilized with various standard products, such as PVPP and silica gel. Furthermore, the trials {{have been made to}} prove the functionality of a new product consisting of carrageenan and cross-linked PVPP. The method used to determine shelf life was haze forcing test (0 / 60 °C). Extract, alcohol, bitterness, foam, haze, color and pH were also monitored. The test results showed expectedly that combined treatment of beer ensures the highest level of product stability. Through selective stripping of polyphenols and protein fractions it is possible to improve shelf life of beer to a significant extent...|$|R

Now an annual event each July, 2015 marked the 45th year of the Festival. It is held at the Kapiolani Park Bandstand in Waikiki. [...] It is the largest ukulele festival in the world and brings in thousands of spectators to see free concerts featuring some of the finest ukulele players. In addition there are celebrities, Hawaiian entertainers and an ukulele orchestra composed of more than 800 students from the area. In 1988 Sakuma sought out Lyle Ritz and thirty years after Ritz released his last ukulele album, re-introduced him to his fans in Hawaii. Ritz moved to Hawaii and played at the festival for the next 3 years. Other notable ukulele players that have participated include Israel Kamakawiwoʻole and Jake Shimabukuro.|$|R
