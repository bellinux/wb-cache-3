40|$|This {{contribution}} gives a {{brief overview}} of technical issues for PNNI Augmented Routing (PAR). PAR may {{be thought of as a}} method for bootstrapping and maintaining an overlay for the purpose of <b>running</b> <b>layered</b> routing for IP (and other internetwork level protocols) over ATM. This requires that ATM-attached routers (routers and route servers which have an interface to an ATM subnet) participate in PNNI, and make use of information gained from PNNI to support ATM Forum/ 96 - 0354 2 maintenance of the overlay. This contribution is intended primarily to generate discussion and an initial consideration of issues. Support for other internetwork level protocols (such as Appletalk, APPN/HPR, CLNP, DECnet, IPv 6, and IPX) is for further study. It is felt that progress on PNNI Augmented Routing will be more straightforward if we first define support for one protocol (such as IP) and then consider extensions of PAR to support other internetwork level protocols. ************************************ [...] ...|$|R

After prepping and draping of the left chest a posterolateral thoracotomy is performed. The chest cavity is entered between the fourth and fifth rib (fourth intercostal space) (as in the operation for patent ductus arteriosus or coarctation). After pulling the left lung aside, the layer (mediastinal pleura) above the left arch is incised and the left arch and the ligamentum arteriosum are dissected out and separated from the surrounding structures. The ligamentum is divided and two vascular clamps are placed on the junction of the left arch with the descending aorta. After division the two aortic ends are oversewn with 2 <b>running</b> <b>layers</b> of non-absorbable sutures. The end of the left arch is now further dissected from the mediastinal tissues for relief of any remaining constricting mechanism. The medial surface of the descending aorta and the distal end are also carefully dissected away from the esophagus.

40|$|Zinc-bismuth alloys {{have been}} {{suggested}} as materials for <b>running</b> <b>layers</b> in plain bearings to replace lead alloys, because they are environmentally benign [1]. Zinc-bismuth alloys also have melting points higher than zinc-tin alloys and thus {{are considered to be}} superior to the latter. A major challenge in the electrodeposition of zinc-bismuth alloys is the difference in standard potentials of the two metals of 1. 08 V. Thus very little is known on electroplated zinc-bismuth alloys [2]. Cyclic voltammetry and Hull cell experiments have shown that sole complexation of bismuth with common ligands such as gluconate, tartrate or citrate is insufficient to avoid burnt bismuth deposits. A proper choice of bath additives and pH, however, allows the deposition of zinc-bismuth alloys in a composition range and with a morphology, that is suitable for bearing applications [3]. A rotating Hull cell has been used to study the effect of current density and mass transport on the properties of zinc-bismuth alloys electroplated from electrolytes of various compositions. The local alloy composition and layer thickness measured by X-ray fluorescence have been used to calculate current efficiencies for the electrodeposition. The crystallite size and texture of the alloy layers have been measured by X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the morphology and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays showed the element distribution in the biphasic deposits. The microhardness of various alloy compositions has been measured on cross sections...|$|R
