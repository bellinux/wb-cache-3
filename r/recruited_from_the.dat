5|$|Bembo's {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local area and the nearby Reigate art school. From these drawings, Benton-pantographs were used to machine metal punches to stamp matrices. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{under what}} conditions employers <b>recruit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> long-term unemployed. We know that firms employ long-term unemployed when the labour market tightens sufficiently. This paper explores whether employers <b>recruit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> long-term unemployed when the pool of long-term unemployed becomes more heterogeneous and of higher quality, which occurs in slack labour market conditions. In such conditions the effectiveness of stigma evaporates. We employ a British survey on firms participating in wage subsidy schemes. We find support for our proposition. Employers <b>recruit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> long-term unemployed for progressively more complex jobs when labour market tightness eases...|$|R

5|$|In the 1st century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of auxiliary common soldiers were <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Roman peregrine (second-class citizens). In the Julio-Claudian era, conscription of peregrini seems to have been practiced alongside voluntary recruitment, probably {{in the form of a}} fixed proportion of men reaching military age in each tribe being drafted. From the Flavian era onwards, the auxilia were an all-volunteer force. Although recruits as young as 14 are recorded, the majority of recruits (66%) were from the 18–23 age group.|$|E

5|$|Bayern {{considers}} {{itself a}} national club. The club had 3,202 fanclubs with total 231,197 members in 2012, {{making it the}} club with {{the largest number of}} organised supporters in Germany. Owing partly to the club having supporters all over the country, all of Bayern's away games have been sold out in recent years. Their following is mainly <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aspiring middle class and regional Bavaria. Despite a large proportion of their supporters having to travel more than 200km (ca. 120 miles) regularly, the club's home matches in the Allianz Arena have almost always been sold out. According to a study by Sport+Markt Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, and the most popular football club in Germany with 10 million supporters.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Virtually every town or city erected some form of memorial to commemorate their dead. During the war, only London provided more recruits to the British Army than Manchester. The Manchester Regiment and the Lancashire Fusiliers, which largely <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city and towns to the north, were swollen by pals battalions drawn from local employers, social groups, and neighbourhoods. By the end of the war, over 13,000 men of the Manchester Regiment, including more than 4,000 from the pals battalions and 13,600 Lancashire Fusiliers, had been killed. An estimated 22,000 Mancunians died and 55,000 were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Most border {{units were}} based in forts as were their predecessors, the legions and {{auxiliary}} {{units of the}} Principate; {{in many cases they}} were based in the same forts. Some of the larger limitanei units (legiones and vexillationes) were based in cities, probably in permanent barracks. Because units of limitanei operated in one area, had their own camps, and often <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same area, they tended to maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.|$|E

A classical cellist, Ann Sheldon, was <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Royal College of Music. Lastly, the seasoned pop backing vocal team of Flo & Eddie were called by Rundgren to round out many of the songs. The instrumentalists had all been accepted by the band willingly, even enthusiastically – the backing vocalists, however, were another matter.|$|E
