40|$|Methoxyflurane {{has been}} used to provide {{analgesia}} for burns dressings on sixty occasions in eleven patients. It was administered by way of a new, disposable vaporizer, the Analgizer, which is described. Three patients required either supplementary analgesics or tranquillizers. No side effects were noted, and patient acceptance of the Analgizer was good. This method is thought to represent an advance over previous methods of analgesia for burns dressings, since there is no undue sedation, pre-operative starvation is unnecessary, and venepunctures are avoided. This paper describes our experiences using a disposable methoxyflurane dispenser to provide analgesia during repeated burns dressings. This dispenser is known by the trade name of Analgizer (Abbott). * The provision of analgesia for burns dressings is difficult, since frequent, often daily, dressings are necessary.

40|$|Abstract: The {{infiltration}} of neutrophils into injured tissue {{is known to}} protect wounds from invading pathogens. However, more recent studies suggest that neutrophils might inhibit the wound repair process. To investigate the role of neutrophils in wounds, mice were neutrophil-depleted by injection with rabbit anti-mouse neutrophil serum. Remarkably, epidermal healing, measured by wound closure, proceeded significantly faster in neutropenic than control mice (77. 7 � 14. 2 % vs. 41. 2 � 0. 9 %, P< 0. 02 at day 2). Dermal healing was not affected by neutrophil depletion, as neither collagen deposition nor wound-breaking strength was significantly different between neutropenic and control mice. As the delayed repair of diabetic individuals exhibits robust inflammation, the effect of neutrophil depletion on diabetic wound healing was investigated. Similar to the observations in wild-type mice, wound closure was accelerated by nearly 50 % in neutropenic, diabetic mice. The results suggest that although neutrophils may provide protection against infection, they may <b>retar...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} the pertinent issue of insecurity in Nigeria and its implication for socio-economic development. Available {{data on the}} level and dimensions of insecurity in Nigeria reveals an increase over time, which constitutes serious threat to lives and properties, hinders business activities and discourages local and foreign investors, all which stifles and <b>retar</b> ds Nigeria‟s socio-economic development. This rising wave of insecurity has not abated but has assumed a dangerous dimension which is threatening the corporate existence {{of the country as}} one geographical entity. In the light of the above the paper recommends that government must be proactive in dealing with security issues and threats, through modern methods of intelligence gathering, and sharing among security personnel, training, logistics, motivation, and deploying advanced technology in managing security challenges. The real solution lies in government accelerating the pace of economic development through creating an economy with r elevant social, economic and physical infrastructure to support business and industrial growth...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{dealt with}} the effects of nine kinds of silicon {{additives}} on flame retardancy of ethyl-ene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) /magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH) 2] composites, as well as mechanical properties. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) test, horizontal fire test, vertical fire test, and cone calorimeter test were employed to evaluate flame retardancy of the composites. It was found that different silicon additives had different synergistic ef-fects with Mg(OH) 2 on flame retardancy of the EVA matrix and exerted different influences on mechanical properties of the composites. The incorporation of organic montmorillon-ite (MMT) clay or silicone rubber not only made the com-posite reach FH- 1 rating in the horizontal fire test and FV- 1 rating in the vertical fire test, respectively, but also dramat-ically reduced the peak rate of heat release (Peak RHR) and increased the fire performance index (FPI) and ignition time (IT). The composites filled with precipitated SiO 2 exhibited the longest IT, the highest FPI, and FV- 1 rating.

40|$|Screening newborns for {{phenylketonuria}} (PKU) is a m andatory practice {{based on}} m easuring a raised blood phenylalanine level. Many factors influence {{the rate of}} blood phenylalanine rise {{so that there are}} many pit falls in detecting the 1 : 10, 000 affected infant. About one percent of all babies tested proves to be “false positives. ” Two-thirds of those with per sistent hyperphenylalaninem ia prove to have classic PKU. Non-classic PKU with less intense, persistent hyperphenylalaninemia is due to differ en t alterations in the enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase. Additionally, about one percent of the confirmed positive patients is due to either a defect in the synthesis or regeneration of the cofactor, tetrahydrobiop-terin; these latter forms are not amenable to treatm ent with the low phe nylalanine diet. Screening programs have developed directives regarding the timing and conditions for obtaining the specimens for testing. Specific confirmatory tests of those with positive results must be performed.

40|$|Abstract Runtime {{enforcement}} {{is a powerful}} technique {{to ensure that a}} running system satisfies some desired properties. Using an enforcement monitor, an (untrustworthy) input execution (in the form of a sequence of events) is modified into an output sequence that complies with a property. Over the last decade, runtime enforcement has been mainly studied in the context of untimed properties. This paper deals with runtime enforcement of timed properties by revisiting the founda-tions of runtime enforcement when time between events matters. We propose a new enforce-ment paradigm where enforcement mechanisms are time retardants: to produce a correct output sequence, additional delays are introduced between the events of the input sequence. We consider runtime enforcement of any regular timed property defined by a timed automa-ton. We prove the correctness of enforcement mechanisms and prove that they enjoy two usually expected features, revisited here in the context of timed properties. The first one is soundness meaning that the output sequences (eventually) satisfy the required property. The second one is transparency, meaning that input sequences are modified in a minimal way. We also introduce two new features, i) physical constraints that describe how a time <b>retar...</b>|$|R
40|$|Myotonia dystrophica is a {{hereditary}} disease which may present serious {{problems for the}} anaesthetist. It is characterized mainly by myo-tonia and muscular wasting (Miller and Lee, 1981). Myotonia may be provoked by suxa-methonium, neostigmine, hypothermia, shivering or hyperkalaemia, and may render ventilation difficult and trachea! intubation impossible. Patients are sensitive to barbiturates, opioids, benzodiazepines and volatile agents, all of which may cause apnoea when administered in small doses. These and other anaesthetic problems have been reviewed by Aldridge (1985). We present a patient suffering {{from all of the}} typical signs and symptoms of the disease, who was successfully managed while undergoing an urgent partial gastrectomy. CASE REPORT The patient was a 50 -yr-old woman. Her mother had died 10 years earlier following the adminis-tration of suxamethonium for an orthopaedic operation; her aunt had suffered from myotonia, but her father and brother are fit and well. At the age of 10 yr the patient underwent an uneventful tonsillectomy. The first symptoms of myotonia dystrophica appeared at the age of 20 yr, with dysarthria, atrophy of the extremities and myotonia in both hands. The patient also complained of difficulties with mastication and in lifting her head while supine. She later developed frontal baldness, inexpressive fades, mental <b>retar...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the size and}} parental origin of the deletion in individuals with 18 p syndrome. Methods: Molecular and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} analyses of the pericentromeric region of chromosome 18 were performed on genomic DNA and chromosomes from study participants. Results: The majority of the breakpoints were located between markers D 18 S 852 on 18 p and D 18 S 1149 on 18 q, a distance of approximately 4 Mb. The parental origin of these deletions appears to be equally distributed, half maternally derived and half paternally derived. Conclusion: The distributions of both the size and parental origin of the 18 p deletions support the presence of a breakpoint cluster in the 18 p syndrome. Genet Med 2002 : 4 (1) : 15 – 19. Key Words: 18 p syndrome, breakpoint cluster, aneusomy, parental origin, deletion When it was first described in 1963, the 18 p syndrome was the only autosomal deletion syndrome then known to be com-patible with long-term survival. 1 Reported clinical features in-clude speech delay, growth hormone deficiency, 2 cardiac anomalies, 3 ptosis, and holoprosencephaly. 4 Mental retarda-tion has also been associated with this syndrome, but this phe-notype has wide variation, ranging from severe mental <b>retar...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} coordinated mass {{dissemination}} of information about asset fundamentals should make asset markets less prone to bubbles. The key idea {{is to establish a}} centralized and popular information source to make key information common knowledge across as many market participants as possible. This realistic, micro-level anti-bubble policy faces fewer challenges than monetary policy and macro-prudential tools. It is common for asset price bubbles to precede financial crises and depressions. Indeed, a real estate bubble {{lies at the heart of}} the recent U. S. financial crisis and the ensuing economic slump. Typical anti-bubble policy responses include both tightening monetary policy and deploying macro-prudential tools, such as raising capital requirements, imposing transaction costs, and applying direct lending constraints. However, effective application of such policy responses faces two difficulties. First, timely deployment of monetary policy and macro-prudential tools poses the significant difficulty of recognizing an inflating bubble in real time. Most bubbles are only recognized (with sufficient degree of certainty to justify policy action) in hindsight or when it is too late to prevent damage. Second, commonly-proposed monetary and macro-prudential anti-bubble measures can create negative effects on regions or markets without bubbles. For example, the very policies that help to fend off a real-estate bubble in overheating regions may <b>retar...</b>|$|R

Grain yield and its components were discussed. The source of results was field experiment carried out at the Experimental Station „Baácyny Sp. z o. o. ” near Ostróda, under favourable weather conditions for winter barley in the years 2006 - 2008. 35 - 2 (IV) fractional design was applied in two replications with 27 combinations in each one, in which at the same time 5 factors were tested (A, B, C, D, E) on three levels (0, 1, 2). Very high, though diversified in years, yield of winter barley cv Corbie was confirmed on the soil of the good wheat complex. During studies, the plants of this cultivar overwintered well, to a slight degree they lodged, and their infection with fungal diseases was low. Relationship between the yield and technological level was smaller than assumed in the working hypothesis. The highest grain yield was obtained from barley which was sown earliest (September 9 - 11 th), at a rate of 450 grains·m- 2 with spring N fertilization at a rate of 60 kg N·ha- 1.
