40|$|Roads, {{particularly}} {{since the advent of}} motorized traffic, have hugely impacted contemporary landscapes. Although their significance was noted in the 1980 s, specific roadway-heritage studies are scarce. Research in different disciplines has identified certain features of roads, but an integrated approach to roadway heritage or a consensus on what this constitutes are lacking. This article proposes an interdisciplinary methodology to assess roadway heritage. Roadways are interpreted within the framework of semantic openness that currently characterizes heritage studies, territory being the basic element of interpretation. Rather than a fragmented approach to conservation, the research defines integrated heritage configurations where natural, cultural, and historical features combine to produce a cohesive form of heritage.

40|$|Many {{transportation}} {{agencies are}} currently involved in computerizing {{large quantities of}} gee-based data that have been traditionally relegated to filing systems. The advantages of such computerization include quicker access, more easily understood presentations that result in better interpretations, improved updating capabilities, and a more centralized and controllable source of information. The overwhelming disadvantage of such computerization is the cost encountered during the initial acquisition and coding of relevant gee-based data. The bulk of these costs arise from the task of attaching x and y coordinates to traditional data. The sheer magnitude of these costs is the probable reason that many transportation agencies have waited so long to begin computerization. Given the costs involved in computerization, {{it is imperative that}} comprehensive, efficient, and versatile data structures be used, else the agency will periodically need to incur considerable expense to overcome deficiencies in the data structure design. The objective {{of this article is to}} present an overall framework for designing comprehensive data structures that are suitable for <b>roadway</b> <b>information</b> systems. This framework is based on the findings of an ongoing research project at the Pennsylvania State University. Results from this project will be used to illustrate important points concerning the overall structure of roadway gee-based data systems.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{examples of}} road signage and billboard advertising along the M 1 Motorway between the Gold Coast and Brisbane from a pragmatic visual communication perspective. Such a perspective requires that two studies be conducted simultaneously. One study examines how people use designs {{while the other}} examines how features of designs meet people’s needs. For this research, the first study consisted of a literature review aimed at determining how people use road signage and advertising. Results indicate that drivers attend to signs differently depending upon personal variables such as driving experience, environmental variables such as traffic density, and sign variables such as the message and visual design. The {{second part of the}} research involved comparing all types of signs along the M 1 to best practice in the visual design of <b>roadway</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper, designs that follow best practice were considered to be those that follow principles of positive guidance. As part of this research, the author took photographs of signs in August and September 2008. Results indicate that research could be conducted on a few types of sign designs. For road signage, {{it would be useful to}} study the effectiveness of educational messages placed on variable message signs and whether M 1 drivers would find it helpful to have graphics placed on these signs. It would also be useful to study the use of more mixed-case text and the Clearview font on signs, and the effectiveness of tourist signs. Further, it may be useful to develop a more detailed taxonomy of driver types on which to test signs. For advertisements, it would be helpful to provide additional guidance to billboard designers on making messages more effective and appealing, and to test what creates distracting content. This paper should be useful to traffic engineers, and teachers and students of <b>roadway</b> <b>information</b> design who would like to increase their knowledge of signage design and design research...|$|E

The goal of this thesis is to analyze a sample set of 18 design exceptions taken from a total of 467 design exceptions approved in Georgia from 1995 – 2012. Crash data were obtained at the locations {{of each of these}} design exceptions three years before the let date and three years after the construction end date. To compensate for causal factors other than the design exception on the <b>roadway,</b> similar <b>information</b> from a range of control sites were also obtained. These control sites consisted of projects without design exceptions that occurred within the same time constraints as the design exception projects, were of the same work type, and were either located on the same route or within the same district. The potential safety impacts of the design exceptions were evaluated by comparing the before and after crash rates of projects before and after crash rates at these control sites Based on these data, no statistically significant relationship between the existence of a design exception and crash rates was identified. The sample set in this study was too small and the number of crashes found at both projects with design exceptions and control sites without design exceptions was too low to perform a significant Empirical Bayesian (EB) analysis.

The {{goals of}} the project are to study the feasibility of using advanced technology from other industries to improve he efficiency and safety of winter highway maintenance vehicle operations, and to provide travelers {{with the level of}} service defined by policy during the winter season at the least cost to the taxpayers. The results of {{the first phase of the}} research were documented in the Concept Highway Maintenance Vehicle Final Report: Phase One dated April 1997, which describes the desirable functions of a concept maintenance vehicle and evaluates its feasibility. Phase I concluded by establishing the technologies that would be assembled and tested on the prototype vehicles in Phase II.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how data from several Iowa information management systems {{were used to}} analyze the mobility and safety impacts of winter storm events. Roadway and weather data were acquired from the <b>roadway</b> weather <b>information</b> system (RWIS), hourly traffic volumes from automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), and crash information from the accident location and analysis system (ALAS). Daily snowfalls were acquired from state and national agencies. Storm and non-storm data for seven interstate roadway segments were considered. Only winter storm events with a duration of four or more hours and a snowfall of 0. 51 centimeters per hour (0. 20 inches per hour) or more were evaluated. Analysis of the data revealed the impacts of winter weather on freeway traffic. Winter storm events decrease traffic volumes, but the impact is highly variable. The average winter storm volume reduction was approximately 29 percent, but ranged from approximately 16 to 47 percent. A positive relationship was found between percent volume reduction, total snowfall, and the square of maximum gust wind speed. Crash rates also significantly increase during winter storm events, possibly the result of a large decrease in traffic volumes and higher crash reporting rates during winter weather. After controlling for exposure, an increase in snowfall intensity and snowstorm duration also increased winter storm event crash frequency. The results of this research can help determine the potential impacts of winter weather, support the eventual development of a dynamic winter weather driveability level of service system, and assist with planning preventive and emergency operations. Key words: winter weather, mobility, safety, volume...|$|R

This project presents an alternative tool that will supplement local decision making but maintain a full appreciation of the complexity and sophistication of today’s regional model and local traffic impact study methodologies. This alternative method is tailored to the desires of local agencies, which requested a better, faster, and easier way to evaluate land uses and their impact on future traffic demands at the sub-area or project corridor levels. A particular emphasis was placed on scenario planning for currently undeveloped areas. The scenario planning tool was developed using actual land use and <b>roadway</b> <b>information</b> for the communities of Johnston and West Des Moines, Iowa. Both communities used the output from this process to make regular decisions regarding infrastructure investment, design, and land use planning. The City of Johnston case study included forecasting future traffic for the western portion of the city within a 2, 600 -acre area, which included 42 intersections. The City of West Des Moines case study included forecasting future traffic for the city’s western growth area covering over 30, 000 acres and 331 intersections. Both studies included forecasting a. m. and p. m. peak-hour traffic volumes based upon a variety of different land use scenarios.

In this study, we create an attention switching model that accounts for both subtask boundaries and uncertainty, and use Approximate Bayesian Computation-Markov Chain Monte Carlo (ABCMCMC) to determine the weight between the two factors, based on the empirical data. The weight was calculated for each of two different types of tasks, text reading and entry, that have subtask boundaries with different characteristics. We found that the subtask boundary in the text reading task nudged drivers to discontinue the distracting task and switch attention back to the road more than the subtask boundary in the text entry task.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} various {{factors that contribute}} to the severity of work zone crashes. However, little has been done on the specific effects of light conditions. Using the data from the Enhanced Tennessee <b>Roadway</b> <b>Information</b> Management System (E-TRIMS), crashes that occurred in the Tennessee work zones during 2003 – 2015 are categorized into three light conditions: daylight, dark-lighted, and dark-not-lighted. One commonly used decision tree method—Classification and Regression Trees (CART) —is adopted to investigate the factors contributing to crash severity in highway work zones under these light conditions. The outcomes from the three decision trees with differing light conditions show significant differences in the ranking and importance of the factors considered in the study, thereby indicating the necessity of examining traffic crashes according to light conditions. By separately considering the crash characteristics under different light conditions, some new findings are obtained from this study. The study shows that {{an increase in the number}} of lanes increases the crash severity level in work zones during the day while decreasing the severity at night. Similarly, drugs and alcohol are found to increase the severity level significantly under the dark-not-lighted condition, while they have a limited influence under daylight and dark-lighted conditions...|$|E
40|$|Limited access facilities, such as freeways and expressways, are {{generally}} designed {{to the highest}} standards among public roads. Consequently, these facilities demonstrate crash, injury, and fatality rates that are significantly lower than other road facility types. However, these rates {{are generally}} elevated {{in the immediate vicinity}} of interchanges due to increases in traffic conflicts precipitated by weaving, merging, and diverging traffic. Given the extensive costs involved in interchange construction, it is important to discern the expected operational and safety impacts of various design alternatives. To this end, the objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the safety performance within the functional areas of interchanges. The study involves the integration of traffic crash, volume, and <b>roadway</b> geometric <b>information</b> using data from 2010 to 2014 from the state of Iowa in order to assess the relationships between these factors and frequency of crashes within the interchange functional area. Separate analyses were conducted for the freeway mainline and ramp connections. Safety performance functions (SPFs) were estimated for the interchange mainline and ramps using negative binomial regression models, and random effects models were estimated to account correlation in crash counts at the same location over time. The results from this study suggest that speed limit and interchange configuration have a significant impact on crash rates. Lower ramp advisory speeds (10 mph to 35 mph) were associated with fewer crashes on-ramps. Off-ramps were also associated with elevated crash risk in comparison to on-ramps and freeway-to-freeway ramps. Comparison SPF models were also developed using Iowa-specific data to relate the outcomes of these simple SPFs with Florida-specific SPFs and the national default SafetyAnalyst SPFs with varying results...|$|R

The active safetysystems on-board a vehicle, such as collision avoidance systems, help the driver de-tect and defuse oncoming potential crash situations. They have received signi¯cantattention recently. Wireless communication and estimation are critical componentsof an active safety system enabling {{the vehicle to}} be aware of surrounding vehiclesand the <b>roadway.</b> The <b>information</b> provided by the communication and estimationsystems can be used by vehicle control systems such as Cooperative Adaptive CruiseControl (CACC) or driver assistance/warning systems. This thesis makes advances in three areas | a bene¯t analysis of vehicle-vehiclecommunication-aided CACC system in highway tra±c, the design of Medium AccessControl (MAC) protocols for vehicle safety messaging over Dedicated Short RangeCommunication (DSRC), and the real-time estimation of a Markov process over anoisy digital communication channel. We compare the in°uence of adaptive cruise control (ACC) and CACC systems onhighway tra±c behaviors. The main di®erence between the CACC systems and theACC systems is that CACC systems have vehicles interact by exchanging informationthrough communication. Communication is shown to decrease braking e®ort, increaseaverage velocity, reduce congestion, and smooth shock waves. The positive resultsmotivate us to design e±cient communication and estimation systems for vehicleactive safety system. We next study the design of MAC protocols for vehicles to send safety messages toeach other. The target is to send vehicle safety messages with high reliability and lowdelay. We propose and analyze several random access MAC protocols. The protocolsare compatible with the national DSRC multi-channel architecture. Both analyti-cal and simulation results show our approach is feasible for vehicle safety messagesin DSRC. Our best protocol outperforms the popular standard IEEE 802. 11 MACprotocol. Finally, we study the real-time estimation of a Markov process over a memorylessnoisy digital communication channel. The problem could model a vehicle estimating 3 in real time the position, relative velocity, and direction of neighboring vehicles usingthe information obtained by wireless communication.

He first requested that the participants share their cooking methods and ingredients. He then explored what was available in their community gardens and sold on the <b>roadways.</b> With this <b>information</b> he was able to increase the nutrition and diversity of their meals. Measuring tools were ignored. Participants were encouraged to use their intuition and trust their eyes and taste when creating meals. Almost half of children in the rural areas of the Sikasso region, 42%, show delayed growth (Malian Demographic and Health survey: EDSM-V 2012-2013). Benedicto built the capacity of men, women, and youth to prepare and appreciate more diverse food choices, such as the highly nutritious moringa tree leaf, papaya, sweet potatoes, and spices, along with the addition of protein from fresh milk, eggs, chicken, and fish from the local river. The village chief, Mr. Djeka Mariko, praised the results: “Benedicto you are a blessing…, by coming so far and training all of us on the importance of using our foods as our medicine to maintain health.” ...|$|R
40|$|Always seeking {{creative}} avenues {{to promote}} physical activity, the Williamson County & Cities Health District (WCCHD) utilized GIS technology {{to measure the}} safety of bikeable roads and created both a paper and web-based bicycle map. The presentation covers the goals for the project, design and implementation plans, and details on how the map was built using ArcView 3. 2 and ARCIMS 3. 1. The WCCHD is the local health department for a county of 250, 000 residents in Central Texas. Attendees will learn how to duplicate this project with limited in-house resources. Summary Are you responsible for promoting physical activity for your organization? If so, this presentation is for you! The development of the Williamson County Bicycle Map demonstrates a creative and practical application of how GIS technology {{can be used to}} promote physical activity for a county population. For this project, staff utilized a set of criteria, developed by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, to physically evaluate county road conditions and calculate a suitability, or ease of use, score for roadways. With this data project staff developed a bicycle map for the county (available in print or on the web) that provides <b>roadway</b> <b>information</b> to bicyclists. The criteria {{can also be used to}} identify gaps in bicycle route networks and to plan bicycle improvements for roadways. The information, although created for Texas, is general enough to be used by any state. Also, learn from our experience how this bicycle map project led to new opportunities for partnerships and projects that have helped fund and market the map. Background The Williamson County & Cities Health District (WCCHD), located in central Texas, is the local public health department for a county of almost 300, 000 residents over 1, 124. 3 square miles. While WCCHD provides many traditional public health services to residents, they are also responsible for promoting healthy living and healthy communities...|$|E
