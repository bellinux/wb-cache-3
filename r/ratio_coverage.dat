5000|$|Powering the new Subaru Impreza is {{a revised}} version of the FB20 2.0 litre direct-injection boxer-four. This engine is sold in all markets except Europe. A 1.6 litre engine {{continues}} to be available in Europe and in the Japanese domestic market. With around 80% of parts revamped, the engine produces 152 hp, four more than before. Subaru's Lineartronic CVT was also improved with enhanced <b>ratio</b> <b>coverage,</b> and a 5-speed manual transmission continues to be available. The changes made to the Impreza's 2.0L engine are supposed to offer slightly improved acceleration and flexibility of power delivery. Although the engine is 152 hp, some auto reviewers feel that the new Impreza continues to fall short in power when compared to competitors from other brands. Some competing compact sedans such as the Volkswagen Jetta, Honda Civic, and Hyundai Elantra are sold with optional engines offering 200 hp or more. As with the previous generation, the WRX remains a separate model. The WRX was redesigned for 2014, so the move to a Subaru Global Platform-based WRX is not expected until the 2020 model year. Subaru has rated the new Impreza in the US market [...] (with 2.0L engine) an EPA-estimated 28 mpg city (10 L/100 km)/38 mpg (7.4 L/100 km) highway. As with the previous generation Impreza, Subaru's Symmetrical AWD is standard in all markets except Japan, where it is optional.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) of split-power design consists of a variator and an arrangement of planetary gears. A black box model describing such transmissions is presented. The model {{can be used for}} synthesis as well as loss-free analysis of split-power CVT concepts in general. The planetary gear arrangement may have an arbitrary number of shafts. It is described by a sufficient number of basic speed ratios. By using several modes, both a large overall speed ratio range and low variator power ratios can be obtained. This is necessary for optimal engine use and high transmission efficiency. In each mode, specific components are active in the transmission. The black box model includes two modes, but CVT concepts with an arbitrary number of modes can be described by combining matching two-mode CVTs. General conditions for performing mode shifts are presented. A general relationship between overall speed ratio and variator speed ratio has been derived, as well as a general relationship for variator power ratios of loss-free transmissions. Different variator types are categorized by their <b>ratio</b> <b>coverage.</b> Possible combinations of variator power ratio, overall <b>ratio</b> <b>coverage</b> and variator <b>ratio</b> <b>coverage</b> are mapped and presented graphically for different configurations. Suitable combinations of these quantities can be chosen. Design parameters included will then indicate how the CVT should be designed. On the basis of the black box model, two split-power CVT concepts for automotive use are proposed. Each of the transmissions, having a geared neutral, is an infinitely variable transmission (IVT). They do not need such devices as starting clutches or hydrodynamic torque converters. They are designed for use in front wheel drive cars with transversely mounted engines. The main components of the first IVT are a traction ball drive variator, a simple epicyclic gear train with three shafts and some gear stages. The transmission can be run in three modes, including a separate mode for reverse. The second IVT consists of a hydrostatic variator, two simple epicyclic gear trains with three shafts and a few gear stages. It can be run in two modes. Reverse drive is included in one of the modes. Losses in gear meshes and variators are estimated. Hereby, constant component efficiencies are used, as well as efficiencies calculated taking load and speed dependence of the losses into consideration...|$|E

While batteries and supercapacitors store energy in the form of electric energy, the flywheel (FW) is the only device that keeps the energy stored in the original form of mechanical energy the same as the moving vehicle. The flywheel needs to be coupled to the driveshaft of the vehicle in a manner which allows it to vary its speed independently of the moving vehicle in order to vary its energy content.

The common mechanical variators used in automotive applications, namely the rolling traction drives and the belt drives, have the disadvantage that their speed ratio range defined as the maximum to minimum speed ratio is generally not sufficient for flywheel energy storage system (FESS).

50|$|The footage {{which can}} be built-upon is {{regulated}} according to a system involving two figures: building <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> (kenpeiritsu) and floor area <b>ratio</b> (yōsekiritsu). Building <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio of the}} building footprint compared to the total area of the land. These two figures are often listed in advertisements for plots of land such as 70:400 (where 70 means the building <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> is 70% and 400 is the floor area ratio or 400%). This would mean that a 4 story home could be built using 70% of the land. Thus, for a maximum allowable <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> of 50%, the greatest building footprint allowed for a lot of 100m2 would be 50m2. Floor area ratio is the total floor area of the house (excluding the roof and basement) as compared to the area of land the house is built upon; for a maximum FAR of 150%, the greatest possible total floor area for a house built on a 100m2 lot would be 150m2. Both maximum values vary according to the location of the land and width of facing roadway, with more built-up areas with wider roads generally allowing greater maximum floorspace, and building coverage dictated by factors such as frontage, nearby roads, and construction materials. Additionally, the number of floors in a structure may be restricted, in order to avoid excessive blockage of light to neighboring properties.|$|R
