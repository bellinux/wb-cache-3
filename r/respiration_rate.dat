The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft. The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, <b>respiration</b> <b>rate</b> and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether {{it could be used}} as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked <b>respiration</b> <b>rate,</b> maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic rate, which {{indirectly}} affects respiration, is {{also influenced}} by environmental temperature. Peak metabolism occurs at about 32°C.

40|$|Suboptimal {{temperature}} (7 ") affects germination rates (reciprocal {{of time to}} radicle emergence) on {{a thermal}} time basis; that is, the T in excess of a base or min-imum temperature multiplied by the time to a given per cent germination (fg) is a constant. <b>Respiration</b> <b>rates</b> are also sensitive to T, and proportional relation-ships are often found between <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> and germination rates. Reduced water potential (if/) delays seed germination on a hydrotime basis (i. e. the i n excess of a base water potential multiplied by tg is a constant). It was tested whether <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> prior to radicle emergence vary in proportion to T and iff as expected from the thermal and hydrotime models. <b>Respiration</b> <b>rates</b> (C 02 evolution) of cold-tolerant, rapidly germinating (PI 341988) and cold-sensitive, more slowly germinating (T 5) tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) seeds were evaluated over a range of T and if / conditions. For both genotypes, <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> {{until the beginning of}} radicle emergence were related to T on a thermal time basis and increased approximately linearly with iff above — 2. 0 MPa, con-sistent with the hydrotime model. <b>Respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were uniquely related to germination rates, regardless of whether germination timing was affected by T, if/, or genotype. However, germination timing was unaf-fected when <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were manipulated by varying O 2 partial pressure. Thus, while both germina-tion and <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> vary with T and iff consistent with thermal and hydrotime models of biological time, <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> per se were not the limiting factor in germination timing of tomato seeds...|$|R

25|$|The {{increase}} in <b>respiration</b> <b>rate</b> {{from the low}} range to the high range is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in <b>respiration</b> <b>rate</b> however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through panting without experiencing respiratory alkalosis by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During hyperpnea ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40–60 cycles per minute, versus their resting rate of 6–12 cycles per minute. Hot, dry and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affects oxygen's diffusion rate (Henry's Law).|$|E
25|$|<b>Respiration</b> <b>rate</b> {{also appears}} to be {{influenced}} significantly by caste. Males show a considerably higher rate of respiration than females and workers, due, in part, to their capability for flight and higher muscle mass.

ETS activities were significantly correlated with <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> (r** 2 = 0. 79, p = 0. 0001). R:ETS ratios were lowest in slow-moving Eucalanidae (0. 11) and highest in diapausing Calanoides carinatus copepodids CV (0. 76) while fast-moving copepods showed intermediate R:ETS (0. 23 - 0. 37). 82 % of the variance of <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> could be explained by differences in dry mass, temperature and the activity level of different copepod species. Three regression equations were derived to calculate <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> for diapausing, slow- and fast-moving copepods, respectively, based on parameters such as body mass and temperature. Thus, knowledge about the activity level and behavioral characteristics of copepod species can significantly increase the predictive accuracy of metabolic models, which will help to better understand and quantify the impact of copepods on nutrient and carbon fluxes in marine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Microbial <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were {{determined}} through a 3. 2 m thick, sandy unsaturated zone in a 2. 4 m diameter X 4. 6 m high mesocosm. The mesocosm was maintained under near constant temperature (18 ° to 23 °C) and reached steady moisture content conditions after several hundred days. Soil-gas CO 2 {{concentrations in the}} mesocosm ranged from 0. 09 % to 3. 31 % and increased with depth. <b>Respiration</b> <b>rates</b> within the mesocosm were quantified over a 342 –day period using measured CO 2 concentrations and a transient, one-dimensional finite-element model. Microbial <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were 2 × 10 – 1 μg C·g− 1 ·d− 1 {{throughout most of the}} system, but decreased to 10 – 4 to 10 – 3 μg C·g− 1 ·d− 1 within the capillary fringe. Microbial <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were also determined in minicosms (500 g sample mass) over a range in temperatures (4 ° to 30 °C) and volumetric moisture contents (0. 044 to 0. 37). The functional dependence of CO 2 production on temperature and soil-moisture content was similar for the two scales of laboratory observation. <b>Respiration</b> <b>rates</b> in the minicosms, for temperatures and moisture contents in the mesocosm, were up to an order of magnitude greater than those determined for the mesocosm. The higher <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> in the minicosms, compared to the mesocosm, were attributed to greater disturbance of the samples and to shorter acclimation time in the minicosms. Extrapolating the laboratory <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> to field conditions yielded rates that were two to three orders of magnitude greater than rates previously determined in situ for C-horizon material. Results show that in situ microbial reaction rates determined using disturbed samples in minicosms and mesocosms yielded <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> that greatly exceeded field conditions. Mesocosms can, however, provide a useful environment for conducting process-related research in unsaturated environments...|$|R
40|$|Although snags and coarse woody debris {{are a small}} {{component}} of ecosystem respiration, disturbances can significantly increase the mass and respiration from these carbon (C) pools. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) measure <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> of snags and coarse woody debris throughout the year in a forest previously defoliated by gypsy moths, (2) develop models for dead stem <b>respiration</b> <b>rates,</b> (3) model stand-level <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> of dead stems using forest inventory and analysis data sets and environmental variables predisturbance and postdisturbance, and (4) compare total dead stem <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> with total ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange. <b>Respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were measured on selected Pinus and Quercus snags and coarse woody debris each month for 1 year in a northeastern U. S. temperate forest. Multiple linear regression using environmental and biometric variables including wood temperature, diameter, density, species, and decay class was used to model <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> of dead stems. The mass of snags and coarse woody debris increased more than fivefold after disturbance and <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> increased more than threefold. The contribution of dead stems to total ecosystem respiration more than tripled from 0. 85 % to almost 3 % and respiration from dead stems alone was approximately equal to the net ecosystem exchange of the forest in 2011 (fourth year postdisturbance). This study highlights the importance of dead stem C pools and fluxes particularly during disturbance and recovery cycles. With climate change increasing the ranges of many forest pests and pathogens, these data become particularly important for accurately modeling future C cycling...|$|R
25|$|The <b>respiration</b> <b>rate</b> was {{faster than}} the {{photosynthesis}} (possibly {{in part due to}} relatively low light penetration through the glazed structure) resulting in a slow decrease of oxygen. A mystery accompanied the oxygen decline: the corresponding increase in carbon dioxide did not appear. This concealed the underlying process until an investigation by Jeff Severinghaus and Wallace Broecker of Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory using isotopic analysis showed that carbon dioxide was reacting with exposed concrete inside Biosphere2 to form calcium carbonate, thereby sequestering both carbon and oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Although {{nicotine}} does {{play a role}} {{in acute}} episodes of some diseases (including stroke, impotence, and heart disease) by its stimulation of adrenaline release, which raises blood pressure, heart and <b>respiration</b> <b>rate,</b> and free fatty acids, the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process. This has {{led to the development of}} various nicotine delivery systems, such as the nicotine patch or nicotine gum, that can satisfy the addictive craving by delivering nicotine without the harmful combustion by-products.

25|$|When using linear regression, {{multiple}} {{data points}} are graphed and the points can be {{fitted with a}} linear regression equation, which will provide a slope.

It is important that the measurement is not allowed to run {{over a longer period of}} time as the increase in CO2 concentration in the chamber will also increase the concentration of CO2 in the porous top layer of the soil profile. This increase in concentration will cause an underestimation of soil <b>respiration</b> <b>rate</b> due to the additional CO2 being stored within the soil.|$|E
40|$|For {{the design}} of high oxygen {{modified}} atmosphere packages, knowledge and modelling of <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> at both low and super-atmospheric oxygen levels is required. Fresh-cut butterhead lettuce was stored in glass jars at three different temperatures (1 degrees C, 5 degrees C and 9 degrees C), three carbon dioxide levels (0, 10 and 20 kPa) and eight different levels of oxygen partial pressures (0, 2, S, 10, 20, 50, 70 and 100 kPa). Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production rates were measured. The <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly reduced by low temperatures and elevated carbon dioxide concentrations up to 10 kPa. At carbon dioxide concentrations of 20 kPa the <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were comparable to those at 0 kPa CO 2 probably due to an injury response. Oxygen concentrations had to be below 2 kPa to significantly reduce the <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> compared to air conditions. <b>Respiration</b> <b>rates</b> were also slightly lower under super-atmospheric (50, 70 and 100 kPa) oxygen partial pressures than at air conditions. Additionally, a Michaelis-Menten based model to describe the <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> {{as a function of}} oxygen, carbon dioxide and temperature was constructed. Models that include <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> at super-atmospheric oxygen levels have not previously been described. The inhibitive effects of carbon dioxide and high oxygen concentrations were incorporated by an uncompetitive and a non-competitive inhibition term respectively. Temperature effects were described using Arrhenius' law.

25|$|Molecular {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to understand the signaling pathways between arbuscular mycorrhizae and plant roots. In 2003 it was shown how the AM undergoes physiological changes in the presence of exudates from potential host plant roots, to colonize it. Host plant root exudates trigger and turn on AM fungal genes required for the respiration of spore carbon compounds. In experiments, transcription rate of 10 genes increased half-hour after exposure and at an even greater rate after 1 hour. after 4 hours exposure AM respond with morphological growth. Genes isolated from that time are involved in mitochondrial activity and enzyme production. The fungal <b>respiration</b> <b>rate,</b> measured by O2 consumption rate, increased by 30% 3 hours after exposure to root exudates, indicating that host plant root exudates stimulate AMF spore mitochondrial activity. It may be part of a fungal regulatory mechanism that conserves spore energy for efficient growth and the hyphal branching upon receiving signals from a potential host plant.|$|E
25|$|Temperature affects {{almost all}} aspects of {{respiration}} processes. Temperature will increase respiration exponentially to a maximum, at which point respiration will decrease to zero when enzymatic activity is interrupted. Root respiration increases exponentially with temperature in its low range when the <b>respiration</b> <b>rate</b> is limited mostly by the TCA cycle. At higher temperatures the transport of sugars and the products of metabolism become the limiting factor. At temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius, root respiration begins to shut down completely. Microorganisms are divided into three temperature groups; cryophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles. Cryophiles function optimally at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, mesophiles function best at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius and thermophiles function optimally at over 40 degrees Celsius. In natural soils many different cohorts, or groups of microorganisms exist. These cohorts will all function best at different conditions so respiration may occur over a very broad range. Temperature increases lead to greater rates of soil respiration until high values retard microbial function, {{this is the same}} pattern that is seen with soil moisture levels.|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollution}} risk {{is a function}} of the hazard of the pollutant and the exposure to that pollutant. Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area, which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated as an inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher <b>respiration</b> <b>rate</b> than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.|$|E

In the evergreen forest with common brown forest soil, soil properties had the greatest effect on soil <b>respiration</b> <b>rates,</b> followed by soil moisture and soil temperature. These results {{may be explained by}} the fact that different soil properties matured within different environments. It can be argued that the low soil <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> in the low parts of the slope in the evergreen forest resulted from soil properties and not from wet soil conditions.

Our objective was to compare <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> of soil {{that had been in}} no-tillage management for 25 yrs to soil that was managed with conventional tillage. Soil respiration was measured in disked and no-tillage plots in 2003 on a Norfolk loamy sand soil (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudult). This tillage experiment was established in 1978 and the surface 2 -in of the no-tillage and disked tillage plots differed in soil C content. Measurements were collected for approximately 50 days during the summer and during the fall. Soil <b>respiration</b> <b>rates</b> during the summer ranged from 0. 6 to 22. 7 gm CO 2 m- 2 hr- 1 for disk tillage and from 0. 6 gm to 1. 4 gm CO 2 m- 2 hr- 1 for no-tillage.

500|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide are {{metabolic}} end products of oxidation of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Oxidising a gram of carbohydrate produces 0.60 grams of water; a gram of protein produces 0.41 grams of water; and a gram of fat produces 1.07 grams of water, {{making it possible for}} xerocoles to live with little or no access to drinking water. The kangaroo rat for example makes use of this water of metabolism and conserves water both by having a low basal metabolic rate and by remaining underground during the heat of the day, reducing loss of water through its skin and respiratory system when at rest. Herbivorous mammals obtain moisture from the plants they eat. Species such as the addax antelope, dik-dik, Grant's gazelle and oryx are so efficient at doing this that they apparently never need to drink. The camel is a superb example of a mammal adapted to desert life. It minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung, and is able to lose 40% of its body weight through water loss without dying of dehydration. Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey. Many other hot desert animals are nocturnal, seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows. At depths of more than [...] , these remain at between [...] regardless of the external temperature. Jerboas, desert rats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes, coyotes, jackals and snakes that prey on them. Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their <b>respiration</b> <b>rate,</b> panting, sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with saliva. Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin. The arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size. Birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies, a form of adaptive insulation. The emperor penguin has dense plumage, a downy under layer, an air insulation layer next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on Earth.|$|E
