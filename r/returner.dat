In college, he set numerous Kansas State football records and was both a 2011 All-American (as a kickoff <b>returner)</b> & 2014 College Football All-America Team consensus All-American selection (as a punt <b>returner).</b> In college, he totaled 6,586 career all-purpose yards and 35 touchdowns, including 3,710 yards and 29 touchdowns as a receiver.|$|E
40|$|Hakim’s Preference Theory on the {{heterogeneity}} of the work-life preferences of women, and in particular its implicit assumption that a woman’s preference to work or {{to stay at home}} is based on her personal choices, has frequently been criticized. Other researchers emphasize the constraining influence that a woman’s personal, financial and family situation can have on her preferences. Our article aims at contributing to this debate by analysing the work orientations of female <b>returners,</b> in themselves a particular job-seeking category which differs noticeably from other categories in regard to their central motivation when considering whether or not to re-enter a paid job. Our research indicates that older female <b>returners</b> are more job and people oriented than younger ones. Female <b>returners</b> with a lower level of education and female <b>returners</b> with financial problems are money oriented, whereas higher educated female <b>returners</b> and female <b>returners</b> who are financially well off show more of a job orientation. Surprisingly, the pres-ence of young children in the household does not significantly influence the work orientations of female <b>returners.</b> KEY WORDS female <b>returners</b> / labour market participation / work orientation 7 Work, employment and society Copyright © 200...|$|R

5|$|Before the 1975 season, the CFL {{implemented}} a rule change allowing the return team to block on punts. Allison was used {{on special teams}} as a blocker under this new rule. He continued his role as an occasional punt <b>returner</b> with 24 returns. Allison also continued to contribute defensively, playing in all 16 regular season games and recording an interception and fumble recovery.|$|E
5|$|The {{positions}} {{specific to}} punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football {{directly to the}} punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt <b>returner</b> (PR) – the player that catches the punt.|$|E

5|$|A {{handful of}} days before the Sugar Bowl, Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Hall broke a bone in his foot during practice and was considered unlikely to play. Hall was Tech's second-leading receiver, having caught 25passes for 398yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting punt <b>returner,</b> and had returned 40kicks for 510yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.|$|E
5|$|After the season, the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association named Smith to the All-ACC {{second team}} {{as both a}} wide {{receiver}} and return specialist. Phil Steele's and The Sporting News named him to their All-ACC first teams as a wide receiver. Phil Steele's and Rivals.com named him to their All-ACC second teams as a kick <b>returner.</b> Smith submitted his name to a panel of NFL scouts after the season, which evaluated him as a third- or fourth-round selection in the 2010 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Akins {{went on to}} play at both East Mississippi and Northeast Louisiana University. In {{his first}} game at East Mississippi, Akins {{returned}} a punt 85 yards for a touchdown. Although Akins developed at East Mississippi and with the Northeast Louisiana Indians, he remained at least second on the depth chart, playing behind Quincy Jackson at East Mississippi and Marty Booker at Northeast Louisiana. Akins played with the Indians through 1998, when he featured as the team's kick <b>returner</b> and led his team with 1,269 all-purpose yards.|$|E
40|$|Background Limited {{research}} {{exists on}} the experiences of engineering <b>returners</b> – those with undergraduate degrees who work {{for at least five}} years and return to academia for graduate degrees. <b>Returners</b> bring a different perspective to their graduate studies and postgraduate work than direct‐pathway students but face additional challenges. Purpose Our aim was to understand practitioners' decisions to return to graduate school and complete graduate degrees. Guided by expectancy value theory, we investigated their beliefs about their ability to succeed; the interest, attainment, and utility values <b>returners</b> placed on graduate school; the costs they experienced in returning; and the personal, programmatic, and cultural factors that mitigated these costs. Design/Method We employed a qualitative interpretivist approach to investigate the returning experience through semi‐structured interviews with 10 <b>returners.</b> We analyzed the results deductively, using expectancy value theory to understand participants' expectations of success and the values of those experiences, and inductively, to understand the types of costs that influenced the decision to return and complete graduate school. Results Utility value drove participants' decisions to return and complete graduate programs, and participants had a high expectancy of success in earning their graduate degrees. Four types of costs emerged from analysis of the interviews: intellectual, balance, cultural and environmental, and financial. Participants employed various strategies to mitigate these costs. Conclusions With the results of our study, potential <b>returners</b> can more effectively plan for success in the graduate environment, and universities can develop initiatives to better recruit <b>returners</b> and support their success...|$|R

5|$|Alston played college {{football}} for the East Carolina Pirates as a quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. While at East Carolina University, Alston studied economics. After failing {{to make the}} Browns' regular season roster in 2003, he was allocated to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe, where he became a World Bowl champion. Alston played as a kick <b>returner</b> for the Browns in 2004 before playing in the CFL from 2006 to 2007.|$|E
5|$|As {{a senior}} at Arizona State, he played left halfback and was {{recognized}} as one of the roughest and hardest runners in the country, and as one of the top defensive players as a safety. He also excelled as a punt <b>returner,</b> and had a two-game stretch in which he returned four punts for touchdowns. Johnson's running abilities made him a standout pro football prospect as a black athlete at a primarily white college.|$|E
5|$|Bell entered Penn in {{the fall}} of 1914 as an English major and joined Phi Kappa Sigma. In a rare {{occurrence}} for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penn's coach George H. Brooke. On the team, he also was as a defender, punter, and punt <b>returner.</b> After the team's 3–0 start, Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season, as Penn finished with a record of 3–5–2.|$|E

5|$|Luck {{distributed}} his passes relatively evenly {{among his}} receivers. Doug Baldwin was the team's leading receiver, with 56 receptions for 824 yards and 9 touchdowns {{during the regular}} season. Wide receiver and kick <b>returner</b> Chris Owusu, who played in only six games because of a knee injury, underwent arthroscopic surgery and was expected {{to play in the}} Orange Bowl. He was the team's fourth-leading receiver in terms of yardage, catching 24 passes for 394 yards and 3 touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Originally drafted as a cornerback, Hester quickly made {{an impact}} as a kick <b>returner,</b> {{and later became}} one of the team's {{starting}} wide receivers. Hester holds the NFL record for most all-time return touchdowns (punt and kickoff combined) and most all-time punt return touchdowns. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} best return specialists in NFL history, and was the first person ever to return the opening kick of the Super Bowl back for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Smith drew {{praise from}} the Maryland {{coaching}} staff during summer workouts before the 2008 season, and The Washington Times predicted Smith, alongside receiver Ronnie Tyler, would earn significant playing time. He played in all 13games and {{started in the}} last six of the season. He also saw action on special teams as a kickoff <b>returner.</b> Smith recorded 24receptions for 336yards and twotouchdowns. In its midseason report, The Baltimore Sun credited Smith for often giving an inconsistent Maryland team good field position with his long kick returns.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} and Clemson's kick <b>returner</b> {{ran out of}} bounds at the Tigers' 12-yard line. Dantzler scrambled for two yards, but Virginia Tech linebacker Jake Houseright was injured during the play and left the game. After a delay while the injured Houseright was helped off the field, Dantzler scrambled for six yards. Bernard Rambert gained a first down with a two-yard run, then he gained five yards on a run up the middle. Dantzler followed the gain with a 13-yard run {{of his own and}} a first down at the Clemson 40-yard line. Rambert caught a five-yard pass from Dantzler, then he ran for one yard up {{the left side of the}} field. During the play, Rambert was injured and had to be helped off the field. He was replaced by third-string freshman running back Keith Kelly. Dantzler threw an incomplete pass on third down, then Somaini punted the ball to Virginia Tech. The kick bounced off the chest of the Virginia Tech kick <b>returner,</b> and the loose ball was scooped up by Robert Carswell of Clemson. Following the turnover, Clemson's offense had a first down at the Tech 20-yard line with 8:44 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick <b>returner</b> because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Swedish pre-improvement tenants {{have the}} right to remain in their flats during {{modernisation}} or to return afterwards. One aim of the paper is to assess to what extent these rights are exercised. A second aim is to discuss factors influencing the varying proportions of stayers and <b>returners</b> in different improvement projects. Two-thirds of the tenants move out for good. Building ownership, the extent of improvement and the type of building proved to have a rather large impact on the proportion of stayers. Differences among municipalities and characteristics of the tenants themselves were not as important as had been expected. The same conclusions hold for the proportion or <b>returners.</b> The model tested was less successful in explaining the varying proportion of <b>returners...</b>|$|R

50|$|Avoid {{the ball}} and let it hit the ground. Under this option the ball will go into the {{returning}} team's end zone for a touchback, go out of bounds and be spotted at that point, or come to final rest {{in the field of}} play and be downed by a player on the punting team. This is the safest option, as it completely eliminates the chance of a fumble and ensures that the <b>returner's</b> team will get possession of the ball. However, it also provides an opportunity for the punting team to pin the <b>returner's</b> team deep in their own territory by downing the ball or sending it out of bounds near the <b>returner's</b> end zone. This can not only give the return team poor field position, but can even lead to a safety.|$|R
