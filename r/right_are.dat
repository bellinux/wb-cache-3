40|$|Stephen May (2011) {{holds that}} {{language}} <b>rights</b> have <b>been</b> insufficiently recognized, or just rejected as problematic, {{in human rights}} theory and practice. Defending the “human rights approach to language rights”, he claims that language <b>rights</b> should <b>be</b> accorded the status of fundamental human rights, recognized as such by states and international organizations. This article argues {{that the notion of}} language <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> far from clear. According to May, one key reason for rejecting the claim that language <b>rights</b> should <b>be</b> considered as human <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> the widespread belief that language <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> collective <b>rights.</b> In order to address this kind of objection, the collective character attributed to language <b>rights</b> must <b>be</b> carefully assessed, distinguishing two different views of what a collective <b>right</b> <b>is...</b>|$|R

Since all pawns are just one step from promotion, they may only promote to captured pieces: if no pieces may be captured, pawns may not move to the last row.|$|E
