50|$|The <b>rusty-margined</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope superciliaris) is {{a species}} of bird in the Cracidae family, which {{includes}} the chachalacas, guans, and curassows. It {{is found in the}} dry regions of northeast Brazil, the cerrado and caatinga, as well as southeast Brazil; also the pantanal and the adjacent southeast Amazon Basin. It is also found in eastern Paraguay with extreme northeast Argentina, and eastern Bolivia in the Pantanal. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. If not hunted, it tolerates human proximity well and can be found even in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in places such as the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden {{as well as in the}} adjoining Tijuca Forest.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the movement of}} seeds transported by fruit-eating birds in an agricultural, fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil, I asked which bird species are the main seed dispersers in such environment, and how they use the available habitats (small forest fragments, forest thickets, live fences, isolated trees, and active pastures) where they {{are most likely to}} drop the seeds they swallow the relative importance of fruit-eating birds as seed vectors was evaluated {{based on the number of}} fruit species eaten, the number of visits, and visitation rate to fruiting plants. Habitat use was accessed by recording the habitats where birds were seen or heard during walks conducted throughout the study area. Sixteen plant species were observed during 308. 3 plant-hours. Forty-one bird species were observed eating fruits in a total of 830 visits to fruiting plants. Sayaca Tanagers (Thraupis sayaca) and Pale-breasted Thrushes (Turdus leucomelas) ate the greatest number of fruit species, were the most frequent plant visitors in terms of number and rate of visits, and had a broad range of habitat use. These two species and the <b>Rusty-margined</b> <b>Guan</b> (Penelope superciliaris), which is able to swallow large fruits with large seeds that smaller bird species cannot cat, likely have a great contribution to the movement of seeds throughout this highly degraded landscape...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Guans {{are large}} frugivorous birds that inhabit Neotropical forests {{and play a}} {{fundamental}} role in seed dispersal and forest regeneration. Despite their ecological importance, the natural populations of these birds are increasingly threatened by deforestation and hunting pressure. The present study was conducted in the Araripe National Forest, Ceará (Brazil), with the objective of estimating population parameters (density and total population size) in the <b>Rusty-margined</b> <b>Guan</b> (Penelope superciliaris) and the White-browed Guan (Penelope jacucaca), as well as providing data on their feeding ecology, including seasonal variation and fruit morphology. The study was based on the monthly collection of data between November, 2011, and October, 2012. Population parameters were estimated using line transect surveys, while feeding ecology was studied by direct observation, and the collection of plant and fecal samples. The estimated population density of P. superciliaris was 19. 17 individuals/km 2 (CV= 13. 98 %), with a mean of 0. 13 sightings per 10 km walked. Penelope jacucaca was not encountered during the surveys. A total of 14 plant species were recorded in the diet of P. superciliaris, 12 by direct observation, and two from fecal samples. Fruit diameter varied from 6. 3 ± 1. 35 mm (Miconia albicans) to 29. 9 ± 1. 7 mm (Psidium sp.). Yellow was the most frequent fruit color (41. 6 %, n= 5), with two species each (16. 6 %) providing black, green, and red fruits. Fleshy fruits of the baccate (50. 0 %, n= 6) and drupe (33. 3 %, n= 4) types were the most consumed. The data on population parameters and feeding ecology collected in the present study provide an important database for the development of effective management strategies by environmental agencies for the conservation of the populations of the two guan species...|$|E
40|$|Lagoa Santa, a {{small town}} in southeastern Brazil where naturalist Peter Lund lived, is {{regarded}} nowadays as an important historical site for the biological sciences. From 1847 to 1855, J. T. Reinhardt, hosted by Lund, collected 343 bird species. This material is an outstanding reference for many modern ornithological studies. The present paper reports the occurrence of some rare and threatened birds for the region of Lagoa Santa between 1998 and 2005. In this account I list the <b>Rusty-margined</b> <b>Guan</b> Penelope superciliaris Temminck, 1815; the Roseate Spoonbill Platalea ajaja Linnaeus, 1758; the Maguari Stork Ciconia maguari (Gmelin, 1789); the Wood Stork Mycteria americana Linnaeus, 1758; the Black Hawk-eagle Spizaetus tyrannus (Wied, 1820) and the Turquoise-fronted Parrot Amazona aestiva (Linnaeus, 1758). It is also reported the southernmost record for the Blue-and-yellow Macaw Ara ararauna (Linnaeus, 1758) and the range extension of the Crowned Slaty flycatcher Griseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus (d'Orbigny and Lafresnaye, 1837). These data {{can be used as a}} baseline for studies of colonization and extinction. Lagoa Santa, cidade onde viveu Peter Lund é um dos sítios de maior importância histórica para as ciências biológicas. Durante os anos de 1847 e 1855, J. T. Reinhardt, a convite de Lund, coletou 343 espécies de aves que são hoje referência para vários estudos ornitológicos. O presente artigo relata a ocorrência de algumas aves raras e/ou ameaçadas para a região de Lagoa Santa, entre 1998 e 2005. A lista de espécies inclui a jacupemba Penelope superciliaris Temminck, 1815, o colhereiro Platalea ajaja Linnaeus, 1758, a maguari Ciconia maguari (Gmelin, 1789), a cabeça-seca Mycteria americana Linnaeus, 1758, o gavião-pega-macaco Spizaetus tyrannus (Wied, 1820); e o papagaio-verdadeiro Amazona aestiva (Linnaeus, 1758). Relata-se também a ocorrência mais meridional da arara-canindé Ara ararauna (Linnaeus, 1758), e a expansão da distribuição geográfica do peitica-de-chapéu-preto Griseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus (d'Orbigny and Lafresnaye, 1837). Estes dados poderão ser usados como referência nos estudos de colonização e extinção de espécies de aves...|$|E
