2500|$|... 3D printing, {{also known}} as {{additive}} manufacturing (AM), refers to processes {{used to create a}} three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. Stereolithography (STL) {{is one of the most}} common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, unlike material <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> a <b>stock</b> in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.|$|R

40|$|You can park {{your car}} {{on the streets of}} New York, or you can have a full time job, but you can’t {{possibly}} do both. —Calvin Trillin Street cleaning is a common practice in many communities. The process requires that street parking be temporarily <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>stock</b> of available parking spaces, which affects parking and travel decisions. When streets are cleaned as frequently as once or twice a week, as in dense urban com-munities such as New York City, Chicago, or San Francisco, it can become a hassle to residents and a contentious local issue. Many opponents to frequent street cleaning claim that the process forces residents to relocate their cars and thereby increases traffic. However, few studies have examined the effects of street cleaning on parking and driving. To better understand how street cleaning affects driving,...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} of blood components remains an on-going challenge. In {{the majority of}} cases, organisms contaminating the blood components {{are a part of}} normal skin flora. Here, we report a case of bacterial {{contamination of}} blood units through contaminated donor arm disinfectant. There was a series of reactions due to random donor platelet (RDP) transfusion. The patients had features of septic transfusion reactions. On root cause analysis, spirit swabs used for disinfection of donors' arm were identified as the culprit and presence of Clostridium difficile was established. All the blood components prepared on the dates of implicated RDP units were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>stock</b> and we replaced the existing 70 % alcohol disinfectant with chlorhexidine-alcohol-based antiseptic rub. Further, no such transfusion reactions were reported. Implementation of good donor arm disinfection technique in addition to the use of blood bags with diversion pouch is proposed to be best preventive strategy for resource-poor settings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the career concerns of security analysts using long histories of their earnings forecasts, job separations and stock coverage assignments. Our findings include the following. Relatively good (accurate) past forecast performance increases {{the probability that}} an analyst moves from a low status to a high status (large, prestigious) brokerage house, while relatively poor past forecast performance leads to movements down the brokerage house hierarchy. High status brokerage houses {{are more likely to}} discharge an analyst for poor past forecast performance than other houses. In addition, analysts with poor past forecast performances but who do not change employers {{are more likely to be}} <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> following <b>stocks</b> with large market capitalization or significant analyst following. This effect is also more pronounced for analysts who work for high status brokerage houses. These findings suggest that the labor market for security analysts provides important implicit incentives for analysts to produce good forecast track records...|$|R

If, for instance, the upper part of a large Manchester goods warehouse was on fire, it would be of very little advantage to the offices interested in the risk if the men were set to work <b>removing</b> <b>stock</b> <b>from</b> the ground floor.
