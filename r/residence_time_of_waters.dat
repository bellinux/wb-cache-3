40|$|International audienceLi, B, Mg and Ca {{isotopes}} {{became of}} increasing interest {{during the last}} decade due to their potential for better constraining the carbon cycle and nutrient cycling. At the soil-water-plant scale, Li and B isotopes are powerful tools for the understanding of processes leading to clay mineral formation in soils. Ca and Mg isotopes allow, for their part, to identify plant-mineral interactions and recycling by vegetation. At the scale of monolithological silicate watersheds, Li and B isotope fractionations are mainly controlled by the degree of mineral leaching and the amount of clay mineral formation. Ca and Mg isotope signatures in soil and waters vary seasonally, depending on the vegetation growth cycle and rain events. In mixed-lithology basins, B and Li isotopes are controlled by alteration rates of silicate minerals and the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> within the watershed. Ca and Mg isotope ratios of river waters appear to be also lithology-controlled...|$|E
40|$|The direct {{simulation}} of water age is outlined and applied {{for evaluating the}} flushing features in fluvial conditions. The local water age is considered as a mass-weighted average of <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> with various past. Given the river flow field is numerically modelled on a two- or three-dimensional grid, the spatial distribution and time variation of {{the mean age of}} water masses entering the study domain is simulated as an advection-diffusion process, with zero-order source of unit strength as rate of ageing. The contribution of characteristic sub-domains to the residence time is estimated by a multiple-fraction extension of the approach, making it possible to quantify both the near and far field impact of e. g. high residence time of recirculations or slow flow in densely vegetated zones. Sample applications cover the assessment of flushing of groin fields with multiple-cell recirculation zones, floodplains with various roughness conditions and the impact of hydro-peaking on flushing conditions in such river reaches...|$|E
40|$|A cross-system {{comparison}} of organic carbon origin and behaviour in nine European estuaries is presented. The study sites display {{a very large}} range of hydrological and environmental conditions. The watershed of the respective estuaries were characterized by plotting the total organic carbon (TOC) in the rivers versus the inhabitants/discharge ratio, This allows to distinguish four types of watershed with regard to anthropogenic forcing and organic carbon levels: polluted by sewage inputs (Scheldt and to a much lesser extent, Ems, Sado and Thames), decontaminated (Elbe and Rhine), pristine (Gironde and Douro) and eutrophized (Loire and Scheldt). In the estuarine zone, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) almost always decreased linearly with increasing salinity. Exceptions were: the Scheldt, where a net consumption of sewage-derived DOC was observed, the Gironde, where a net production of DOC occurred in the maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) and the Sado and Ems, where DOC was supplied from large intertidal areas. By contrast, a large fraction of the riverine particulate organic carbon (POC) was mineralized in all the estuaries, except the Douro, where <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> {{is only a few}} days. A fraction of POC appeared however refractory and accumulated in the MTZs, where terrestrial soil-derived material dominates (Elbe, Ems, Loire, Gironde and Sado). In the marine regions of most estuaries, autochthonous POC was present during spring and summer. The analysis of all river and estuarine data allows estimation of the loss of continental POC occurring in each estuary. It decreases in the following order: Scheldt much greater than Thames > Ems = Sado = Loire > Gironde > Elbe > Rhine > Douro, which almost corresponds to the anthropogenic pressure in the respective watersheds. Two major variables appear to control the intensity of this mineralization: the origin of the POC, the lability increasing with pollution, and the residence time of particles in the estuarine zone...|$|E

40|$|The Ria Formosa wetland {{system is}} {{classified}} as a leaky coastal lagoon and covers approximately 100 km 2 of the South of Portugal, with roughly 50 % being intertidal. Its hinterland is set in an arid region and on a coastal plain subject to intensive agriculture since the 50 ’s. In spite of high exchange coefficients with the coastal ocean (50 and 75 % at neap and spring tides, respectively) and the annual total potential freshwater discharge from the hinterland {{a fraction of the}} daily tidal prism, worrying signs of eutrophication have been detected during the past couple of decades. These include fish- and clam-kill episodes, increased occurrence of nuisance algal blooms and substitution of native sea grass communities by macroalgae. Notwithstanding its critical importance for the evaluation of pollutant exposure period, the literature includes a wide range of estimates for the ‘residence time’ of waters within the lagoon (16 hours to 11 days, with an the apparent consensus falling within the 1 - 2 day interval) and this point is a clear obstacle for a correct environmental risk assessment, including management of the system. This lack of clarity is due in our view to two main factors: i) the lack of proper physical definition of the term ‘residence time’, with its consequent misuse and misapplication in context, a misconception that is unfortunately too common within the environmental community, and different concepts in the application of transport time scales ii) the geomorphological and hydraulic complexity of the system [...] As part of ongoing research evaluating the role of Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) as a loading vector for nutrients (especially Nitrate) into the lagoon, we use the radium quartet in combination with remote sensing and isotope mixing models to develop and discuss a mixing timeline for the system, We conclude that the average, whole-system <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> within the lagoon is at least 4 days...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong {{waters in}} the {{northern}} part of the South China Sea are subjected to seasonal oceanographic processes due to monsoonal winds and Pearl River outflow. Several 100 red tides have occurred in Hong Kong waters during 1983 to 1998, and show a clear spatial and temporal distribution. Most (74 %) occurred in semi-enclosed NE bays away from the Pearl River estuary, and fewer occurred in western estuarine waters. Most red tides (70 %) occurred between December and May, and fewer in summer. However, nutrients are high in the Pearl River estuary, whereas nutrients are generally low in the NE bays (Mirs Bay and Port Shelter) and cannot support the high biomass of red tides. This suggests that there are concentrating mechanisms promoting the formation of red tides in NE waters, either by vertical migration or horizontal aggregation under suitable wind conditions (NE winds and moderate speeds around 6 m s- 1). The prevailing NE monsoon winds in winter and spring result in downwelling and a longer <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> in the NE bays, creating conditions similar to those of a batch culture, and allowing local inputs of nutrients and vertical migration of phytoplankton in shallow waters to play a dominant role in favor of local red tides. This may be one of the reasons why more red tides occur in winter and spring in semi-enclosed waters. In summer, the SW monsoon winds result in upwelling along the coast, and high river discharge and rainfall cause an increased estuarine circulation in the Pearl River estuary and rapid outflow of the surface water from these semi-enclosed waters. As a result, residence time of these waters decreases, and they may be analogous to semi-continuous or continuous cultures. This may explain why there are fewer red tides in summer. The species occurring most frequently are (in descending order) Noctiluca scintillans, Gonyaulax polygramma, Skeletonema costatum, Mesodinium rubrum, Prorocentrum minimum and Ceratium furca. In general, dinoflagellate red tides occur mostly in April when Si is low, whereas diatom red tides occur in June when Si increases due to the freshwater discharge. Deep oceanic water on the continental shelf is drawn into the NE bays during the upwelling; it is poor in nutrients, and does not favor nutrient acquisition in deep water by vertical migrating dinoflagellates.

40|$|The US Geological Survey has {{maintained}} a network of stations to collect samples for the measurement of tritium concentrations in precipitation and streamflow since the early 1960 s. Tritium data from outflow waters of river basins draining 4500 - 75 000 km 2 are used to determine average residence times of water within the basins. The basins studied are the Colorado River above Cisco, Utah: the Kissimmee River above Lake Okeechobee, Florida; the Mississippi River above Anoka, Minnesota; the Neuse River above Streets Ferry Bridge near Vanceboro, North Carolina; the Potomac River above Point of Rocks. Maryland; the Sacramento River above Sacramento, California: the Susquehanna River above Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The basins are modeled {{with the assumption that}} the outflow in the river comes from two sources prompt (within-year) runoff from precipitation, and flow from the long-term reservoirs of the basin. Tritium concentration in the outflow water of the basin is dependent on three factors: (1) tritium concentration in runoff from the long-term reservoir, which depends on the residence time for the reservoir and historical tritium concentrations in precipitation; (2) tritium concentrations in precipitation (the within-year runoff component); (3) relative contributions of flow from the long-term and within-year components. Predicted tritium concentrations for the outflow water in the river basins were calculated for different residence times and for different relative contributions from the two reservoirs. A box model was used to calculate tritium concentrations in the long-term reservoir. Calculated values of outflow tritium concentrations for the basin were regressed against the measured data to obtain a slope {{as close as possible to}} 1. These regressions assumed an intercept of zero and were carried out for different values of residence time and reservoir contribution to maximize the fit of modeled versus actual data for all the above rivers. The final slopes of the fitted regression lines ranged from 0. 95 to 1. 01 (correlation coefficient 3 ̆e 0. 96) for the basins studied. Values for the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> within the basins and average relative contributions of the within-year and long-term reservoirs to outflow were obtained. Values for river basin residence times ranged from 2 years for the Kissimmee River basin to 20 years for the Potomac River basin. The residence times indicate the time scale in which the basin responds to anthropogenic inputs. The modeled tritium concentrations for the basins also furnish input data for urban and agricultural settings where these river waters are used...|$|E

However, the exact mechanisms which drive the behaviour of Li isotopes in surface environments are not totally understood and {{there is a need to}} better calibrate and characterize this proxy. In this study, we analysed the Li concentrations and isotopic compositions in the various surface reservoirs (soils, rocks, waters and plants) of a small forested granitic catchment located in the Vosges Mountains (Strengbach catchment, France, OHGE [URL] Li fluxes were calculated in both soil profiles and at the basin scale and it was found that even in this forested basin, atmospheric inputs and litter fall represented a minor flux compared to input derived from the weathering of rocks and soil minerals (which together represent a minimum of 70 % of dissolved Li). Li isotope ratios in soil pore waters show large depth dependent variations. Average dissolved d 7 Li decreases from _ 1. 1 &to _ 14. 4 & between 0 and _ 30 cm, but is + 30. 7 &at _ 60 cm. This range of Li isotopic compositions is very large and it encompasses almost the entire range of terrestrial Li isotope compositions that have been previously reported. We interpret these variations to result from both the dissolution and precipitation of secondary phases. Large isotopic variations were also measured in the springs and stream waters, with d 7 Li varying from + 5. 3 & to + 19. 6 &. d 7 Li increases from the top to the bottom of the basin and also covaries with discharge at the outlet. These variations are interpreted to reflect isotopic fractionations occurring during secondary phase precipitation along the water pathway through the rocks. We suggest that the dissolved d 7 Li increases with increasing <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> through the rocks, and so with increasing time of interaction between waters and solids. A dissolution precipitation model was used to fit the dissolved Li isotopic compositions. It was found that the isotopic compositions of springs and stream waters are explicable by an isotopic fractionation of _ 5 &to _ 14 & (best fit _ 10. 8 &), in agreement with Li incorporation into clay. In soil solutions, it was found that isotopic fractionation during secondary precipitation is larger (at least _ 23 &), suggesting a major role for different secondary phases, such as iron oxides that maybe incorporate Li with a higher isotope fractionation...|$|E
40|$|The Montirone is a travertine-made hill (max. height 15. 75 m a. s. l.) {{located in}} the Abano Terme area of the Euganean Geothermal Field (EGF), that extends on a plain band of 36 Km 2 south of Padova (Veneto-Italy). The {{existence}} of an extensional relay zone, buried hundred meters beneath the alluvial cover, between segments of the Schio-Vicenza fault system (SVFS) has been proposed. This structure accommodates a local extensional regime that keeps open fractures in the subsurface of EGF and enhances the uprising of hot waters. The temperature of thermal waters, used mainly for spa, ranges from 60 °C to 86 °C. 3 H and 14 C measurements suggest a residence time greater than 60 years, probably a few thousand years. At present, about 250 wells are active and the total average flow rate of exploited thermal fluids is 15 Mm 3 /Y. Until the 1960, the only natural occurrence of thermal waters in Abano was located on the Montirone hill; hot waters fed several pools located on the flat top and {{at the base of}} the hill and were partially channeled to move a mill-wheel. The intense exploitation of thermal waters, linked to the increasing number of thermal wells, lowered the potentiometric level from more than 16 m a. s. l. to - 15 m a. s. l. (year 1982; at present is 5 m a. s. l.) and dried up the hot springs. The hill has a sub-circular shape, covers an area of 10000 m 2 and can be classified as a regular shaped travertine mound. The mound is affected by a network of fractures mainly composed of two sets (WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW) that can be interpreted as a fracture mesh developed in a dilational stepover between strike-slip or transtensional fault segments of the SVFS. The trend of fissures parallels the trend of the main regional structural elements (e. g. SVFS; mainly oriented NW-SE) and is consistent with the direction of the anisotropy depicted in the variogram analysis of transmissivity calculated in the bedrock of EGF (N 110 °E). Two drillings (about 1 m deep) were made to study the depositional facies of the travertine because of the absence of relevant cross sections. Thin sections of the core samples show the dominance of layered travertine made of lime-mudstone with paper-thin rafts and laminae of bacterial shrub, locally covered by crystalline crusts made of feather-like calcite. Moreover, soft sediment syndepositional deformations and repeated phases of karstic dissolution and redeposition have been observed. Isotopic analyses on uranium-series, carried out on crystalline crusts sampled during the drillings, have given ages from 30 ± 4 kY to 25 ± 5 kY. Moreover, the low content of U (from 3 to 12 ppb) and the high activity ratio of 234 U/ 238 U (> 2) clarify the high interaction between rock and water, typical of a deep geothermal system with high <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters.</b> Geophysical methods, and particularly Electromagnetic survey (EM) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) were used to determine the mound geometry. The map of EM measurements (depth of investigation around 1. 5 m) shows the presence of two resistive areas along the slope and a more conductive region on the top of the mound. The latter can be interpreted as indicative of the uprising of thermal waters through a more fractured zone. ERT surveys confirm the vertical extent of the conductive and resistive anomalies, and support the interpretation above. The presence of the Montirone travertine deposit strongly supports the existence of a releasing structure in the subsurface, which controls the development of the EGF, and an ongoing activity of the SVFS, which is generally considered inactive. The analysis on U-series isotopes gives another important constraint on the deep circulation and a long residence time of thermal waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop a 'transportable' water quality model for the Solent and Southampton Water estuarine system, as a {{part of an effort to}} examine the effects of human activity and natural processes on estuarine water quality. Dissolved oxygen (DO), as a main indicator of water quality, is influenced by physical, chemical and biological processes, and has been chosen as the core parameter to link the different processes to be modelled. Monthly surveys of DO, planktonic community respiration rates and other water quality parameters (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, suspended particulate matter, inorganic nutrients etc.) in the Itchen Estuary and Southampton Water were conducted from January 1998 to April 1999. DO data shows that Southampton Water is a relatively healthy estuary, despite receiving considerable loads of oxygen demanding organic sewage effluent discharged from a number of points. A persistent moderate DO sag (DO saturation > 80 %) was observed in the upper Itchen Estuary throughout the year. In the lower Itchen Estuary and Southampton Water, the waters were DO saturated during the non-phytoplankton growth season. Surface DO supersaturation was observed during the phytoplankton growth season especially during algal blooms, but no severe DO depletion was detected following the bloom collapse. Community respiration rates maintained a substantial level in the upper Itchen estuary, while in the lower estuary respiration rates were low during the non-phytoplankton season and increased during the phytoplankton growth season. It is suggested that the high winter respiration rate in the upper Itchen Estuary are sustained by inputs from external sources (rivers, sewage and industrial effluents) and that the summer increase in the lower estuary is a consequence of phytoplankton photosynthesis. Nutrients in the Itchen Estuary and Southampton Water show mainly conservative behaviour in a plot of nutrient concentration against salinity. The removal of the nutrients by phytoplankton activity occurred at high salinities during the spring to summer period. A 3 -D finite element baroclinic hydrodynamic model with two-equation q 2 -q 2 l turbulence closure has been developed including a mass conservation scheme. The model successfully simulated the tides, tidal currents, and estuarine circulation in the Southampton Water and Solent estuarine system. The modelled tidal induced residual currents and water mass transportation in Southampton Water and the Solent have been examined. Model results show the existence of a predominant westward tidal induced residual current in the Solent. The tidal induced residual water mass transport is extremely limited in Southampton Water, except near the entrance to Southampton Water, where it joins the Solent. The estuarine circulation with surface, seaward flowing fresher water and bottom, landward flowing saltier water provides the main mechanism for water mass transport in the model. The short <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> in the estuary estimated from the survey salinity data confirmed how effective the estuarine circulation is for sea water from the Solent to replace the water within Southampton Water. The trapping effect of estuarine circulation is also crucial for the water quality in the estuary. A water quality model has been developed and coupled with the 3 -D hydrodynamic model. The water quality model consists of an external (dissolved oxygen-biochemical oxygen demand) model, which models the direct impact of external inputs (riverine discharge, domestic and industrial effluents) to the water quality, and an internal model, which simulates the impact of local estuarine phytoplankton growth on the water quality. DO and dissolved inorganic nutrients are the 'link substances' between the external model and internal model. The integrated water quality model output has been compared against the survey data for 1998, and has been shown to reproduce the spatial and temporal change in oxygen, nutrients, chlorophyll and planktonic respiration in Southampton Water...|$|E

30|$|Storm flow during high-intensity {{rainfall}} is {{a special}} case of hillslope response characterized by an array of flow types that vary throughout the watershed and are susceptible to time-dependent change depending on topography, climate, soils, geology, land cover, vegetation, seasonality, and disturbance factors including wildland fire, agriculture, forest management activities, and water management. The hillslope response during storm flow depends on direct runoff composed of surface runoff (infiltration excess or saturation excess runoff; Horton, 1938; Dunne and Black, 1970) and subsurface storm flow. Although both mechanisms provide the fast-flow component of runoff (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967; Agnese et al., 2001), the former has a faster response time than the latter because the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at the surface is shorter than the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in the soil.

We derive spatial maps <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> <b>time,</b> attributed to evaporation and precipitation, and age <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>water,</b> showing that there are different {{ways of looking at}} temporal characteristics <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>water.</b> Longer evaporation <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> often indicate larger distances towards areas of high precipitation. From our analysis we find that the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> over the ocean is about 2  days less than over land. It can be seen that in winter, the age of atmospheric moisture tends to be much lower than in summer.

40|$|The isotope {{hydrology}} {{of a set}} of nested sub-catchments in the north-east of Scotland {{has been}} studied to examine the mixing processes and <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in the catchments. The measured δ 18 O in stream waters was found to be exceptionally uniform both temporally and spatially. Hydrochemical mixing analyses showed that groundwater contributes between 62 and 90 % of the stream flow in all sub-catchments. Model analysis indicated that the δ 18 O in stream <b>water</b> is indicative <b>of</b> a highly mixed system in which near surface runoff appears to be mixed with groundwater, within the soil profile, before being released from the catchment. Small fluctuations in the stream water δ 18 O response are generated by a small proportion (< 10 %) <b>of</b> less-well mixed <b>water</b> in infiltration excess runoff during storm events. A comparative application of the model to a nearby catchment, which has a lower proportion of groundwater runoff, demonstrated contrasting behaviour, with significantly less mixing <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> occurring and a more distinct difference in the age of runoff generated by different flow paths. This highlighted that standard methods for characterization of mixing mechanisms are often insufficient and may not discriminate between systems that have retained quite distinct flow paths throughout catchment transit, and those which have been mixed at some stage. Model sensitivity analysis also indicated that the simulated mean <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> varies most strongly in response to different parameters compared with the δ 18 O response. This has implications for estimating water <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> from isotope data...|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{classify}} the groundwater by various methods of Gundlupet taluk. The Gundlupet taluk having an area of 1406. 30 sq. Km falls in Chamrajanagar district <b>of</b> Karnataka. <b>Water</b> quality parameters <b>of</b> the <b>waters</b> samples analysed and the results of the analysis have been used to suggest models for predicting <b>water</b> quality. Quality <b>of</b> groundwater in a hard rock terrain is more controlled by the rock-water interaction and the <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in aquifers. The <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> in turn depends on the groundwater systems within a larger hydrological unit.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a method for}} estimating the average in-stream <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in a river channel and across large catchments, i. e. the time between water entering a river and reaching a downstream monitoring point. The methodology uses river flow gauging data to integrate Manning’s equation along a length of channel for different percentile flows. The method was developed and tested for the River Tees in northern England and then applied across the United Kingdom (UK). (i) The study developed methods to predict channel width and main channel length from catchment area. (ii) For an 818 km 2 catchment with a channel length of 79 km, the in-stream <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> at the 50...|$|R
40|$|Forest soil {{fertility}} is generally estimated {{by studying the}} water and nutrient cycles essential to living organisms (i. e. biogeochemical cycles). Use of geochemical and/or isotopic tracers is an innovative, complementary approach to more traditional studies. Experimental procedures and results of some recent studies in forest ecosystems using natural tracers (e. g. 18 O, 13 C, 26 Mg) or artificially supplied tracers (e. g. enrichment in Sr, Rb, 15 N, 44 Ca, 26 Mg, 32 P) are presented. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} relevance for using these tools to identify sources, to estimate <b>residence</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and elements, and to trace nutrient fluxes, of both organic and mineral origins, that are internal or external to the ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|Measurement by two nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) techniques <b>of</b> the mean <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> τa <b>of</b> <b>water</b> molecules inside Chlorella vulgaris (Beijerinck) var. “viridis” (Chodot) is reported. The first is the Conlon and Outhred (1972 Biochim Biophys Acta 288 : 354 - 361) technique in which extracellular water is doped with paramagnetic Mn 2 + ions. Some complications in application of this technique are identified as being caused by the affinity of Chlorella cell walls for Mn 2 + ions which shortens the NMR relaxation <b>times</b> <b>of</b> intra- and extracellular water. The second is based upon observations of effects of diffusion on the spin echo of intra- and extracellular <b>water.</b> Echo attenuation <b>of</b> intracellular <b>water</b> is distinguished from that <b>of</b> extracellular <b>water</b> by {{the extent to which}} diffusive motion is restricted. Intracellular water, being restricted to the cell volume, suffers less echo attenuation. From the dependence of echo amplitude upon gradient strength at several values <b>of</b> echo <b>time,</b> the mean <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> intracellular <b>water</b> can be determined. From the mean <b>residence</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> intracellular <b>water,</b> the diffusional <b>water</b> permeability coefficient <b>of</b> the Chlorella membrane is calculated to be 2. 1 ± 0. 4 × 10 − 3 cm sec− 1...|$|R
