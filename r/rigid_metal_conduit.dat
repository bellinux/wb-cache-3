5000|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> (RMC) is a {{thick-walled}} threaded tubing, {{usually made}} of coated steel, stainless steel or aluminum.|$|E
50|$|These now-bare {{electrical}} conductors {{inside the}} un-grounded <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> glowed red-hot and started arcing, which ignited the fire.|$|R
50|$|Intermediate <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> (IMC) is a {{steel tubing}} heavier than EMT but lighter than RMC. It may be threaded.|$|R
50|$|Flexible <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> usually uses {{fittings}} with a {{clamp on}} the outside of the box, just like bare cables would.|$|R
50|$|Liquidtight {{flexible}} <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> (LFMC) is {{a metallic}} flexible conduit {{covered by a}} waterproof plastic coating. The interior is similar to FMC.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> may {{also serve as}} a useful bonding {{conductor}} for grounding (earthing), but wiring regulations may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types. While <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> may sometimes be used as a grounding conductor, the circuit length is limited. For example, a long run of conduit as grounding conductor may have too high an electrical resistance, and not allow proper operation of overcurrent devices on a fault.|$|R

5000|$|A conduit {{system can}} be made {{waterproof}} or submersible. <b>Metal</b> <b>conduit</b> {{can be used to}} shield sensitive circuits from electromagnetic interference, and also can prevent emission of such interference from enclosed power cables. Non-metallic conduits resist corrosion and are light-weight, reducing installation labor cost.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{fittings}} {{are considered}} sufficiently conductive to bond (electrically unite) the <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> to a <b>metal</b> junction box (thus sharing the box's ground connection); other times, grounding bushings are used which have bonding jumpers from the bushing to a grounding screw on the box.|$|R
40|$|Propagation of interfering signals delayed. Experiments {{demonstrated}} {{utility of}} slow-wave isolation between transmitting and receiving transducers in acoustic measurements of sound speed and/or flow velocity in ducts. Specifically, finding pertains to acoustic measurements of speeds of flow of low-molecular-weight gases at pressures {{low enough to}} be contained in thin-walled <b>metal</b> <b>conduits...</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1962 riots, four-story Shoemaker Hall {{was under}} {{construction}}. Students took up construction materials, including loose bricks, <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> pipes, and a bulldozer to attack federal officers. The dorm hall {{was the site}} of one of the two fatalities associated with the riots. Each of the men killed was shot execution style.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of CSST lightning damage: 1) Yellow-jacketed CSST should be bonded (connected to the electrical service panel’s ground bus) at its entrance into a building. Many local codes require this. 2) All CSST should be installed away from metal objects such as metal duct work, metal pipes, electrical wiring, metal beams, or <b>metal</b> <b>conduit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The actual {{cause of}} 80% of neon sign {{failures}} is the burnout {{of the high}} voltage electrical wires connecting the tubes inside of <b>metal</b> <b>conduits.</b> A very common type of neon sign is made from a formed metal box having a colored translucent face, called [...] "channel lettering". Newer channel letter signs are being replaced by high brightness LEDs.|$|R
30|$|Self-adhesive {{resin cement}} (G- CEM, USA) {{was used for}} fixing of metal tube to the abutment. A {{customized}} <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> mounting jig was designed, as a holding device, to ensure solid fixation of the sample while recording the measures.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{its larger}} brother - the PGM Hécate II (chambered in [...]50 BMG), the PGM 338 is {{structured}} around a central <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> girder chassis, {{giving it a}} skeletal [...] "barebones" [...] appearance to minimize weight and simplify maintenance.|$|R
2500|$|The lowest plate rails {{of walls}} (usually called [...] "mudsills" [...] or [...] "foundation sills" [...] in North America) are bolted to a {{continuous}} foundation, or secured with <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> connectors {{bolted to the}} foundation so as to resist side-to-side forces.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{lithium-ion}} cylindrical and prismatic cells, {{which have}} a <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> case, LiPo cells have a flexible, foil-type (polymer laminate) case, so they are relatively unconstrained. By themselves the cells are over 20% lighter than equivalent cylindrical cells of the same capacity.|$|R
5000|$|A shark suit is a body-cover suit {{designed}} to protect a diver against shark bite. Various approaches have been attempted with materials ranging from sharp metal spikes that can deter sharks to <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> and plastic plating but most current suits are made of chainmail.|$|R
2500|$|Copper {{thickness}} {{of less than}} [...]25mm is, {{in the case of}} cookware, referred to as foil and must be formed to a more structurally <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> to produce a serviceable vessel. Such applications of copper are purely aesthetic and do not materially contribute to cookware performance.|$|R

50|$|The Long Sword {{dance is}} a hilt-and-point sword dance {{recorded}} mainly in Yorkshire, England. It {{is related to}} the rapper sword dance of Northumbria, but the character is fundamentally different as it uses <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> or wooden swords, rather than the flexible spring steel rappers used by its northern relation.|$|R
5000|$|Built between December 1945 and July 1948, the [...] "Babyface" [...] design {{reflected}} Baldwin {{steam and}} electric locomotive practice. The carbody rode on two massive articulated cast steel half-frames cast by General Steel Castings, linked {{at the middle}} with a hinged joint. Unpowered four-wheel trucks at each end guided the locomotive through curves for stability at speed. Internal wiring was passed through <b>metal</b> <b>conduits</b> exactly like those used on a steam locomotive, which proved troublesome in practice.|$|R
5000|$|Waveguides are <b>metal</b> <b>conduits</b> used {{to confine}} and direct radio signals. They are usually made of brass, but {{aluminium}} and copper are also used. [...] Most commonly they are rectangular, but other cross-sections such as circular or elliptical are possible. A waveguide filter is a filter composed of waveguide components. It has {{much the same}} range of applications as other filter technologies in electronics and radio engineering but is very different mechanically and in principle of operation.|$|R
40|$|Feasibility of metal-to-metal {{androgenous}} seals {{has been}} demonstrated. Techniques to minimize surface irregularities must be examined. Two concepts investigated: 1) Flexible metal interface with elastomeric preloader; 2) Flexibility will accommodate any surface irregularities from the mating surface. <b>Rigid</b> <b>metal</b> interface with elastomeric preloader. Rigidity {{of the metal}} surface will prevent irregularities (waves) from occurring...|$|R

50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} two rings that hang freely from a <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> frame. Each ring {{is supported by a}} strap, which in turn connects to a steel cable that is suspended from the metal frame. The gymnast, who grips one ring with each hand, must control the movement of the rings and his body movements during all time.|$|R
50|$|Since {{cartridge}} heaters {{are installed}} {{in a wide variety}} of machines, manufacturers must design the heaters to meet certain clearances. link The cartridge heaters might be terminated with the leads coming out straight, or in a right angle. Also, manufacturers must be careful that the leads are not exposed to temperatures higher than the maximum rating for the lead wire. In order to prevent lead wire damage from temperature, movement or contamination, the lead wire can be protected with a <b>metal</b> <b>conduit,</b> braided <b>metal</b> or silicone sleeves.|$|R

Fernando Garcia, a bikini designer in South Beach, Miami, turns various exotic material into bikinis including blacklight paint, python skin, Mongolian lamb fringe and black fox material.|$|R
5000|$|Tendon-driven robots (TDR) are robots whose limbs mimic {{biological}} musculoskeletal systems. They use plastic straps {{to mimic}} muscles and tendons. Such robots are claimed {{to move in}} a [...] "more natural" [...] way than traditional robots that use <b>rigid</b> <b>metal</b> or plastic limbs controlled by geared actuators. TDRs can also help understand how biomechanics relates to embodied intelligence and cognition.|$|R
50|$|From 1995 {{through most}} of 1996, Arvid Myhre Building Construction Company of Frenchtown, New Jersey {{completed}} the physical rehabilitation of the house. 26 layers of paint were stripped from the woodwork which was then repainted in historically accurate colors. Behind-the-scenes work included complete upgrades of heating and cooling systems, new electrical wiring encased in <b>metal</b> <b>conduit,</b> a state-of-the-art dry-feed fire suppression system, and new plumbing and water supply systems. Additionally, an exhibit system was fabricated to protect the original plaster walls, while still allowing the museum to install changing exhibitions.|$|R
40|$|Conformal transformations {{are often}} applied to solve 2 D Laplacian problems. We present results {{for a few}} {{examples}} {{in the field of}} electromagnetic compatibility. First we derive the mutual inductances M for a printed circuit board and the straight tracks, above a metal cabinet plane. Secondly, <b>metal</b> <b>conduits</b> protect cables inside them. A good measure is the transfer impedance Zt, which is dominated by a position dependent mutual inductance M above a few kHz. Finally a cover on a conduit is calculated. All results compare well with the measurements, which have been reported elsewhere...|$|R
