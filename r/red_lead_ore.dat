50|$|At first {{his work}} {{appeared}} {{as that of}} his master and patron, then in their joint names; in 1790 he began to publish on his own, and between that year and 1833 his name is associated with 376 papers. Most of these were simple records of patient and laborious analytical operations, and it is perhaps surprising that among all the substances he analysed he only detected two new elements, beryllium in 1798 in beryl and chromium in 1797 in a <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> <b>ore</b> from Siberia. He also managed to get liquid ammonia at atmospheric pressure.Later with Fourcroy, he identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène, This name ‘ptene’ or ‘ptène’ was reported as an early synonym for osmium..|$|E
5000|$|In 1761 the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences {{invited him}} to St Petersburg, where he became {{professor}} of chemistry {{and director of the}} imperial museum there. At the Beryozovskoye deposit in the Urals he discovered a <b>lead</b> <b>ore</b> with a reddish-orange mineral (PbCrO4), which he named [...] "Rotbleierz" [...] (<b>red</b> <b>lead</b> ore); today in English its name is crocoite.|$|R
5000|$|Bismuth(III) oxide {{is perhaps}} the most industrially {{important}} compound of bismuth. It is also a common starting point for bismuth chemistry. It is found naturally as the mineral bismite (monoclinic) and sphaerobismoite (tetragonal, much more rare), but it is usually obtained as a by-product of the smelting of copper and <b>lead</b> <b>ores.</b> Bismuth trioxide is commonly used to produce the [...] "Dragon's eggs" [...] effect in fireworks, as a replacement of <b>red</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|R

By 1863, 980 tons of <b>lead</b> <b>ore</b> and 230 tons of copper ore were exported from the district, representing 14% of the colony's total annual exports, exceeded only by wool (52%) and sandalwood (18%).

50|$|They were {{formerly}} confused {{under the}} names green <b>lead</b> <b>ore</b> and brown <b>lead</b> <b>ore</b> (German: Grünbleierz and Braunbleierz).

40|$|The {{smelting}} {{of complex}} <b>lead</b> <b>ores</b> {{is a difficult}} operation, especially when they contain considerable amounts of iron and zinc.

5|$|Most <b>lead</b> <b>ores</b> {{contain a}} low {{percentage}} of <b>lead</b> (rich <b>ores</b> have a typical content of 3–8%) {{which must be}} concentrated for extraction. During initial processing, ores typically undergo crushing, dense-medium separation, grinding, froth flotation, and drying. The resulting concentrate, which has a lead content of 30–80% by mass (regularly 50–60%), is then turned into (impure) lead metal.|$|R
