50|$|Mini-automatic <b>radar</b> <b>plotting</b> aid (or MARPA) is a radar {{feature for}} target {{tracking}} and collision avoidance. Targets must be manually selected, but are then tracked automatically, including range, bearing, target speed, target direction (course), CPA (closest point of approach), and TCPA (time of closest point of approach), safe or dangerous indication, and proximity alarm. MARPA {{is a more}} basic form of ARPA (automatic <b>radar</b> <b>plotting</b> aid).|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{enormous}} {{potential of}} complex data files generated by 10 -color flow cytometry (FC) is hindered by {{the requirement for}} exhaustive manual gating and the complexity of multidimensional data visualization. We propose a model using <b>radar</b> <b>plots</b> (RPs), to improve FC data visualization by capturing multidimensionality and integration of FC findings. Method: We analysed 12 normal/reactive bone marrow (N/R BM) samples and 12 BM samples from patients with myelodysplasia (MDS) with 10 -color FC. All identifiable cell clusters were individually marked, grouped, and visualized on <b>radar</b> <b>plots.</b> RPs were optimized to de-clutter the cell clusters and map BM cell composition and maturation. Results: A total of 27 immature and mature cell clusters were identified and visualized on 8 multidimensional <b>radar</b> <b>plots.</b> The RPs displayed flow cytometry findings of normal BM in an integrated fashion to maximize overall insight into the data set. The constructed map of bone marrow cell composition was reproducible in all normal BM samples analyzed. Analysis of the pilot cohort of patient samples confirmed the presence of MDS-related changes. These changes are readily identifiable on RPs. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the cell clusters of normal BM can be mapped on multidimensional <b>radar</b> <b>plots,</b> which provide an inclusive insight into BM cell composition and maturation. These reproducible RPs present a comprehensive and comprehensible visual display of differentiation and maturation of haematopoietic cells in normal BM, {{and can be used}} as a reference map to assess abnormal haematopoiesis in MDS...|$|R

50|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>plots</b> {{show the}} {{aircraft}} maintained a straight course {{over the last}} 50 km of the flight until impact, {{in line with the}} planned route. The plots did not indicate tactical low-level flying, although that was an optional plan for part of the route if weather conditions allowed. Just prior to the crash, Swedish air traffic controllers at Kiruna cleared the Hercules to descend to 7,000 feet (2,134 meters). This altitude is just 20 meters above the height of the top of the Kebnekaise mountain. The altitudes for the continuous <b>radar</b> <b>plots</b> remained in the possession of the accident investigation board and were not released.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 February 1945, Bebas cleared Eniwetok {{in company}} with the tankers [...] and SS Egg Harbor, bound for Ulithi. On the second night out, Bebas and her two charges {{identified}} another convoy as friendly and then picked up a surface radar contact which a quick exchange of information showed to be [...] "definitely suspicious."

At 00:54, gun-flashes from Vincennes and her sisters' main battery split the night; both main and secondary batteries — 6 and 5-inch guns — in company with the 5-inch guns of the destroyers, hurled salvoes at the enemy vessel. The vessel — tentatively identified as a cruiser — sank beneath the waves at 01:49 {{as a result of the}} deluge of rapid shellfire.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s plot {{extraction}} equipment was introduced, this took {{the primary and}} associated secondary radar outputs, combined and processed them before sending them over telephone lines to the L1. The RPEARDS (<b>Radar</b> <b>Plot</b> Extraction And Remote Display Equipment) was a hard-wired computer that processed, combined and transmitted the signals. The memory was magnetic core store that had the capacity of some 1000 words, each of over 60 bits in length, transmission over the telephone line was at 2400 baud using GMSK.

5000|$|A short lull {{followed}} {{after the}} <b>radar</b> <b>plot</b> showed four Japanese ships, just {{clear of the}} left tangent of Savo, approaching from the starboard bow, range 5800 yd. Searchlights from the second ship in the Japanese column illuminated South Dakota. Washington opened with her main battery on the leading, and largest, Japanese ship. South Dakotas secondary batteries put out the lights, and it shifted all batteries {{to bear on the}} third ship, believed to be a cruiser, which soon gushed smoke. That night, an error in engine room switchboards left South Dakota powerless: without its radars, it no longer had a grasp on the complicated tactical situation. South Dakota, under fire from at least three ships, took 26 hits, causing considerable damage. Its radio communications failed, <b>radar</b> <b>plot</b> was demolished, three fire control radars were damaged, there was a fire in her foremast, and it had lost track of Washington. As South Dakota was no longer receiving enemy fire and there were no remaining targets, it withdrew, met Washington at a prearranged rendezvous, and proceeded to Nouméa. Out of the American destroyers, only Gwin returned to port; the other three had been severely damaged early in the engagement: Walke and Preston were sunk, and Benham had part of its bow blown off by a torpedo, and, while en route to Nouméa with the damaged Gwin as its escort, had to be abandoned. Gwin then sank it by gunfire. On the Japanese side, hits had been scored on Takao and Atago (both survived); Kirishima and the destroyer [...] were both severely damaged by gunfire, and were abandoned and scuttled.|$|E

Helicopters were assisting the search for Flight 3275 and 500 soldiers had taken part in the search and rescue operation. Flight 3275 was officially declared as missing. Search and rescue team searched the plane overnight with thermal imaging and night-vision equipment. Search and rescue operation was hampered by weather, mountainous terrain, and mines in the area. The wreckage of the plane was found on November 14, 1999 on a steep mountainside, located approximately 7 miles {{from the town of}} Mitrovica. There were no signs of life among the wreckage. First responder who arrived first at the scene stated that several charred bodies were found around the wreckage of the plane. Only the tail of the plane was still intact.

5000|$|Detached from duty at Majuro on 13 June, Burden R. Hastings headed via Eniwetok for Pearl Harbor, {{proceeding}} independently.

The small [...] "pip" [...] {{on the radar screen}} indicated either a surfaced submarine or a small craft, so the captain decided to close range to 5,000 yards and challenge the stranger visually. Burden R. Hastings proceeded ahead through the moderate sea while her quarry moved at 18 knots. The destroyer escort rang up 19.5 knots to close range and went to General Quarters. At 0337, when the two ships were 5,000 yards apart, Burden R. Hastings challenged thrice with an Aldis lamp but received no reply.

Bunch served as convoy guide for the passage, which was undertaken to permit the two craft in tow to receive repairs. The high-speed transport and her charges reached Shanghai on 22 December, and Bunch spent {{the remainder of the}} month at moored to a succession of buoys in the port.

5000|$|Track {{initiation}} is {{the process}} of creating a new radar track from an unassociated <b>radar</b> <b>plot.</b> When the tracker is first switched on, all the initial radar plots are used to create new tracks, but once the tracker is running, only those plots that couldn't be used to update an existing track are used to spawn new tracks. Typically a new track is given the status of tentative until plots from subsequent radar updates have been successfully associated with the new track. Tentative tracks are not shown to the operator and so they provide a means of preventing false tracks from appearing on the screen - at the expense of some delay in the first reporting of a track. Once several updates have been received, the track is confirmed and displayed to the operator. The most common criterion for promoting a tentative track to a confirmed track is the [...] "M-of-N rule", which states that during the last N radar updates, at least M plots must have been associated with the tentative track - with M=3 and N=5 being typical values. More sophisticated approaches may use a statistical approach in which a track becomes confirmed when, for instance, its covariance matrix falls to a given size.|$|E
