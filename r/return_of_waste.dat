40|$|Supplemental {{irrigation}} water supplies {{will be required}} if the present rate of groundwater withdrawal is continued. An alternate {{irrigation water}} supply source will be needed even sooner if irrigation developmental trends continue. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the least cost method of supplying irrigation water to the Box Butte County area from an alternate source. This suggests the importation of water into the region since adequate supplies do not exist within the county. Irrigation water requirements will be determined as a criteria for project water supply. Costing and associated water losses for project component structures will be developed and used in the selection of the least cost method of meeting the irrigation water requirements. Total project cost and cost per acre-foot of water will be determined. Specific objectives are: To determine irrigation water requirements for Box Butte County in 1980. To develop costs and technical coefficients which can be used in a process for the selection of irrigation project component structures. To determine the least cost method of meeting the irrigation water requirement criteria. To determine the total project cost. To determine the cost per acre-foot of supplying the required irrigation water. The irrigation water requirement for Box Butte County in 1980 was determined to be 159, 481 acre-feet. This is the irrigation requirement for an estimated 73, 800 acres which are expected to be developed for irrigation by then. The irrigation requirement is 2. 16 acre-feet per acre with an average effective irrigation requirement of about 15 Â¼ inches for the crops grown in the area. The least cost method of supplying irrigation water from outside the county involves a system for extraction of groundwater from southern Sheridan County and moving it into Box Butte County. The system includes 465 wells located along a canal and collection lines in Sheridan County. A surface storage reservoir with about 61, 300 acre-feet capacity is located on Box Butte Creek. A nineteen mile pipeline is required to lift water a height of 100 to 400 feet from the reservoir to the four irrigation areas. Lateral distribution systems are required to deliver water to the four irrigation areas and structures for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> water are required. On-site wells which recycle percolated water are also included in the least cost system. Advisor: Maurice Bake...|$|E

This paper develops a two-country model to solve for optimal tax policies to achieve the efficient level of economic resources in an economy with global reuse. In the baseline case both the developed and developing economies are able to initiate tax policies to internalize the social costs <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> disposal. Unsurprisingly, optimal policy requires each disposal tax to be set equal to the external marginal cost within each country. The model is then extended to the more interesting case where only the developed nation can tax waste. The global Pareto Optimum can still be obtained by either taxing the importation of the used durable good or subsidizing consumer <b>return</b> <b>of</b> durable <b>waste</b> for eventual disposal back in the developed country.

A simulation study was performed using the model PASIM to extrapolate potential emissions from grassland/livestock systems under alternative climate/soil/plant/management regimes at 12 French sites. Fluxes of CO 2 associated with those of N 2 O indicate that both gases may be controlled by similar or concomitant environmental factors. In particular, CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes {{were higher in the}} temporary grasslands, where grass management (mowing, N fertilization) promotes increased plant respiration and soil organic matter turnover. In these systems, high CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were accompanied by absence of CH 4 emissions. Similar responses were observed with intensive permanent grasslands, where the presence of grazing animals also determines CH 4 emissions. High CH 4, and low CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes were generally estimated with extensive permanent pastures. While there are site-to-site and climate-to-climate variations, a general conclusion is that the GWP is expected to decrease in the future as result of increased soil dryness and C stocking. Also, temporary grasslands are indicated as the most desirable land use in reducing global warming.

Despite the adoption <b>of</b> several <b>waste</b> management strategies, waste reduction to landfill continues seeming an insurmountable challenge. This paper explores factors impeding the effectiveness <b>of</b> existing <b>waste</b> management strategies, as well as strategies for reducing <b>waste</b> intensiveness <b>of</b> the construction industry. Drawing on series of semi structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading construction companies, this paper combines phenomenological approach with a critical review and analysis of extant literatures. Five broad categories of factors and practices are responsible for ineffectiveness of construction and demolition waste management strategies, which subsequently results in <b>waste</b> intensiveness <b>of</b> the industry. These include end of pipe treatment <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> externality and incompatibility <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management tools with design tools, atomism <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management strategies, perceived or unexpected high cost <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management, and culture <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour within the industry. To reduce <b>waste</b> intensiveness <b>of</b> the construction industry, the study suggests that six factors are requisites. These are tackling <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> at design stage, whole life <b>waste</b> consideration, compliance <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management solutions with BIM, cheaper cost <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management practice, increased stringency <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management legislation and fiscal policies, and research and enlightenment.
