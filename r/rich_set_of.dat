5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had {{at least}} one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that emphasizes the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} 2nd-century {{collection of}} Orphic Hymns (second century AD) and the Saturnalia of Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius (fifth century) {{are influenced by}} the theories of rationalism and the syncretizing trends as well. The Orphic Hymns are a set of pre-classical poetic compositions, attributed to Orpheus, himself the subject of a renowned myth. In reality, these poems were probably composed by several different poets, and contain a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> clues about prehistoric European mythology. The stated purpose of the Saturnalia is to transmit the Hellenic culture Macrobius has derived from his reading, even though much of his treatment of gods is colored by Egyptian and North African mythology and theology (which also affect the interpretation of Virgil). In Saturnalia reappear mythographical comments influenced by the Euhemerists, the Stoics and the Neoplatonists.|$|E

Scheme inherits a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> list-processing primitives such as cons, car and cdr from its Lisp progenitors. Scheme uses strictly but dynamically typed variables and supports first class procedures. Thus, procedures can be assigned as values to variables or passed as arguments to procedures.|$|E
25|$|A set of interrupt-driven user {{interface}} routines called Pinball provided keyboard and display {{services for the}} jobs and tasks running on the AGC. A <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> user-accessible routines were provided to let the operator (astronaut) display the contents of various memory locations in octal or decimal in groups of 1, 2, or 3 registers at a time. Monitor routines were provided so the operator could initiate a task to periodically redisplay the contents of certain memory locations. Jobs could be initiated. The Pinball routines performed the (very rough) equivalent of the UNIX shell.|$|E

VB includes a <b>richer</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> classes for UI manipulation, whereas LotusScript includes a <b>richer</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> application-specific classes for Lotus Notes, Lotus Word Pro and Lotus 1-2-3. In the case of Lotus Notes, there are classes to work with Notes databases, documents (records) in those databases, etc. These classes can also be used as OLE Automation objects outside of the Lotus Notes environment, from Visual Basic.|$|R
25|$|Tsez has a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> particles, {{most of them}} {{occurring}} as clitics. The particle -tow shows general emphasis while -kin shows general emphasis and focusing. A contrastively topicalized constituent {{is marked}} by the particle -gon. Being clitics, they can be attached to any part of speech. There is also a quotation particle that is used in direct reported speech and appears as the suffix -ƛin that always appears {{at the end of}} the quoted phrase or sentence. Example: Di žekʼu yołƛin eƛix kʼetʼā ("'I am a man', says the cat"). There are also other free particles like hudu ("yes, so") or āy ("no").|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} body of text {{appears in}} runic inscriptions and in poems composed c. 900 by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (although the poems are not preserved in contemporary sources, {{but only in}} much later manuscripts). The earliest manuscripts are from the period 1150–1200 and concern both legal, religious and historical matters. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Trøndelag and Western Norway {{were the most important}} areas of the Norwegian kingdom and they shaped Old West Norse as an archaic language with a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> declensions. In the body of text that has come down to us from until c. 1300, Old West Norse had little dialect variation, and Old Icelandic does not diverge much more than the Old Norwegian dialects do from each other.|$|E
25|$|The Met's {{collection}} of photographs, numbering more than 25,000 in total, {{is centered on}} five major collections plus additional acquisitions by the museum. Alfred Stieglitz, a famous photographer himself, donated the first major {{collection of}} photographs to the museum, which included a comprehensive survey of Photo-Secessionist works, a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> master prints by Edward Steichen, and an outstanding collection of Stieglitz's photographs from his own studio. The Met supplemented Stieglitz's gift with the 8,500-piece Gilman Paper Company Collection, the Rubel Collection, and the Ford Motor Company Collection, which respectively provided the collection with early French and American photography, early British photography, and post-WWI American and European photography. The museum also acquired Walker Evans's personal collection of photographs, a particular coup considering the high demand for his works. The department of photography was founded in 1992. Though the department gained a permanent gallery in 1997, {{not all of the}} department's holdings are on display at any given time, due to the sensitive materials represented in the photography collection. However, the Photographs department has produced some of the best-received temporary exhibits in the Met's recent past, including a Diane Arbus retrospective and an extensive show devoted to spirit photography. In 2007, the museum designated a gallery exclusively for the exhibition of photographs made after 1960.|$|E
40|$|PERT-type {{subjective}} estimations {{are used}} in many stochastic decision models to estimate the random variables' {{mean and standard deviation}} (s. d.). The approach is based on the beta-distribution assumption; also, most PERT-type formulas use only three estimated fractiles. We point out that: (i) it is desirable to consider a substantially <b>richer</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> distributions than the beta in developing PERT-type formulas; (ii) it may be beneficial to use more than three fractile-estimates in PERT-type formulas. We then develop formulas for estimating the mean and s. d. that are based on a substantially <b>richer</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> distributions than the beta and that use more than three estimated fractiles. These formulas perform better than the best currently-available formulas when the subjective distribution is not restricted to be beta. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Modern military concepts, such as [...] "battlefield awareness", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a <b>rich</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions.
