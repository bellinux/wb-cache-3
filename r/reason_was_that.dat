5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|But {{the real}} <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{production}} had financial issues, with {{the acquisition of}} new crew members {{and the increase in}} popularity of Doctor Leonard McCoy meaning that those salaries needed {{to come out of the}} original budget. In Justman and Herb Solow's 1996 book Inside Star Trek, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney's limited appearances and the financial issues that the series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due to rising costs.|$|E

30|$|Sign-changing {{solutions}} of nonlinear elliptic equations {{have attracted}} much attention in recent years. One <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sign-changing solutions arise naturally from mathematical models in biology and physics.

5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no one had {{a copy of the}} treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders {{released}} Last Splash in August 1993; {{the album was}} very successful, and its release was followed by much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album {{was going to be a}} Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal wanted to do a solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be part of any immediate Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in the 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) {{were made of}} wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl {{took over}} {{at a time when}} South Africa was putting {{increasing}} pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March 1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town to explain why the Rhodesian government had detained Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African National Union, who was accused of plotting against other black nationalist leaders. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and suspected that the real <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo. Van der Byl was unsuccessful in reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} eight <b>reasons</b> why it <b>is</b> rational not {{to trust}} large complex Anglo corpora-tions {{and how these}} <b>reasons</b> could <b>be</b> removed. Two <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> directors <b>are</b> overloaded with information but also lack information independent of management to evaluate manage-ment and the business. A third <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> directors do not have systemic processes to dis-cover if their trust in management is misplaced. A fourth and fifth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> directors have absolute power to manage their own conflicts of interest and a dominant shareholder can enter into related party transactions that can unfairly extract value. The sixth and seventh <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> the incentive for directors not {{to blow the whistle}} on their colleagues and the impotence of a director to act alone. The eighth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> shares can <b>be</b> manipulated and traded cov-ertly. Four changes in corporate constitutions <b>are</b> identified <b>that</b> could remove these concerns. These are to establish a watchdog board, introduce cumulative voting for directors, establish stakeholder councils and introducing sunlight share trading...|$|R

5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This is {{attributed}} to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Koṇḍañña considered his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Koṇḍañña's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, Vestfoldfly never {{received}} a concession for a regular, scheduled flight from Sandefjord to Oslo. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Skien-based Fjellfly held the concession for the routes from Oslo to Sandefjord, Tønsberg and Skien. Fjellfly never used its landing rights at Sandefjord, but nevertheless still hindered Vestfoldfly from starting a competing route. Skaunfelt eventually split his activity in two, demerging the aviation school and renaming it Den Norske Luftfartsskole, which remained in operation until 1999. The other activity was renamed Norsk Flytjeneste. In 1969, Norsk Flytjeneste and Jotun, a large Sandefjord-based industrial company, established Penguin Air Service, where Norsk Flytjeneste owned 25 {{percent of the}} shares. Penguin Air Service company bought a six-seat Piper PA-31 Navajo and started charter services for Jotun. In 1975, Bugge Supplyship also joined the joint venture and a second aircraft was bought. Most of the traffic was for the oil industry to Stavanger.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made {{not on a}} basketball court, but rather {{in a court of}} law. It was the year of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.|$|E

5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that {{her use of}} loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin. He also felt that Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include {{the top of the}} head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham's <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{announced}} in February1993 {{that they were}} considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Widerøe articulated that Båtsfjord Airport {{did not meet the}} demands for future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash8, which would be phased in between 1993 and 1995, they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. The CAA stated, instead, that the new airport should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including Båtsfjord.|$|E

50|$|When {{using in}} situremediation the {{reactive}} products {{must be considered}} for two <b>reasons.</b> One <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a reactive product might be more harmful or mobile than the parent compound.

TCE (trichloroethylene), under reducing conditions by nanoiron, may sequentially dechlorinate to DCE (dichloroethene) and VC (vinyl chloride). VC {{is known to be}} more harmful than TCE, meaning this process would be undesirable.|$|R
5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a pilot programme in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E
