40|$|A general {{relationship}} between the gains of multiterminal amplifiers is derived in this paper. It reveals a constraint for the simultaneous improvement of the common-mode and the power-supply <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios</b> of the simple operational amplifier. This constraint can be relaxed by either adding a supplementary input terminal to the amplifier circuit or using a fully differential design. The method {{can be used to}} improve the power-supply <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios</b> in operational amplifiers. Several implementations of a two-stage operational amplifier illustrate this technique...|$|R

25|$|While the 741 was {{historically}} used in {{audio and}} other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare {{because of the}} improved noise performance of more modern op-amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op-amps may have poor common-mode <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios</b> and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.|$|R
25|$|Power-supply rejection: The {{output of}} a perfect {{operational}} amplifier will be completely independent from its power supply. Every real operational amplifier has a finite power supply <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio</b> (PSRR) that reflects how well the op-amp can reject changes in its supply voltage.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a {{receiver}} to reject interfering signals at the image frequency {{is measured by the}} image <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio.</b> This is the ratio (in decibels) of the output of the receiver from a signal at the received frequency, to its output for an equal-strength signal at the image frequency.|$|E
25|$|Common-mode gain: A perfect {{operational}} amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages {{that are common}} to both. However, the differential input stage of an {{operational amplifier}} is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the common-mode <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio</b> (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.|$|E

25|$|Widlar {{disposed}} with hybrid technology, {{and used}} only diffused resistors formed within the silicon die. Each {{of the nine}} NPN transistors was sized and shaped according to its function, contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimal-area patterns. Widlar introduced three innovations: interfacing a long-tail with a single-ended stage without losing half of the gain, shifting the DC level using only NPN transistors, and optional frequency compensation with an external capacitor. Compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 25-30MHz, an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time. Widlar did not consider the μA702 prototype good enough for production, but Fairchild decided otherwise and rushed the chip into production in October 1964. The device set the direction for the industry for decades, despite poor common-mode <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio,</b> weak output drive capabilities, and a price of $300. According to Jack Gifford, the top management of Fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of Widlar's existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market.|$|E
25|$|Power supply {{imperfections}} (e.g., {{power signal}} ripple, non-zero source impedance) {{may lead to}} noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified power supply <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio</b> that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).|$|E
500|$|Atomic line {{filters are}} {{inherently}} very efficient filters, generally classified as [...] "ultra-high-Q" [...] as their Q factor {{is in the}} 105 to 106 range. This is partially because the, [...] "crossed polarizers ... serve to block out background light with a <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio</b> better than 10−5". The passband of a typical Faraday filter may be a few GHz. The total output of a Faraday filter may be around 50% of the total input light intensity. The light lost is reflected or absorbed by imperfect lenses, filters and windows.|$|E

2500|$|The Zobel {{networks}} {{described here}} {{can be used to}} equalise land lines composed of twisted pair or star quad cables. [...] The balanced circuit nature of these lines delivers a good common mode <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio</b> (CMRR). [...] To maintain the CMRR, circuits connected to the line should maintain the balance. [...] For this reason, balanced versions of Zobel networks are sometimes required. [...] This is achieved by halving the impedance of the series components and then putting identical components in the return leg of the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|However, as {{mentioned}} above, the 10 log intensity convention prevails more generally in physical optics, [...] including fiber optics, so the terminology can become murky between {{the conventions of}} digital photographic technology and physics. Most commonly, quantities called [...] "dynamic range" [...] or [...] "signal-to-noise" [...] (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio)</b> the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a waveguide-type dual-polarization sideband-separating SIS receiver {{system of the}} 100 -GHz band for the 45 -m radio telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, Japan. This receiver is composed of an ortho-mode transducer and two sideband-separating SIS mixers, which are both based on the waveguide technique. The receiver has four intermediate frequency bands of 4. 0 – 8. 0 GHz. Over the radio frequency range of 80 – 120 GHz, the single-sideband receiver noise temperatures are 50 – 100 K and the image <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios</b> are greater than 10 dB.

40|$|Transistor random {{mismatch}} continuously {{poses challenges}} for analog/RF circuit design for achieving high accuracy and high yield {{as the process}} technology advances. Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation, we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is current source calibration {{and the other is}} phase/delay calibration. To verify this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design. The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving harmonic <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios.</b> With the high calibration resolution provided by the ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios.</b> To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a current-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based amplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance. Simulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude linearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC. Comment: CMU PhD Thesi...|$|R
