50|$|The {{complete}} Chua K'a Bodywork procedure {{consists of}} a comprehensive massage of the 27 zones of the body, followed by a <b>rolling</b> of the <b>skin</b> (<b>skin</b> <b>rolling),</b> and ending with {{the application of the}} k'a stick. In the technique of <b>skin</b> <b>rolling,</b> developed by Ichazo, the skin and subcutaneous tissues are rolled over the deep structures, lifting the dermis and hypodermis off the deeper fascia. This technique is recognized to reduce pain, restore mobility, and to stimulate circulation and lymph drainage. The three-part Chua K'a Bodywork method integrates these physical aspects of bodywork with a systematic practice of 'conscious awareness' by directly applying the vital energy flow in the body, originating from the point in the lower belly recognized in Chinese medicine and martial arts as the tan t'ien (known in the Arica method as the Kath).|$|R

50|$|Any {{impairment}} {{of the electric}} contact between sensor scanning element and workpiece is, {{in the case of}} electric-contact sensors, problematic, e.g. welding spatters at the shielding gas nozzle, scale and <b>rolling</b> <b>skin</b> on the workpiece surface or through a wire electrode end which has molten spheroidally and has adherence of slag.When mechanical-contact sensors are used, the scanning elements must be adapted to the respective groove shapes. Butt welds with a square butt joint preparation must have a groove gap of more than 3 mm; in overlap joints the top plate must have a thickness of more than 3 mm.The sensor must be mounted separately from the welding torch.Thus, the groove scanning is mainly carried out in a leading position in front of the torch. If the welds are mainly straight, this adjustment is no problem. It is also possible to use scanning element arrays (e.g. fork callipers or separated scanning elements for height and lateral scanning which allow scanning in the torch level and thus weld scanning which is almost free from errors. Apart from the torch guidance along a weld groove, mechanical contact sensors can also be applied for detection of the weld start and end of the weld.|$|E

40|$|The {{consequences}} of selection for ‘Soft <b>Rolling</b> <b>Skin</b> ’ (SRS) {{were examined in}} two age groups of South Australian Merino ewes which were objectively measured and subjectively assessed {{for a wide range}} of skin, fleece and body traits. The pooled (over age groups) heritability of SRS score was 0. 29. SRS score had a low to moderate but favourable correlation with fibre diameter, fibre diameter variability, percentage of fibres greater than 30 um and S/P ratio. The calculation of selection differentials indicated that the use of SRS as a selection criterion (within a flock) could provide benefits. SRS selection achieved similar (negative) selection differentials in fibre diameter as an index based approach, but it resulted in smaller (positive) differentials in clean fleece weight. At high selection intensity index based selection resulted in a negative selection differential for staple strength, whereas SRS selection did not. Both SRS and index selection resulted in small but generally favourable selection differentials in subjectively assessed wool characters. It is concluded that the SRS approach and index based selection are not as antagonistic as often portrayed in the rural press...|$|E
40|$|For {{a number}} of years the Merino {{industry}} has debated the merits of alternative sheep selection systems. In 1996 the Selection Demonstration Flocks were established to highlight {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} alternative sheep selection systems. Three selection demonstration flocks (SDFs) of 200 breeding ewes in each flock were established. A fourth, randomly selected flock of the same size has been maintained as a control group. The SDFs represent: 1. Selection predominantly driven by measurement and performance recording; 2. Selection by visual and tactile appraisal by professional sheep classers, and 3. Selection using the technological package of advocates of the 2 ̆ 7 soft <b>rolling</b> <b>skin</b> 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 elite wool flock 2 ̆ 7 approach. A meat Merino line (FM+) has been introduced to demonstrate the attributes of both fibre plus meat traits in conventional Merinos. Results for the fifth (2001) drop from the original flocks and the second drop of the meat Merino line are presented and discussed. The results from selected ewes originating from earlier drops (1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000) are also reported. All selection systems have made significant gains in comparison with the Control flock and after two years of results the FM+ is clearly superior in meat production traits. In previous years (1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000) the rate of genetic improvement has been very similar between selection systems. The 2001 drop provides the first indication of divergence between the selection lines. Further years of results will confirm whether differences are due to selection methods...|$|E
40|$|Merino woolgrowers can {{maintain}} and increase technical and economic productivity by genetic {{improvement in their}} flocks. In recent years, genetic improvement in the Merino sheep industry {{has been the subject}} of considerable contentious public debate - in particular, the selection for sheep with a type of skin called soft <b>rolling</b> <b>skin</b> (SRS). Hence, one aim in this thesis is to explore ways of evaluating the benefits and costs from an innovation in sheep selection aimed at improving, and realising, the genetic potential of the animals in the farm system. At the farm level, proposed changes of introducing genetic material with traits such as high secondary to primary follicle ratios (> 40 : 1) for each case studies whole farm system, combined with significant extra inputs to the system, illustrated that for these individual farming systems, there was adequate economic and financial reward to implement the proposed change, if the most likely outcomes occur. In year 12 (steady state) both case studies had a real return on extra capital of greater than 23 percent based on the expected scenario. In such a scenario, if the new genetics incur fewer environmental demands than expected, then real return on extra capital for both case studies would be greater than 40 percent (table 4. 2). Based on the most likely scenario, the real internal rate of return over 12 years for both case studies, was greater than twelve and a half percent (table 4. 3). The variability of greasy wool characteristics creates uncertainty for processors as to the exact characteristics of the fibre in a wool lot. This makes it difficult to accurately predict how a wool lot will perform during the numerous processes required to convert greasy wool to the final product. The variability of the most important greasy wool characteristics, fibre diameter is not objectively available pre-sale in the sale catalogue. The analysis of sales studied for elite-type wools, showed that these wools did not receive significantly higher prices than non-elite type wools with very similar objective measurements. The null hypothesis (H 0) tested, was that the price of elite-type wool was the same as the price of non-elite type wool. The alternative hypothesis (Hi) was that the price of elite-type wool would be greater than the price of non-elite type wool. The one tailed T -test (table 3. 3) showed that the price of the elite-type wool was the same as the non-elite type wool i. e. the null hypothesis (H 0) was accepted.

40|$|T {{cell homing}} to sites of injury and {{inflammation}} {{is a critical}} step for adaptive immune responses. While much has been learned regarding T cell homing to lymphoid tissues, few studies have directly observed trafficking events during an effector response. In this study, we developed a model that uses intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy to determine the molecules critical to T cell <b>rolling</b> within <b>skin</b> allograft microvasculature during the effector phase of the rejection response. Additional studies were performed to quantify T cell infiltrates as rejection progressed. We found that P-selectin and E-selectin expressed on postcapillary venules play overlapping roles in the recruitment of activated T cells in a SCID reconstitution model of skin graft rejection and are important in T cell accumulation at the graft site. Surprisingly, {{we also found that}} naive T cells are recruited and accumulate via constitutive T cell L-selectin and upregulated L-selectin ligands on rejecting allograft vasculature. These data indicated that a specific retinue of molecules is upregulated during the rejection response, and they suggest potential future therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|Leukocyte extravasation is {{initiated}} by an interaction of selectin adhesion molecules and appropriate carbohydrate ligands. Targeting those interactions seems a promising approach to treat chronic inflammation. We developed a beta- 1, 3 -glucan sulfate (PS 3) with inhibitory activity toward L and P-selectins under static conditions. Here, detailed investigation showed inhibition of P- and L-selectins, but not E-selectin under flow conditions (relative reduction of interaction with appropriate ligands to 34. 4 +/- 16. 6, 8. 5 +/- 3. 6, or 99. 5 +/- 9. 9 %, respectively, by PS 3 for P-, L- or E-selectin). Intravital microscopy revealed reduction of leukocyte <b>rolling</b> in <b>skin</b> microvasculature from 22. 7 +/- 5. 0 to 12. 6 +/- 4. 0 % after injection of PS 3. In the next experiments, mice were sensitized with 2, 4,-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), and lymphocytes were transferred into syngeneic recipients, which were challenged by DNFB. Inflammatory responses were reduced when immunity was generated in mice treated with PS 3 or in L-selectin-deficient mice. No effect was observed when L-selectin-deficient donor mice {{were treated with}} PS 3, further suggesting that PS 3 acted primarily through inhibition of L-selectin. Elicitation of a contact hypersensitivity response was reduced in P-selectin-deficient and in PS 3 -treated mice. Again, PS 3 had no effect in P-selectin-deficient mice. PS 3 is a potent P- and L-selectin inhibitor that may add to the therapy of inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|Mast cell {{numbers are}} {{markedly}} increased at sites of chronic inflammation. However, {{the underlying mechanisms}} of mast cell accumulation including mast cell progenitor trafficking remain to be identified in detail. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to identify the adhesion molecules involved in rolling, firm adhesion and transendothelial diapedesis of murine bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMC) as a model for immature mast cells. We could show that BMCMCs exhibit in vivo <b>rolling</b> on <b>skin</b> vessel walls and strong adhesion to skin endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro under static and flow conditions. Interestingly, interaction of BMCMC with the EC adhesion molecules E- and P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) is required to mediate rolling and firm adhesion to ECs. The adhesion of BMCMCs to skin ECs is further enhanced by TNF, IL- 4, IL- 15 and vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Furthermore, BMCMCs exhibit directed and dose-dependent transmigration across an endothelial barrier, mediated by a PECAM- 1 -dependent mechanism. Our results demonstrate that BMCMCs can undergo a tightly regulated extravasation cascade consisting of rolling on and adhesion to endothelium and followed by directed diapedesis and reveal selectins, VCAM- 1 and PECAM- 1 as required adhesion molecules. These processes may contribute to mast cell accumulation in chronic inflammatory skin diseases and reveal opportunities to modulate peripheral tissue numbers of mast cells...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Objectives: This review {{examines}} diagnostic {{factors of}} myofascial pain syndrome [MPS] and fibromyalgia [FMS], and their differential diagnosis. Findings:A base of electrophysiologic and anatomic data exists {{that supports the}} clinical identification of myofascial trigger point [TrP] fea-tures.

It is not clear if either response to electrical stimulation of the parietal tissues or the <b>skin</b> <b>rolling</b> test will provide the necessary specificity. Biochemical markers such as substance P elevation in spinal fluid may be sensitive for FMS, but the specificity of the finding is unknown.

40|$|The {{process chain}} for sheet metals after casting to produce {{components}} made of semi-finished products {{is complex and}} the resulting mechanical properties of the produced material depend strongly {{on the evolution of}} the microstructure. After casting, a typical process chain consists of hot rolling, cold <b>rolling,</b> annealing, <b>skin</b> pass <b>rolling,</b> and sheet metal forming. In order to represent the microstructure evolution in an adequate way, a multiscale modeling concept is applied for the process steps cold rolling, annealing, and sheet metal forming. In this Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) concept, the strong microstructure evolution during the production of semi-finished products is modeled by using crystal plasticity for the representation of the cold rolling process and a cellular automaton is incorporated to model the annealing procedure. In both cases, only the microstructure in an adequate unit cell is considered. For sheet metal forming, the whole component has to be simulated together with the interaction between workpiece and the forming tools in order to solve technological problems like springback. For this purpose, classical macroscopic plasticity models have been applied. To connect the different length scales of the modeling approaches, a scale transition on the basis of numerical homogenization is introduced for the determination of the mechanical properties like the multi-axial yield behavior. These information are required to virtually determine the type of the macroscopic plasticity model, the material parameters of the plasticity model, and to simulate sheet metal forming processes. In the article, the different modeling approaches are compared step by step with experimental investigations in order to prove the predictability of each modeling technique...|$|R

It was observed that a precise control of the process parameters enabled to obtain weld beads with acceptable dimensional and geometric characteristics and minimizing weld defects. Helium shielding gas produced higher aspect ratio welds than those with pure argon. Although, pores were observed in the fusion zone, they represented only about 5 % of the weld bead area. the optimal beam positioning should remain up to 0. 2 mm relative to junction line, for seam angles between 10 degrees and 15 degrees. the weld mechanical behavior depended on the sheet rolling direction. Joint efficiency up to 85 % were obtained after hoop tensile tests when the weld bead longitudinal-section was perpendicular to <b>skin</b> <b>rolling</b> direction and parallel to the stringer rolling direction.

40|$|Selectin-mediated {{tethering}} {{and rolling}} initiates the multi-step process of leukocyte extravasation which {{is crucial for}} the formation of an inflammatory infiltrate. We studied the impact of platelets on this process in the skin. Using intravital microscopy, we analyzed platelet interactions with cutaneous post-capillary venules of mouse ears and observed an increase in platelet rolling if platelets were activated (41. 6 +/- 20. 2 % vs. 13. 1 +/- 8. 5 % rolling of resting platelets). Experiments with P-selectin deficient mice and antibodies blocking either P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa or GPIb showed that rolling depends on platelet PSGL- 1 and GPIIb/IIIa on one hand, and endothelial P-selectin on the other. Next, formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates was demonstrated by simultaneous observation of platelets and leukocytes in vivo utilizing a newly developed two-color technique. Aggregates increased overall leukocyte rolling (leukocytes alone: 27. 4 +/- 11. 2 %, leukocytes with resting platelets: 25. 3 +/- 10. 2 %, leukocytes with activated platelets 38. 1 +/- 11. 8 %). To investigate if activated platelets may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic cutaneous inflammation, platelet P-selectin expression was studied in 8 patients with psoriasis. A correlation between platelet P-selectin expression and disease severity was established. In summary, we show that activated, not resting, platelets increase leukocyte <b>rolling</b> in murine <b>skin.</b> This increased <b>rolling</b> is due to the aggregate formation of platelets with leukocytes. We also provide evidence for a potential role of this mechanism in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the roles of mast cell-derived mediators for leukocyte/endothelium interactions and microvascular mechanisms in inflammation and in anaphylaxis, using mast cell-deficient Ws/Ws rats and their wild-type +/+ littermates. The efflux of endogenous histamine and edema formation evoked by subplantar injection of compound 48 / 80 in rat hindpaws was dose-dependent in +/+ rats, and was essentially lacking in Ws/Ws rats. These findings suggest a critical role of histamine as trigger of edema formation in vivo. Spontaneous leukocyte rolling was studied by intravital microscopy of venules in rat mesentery and cremaster muscle. Rolling and rolling velocity in mast cell-deficient animals exactly matched that seen in mild-type animals. Challenge with 48 / 80 markedly increased leukocyte adhesion and emigration in +/+ animals, whereas in animals lacking mast cells adherent and extravascular leukocytes remained very few and did not increase after challenge with 48 / 80. The data strongly suggest that the presence or activation of mast cells has no bearing on spontaneous leukocyte <b>rolling.</b> Experimental surgical <b>skin</b> flaps in mast cell-deficient rats accumulated little histamine and leukocytes and exhibited little tissue necrosis, whereas flaps in wild-type rats were associated with marked accumulation of histamine and leukocytes and showed substantial tissue loss. Antihistamine treatment in the wild-type rats halved leukocyte accumulation and increased flap survival. The data suggest a role for histamine in skin wound healing. Ovalbumin-sensitized rats, both Ws/Ws and +/+ but not sham sensitized animals, exhibited hypotensive responses after intravenous antigen challenge. There was no mast cell activation in the mesentery of senzitised +/+ rats after intravenous antigen challenge. Hypotension induced by intravenous injection of dextran or compound 48 / 80 occurred in +/+ rats, but not in Ws/Ws rats, and was inhibited by pre-treatment with histamine receptor antagonists. The data indicate that the hypotensive response induced by antigen- mediated anaphylaxis is independent of mast cell activation. Plasma exudation and influx of leukocytes in air pouches after immune complex reaction were markedly lower in Ws/Ws rats than in +/+ rats. Leukocyte rolling, adhesion and transmigration in the mesentery were all substantially increased 6 h after immune complex reaction in +/+ rats bin not in Ws/Ws rats. Leukocytes adhered under flow conditions in markedly larger numbers to endothelial cell monolayers stimulated with peritoneal fluid (collected 6 h after immune complex reaction) from +/+ rats than from Ws/Ws rats. The data indicate a dominant role of mast cell-derived mediators in the leukocyte response to an IgG immune complex reaction in rat skin and mesentery. In summary, the data presented in this thesis show distinctive roles of mast cells in inflammation and anaphylaxis. As studied in the rat, mast cells are of critical importance in local tissue response to immune complex activation and surgical trauma, and are likely important in wound healing. Systemic anaphylaxis to allergen is not critically dependent on mast cells. Mast cell-deficient rats should be most useful in further delineating physiological and pathophysiological roles of mast cells...|$|R
