40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role that}} individual police officers play in making victims aware of criminal injuries compensation. Specifically, this {{study examines}} the behaviour, knowledge, and attitude of police officers in four police departments [...] two with a victim <b>assistance</b> <b>unit</b> and two without. The study found that officers from a department with a victim <b>assistance</b> <b>unit</b> did have a better knowledge of compensation eligibility requirements, including the necessity to suffer injury eligibility provision. Victim <b>assistance</b> <b>unit</b> officers were also found to have more positive attitudes towards compensation programs. They {{were more likely to}} be of the view that compensation programs assisted victims effectively and they were more likely to feel that the programs should be expanded to serve greater numbers of victims, including victims of break and enter. They were also more likely to indicate that they had made victims aware of compensation benefits. However, the presence of a victim <b>assistance</b> <b>unit</b> does not make the situation ideal. Many respondents from a force with a victim <b>assistance</b> <b>unit</b> indicated that they had never made a victim aware of compensation benefits. Of particular relevance is the fact that only sixteen per cent of victim <b>assistance</b> <b>unit</b> officers had ever provided a victim with a card or leaflet with information on criminal injuries compensation. The study concludes with a number of recommendations designed to improve the information crime victims receive with respect to criminal injuries compensation. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} of medically fragile adolescents {{has grown in}} recent decades because of the sequelae of prematurity, injuries, and chronic or terminal illnesses. Medically fragile adolescents who require <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance</b> {{are part of this}} unique population with challenges in their daily lives, yet as nurses, we know little about their experiences and the best approaches to use in caring for them. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the experiences of medically fragile adolescents who require <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance.</b> Interpretive phenomenology was used to describe and interpret the experience of 11 medically fragile adolescents who required <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance.</b> The adolescents ranged in age from 13 to 18 years of age and required <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistances</b> of tracheostomies, ventilator support, and Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPap). Audiotaped semi-structured interviews were conducted with the adolescents. Data analysis was completed using the steps delineated by Diekelmann and Allen (1989). Six themes and one pattern were identified from the interviews with the adolescents. The major themes were “Get to know me”, “Allow me to be myself”, “Being there for me”, “No matter what, technology helps”, “I am an independent person”, and “The only one I know of”. This study explored medically fragile adolescents who required a specific technology, <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance,</b> within a distinct developmental stage. These adolescents have a clear view of who they are as a person. They want nurses to view them as a person, not just a patient. The adolescents felt that friends were there for them when they needed support. This was in contrast to those that they did not consider friends who were judgmental. Technology had meanings that encompassed enhanced daily living and existing as a part of their day, not their whole day. The adolescents viewed themselves as an independent person and were actively engaging in activities and strategies to achieve their goals of independence. This study contributes to nursing knowledge by helping nurses to understand what these adolescents experience in their daily lives and aiding nurses in providing better care for these adolescents. Recommendations for nursing practice, education, and research were identified in this study...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neonatal bulbar {{weakness}} (BW) has various etiologies {{and a broad}} prognostic range. We aimed to report outcomes in a large series of children with neonatal BW and explore the association of orofacial electrodiagnostic data with outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the files of children who presented with facial, lingual, laryngeal, or pharyngeal weakness at birth and who underwent electrodiagnostic studies combining conventional needle electromyography (EMG) of orofacial muscles, blink responses, and EMG during bottle-feeding. Outcome measures included the need for prolonged <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance</b> and enteral feeding, as well as sensorimotor and cognitive impairments. RESULTS: Of 175 patients, 73 % had developmental disorders, 25 % suffered from acquired brain damage, and 2 % had no apparent underlying disorders. Motor or mental impairment was observed in 71 %; death occurred in 16 %. Outcomes {{were not significantly different}} when comparing developmental disorders versus acquired brain damage or neurogenic versus normal detection EMG. Abnormal blink responses were associated with higher frequencies of <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance</b> (P =. 03), gastrostomy (P =. 025), and death (P =. 009); moderate or severe oropharyngeal incoordinations were associated with higher frequencies of <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance</b> (P =. 006), prolonged enteral feeding (P <. 0001), and gastrostomy (P =. 0002).

40|$|Abstract Background Organs {{harvested}} from a body lapsing into circulatory deficit {{are exposed to}} low O 2 /high CO 2, and reach a critical point where original functionality after transplantation is unlikely. The present study evaluates the effect of <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance</b> using Chlorella photosynthesis on preservation of the rat pancreas {{from the viewpoint of}} donation after cardiac death (DCD). Methods Gas was exchanged through the peritoneum of rats under controlled ventilation with or without Chlorella photosynthetic <b>respiratory</b> <b>assistance.</b> A gas permeable pouch containing Chlorella in solution was placed in the peritoneum and then the space between the pouch and the peritoneum was filled with an emulsified perfluorocarbon gas carrier. Rat DCD pancreases procured 3 [*]h after cardiac arrest were preserved for 30 [*]min in a cold or mildly hypothermic environment or in a mildly hypothermic environment with photosynthetic respiratory support. The pancreases were then heterotopically transplanted into rats with STZ-induced diabetes. Results Levels of blood oxygen (PaO 2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) increased and significantly decreased, respectively, in rats with mechanically reduced ventilation and rats given intraperitoneal photosynthetic respiratory support when compared with those without such support. Transplantation with DCD pancreases that had been stored under photosynthetic respiratory support resulted in the survival of all rats, which is impossible to achieve using pancreases that have been maintained statically in cold storage. Conclusion <b>Respiratory</b> <b>assistance</b> using photosynthesis helps to improve not only blood gas status in the event of respiratory insufficiency, but also graft recovery after pancreas transplantation with a DCD pancreas that has been damaged by prolonged warm ischemia. </p...|$|R
