5|$|The {{library is}} a modern looking {{rectangular}} structure with orange brick and clear glass which is adjacent to Glenn Jackson Plaza and Hudson's Bay, with the Mill Race flowing by on the north side. The north and south faces are clear glass, while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging <b>roof</b> <b>line</b> contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily rectangular building.|$|E
5|$|The 250-metre {{long and}} 35-metre tall {{building}} has nine floors, but {{the height of}} the ground floor varies (4.6–4.2 m). This variation is reflected in the <b>roof</b> <b>line</b> which looks taller at the wings than the spine. The volume of the building is 280,000 m³, constructed from 4,600tonnes of steel frame with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over 55740 m² of usable office space". The façade is clad with 33,000 m² Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt Travertine marble, punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey. Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted for emphasis. The top storey is lit from skylights rather than banded glazing and has a very low ceiling height. It forms a clear building conclusion. Until the 1950s, the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} wide, flat frieze. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's <b>roof</b> <b>line.</b> Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.|$|E
50|$|There were {{numerous}} models available, {{but to make}} the homes look custom, the footprints were rotated on their lots and flipped {{with a minimum of}} 3 different <b>roof</b> <b>lines</b> available: folded plate <b>roof</b> <b>lines,</b> butterfly <b>roofs,</b> ranch, and dramatic overhangs. The homes also featured unique decorative block work and stone screens and were generally finished in sanded stucco.|$|R
50|$|The Sydney School, {{also the}} Nuts and Berries style, {{refers to an}} {{architectural}} style {{by a group of}} architects in Australia who reacted against international Modernism with their own regionalist style during the 1960s. In contrast to the purism of the international style, they were drawn to rustic materials, clinker bricks, low gutter <b>lines,</b> and raked <b>roof</b> <b>lines</b> rather than flat <b>roof</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} the Rova's {{buildings}} possessed unique design features. The modest wood building then known as Manjakamiadana was also called Felatanambola ("Silver Hands") for the hand-shaped sculptures crafted from melted silver piastres and attached {{to each of the}} building's four tandrotrano (roof horns)—an architectural design element formed from the crossed gable beams that extended past the <b>roof</b> <b>line</b> of all traditional aristocratic Merina houses. Felatanambola's decorative silver hands were later affixed to the roof horns of Besakana. Another distinctive building from this period was called Bevato ("Many Stones") because its foundation was atypically composed of stone blocks. Manatsara was said to be the most well constructed of the many houses because it was built using ambora (Tambourissa parrifolia), an extremely durable and rot-resistant indigenous hardwood, rather than a traditional wood called hazomena (Weinmannia rutenbergii). According to oral history, Manatsara was treasured by Andrianampoinimerina and the house was quite old but still well preserved in the mid-19th century when Queen RanavalonaI decided to recover its interior walls with wood taken from Sihanaka country.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Chicago school produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, {{built with}} a common appearance and to a common height. The result was usually a box-like palazzo, illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center. The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the <b>roof</b> <b>line.</b> This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect {{the functions of the}} different parts of the skyscraper. The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an atrium for shops and restaurants. Rents for these shops were up to five or six times that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property. Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. Sometimes these protruded from the building to form a slight bay.|$|E

The {{building is}} topped by dentils near its <b>roof</b> <b>line.</b> Also known as Crothers & Crew Building. In the early 1990s the building was restored by Russell Francios for use as an architectural office. During this renovation the third floor was converted into a contemporary apartment and studio.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, the open loggias around {{the ground floor}} were enclosed. Although the house {{was built in the}} floor plan shape of the Letter E, in honour of Queen Elizabeth, it is now missing its north-west wing. During the period of the 9th Earl's ownership, and under the {{guidance}} of the famous landscaper, Capability Brown, the south front was raised to alter the <b>roof</b> <b>line,</b> and the north-west wing was demolished to allow better views of the new parkland.|$|E

All masses for the weekend were moved to the auditorium as they had been during 2008. The Archdiocese of Chicago floated a loan to Holy Name in order to finance the repairs. The Cathedral reopened the weekend of August 1 that year.|$|E

25|$|Architecturally, Lawson's work on {{the asylum}} was very exuberant, making some of his {{previous}} designs look comparatively tame. The asylum had turrets on corbels projecting from nearly every corner, with the gabled <b>roof</b> <b>line</b> dominated by a large tower complete with further turrets and a spire. The building contained {{four and a half}} million bricks made of local clay on the site and was 225 metres long by 67 metres wide. The great central tower of 50 m height, an essential element of many revivalist designs, was also proposed to double as an observation tower if inmates should try to escape.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Department of Energy {{installed}} a 250 kilowatt solar electric photovoltaic array on the North Building's roof. Designed to generate up to 200 megawatt hours of energy annually, {{it was one}} of the largest solar electric photovoltaic systems in Washington, D.C. SunPower, the array's designer, said the 891 photovoltaic units were 18.5 percent efficient, and DOE estimated they would provide about 8 percent of the Forrestal Building's power during peak usage. The SunPower system was chosen because it did not alter the building's <b>roof</b> <b>line.</b> The agency also established a new policy which required it to calculate how much energy it was saving and reinvest the funds in new energy conservation measures.|$|E
25|$|For 1958, Chevrolet {{models were}} {{redesigned}} longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors, {{and the first}} ever production Chevrolet big block V8, the , was now an option. The Bel Air gained a halo vehicle in 1958, the Impala, available only as a hardtop coupe and convertible in its introductory year. Impala styling followed the basic lines of the other Chevrolet models but received special styling cues including a different <b>roof</b> <b>line,</b> a vent above the rear window, unique side trim, and triple tail lights housed in slightly broader alcoves. For the budget conscious, the Biscayne, (formerly the 210) and the Delray (formerly the 150) completed this model year's family-oriented and utility offerings.|$|E

50|$|Sophie Amalienborg {{was built}} in the style of a large three storey Italian villa suburbana with long one-storey lateral wings. The central wing had a high ground floor with a mezzanine. It had a flat <b>roof</b> <b>lined</b> by a {{balustrade}} and with a small tower in its centre.|$|R
25|$|The 15th-century tower arch {{comprises}} two half columns {{supporting a}} moulded pointed arch. Partially surrounding the arch is a hood mould, finishing {{at its base}} with carved leaf label stops. The {{upper part of the}} arch, within the tower, contains the church organ. Within the tower are 15th-century stairs to the belfry, accessed by an 18th-century timber arched door. The stairs ascend {{the west side of the}} tower and are lit by a Perpendicular window of three lights. The middle stage of the tower is lit by two pointed arched 19th-century windows at the south. Above the tower arch are raised indications of the <b>roof</b> <b>line</b> of the Saxon nave, steeply pointed, with the remains of coping stones and quoins showing the extent of the earlier church.|$|E

The power cars receive the standard blue wave across the front and {{along the top of}} the side. The windscreen receives a dark purple 'bubble' surrounding it. Running along the bottom of the entire consist is a dark grey area just beneath the standard red reflective stripe. Each power car has a large Acela Sea Turtle Fin logo near the rear, and a smaller one near the cab. The cars do not have the blue <b>roof</b> <b>line,</b> however each car has a series of Sea Turtle Fins, or Splotches, which vary in shape, color, and positioning depending on the class of car it is (Business Class, Cafe Bistro, and First Class).|$|E
25|$|It is {{only now}} that Inigo Jones may have taken a firmer grip on his {{original}} ideas. Seeing De Caus' completed wing standing alone as an entirety, it was considered too plain – De Caus' original plan was for the huge facade to have a low pitched roof, with wings finishing with no architectural symbols of termination. The modifications to the completed wing were of a balustrade hiding the weak <b>roof</b> <b>line</b> and Italianate, pavilion-like towers at each end. The focal point became not a portico but the large double height Venetian window. This south front (illustration above), has been deemed an architectural triumph of Palladian architecture in Britain, and {{it is widely believed}} that the final modifications to the work of De Caus were by Inigo Jones himself.|$|E
