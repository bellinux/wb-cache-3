5|$|Pinnipeds have lifespans {{averaging}} 25–30 years. Females usually live longer, as males tend {{to fight}} and often die before reaching maturity. The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for a wild female <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> and 46 years for a wild female grey seal. The age at which a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2–12 years depending on the species. Females typically mature earlier than males.|$|E
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the <b>ringed</b> <b>seal,</b> which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{estimated}} population size for the Alaska stock of <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> is 249,000 animals. Currently, the population trend for this stock is unknown. [...] <b>Ringed</b> <b>seals</b> {{are listed as}} a species of [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN, and are considered not “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act. Reliable estimates of the minimum population, potential biological removal, and human-caused mortality and serious injury are currently not available. Because the potential biological removal for <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> is unknown, the level of annual U.S. commercial fishery-related mortality that can be considered insignificant and approaching zero mortality and serious injury rate is unknown.

25|$|The {{ice cover}} {{is the main}} habitat for two large mammals, the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and the Baltic <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> (Pusa hispida botnica), both of which feed {{underneath}} the ice and breed on its surface. Of these two seals, only the Baltic <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> suffers when there is not adequate ice in the Baltic Sea, as it feeds its young only while on ice. The grey seal is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea. The sea ice also harbours several species of algae {{that live in the}} bottom and inside unfrozen brine pockets in the ice.|$|E
25|$|Ringed seals {{reside in}} arctic waters and are {{commonly}} associated with ice floes and pack ice. The <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> maintains a breathing hole in the ice thus allowing it to use ice habitat that other seals cannot.|$|E
25|$|The seals are the <b>ringed</b> <b>seal,</b> {{the harp}} seal and the grey seal. These animals {{for the most}} part were common in the Littorina Sea but are not found in the Baltic Sea now. Again, they could have been taken on land or in the shallows.|$|E

25|$|The <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> (Pusa hispida or Phoca hispida), {{also known}} as the jar seal and as netsik or nattiq by the Inuit, is an earless seal (family: Phocidae) inhabiting the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. The <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> is a {{relatively}} small seal, rarely greater than 1.5 m in length, with a distinctive patterning of dark spots surrounded by light grey rings, hence its common name. It is the most abundant and wide-ranging ice seal in the Northern Hemisphere: ranging throughout the Arctic Ocean, into the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea as far south as the northern coast of Japan in the Pacific, and throughout the North Atlantic coasts of Greenland and Scandinavia as far south as Newfoundland, and include two freshwater subspecies in northern Europe. Ringed seals are one of the primary prey of polar bears and have long been a component of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ringed</b> <b>seals</b> reside within 35°N and the North Pole, and {{are thus}} known as a {{circumpolar}} based species. The {{effects of climate change}} are projected to affect both polar regions of the earth more than anywhere else. This means a changing climate and life for all those residing in these polar regions. As for <b>ringed</b> <b>seals,</b> two potential outcomes lie ahead in this ever-changing climate.|$|R
25|$|Winter {{boots are}} made with depilated soles of bearded seal and leg {{sections}} of haired ringed or spotted seal. Decorative red yarn is worked into the sole seam around the toe and heel. In the past, boots used for dancing were also used as winter boot. The leg section was made from young caibou-leg skins and the soles were made from depilated skin of bearded seal. Today many dances are held indoors, so some women make the soles of their dance boots with lighter-weight materials sucj as <b>ringed</b> <b>seal.</b> Moose-leg skins are used when they are available. Commercially tanned calfskin is used by contemporary seamstresses.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s {{anthropologist}} Vilhjalmur Stefansson {{lived with}} and studied {{a group of}} Inuit. The study focused {{on the fact that}} the Inuit's low-carbohydrate diet had no adverse effects on their health, nor indeed, Stefansson's own health. Stefansson (1946) also observed that the Inuit were able to get the necessary vitamins they needed from their traditional winter diet, which did not contain any plant matter. In particular, he found that adequate vitamin C could be obtained from items in their traditional diet of raw meat such as <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> liver and whale skin (muktuk). While there was considerable skepticism when he reported these findings, they have been borne out in recent studies and analyses.|$|E
25|$|Inuit {{seal hunting}} {{accounts}} {{for the majority of}} the seal hunt, but just three percent of the hunt in southern Canada; it is excluded from the European Commission's call in 2006 for a ban on the import, export and sale of all harp and hooded seal products. Ringed seals were once the main staple for food, and have been used for clothing, boots, fuel for lamps, as delicacy, containers, igloo windows, and in harnesses for huskies. Though no longer used to this extent, ringed seals are still an important food and clothing source for the people of Nunavut. Called nayiq by the Central Alaskan Yup'ik people, the <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> is also hunted and eaten in Alaska.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ringed</b> <b>seals</b> have a {{circumpolar}} distribution {{from approximately}} 35 °N to the North Pole, occurring in all seas of the Arctic Ocean (King 1983). In the eastern North Pacific, {{they are found}} in the southern Bering Sea and range as far south as the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan. Throughout their range, <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> have an affinity for ice-covered waters and are well adapted to occupying seasonal and permanent ice. They remain in contact with ice most of the year and pup on the ice in late winter-early spring. <b>Ringed</b> <b>seals</b> are found throughout the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas, as far south as Bristol Bay in years of extensive ice coverage (Fig. 12). During lat...|$|R
25|$|Beaufort Sea, {{the density}} of <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> in May–June is higher to the east than {{to the west of}} Flaxman Island. The overall winter {{distribution}} is probably similar, and it is believed there is a net movement of seals northward with the ice edge in late spring and summer. Thus, <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> occupying the Bering and southern Chukchi seas in winter apparently are migratory, but details of their movements are unknown.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of <b>ringed</b> <b>seals.</b> The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The baby fur of most Arctic seal species is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic seals all have dark fur at birth.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} {{distinction between the}} southern Canadian seal hunt and the Inuit Canadian hunt is that Canadian Inuit typically hunt ringed seals, while the southern Canadian hunt targets the pelt of the harp seal. Greenlandic Inuit hunt and eat both ringed and harp seals. Unfortunately, protests surrounding the southern seal hunt in Canada have historically damaged the financial well-being of both Canadian and Greenlandic Inuit more than it has the hunting of harp seals. Because of the strongly emotional nature of the protest, profits surrounding the Inuit hunting of <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> fall with any ban on any type of seal product, regardless of exemption. For example, in 1963, prices for high-quality pelts of ringed seals could reach above $20.00 each; these same pelts in 1967, {{the year of the}} first major protests, would only sell for $2.50 each, which threatened the survival of Inuit in many areas. Several protests in other years have resulted in similar decreases in price.|$|E
25|$|Toxicants {{may also}} cause {{endocrine}} disruption through {{interacting with the}} estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals {{have been used as}} coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties. A purely anthropogenic substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment. PCBs are a xenoestrogen, which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor. These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and bioaccumulate in organisms. These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as heat shock proteins 59, 70, and 90. After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a homodimer complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA. The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the chromatin and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein. In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism. These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation. Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Similar effects have been found in the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), the <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> (Pusa hispida) and the California sea lion (Zalophys californinus). In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and stenosis were found which led to sterility. If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations. This is often used as a biomarker for EDCs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ringed</b> <b>seal</b> are an {{important}} food item in particular for polar bears. [...] During the pupping season, Arctic fox and glaucous gulls take <b>ringed</b> <b>seal</b> pups born outside lairs while killer whales, Greenland sharks and occasionally Atlantic walruses prey upon them in the water.|$|E
50|$|Fishes of {{the area}} include Arctic char, Greenland halibut, polar cod, cuttlefish, wolf fish, sea {{scorpion}} and Greenland shark. Aquatic mammals are dominated by <b>seals</b> (<b>ringed,</b> hooded, harbor, bearded and harp seal) which feed on fish in winter (mostly polar cod) and crustaceans in summer. Larger species include Atlantic walrus, narwhal and sometimes beluga whale. Atlantic walrus feeds on mussels, fish and <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> that urges <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> to disappear from the area when walruses stay there for prolonged periods. Narwhals consume polar cod, Greenland halibut, cuttlefish and pelegaec crustaceans.|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} in 1999 and 2000 to estimate the densities of ringed (Phoca hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals in the eastern Chukchi Sea. Survey lines were focused mainly on the coastal zone within 37 km of the shoreline, with additional lines flown 148 – 185 km offshore to assess how densities of seals changed {{as a function of}} distance from shore. Satellite-linked time-depth recorders were attached to <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> in both years to evaluate the time spent basking on the ice surface. Haulout patterns indicated that <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> transitioned to basking behavior in late May and early June, and that the largest proportion of seals (60 – 68 %) was hauled out between 0830 and 1530 local solar time. <b>Ringed</b> <b>seals</b> were relatively common in nearshore fast ice and pack ice, with lower densities in offshore pack ice. The average density of <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> was 1. 91 seals km- 2 in 1999 (range 0. 37 – 16. 32) and 1. 62 seals km- 2 in 2000 (range 0. 42 – 19. 4), with the highest densities of <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> found in coastal waters south of Kivalina and near Kotzebue Sound. The estimated abundance of <b>ringed</b> <b>seals</b> for the entire study area was similar in 1999 (252, 488 seals, SE= 47, 204) and 2000 (208, 857 seals, SE= 25, 502). Bearded seals were generally more common in offshore pack ice, with the exception of high bearded seal numbers observed near the shore south of Kivalina. Bearded seal densities were not adjusted for haulout behavior, and therefore, abundance was not estimated. Unadjusted average bearded seal density was 0. 07 seals km- 2 in 1999 (range 0. 011 – 0. 393) and 0. 14 seals km- 2 in 2000 (range 0. 009 – 0. 652). Levels of primary productivity, benthic biomass, and fast ice distribution may influence the distributions of <b>ringed</b> and bearded <b>seals</b> in the Chukchi Sea.
