50|$|After the war, he was {{assigned}} as Political Officer for the Mosul Division within Mesopotamia, up until October, 1919. He was murdered during the 1920 insurrection by a son of Sheikh Dhari, from the Zoba tribe, near Fallujah on 12 August 1920. Leachman had visited Dhari {{in an effort to}} renegotiate <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>advances</b> made to him by the government and to persuade him to remain loyal to the current administration, but was shot in the back by Dhari's son after a verbal disagreement over a local robbery. Leachman's death sparked an immediate outbreak of tribal uprisings on the Euphrates between Falluja and Hit, and was responsible for General Haldane's advance on the same area in September, 1920. He was buried in the British Military Cemetery in Baghdad.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the collapse, the Council {{were still}} insistent that Joseph Clayton {{complete}} {{the construction of}} the market, to which he agreed, but then delayed the work by submitting three proposals for alterations to the work on grounds of [...] "future safety". These proposals and a fourth, for Clayton merely to withdraw from the contract, were all declined by the Council. Finally, the contract was abandoned, but only after Clayton had agreed to the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> his original <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> Â£2,300 along with interest.|$|R
50|$|Dick {{began the}} book but {{realized}} {{he did not}} know enough about Christianity to finish it. He asked Ted White to collaborate on it with him, but after reviewing the manuscript White never got started. Zelazny discovered the manuscript in White's home in early 1968, read it, then contacted Dick and agreed to work on it with him. Work proceeded sporadically over several years as each author forgot about it in turn (and Zelazny's cat took the opportunity to urinate on the original manuscript). But they finished it quickly in the spring of 1975 when the publisher demanded the manuscript or <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>advance</b> paid to Dick. The editor discovered Zelazny had sent photocopies of some pages and demanded the originals as per Doubleday's policy; much to Zelazny's chagrin, he had to send in the urine-stained pages and he always wondered what the editor made of them.|$|R

[...] "I should scarce have thought so myself," [...] said the young nobleman; [...] "but so it proves. His Majesty, to close this discourse at once, has been pleased to send me this Proclamation, in answer to a respectful Supplication for the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> large loans <b>advanced</b> by my father for {{the service of the}} State, in the king's utmost emergencies." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon this, Traddles and I both {{struck in}} at once. We both {{recommended}} a small sum in money, and the payment, without stipulation to Mr. Micawber, of the Uriah claims {{as they came}} in. We proposed that the family should have their passage and their outfit, and a hundred pounds; and that Mr. Micawber's arrangement for the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>advances</b> should be gravely entered into, {{as it might be}} wholesome for him to suppose himself under that responsibility. To this, I added the suggestion, that I should give some explanation of his character and history to Mr. Peggotty, who I knew could be relied on; and that to Mr. Peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> another hundred. I further proposed to interest Mr. Micawber in Mr. Peggotty, by confiding so much of Mr. Peggotty's story to him as I might feel justified in relating, or might think expedient; and to endeavour to bring each of them to bear upon the other, for the common advantage. We all entered warmly into these views; and I may mention at once, that the principals themselves did so, shortly afterwards, with perfect good will and harmony.|$|R
50|$|Swearengen {{recruited}} his prostitutes by advertising legitimate stage, cleaning, or waitressing jobs in his {{theater to}} desperate {{young women and}} advancing them the money for their (one way) trip; then, when they arrived, forcing them into what was essentially indentured servitude as prostitutes. Those who balked were first threatened with demands for <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the funds <b>advanced</b> to them for the trip; if that failed, they were threatened with beatings, and if that failed they were beaten and physically forced to submit to Swearengen's demands. Many still resisted, but those who escaped this fate could only find themselves in no better situation, as penniless women with no source of income, alone in a rough and rowdy mining camp, and with the constant threat of Swearengen's men hanging over them. Many grew sick and died from lack of proper nutrition and shelter, while many others committed suicide.|$|R
6000|$|Bar was a sight wondrous to behold, {{and full}} of matter, when, jauntily waving his double eye-glass by its ribbon, and jauntily {{drooping}} to an Universe of jurymen, he, in the most accidental manner ever seen, found himself at Mr Merdle's shoulder, and embraced that opportunity of mentioning a little point to him, on which he particularly wished to be guided {{by the light of}} his practical knowledge. (Here he took Mr Merdle's arm and walked him gently away.) A banker, whom we would call A. B., advanced a considerable sum of money, which we would call fifteen thousand pounds, to a client or customer of his, whom he would call P. q. (Here, as they were getting towards Lord Decimus, he held Mr Merdle tight.) As a security for the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> this <b>advance</b> to P. Q. whom we would call a widow lady, there were placed in A. B.'s hands the title-deeds of a freehold estate, which we would call Blinkiter Doddles. Now, the point was this. A limited right of felling and lopping in the woods of Blinkiter Doddles, lay in the son of P. Q. then past his majority, and whom we would call X. Y.--but really this was too bad! In the presence of Lord Decimus, to detain the host with chopping our dry chaff of law, was really too bad! Another time! Bar was truly repentant, and would not say another syllable. Would Bishop favour him with half-a-dozen words? (He had now set Mr Merdle down on a couch, side by side with Lord Decimus, and to it they must go, now or never.) ...|$|R

6000|$|Glengarry loitered in Paris. On June 9, 1749, {{he wrote}} to the Cardinal Duke of York. He {{explained}} that, {{while he was in}} the Tower, the Court of France had sent him 'unlimited credit' as a Highland chief. He understood that he was intended to supply the wants of the poor prisoners, 'Several of whom, had it not been our timely assistance [Sir Hector Maclean was with him] had starved.' Sir Hector tells the same tale. From Sir James Graeme, Glengarry learned that the Duke of York had procured for him this assistance. But now the French War Office demanded <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>advance,</b> and detained four years of his pay in the French service. He 'can't receive his ordinary supply from home, his father being in prison, and his lands entirely destroyed.' To James's agent, Lismore, he tells the same story, and adds, 'I shall be obliged to leave this country, if not relieved.' {154} Later, in 1749, we learn from Leslie that he accompanied Glengarry to London, where Glengarry 'did not intend to appear publicly,' but 'to have the advice of some counsellors about an act of the Privy Council against his returning to Great Britain.' At this time Leslie pledged a gold repeater, the property of Mrs. Murray, wife of that other traitor, Murray of Broughton. 'Glengarry, after selling his sword and shoe-buckles to my certain knowledge was reduced to such straits, that I pledged the repeater for a small sum to relieve him, and wrote to Mr. Murray that I had done so.' He pledged it to Clanranald. Mrs. Murray was angry, for (contrary to the usual story that she fled after the Prince to France) she was living with her husband at this time. {155a} ...|$|R
