500|$|With {{the end of}} World War I, the Australian Government {{began to}} worry about the threat Japan posed to Australia. Japan had {{extended}} its empire [...] to the south, bringing it right to Australia's doorstep. Japan had continued to build up its naval force, and had reached the point where it outgunned the Royal Navy in the Pacific. The RAN and the government believed that the possibility of a Japanese invasion was highly likely. In his report, Admiral Jellicoe believed that the threat of a Japanese invasion of Australia would remain as long as the White Australia Policy remained in place. Due to the perceived threat, and bilateral support in Australia for the White Australia Policy, the Australian Government became a vocal supporter of the continuance of the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Australia was joined in its support for the alliance by New Zealand but was heavily opposed by Canada, which believed that the alliance had hindered the British Empire's relationship with China and the United States. No decision on the alliance was agreed on, and the discussion was shelved pending the outcome of the Washington Naval Treaty. The results of the treaty, which allowed the British to retain naval supremacy in the Pacific Ocean, created a sense of security in Australia. Many Australians saw the Four Powers Pact as replacing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This sense of security became known as the Ten Year Rule. This led to defence retrenchments in Australia, following the international trend, and a £500,000 <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The Governor-General Henry Forster when opening parliament on 22 June 1922 was quoted as saying: ...|$|E

40|$|Noteworthy {{growth in}} {{free cash flow}} has been well {{reported}} {{over the past few}} years as company management, financial analysts, and investors increasingly focus on cash flow to validate reported earnings. Unfortunately, the calculation of free cash flow has limitations, just like earnings. For example, as capital expenditures decrease, free cash flow increases by the same amount, and vice versa. Thus, a temporary <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> capital <b>expenditures</b> could cause reported free cash flow to increase in an unsustainable way. This study examines growth in adjusted operating cash flow (operating cash flow adjusted for nonoperating and nonrecurring items), adjusted free cash flow (similarly adjusted), and capital expenditures for the non-financial firms of the S&P 100 for the years 2000 through 2003. The objective is to measure the extent to which growth observed in adjusted free cash flow is derived from operations or through <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> capital <b>expenditures.</b> Our results indicate that <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> capital <b>expenditures</b> have been an important contributing factor to the growth observed in adjusted free cash flow in recent years...|$|R

The analysis uses quarterly data for South Africa.

We conclude that an attempt to achieve fiscal sustainability via a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>expenditure</b> on sectors conducive to economic growth might be prone to create social and political shocks, which could render such fiscal policy unsustainable.
