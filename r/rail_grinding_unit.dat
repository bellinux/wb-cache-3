Recent rail inspection data using Ultrasonic rail testing has shown increasing number of rail defects, failures and causing disruptions to rail services.

40|$|Rails play a {{significant}} role in transport of goods and passengers. In Australia railway transport industry contributes 1. 6 % of GDP with goods and services worth $AUD 8 billion each year which includes $ AUD 0. 5 billion per year in exports (Australasian Railway Authority Inc, 2002). Rail track maintenance plays an important role in reliability and safety. The Office for Research and Experiments (ORE) of the Union International des Chemins de Fer (UIC) has noted that maintenance costs vary directly (60 - 65 per cent) with change in train speed and axle load. It was also found that the increase in these costs with increased speed and axle load was greater when the quality of the track was lower (ORR, 1999). Failures during operation are costly to rail players due to loss of service, property and loss of lives. Maintenance and servicing keep rail tracks in operating, reliable and safe condition. Therefore, technical and economical analysis is needed by rail players to reduce maintenance cost and improve reliability and safety of rail networks. Over the past few years, there have been major advances in terms of increased speed, axle loads, longer trains, along with increased traffic density in corridors. This has led to increased risks in rail operation due to rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and rail wear. The infrastructure providers have less incentive to maintain a given infrastructure standard if its access charges are rigid and rolling stock standard is not achieved. It has been estimated that between 40 to 50 per cent of wagon maintenance costs and 25 per cent of locomotive maintenance costs are related to wheel maintenance (Railway Gazette International, 2003). The economic analysis of Malmbanan indicates that about 50 % of the total cost for maintenance and renewal were related to traffic on rails and 50 % not related to traffic, such as signaling, electricity and snow-clearance. The results from the analysis have made it possible for the mining company LKAB to start up the 30 Tonnes traffic with new wagons and locomotives on the Malmbanan line in year 2001 (Åhrén et al 2003). The rail infrastructure providers have challenges to maintain infrastructure due to government control on access charges and limited control on rail operations. The aim of the research is to: · Develop a maintenance cost model for optimal <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> for various operating conditions; and · Develop integrated <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> and lubrication strategies for optimal maintenance decisions. In this research real life data has been collected, new models have been developed and analysed for managerial decisions. Simulation approach is used to look into the impact on various costs such as <b>rail</b> <b>grinding,</b> operating risk, down time, inspection, replacement, and lubrication. The results of the models for costs and the effect of <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> and lubrication strategies are provided in this thesis. In this research rail track degradation, rail failures and various factors that influence rail degradation are analysed. An integrated approach for modelling rail track degradation, <b>rail</b> wear, <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> and lubrication is developed. Simulation model and cost models for <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> are developed and analysed.

Then, the influence of <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> will be evaluated by analyzing the different vibratory response of the FE model in both cases.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is a key}} {{maintenance}} activity for Network Rail. It is performed at night through possession of the track, so process speed is critical. Increasing the metal removal rate (MRR) of the <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> operations would {{be a way to}} improve the time taken for this operation. The aerospace industry has recently seen advances in grinding technologies that have increased MRR. This work was aimed at assessing their best practice and its application to <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> operations. Current Network <b>Rail</b> <b>grinding</b> operations include preventative and corrective re-profiling of the rail head. The majority of work performed in the UK is preventative re-profiling with current train speeds ranging from 1 to 10 mile/h. Opportunities exist to increase train speed and improve the productivity of this operation through the use of more advanced grinding technologies. The most relevant aerospace technology is high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG). This approach uses: a high surface speed of the grinding wheel, superabrasive tooling, and high workpiece feed rates to remove material quickly from the cut-zone. Productivity improvements were identified by applying theory on power requirements (by assessing the specific grinding energy) and chip thickness of the grinding process. Computer CAD/CAM modelling was also performed to assess the effect of changing grinding techniques on potential gouging of the track infrastructure and/or interference with example trackside obstructions. The work concluded that opportunities do exist to improve the current productivity of grinding operations. Utilizing HEDG technology theoretically provides a 100 % train speed increase (utilizing the same power available with the current setup) for preventative re-profiling. This requires the application of high surface speeds of the grinding wheel and superabrasive technology. Further increases in train speed require increased spindle power. The chip thickness experienced by grinding grains is reduced for a peripheral grinding setup and high wheel surface speeds that is beneficial for wheel wear. The application of HEDG technology cutting {{on the periphery of the}} wheel provided optimum conditions during CAD/CAM simulation to avoid rail gouging, and any potential collision of the grinding stone with modelled trackside obstructions...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Over the last two decades, the railroad industry has experienced a significant increase in heavy axle loads acting on railroad rails. In addition, railroad operations have been consolidated resulting in the elimination of redundant routes and increased train traffic on the remaining routes. These changes in railroad industry practice have caused an increase in the rate of occurrence of rail head fatigue defects, one potential cause of train derailment. The primary form of maintenance employed by the individual railroads to combat the formation of fatigue defects is <b>rail</b> <b>grinding.</b> Current <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> practices involve removal of surface defects and reshaping worn rail, but they do not involve grinding as a means to mitigate internal fatigue damage. In this study, a model for optimizing a grinding schedule which will prevent the formation of internal fatigue defects is proposed.

In North America, the standard practice is Preventive and Preventive-Gradual grinding strategy which uses high production rail grinders to complete a single pass on most track locations at high grinding speed. These practices have been proven in field tests {{to be the most}} cost effective grinding strategies. To plan <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> on Queensland <b>Rail</b> a Rail Inspection Vehicle (RIV) is used to gather data of rail profiles and rail surface photos. This inspection technology generates a Grinding Quality Index. This paper proposes the standards utilised in accepted best practices [13] as a standard for Australian railways and their challenges and drawbacks to implementation as well as a better method of addressing RCF defects. Grinding Quality Index (GQI) is estimated by comparing the measured rail profile with the target rail profile template for the area of material to be removed for a particular grinding pass. Based on the rail surface photos taken by the RIV, the operator decides the additional depth of cut and number of passes based on experience with that track. GQI is currently estimated based on profiles and do not consider RCF. Current GQI does not show any relationship with the RCF cracks and can be very good from a profile perspective, but still can have RCF cracks on the surface. Close monitoring of pre and post <b>grind</b> <b>rail</b> profiles for compliance and inclusion of RCF factor has been proposed as an enhancement to the current GQI for effective assurance on the quality of grinding.
