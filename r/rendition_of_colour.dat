The properties of different light sources vary; household incandescent lighting, fluorescent lighting, sodium discharge street lighting, etc., are very different and produce different results, and require different correction if a subjectively neutral <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> is required.|$|R
5000|$|His Art {{is purely}} English, and little {{influenced}} by the arrival in England of such painters as Paul van Somer, Daniel Mytens or Anthony Van Dyck. His work looks back to the flat hieratic style of the late Elizabethan Court, and he devotes infinite care to the <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> surfaces, <b>colours</b> and textures whilst seeming to be indifferent to the niceties of perspective. The result {{is a mixture of}} sophisticated painterly technique allied with a naivet√© of drawing which is at once deeply old-fashioned in the new world of the Baroque, and infinitely charming and unselfconscious.|$|R
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} {{dividend}} into four parts. The first part describes basic terms in video technology (luminance, hue, diagrams CIE). The second part includes types <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> spaces RGB, HSV, CMY(K), YUV, YCbCr, YIQ. In {{the third and}} fourth part, these theoretical findings are used to propound laboratory observations. The laboratory observation processes the <b>colour</b> <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>colours</b> in video technology. In the Matlab software, a user system environment was developed for operations with measured values. The software is capable of recalculating chromaticity coordinates between different colour spaces, to screen colours into diagrams CIE and to show the vectors <b>of</b> <b>colours.</b> The device used for measuring was Chromametr Konica Minolta CS- 100 A. A manual for the device was created. The laboratory observation was measured and processed {{in the form of a}} laboratory protocol...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{given at}} the Dark Side of Color panel. Current {{technologies}} are designed to capture a pictorial image by reflectance of light upon the sensor, {{in order to create}} the potential to render a colour image pixel by pixel, which can then be re-rendered repeatedly without losing colour information or fidelity. Whilst this may be the method used when taking a photograph it may not be what the user is thinking they are doing when they capture a digital image. Pixels only render colour, an image is only represented by coloured pixels {{there is little or no}} other information, should there be? As an example artists and designers make a series of choices before rendering a pictorial image, whether through paint, print or photography. Those choices can be influenced by many factors often bearing no relation to accurate <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>colour</b> viewed. They are however closely related to the accurate <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> the pictorial image that the artist has chosen to represent. This paper articulated some of the approaches an artist makes with visual examples for each approach and demonstrated how decisions made will affect the outcome of the image...|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the Pemaisuris (Queen's) Royal Standard (which is given the name Tanah Kuning Tua) {{is very similar to}} that of the Sultan's, but {{features}} a reversed arrangement <b>of</b> <b>colours,</b> with a white emblem against a yellow field. The Royal Standard of the Yang Di-pertuan Muda (Crown Prince) bears a similar colour configuration as the Queen's, but features only the partial <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> the state emblem, which is significantly larger than that of the Sultan's and the Queen's. The Royal Standard for the Crown Prince is named as Tanah Kuning Muda.|$|R
50|$|Photographic {{lighting}} is the illumination of scenes to be photographed. A photograph simply records patterns <b>of</b> light, <b>colour,</b> and shade; {{lighting is}} all-important in controlling the image. In many cases even illumination is desired {{to give an}} accurate <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> the scene. In other cases the direction, brightness, and <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> light are manipulated for effect. Lighting is particularly important for monochrome photography, {{where there is no}} colour information, only the interplay of highlights and shadows. Lighting and exposure are used to create effects such as low-key and high-key.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{applicability}} <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> {{quality metrics}} to solid-state light sources is validated {{and the results}} of the assessment <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> <b>rendition</b> characteristics <b>of</b> various lamps are presented. The standard colour rendering index metric (CRI) or a refined colour quality scale metric (CQS) fail to distinguish between two principle <b>colour</b> <b>rendition</b> properties <b>of</b> illumination: the ability to render object colours with high fidelity and the ability to increase chromatic contrast, especially when the spectra of light sources contain a few narrow-band electroluminescence components. Supplementing these metrics by the known figures of merit that measure the gamut area of a small number <b>of</b> test <b>colour</b> samples does not completely resolve this issue. In contrast, the statistical approach, which is based on sorting a very large number <b>of</b> test <b>colour</b> samples with respect <b>of</b> just perceivable <b>colour</b> distortions <b>of</b> several kinds, offers a comprehensive assessment <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> <b>rendition</b> properties <b>of</b> solid-state light sources. In particular, two statistical indices, colour fidelity index (CFI) and colour saturation index (CSI), which are the relative numbers <b>of</b> object <b>colours</b> rendered with high fidelity and increased saturation, respectively, are sufficient to reveal and assess three distinct types of solid state light sources. These are (i) high-fidelity lamps, which cover the entire spectrum with the spectral components present in the wavelength ranges of both 530 - 610 nm and beyond 610 nm (e. g. trichromatic warm white phosphor converted LEDs, red-amber-green-blue LED clusters, complementary clusters of white and coloured LEDs); (ii) colour-saturating lamps, which lack power in the 530 - 610 nm wavelength range (e. g. red-green-blue or red-cyan-blue LED clusters); and (iii) colour dulling lamps, which lack power for wavelengths longer than 610 nm (dichromatic daylight phosphor converted LEDs and amber-green-blue LED clusters). Owing to a single statistical format, CSI and CFI can be used for design and optimization of multiwavelength LED clusters providing " smart " illumination with a trade-off between different colour rendition characteristics...|$|R

30|$|The above studies {{essentially}} propose {{rules for}} the implementation <b>of</b> the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> specific typographic attributes. It is obvious that a systematic methodology towards the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> typographic signals does not exist. The present work introduces the emotional-based mapping methodology for rendering font cues to auditory modality. The methodology is applied in a case study for font size and style. We determine the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> the font attributes by combining a text font-to-emotional state model and expressive speech synthesis. By conducting a number of psychoacoustic experiments, we determine the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> text font cues. Our {{ultimate goal is to}} incorporate automatic text font-to-speech mapping in DtA by emotional analogy between the visual (text font cues) and the acoustic (speech prosody) modalities.|$|R
