50|$|Quantitative <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> {{and exports}} {{is a direct}} {{administrative}} form of government regulation of foreign trade. Licenses and quotas limit the independence of enterprises with a regard to entering foreign markets, narrowing the range of countries, which may be entered into transaction for certain commodities, regulate the number and range of goods permitted for import and export. However, the system of licensing and quota imports and exports, establishing firm control over foreign trade in certain goods, in many cases {{turns out to be}} more flexible and effective than economic instruments of foreign trade regulation.

50|$|Larsen & Toubro {{originated}} {{from a company}} founded in 1938 in London by two Danish engineers, Henning Holck-Larsen and Søren Kristian Toubro. The company began {{as a representative of}} Danish manufacturers of dairy equipment. However, with the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the resulting <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports,</b> the partners started a small workshop to undertake jobs and provide service facilities. Germany's invasion of Denmark in 1940 stopped supplies of Danish products. The war-time need to repair and refit ships offered L&T an opportunity, and {{led to the formation of}} a new company, Hilda Ltd, to handle these operations. L&T also started to repair and fabricate ships signalling the expansion of the company. The sudden internment of German engineers in British India (due to suspicions caused by the Second World War), who were to put up a soda ash plant for the Tata's, gave L&T a chance to enter the field of installation.|$|E

40|$|The {{imposition}} of a quantitative <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> implies that someone somewhere is quantity-rationed. If prices rise to cut demand back to the constraint level, suppliers are rationed; if not, demanders are. In this paper we develop techniques for identifying if and when consumers are rationed and for taking account of rationing in the estimation of demand equations and in the calculation of welfare effects. By way of example we consider {{the effects of the}} various non-tariff barriers that have affected imports of different types of footwear from certain suppliers into the UK. We estimate simple CES demand systems for four types of footwear, identifying in each case the principal suppliers. Our results reveal several cases in which import restrictions on footwear led to rationing and suggest that even if prices did not rise to clear the market, the welfare losses to UK consumers of being limited in their purchases of footwear were as high as 53 m pounds sterling in 1986.

40|$|Agricultural biotechnologies, and {{especially}} transgenic crops, {{have the potential}} to boost food security in developing countries by offering higher incomes for farmers and lower priced and better quality food for consumers. That potential is being heavily compromised, however, because the European Union and some other countries have implemented strict regulatory systems to govern their production and consumption of genetically modified (GM) food and feed crops, and to prevent imports of foods and feedstuffs that do not meet these strict standards. This paper analyses empirically the potential economic effects of adopting transgenic crops in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. It does so using a multi-country, multi-product model of the global economy. The results suggest the economic welfare gains from crop biotechnology adoption are potentially very large, and that those benefits are diminished only very slightly by the presence of the European Union's <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> of GM foods. That is, if developing countries retain bans on GM crop production in an attempt to maintain access to EU markets for non-GM products, the loss to their food consumers as well as to farmers in those developing countries is huge relative to the slight loss that could be incurred from not retaining EU market access.

40|$|Whatbeganin 1957 as a {{temporary}} <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> ofJapanese cotton textiles into the United States has evolved over 30 years into a complex market-sharing agreement involving all major trading countries and all categories of textile and apparel trade. The MultifiberArrangement (MFA) is a major experiment {{in the management of}} international trade. However, the use of discriminatory quotas in the MFAisa serious violation ofthe principles ofGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that have governed most trade since World War II. The quotas involve substituting political forces for economic forces in the determination oftrade. The arrangement has imposed high costs on consumers in importing countries, and it has interfered with the United States ’ foreign policy goal of promoting economic development in low-income countries. The MFA has also been criticized by proponents oftextile protection for failing torestrain import growth sufficiently. The time is right toreevaluate this experiment in managed trade and to determine whether to continue the market-sharing approach of the MFA or to return textile trade to compliance with the general rules of the GATT. Description and Purpose of the Arrangement The Multifiber Arrangement, an agreement among 42 exporting and importing countries, regulates trade in textiles and apparel. The stated objectives ofthe MFA are the expansion and liberalization of textile trade and the avoidance ofdisruption in import markets. Since import restriction is the most frequently used remedy for market disruption, there is an inherent conflict between the objectives. Th...|$|E

40|$|The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (hereafter, the GATT), {{which is}} to be signed by more than 10 nations on December 15, 1993, {{represents}} the culmination of seven years of negotiations on reforms of international trade. Assuming that the U. S. Congress will ratify the agreement, most, if not all, agricultural commodities produced in the United States will be affected in some way. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the likely effects of the GATT on U. S. peanut markets. Although the market value of U. S. peanut production is small compared to many other U. S. agricultural commodities, the impacts of the GATT on peanut markets are of considerable interest for at least two reasons. First, because peanut production is concentrated in {{a relatively small number of}} states, peanut revenues constitute an important component of incomes in many communities in the southeastern United States. The impacts of the GATT on peanut markets are therefore important to farmers and policy makers in these areas. Second, the federal peanut program is unique among U. S. commodity programs with its marketing quota, price supports, and import restrictions. An important component of the federal peanut program is explicit <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> of peanuts. The restriction has brought attention to the trade conditions for peanuts that seems not to be justified by the value of trade in peanuts. During the course of the Uruguay Round negotiations, for example, peanut import restrictions were used by other countries as an example of restrictive U. S. trade policies. ...|$|E
30|$|Although the {{government}} supported domestic manufacture, {{due to the}} lack of complementarity between macroeconomic and institutional factors, industrial policies contributed nothing to the alleviation of problems in the Turkish economy, as had been expected in the 1960 s, and this dragged the country into a devastating economic and political crisis at the end of 1970 s. Turkey’s economic reforms were slowed down by political turmoil and social movements. Shaky coalition governments could not produce necessary economic reforms, and this deepened the country’s economic problems. Moreover, by decisions in January 24, 1980, {{the government}} imposed less <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> of goods, supported export by promotions and implemented devaluations in the lira as a preparation for export growth strategies. 24 The decisions taken in the 1980 s were a result of a program supported by the IMF. The reforms were necessary to cut monetary expansion and aimed to reduce the power of trade unions, to increase privatization and decrease the influence of public industries in the market. Furthermore, Turkey decreased its support for the agricultural sector while promoting manufacturing production in an attempt to stimulate exports. This transformation, however, remained slow. In the beginning of 1980 s, political and economic problems led to another military coup. The deregulation policies in the economy continued and these policies were relatively supported in following years. The trade union legislation that was established in the 1960 s made it hard to achieve flexibility of labor without political unrest. In the 1980 s, although trade unions lost a measure of their power, public industries still dominated the economy. Hence, the change to a free market economy remained largely incomplete. Additionally, expected privatizations of the largest public industries met with protests and other pressures, and could not be institutionalized until the mid- 1990 s when Turkey established an institution for the support of foreign direct investment into the public industries.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether a proposed {{measure that would}} prohibit the importation into Australia of illegally logged timber {{would be consistent with}} the WTO Agreement if passed by the Australian Parliament in its current form. The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 (Cth) would prohibit the importation of timber harvested in contravention of the laws of its country of origin, including timber in manufactured products such as furniture. Importers would also be required to comply with certain due diligence requirements, such as assessing the risk that their imports contained illegally logged timber. The Bill is patterned on similar measures adopted by the United States and the European Union and is part of a global movement to combat illegal logging. However, by conditioning entry into the Australian market solely on whether timber was harvested legally, the Bill raises clear issues under the WTO Agreement. In particular, the Bill is likely to lead to differential treatment of like products from different countries, contrary to the Most-Favored-Nation obligations in Article I of the GATT 1994. Moreover, as a <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> the Bill is likely to contravene GATT Article XI. Finally, because the logging laws of countries differ from each other in ways that may not correspond to sound environmental practice, {{it is unlikely that the}} Bill could be justified under GATT Article XX because it would lead to arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between products. An ancillary difficulty under Article XX is that there is evidence that the Bill will not contribute significantly to a net reduction in illegal logging, meaning it would be unlikely to pass a ‘necessity’ test. Although it might be thought that the Bill could fall under the TBT Agreement as well as the GATT 1994, it is unlikely to do so because it does not lay down physical product characteristics or production methods. However, if the TBT Agreement does apply, the Bill is likely to be inconsistent with it for similar reasons to its inconsistency with the GATT 1994. Ultimately, Australia may wish to consider reformulating the Bill so that it more accurately and effectively targets environmentally destructive logging practices and unfair competition against which the Australian government seeks to protect...|$|E
