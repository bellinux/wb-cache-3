40|$|The {{influence}} of planting {{time and the}} quality of <b>rosettes</b> on yield in two strawberry cultivars: Senga sengana and Pocahontas was researched.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to previous reports, the authors do not observe an increased stability of active (early-forming) E-rosettes in young subjects. The dissociation rates of active and total <b>rosettes</b> {{as well as}} morula-formations are quite parallel following incubation at 37 °. Active <b>rosettes</b> formed in warm conditions, display more cap-formations immediately after resuspension and form as many caps as total <b>rosettes</b> after 15 min incubation at 37 °.

5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge {{that creates a}} three-dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one of}} the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The <b>rosette</b> motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central <b>rosette</b> motif. The illusion of three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E
