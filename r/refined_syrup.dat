Technological improvements in the 1970s further <b>refined</b> <b>syrup</b> processing. The Canadian province of Quebec {{is by far the}} largest producer, responsible for 70% of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$ 487 million (about US$ 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90% of this total. Vermont is the largest producer in the United States, generating about 6% of the global supply.|$|E

50|$|The {{village is}} {{somewhat}} {{off the beaten}} path (In spite of US Route 20 passing a few miles north), not much visited by tourists; Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg used to visit to escape city life, especially in the autumn when the maple leaves change color. Many people around Cherry Valley are dairy farmers; tapping maple trees for sap, which is then <b>refined</b> into <b>syrup,</b> is a common spring practice. The area looks much like it did in the 19th century. Historic re-enactments are held to commemorate the importance of Cherry Valley during the American Revolution.|$|R
50|$|Among the Zygosaccharomyces {{spoilage}} species, Z. bailii {{possesses the}} most pronounced and diversified resistance characteristics, enabling it {{to survive and}} proliferate in very stressful conditions. It appears that Z. bailii prefers ecological environments characterized by high osmotic conditions. The most frequently described natural habitats are dried or fermented fruits, tree exudates (in vineyards and orchards), and at various stages of sugar <b>refining</b> and <b>syrup</b> production. Besides, it is seldom to encounter Z. bailii as a major spoilage agent in unprocessed foods; usually the yeast only attains importance in processed products when the competition with bacteria and moulds is reduced by intrinsic factors such as pH, water activity (aw), preservatives, etc.|$|R

40|$|According to a USDA {{study on}} nutrition, major health issues are diet related and the {{solution}} to illness {{can be found in}} nutrition. The real potential from improved diet is preventative in that it may defer or modify the development of a disease state. These findings are corroborated by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop’s 1988 Report on Nutrition and Health. Fifty years ago, grocery stores stocked about 200 items. Seventy percent of those were grown, produced or processed within a 100 -mile radius of the store. Today, the average supermarket carries 50, 000 food items or more; most of these foods are highly processed and refined, most of which are transported thousands of miles to their final destination. Americans spend over 90 percent of their food dollars on these processed foods- foods that contain high levels of refined sugars, high fructose corn <b>syrup,</b> <b>refined</b> polyunsaturated oils and trans fatty acids as well as highly processed protein isolates. The reduction in nutrients in these foods requires that we eat more to satisfy the body’s nutritional requirements. The current Dietary Guidelines and Food Pyramid strongly favor a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. The caloric proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates advocated by USDA’s Food Pyramid and Dietary Guidelines are alarmingly similar to the USDA guidelines for fattening cattle and other livestock. Only during the last century has man’s diet included a high percentage of refined carbohydrates. Ou...|$|R
