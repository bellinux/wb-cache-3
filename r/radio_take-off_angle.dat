The sulfur atom from PEDOT has a different chemical condition from the sulfur atom from PSS, resulting in different S(2 p) binding energy so that {{the composition of the}} PEDOT:PSS from various depth can be analyzed [19]. The S(2 p) core level spectra of pristine PEDOT:PSS film and DMSO modified PEDOT:PSS film are shown in Fig. 4 b, c, with a <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> of 45 ° and 25 °, respectively. The S(2 p) core level spectra of the pristine PEDOT:PSS and modified PEDOT:PSS film at the two <b>take-off</b> <b>angles</b> have identical peaks, around 168.5 eV and 164.0 eV, corresponding to sulfur from PSS and PEDOT.

On the contrast at a <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> of 25 °, the relative intensity S(2 p) of sulfur from PEDOT increases, which indicates that conductive PEDOT concentration increases at the surface of the PEDOT:PSS particle, which is preferred for high conductivity. Particles with higher conductivity and better contacts are formed, resulting in the three orders of degree conductivity improvement by the DMSO modification and thermal treatment.|$|R

Numerical calculations show that with an aperture of 3 ° or 9 ° of the electron analyser, the photoelectron <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> should not exceed 80 ° or 70 °, respectively, as compared to normal <b>take-off</b> <b>angles.</b> At larger photoelectron <b>take-off</b> <b>angles,</b> the effect of the aperture on the photoelectron energy distribution may not be neglected.

Models for the composition and thickness of the oxide layer have been developed. Also, the errors in the parameters of these models have been calculated. It can be concluded that the native oxide layer on silicon is 27 ± 1 (±- 5 %) Å thick and that the ratio of the silicon atom concentration in the substrate to that in the native oxide layer is 3. 7 ±- 0. 3 (±- 8 %), values that agree well with the literature.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and application of a new method of performing multiple scattering calculations of X-ray Photoelectron Diffraction (XPD) from periodic surfaces. The technique is based on the dynamical theory of Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED), allowing more efficient access to high photoelectron energies (1000 eV and above) than is available using present calculational schemes. Convergence tests have been performed to identify the limitations of the present method.;The method is applied to two overlayer systems for which XPD experimental data is available, c(2 x 2) S and c(2 x 2) O on Ni(001). For the c(2 x 2) S system, which is relatively well understood and therefore a good test system, data at four emission (<b>take-off)</b> <b>angles</b> is fitted, giving optimum agreement with the S atoms occupying hollow sites at a vertical adsorption height of between 1. 30 A and 1. 35 A. The agreement is improved slightly for the lowest two <b>take-off</b> <b>angles</b> by an outward relaxation in the top Ni-Ni layer spacing. Comparison is made with single scattering calculations for the system and the present method shown to be far superior at the lowest <b>take-off</b> <b>angle.</b> This clearly demonstrates the importance of multiple scattering at grazing emission angles.;For the c(2 x 2) O system, data at two <b>take-off</b> <b>angles</b> is fitted giving optimum agreement with the O atoms in hollow sites at an adsorption height of 0. 75 A.

The azimuth and <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> {{are used to}} plot the position of an individual seismic record. The <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> is the angle from the vertical of a seismic ray as it emerges from the earthquake focus. These angles are calculated from a standard set of tables that describe {{the relationship between the}} <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> and the distance between the focus and the observing station. By convention, filled symbols are used to plot data from stations where the P-wave first motion recorded was up (a compressive wave), hollow symbols for down (a tensional wave), with dots for stations with arrivals too weak {{to get a sense of}} motion. If there are sufficient observations, one may draw two well-constrained orthogonal great circles that divide the compressive from the tensional observations and these are the nodal planes. Observations from stations with no clear first motion normally lie close to these planes. By convention the compressional quadrants are colour-filled and the tensional left white. The two nodal planes intersect at the N (neutral)-axis. The P and T axes are also often plotted; with the N axis these three directions respectively match the directions of the maximum, minimum and intermediate principal compressive stresses associated with the earthquake.

We measured the ground reaction forces exerted by forelimbs and hindlimbs during short jumps in the Dybowski's frog Rana dybowskii. Take-off occurred in two phases. Phase one (from the initial time until the forelimbs took off), which lasts a relatively long time (63. 2 [*]±[*] 4. 1 % of the total take-off phase, N[*]=[*] 20), provides sufficient time for the forelimbs to elevate the body to a suitable posture to deliver the best <b>take-off</b> <b>angle.</b> Phase two (from the forelimbs lift-off until hindlimbs lift-off) was dominated by the hindlimbs which provided a constant and fast elevation. The force angle (angle of the resultant vector from fore-aft and normal force components towards the plane of the substrate) of the hindlimbs and body trajectory was variable before the forelimbs lifted off of the substrate and then primarily followed the direction of the line from the foot-substrate point to the center of mass (COM). The preparation angle adopted when the forelimbs lifted off of the substrate was a good predictor of the <b>take-off</b> <b>angle.</b> The total normal force oscillated around body weight (BW) before the forelimb normal force peaked.

Analysis of jumping behaviour recorded by a video camera showed that the trajectory of the centre of gravity of the birds during the aerial phase of jumping was parabolic, indicating that the success of landing depends on three parameters at the time of take-off from water: speed, angle and distance from the point of emergence to the ice edge. There was a negative relationship between distance and the <b>take-off</b> <b>angle,</b> suggesting that penguins adjust their <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> to the distance from the ice edge.

We recorded multiple components of escape flight performance in 20 adult European starlings previously subjected to a manipulation likely to have altered levels of developmental stress. Siblings had been cross-fostered to nests where they were either slightly larger (advantaged treatment) or slightly smaller (disadvantaged treatment) than their competitors.

40|$|Locust {{can jump}} {{precisely}} to a target, yet {{they can also}} tumble during the trajectory. We propose two mechanisms {{that would allow the}} locust to control tumbling during the jump. The first is that prior to the jump, locusts adjust the pitch of their body to move the center of mass closer to the intended thrust vector. The second is that contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles during the jump will produce torques that counter the torque produced by thrust. We found that locusts increased their <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> as the initial body pitch increased, and that little tumbling occurred for jumps that observed this relationship. Simulations of locust jumping demonstrated that a pitch versus <b>take-off</b> <b>angle</b> relationship that minimized tumbling in simulated jumps was similar to the relationship observed in live locusts. Locusts were strongly biased to pitch head-upward, and performed dorsiflexions far more often than ventral flexions. The direction and magnitude of tumbling could be controlled in simulations by adjusting the tension in the dorsolongitudinal muscles. These mechanisms allowed the simulations to match the data from the live animals. Control of tumbling was also found to influence the control of jump elevation. The bias to pitch head-upwards may have an evolutionary advantage when evading a predator and so make control of tumbling important for the locust...|$|R
