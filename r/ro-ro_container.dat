She had two Stork Werkspoor engines of 7700 KW ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, the {{discussion}} on the marginal social costs of transportation has been active. Applying the externalities {{as a tool to}} control transport would fulfil the polluter pays principle and simultaneously create a fair control method between the transport modes. This report presents the results of two calculation algorithms developed to estimate the marginal social costs based on the externalities of air pollution. The first algorithm calculates the future scenarios of sea transport traffic externalities until 2015 in the Gulf of Finland. The second algorithm calculates the externalities of Russian passenger car transit traffic via Finland by taking into account both sea and road transport. The algorithm estimates the ship-originated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxides (NO x), sulphur oxides (SO x), particulates (PM) and the externalities for each year from 2007 to 2015. The total NOx emissions in the Gulf of Finland from the six ship types were almost 75. 7 kilotons (Table 5. 2) in 2007. The ship types are: passenger (including cruisers and ROPAX vessels), tanker, general cargo, <b>Ro-Ro,</b> <b>container</b> and bulk vessels. Due to the increase of traffic, the estimation for NO x emissions for 2015 is 112 kilotons. The NO x emission estimation for the whole Baltic Sea shipping is 370 kilotons in 2006 (Stipa & al, 2007). The total marginal social costs due to ship-originated CO 2, NO x, SO x and PM emissions in the GOF were calculated to almost 175 million Euros in 2007. The costs will increase to nearly 214 million Euros in 2015 due to the traffic growth. The major part of the externalities is due to CO 2 emissions. If we neglect the CO 2 emissions by extracting the CO 2 externalities from the results, we get the total externalities of 57 million Euros in 2007. After eight years (2015), the externalities would be 28 % lower, 41 million Euros (Table 8. 1). This {{is the result of the}} sulphur emissions reducing regulation of marine fuels. The majority of the new car transit goes through Finland to Russia due to the lack of port capacity in Russia. The amount of cars was 339 620 vehicles (Statistics of Finnish Customs 2008) in 2005. The externalities are calculated for the transportation of passenger vehicles as follows: by ship to a Finnish port and, after that, by trucks to the Russian border checkpoint. The externalities are between 2 – 3 million Euros (year 2000 cost level) for each route. The ports included in the calculations are Hamina, Hanko, Kotka and Turku. With the Euro- 3 standard trucks, the port of Hanko would be the best choice to transport the vehicles. This is because of lower emissions by new trucks and the saved transport distance of a ship. If the trucks are more polluting Euro 1 level trucks, the port of Kotka would be the best choice. This indicates that the truck emissions have a considerable effect on the externalities and that the transportation of light cargo, such as passenger cars by ship, produces considerably high emission externalities. The emission externalities approach offers a new insight for valuing the multiple traffic modes. However, the calculation of the marginal social costs based on the air emission externalities should not be regarded as a ready-made calculation system. The system is clearly in the need of some improvement but it can already be considered as a potential tool for political decision making...|$|E
50|$|The {{shipyard}} was {{merged into}} Fincantieri on January 1, 1984 with the denomination “Fincantieri Cantieri Navali Italiani S.p.A. Stabilimento di Livorno”.

30|$|The waterway, both inland {{and on the}} sea, was {{the most}} {{important}} freight transport mode before the appearance of the railway in Japan. Shipbuilding has seen its own development and Japanese ships were widely used (Benzai-sen, also known as Sengoku-bune) until the Edo and early Meiji Periods for domestic freight transport. Since the seventeenth century, along with the development of the market economy, off-shore waterways and seaports along the coast were gradually developed. The western routes (so-called Kitamae-bune, connecting Osaka and Hokuriku to Hokkaido via the Seto Inland Sea and Kanmon Straits), which was run by shipowner-merchants, saw a particular prosperity (See e.g. [12]). After industrialization in the late nineteenth century, the railway and later the truck overtook the role as the main mode for long-distance freight transport. However, around 40 % to 45 % of the goods within Japan are still transported by ship (based on ton-km). In the last decades, as Japan increased its imports and exports and along with the globalization of the economy, the role of international bulk, <b>Ro-Ro</b> and <b>container</b> transport is becoming more important.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{laid down}} 1 April 1968 at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. of Pascagoula, Mississippi as SS Mormacksky, ON 521302, IMO 6901830, a Maritime Commission type (C5-S-78a) {{combination}} breakbulk, <b>container,</b> <b>Ro-Ro</b> vessel under Maritime Administration contract (MA 222) for Moore-McCormack Lines. Launched 1 December 1968, she {{was delivered to}} the Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 25 July 1969 and entered service with Moore-McCormack. After working for that line for {{only a short time}} the ship was sold to American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines and renamed SS Great Republic on 19 October 1970. In 1978 she was sold again to Farrell Lines without name change. The ship was turned over to MARAD in 1981.|$|R
2500|$|Built as a {{combined}} <b>RO-RO</b> ferry and <b>container</b> ship, Transcontainer I entered {{service on the}} Dunkerque– Harwich route on 13 March 1969, her planned maiden voyage on 11 March having been cancelled due to industrial action. In 1974, she was converted to a train ferry and was delivered back to SNCF on 24 October. Her port of registry was changed to Dieppe. From November 1974 to January 1975 she operated the Calais–Dover route. On 9 January 1975, the day after {{she returned to the}} Dunkerque–Harwich route, Transcontainer I collided with [...] off Felixstowe, United Kingdom. She was repaired at Dunkerque and returned to service in April 1975. From March to October 1985, she operated the Dieppe–Portsmouth route. Transcontainer I operated the Dunkerque–Dover route between February and July 1986.|$|R

50|$|Facilities at Aden {{consist of}} the Maalla Terminal and the Aden Container Terminal (ACT), {{which opened in}} March 1999. The port can handle <b>ro-ro</b> ships, <b>container</b> ships, cargo ships, as well as tankers. In November 2003, {{following}} the October 2002 bombing of the French supertanker Limburg off the Yemen coast and the resultant dramatic drop in throughput at the Aden port, the Port of Singapore Authority sold its majority stake in the ACT back to the Yemeni government. In June 2005, Dubai Ports International was selected to manage and operate the ACT (and possibly Maalla Terminal) under a 30-year or longer contract; the Yemeni government will remain a minority shareholder. The Port of Aden has recovered well from the 2002 bombing. In 2004 it had annual traffic of approximately 2,000 vessels and 318,901 twenty-foot-equivalent units of containers, mostly handled by the ACT. For 2005, the port handled 317,897 twenty-foot-equivalent units of containers, {{more than double the}} amount for 2003. For the first seven months of 2006, the port handled 207, 687 twenty-foot-equivalent units of containers. However, in May 2006 the London insurance market’s Joint War Committee placed Yemen on its list of “areas of perceived enhanced risk,” which is expected to add a war-risk insurance premium to ships operating in the country’s coastal waters. This added premium, coupled with the availability of more secure ports in neighboring countries, will likely result in reduced throughput in Yemen’s ports in the near future.|$|R
30|$|Decisions {{regarding}} {{usage of}} a fuel cannot be taken without a complete lifecycle assessment {{as well as}} look upon the global warming potential. This has been studied a lot {{and even though the}} potential of LNG usage in reducing NOx, SOx, and PM emissions is acknowledged, there are challenges in total greenhouse gases (GHG) (Brynolf et al. 2014 a; Lindstad et al. 2015; Thomson et al. 2015). Brynolf et al. (2014 a, b) and Thomson et al. (2015) look at a total fuel-cycle analysis including the extraction, processing and operation stages for <b>Ro-Ro</b> and <b>container</b> vessels as well as tug applications respectively. Whilst LNG would exhibit a GHG benefit directly vs. high-sulphur fuel operation and comparing to low-sulphur fuel operation show a climate benefit within 30  years in container ship applications with diesel-ignited gas engines, a benefit would take longer for tug applications as well as with spark ignited gas engines (Thomson et al. 2015). For the chosen Ro-Ro applications, the global warming potential would be very close to the one of HFO when using LNG as fuel as well as the European electricity mix, being a lot dependent upon coal and natural gas, and due to this considerable reductions would demand usage of liquefied bio gas (Brynolf et al. 2014 a, b). Biggest challenges for the gas engines is seen to be the methane slip (CH 4) emissions influencing the total GHG emissions radically due to thirty times stronger warming potential for 100 -year equivalent mass compared to CO 2 (Brynolf et al. 2014 a, b; Thomson et al. 2015). Lindstad et al. (2015) focus on the global warming impact (GWI) from engine operations only but include impacts of all emission components as well as operation at high and low power for general cargo ships operating between the two present ECAs i.e. North America and Europe. The average GWI over 20 - and 100 -year horizons are compared and due to the strong global cooling effect of NOx, SOx, and organic carbon in the atmosphere, high-sulphur fuels show the best result and the authors suggest to still allow usage of high-sulphur heavy fuel oils (HFO) on open seas (Lindstad et al. 2015). Overall it can be concluded that LNG is the fuel of the future at least in short sea shipping and the main question is how to build up the infrastructure and make it available for ships in ports.|$|R
40|$|Gateway cities will be {{most dynamic}} cities {{of the future and}} Port/gate cities will {{increasingly}} become cities with the ambition, the capacity and the resources to be connected to the network of hub-cities woven around the planet. Port areas are local places within global networks, gateways crossed by planetary fluxes of energy and waterfronts are network of places, functions, additions and hinges between the coast and the city, between the port and urban activities. A waterfront is not just a port area, but a concentration of functions that can be productive, relational, cultural, recreational, residential. It is not a closed and protective area, but an osmotic interface, it is a permeable perimeter, sometimes rigid, but sometimes equally “spongy”. Waterfronts are strategic areas capable of generating a new urban form and producing a new landscape by transforming the streams of energy (material and immaterial) running through the great infrastructural networks to make them more vital, communicative and competitive. The paper will explore Palermo’s Waterfront regeneration project that is part of a wider innovative program entitled “Ports&Stations” financed by the Ministry of the Infrastructure with the active partnership of the City Government, the Port Authority and the Italian railway company. Their guiding vision presents a new city for exchange and innovation, in which the port functions, the new hubs of the Mediterranean armature, are integrated with great urban services, residences and local area services whose objective is to provide a more obvious “cityeffect” on the seafront. The tool chosen to implement the integrated strategy for the increase in infrastructures, development of the city and competitive growth is the new “Piano regolatore portuale” (PRP), whose objective is to create a permanent system that incorporates the commercial port (<b>ro-ro</b> and <b>container),</b> the passenger and cruise port and docks for recreational boating, not simply by improving locations and functions, but by connecting them with the environmental requalificaton, the services, parking areas and many new urban functions. Palermo’s Waterfront regeneration project propose strategies, design, services and businesses spaces and, in addition to the issues of general port functions, the project also cope with the question of “city-port interaction areas” and “interface areas”, which are highly attractive for new residential, commercial, cultural and recreational functions. The experience of Palermo’s Waterfront regeneration project deal with the question of multisectoriality and raises some issuses around the necessity to include multidisciplinary action in which a variety of subjects participate to produce a dynamically synergetic environment and to solve the conflictual relation between subjects, tools and competences...|$|R
