500|$|At {{the end of}} , {{the podium}} {{positions}} were unchanged, but the time difference between Loeb and Sordo had decreased to seven seconds, although the gap between first place and fourth was over a minute.

A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for <b>Remote</b> <b>Service</b> Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually. The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence. Loeb won an uneventful , but only by one-tenth of a second ahead of Sordo, and on [...] Sordo was quicker than Loeb, after Loeb stalled on the start-line and was unable to make up the lost seconds. At the midday break, Loeb was lamenting his lead over Sordo. [...] "Now it's a big battle between the two C4s. The other cars for the moment are behind, so it's good news for the team. It would be easier if Dani were bit further behind but I have to deal wit that," [...] he said. [...] "I'll try to keep position this afternoon, but it's not easy. Dani is really fast. I only have a six-second lead." [...] Grönholm was also complaining. [...] " [...] The only good thing here is to win this rally, but to drive here; I don't like it." ...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{limitations}} of the present Shuttle manifest, it is necessary for NASA to consider revision of its previous strategy for servicing satellites. This is particularly important in a period of tight budgets, when space assets will be difficult to replace. Therefore on-orbit assets take on additional value and keeping these assets operational will take on added importance. The key to maintaining these assets will be the long term strategy of developing a <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> capability which is space based and has a minimum reliance on the Shuttle. Such a strategy will require that the users of this servicing system design serviceable spacecraft at a high level and that these assets be located in or be capable of reaching orbits that are accessible to or compatible with the proposed servicing infrastructure. The infrastructure required to support this type of <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> architecture and the development of the necessary systems, tools, and procedures required to support a <b>remote</b> <b>servicing</b> architecture of this type are addressed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} few years, social networks, mobile devices and {{personalized}} services have been heavily responsible for a substantial in- crease in <b>remote</b> <b>services</b> available over Internet. Consequently, service consumers have to discover <b>remote</b> <b>services</b> anytime, anywhere across networks boundaries making thus service discovery, and their underlying Service Discovery Protocols (SDPs) more important than ever. In this paper, we introduce ZigZag, a middleware to reuse and extend current SDP, designed for local networks, to discover available services across network boundaries as required in Future Internet. Our approach is based on protocol translation to enable service discovery irrespective of their underlying SDP. Further, we provide a thorough evaluation to validate our approach...|$|R

We use simulation to quantify functional effectiveness achieved by the two architectures as the rate of failure increases for <b>remote</b> <b>services.</b> We further decompose non-functional periods into failure-detection delay and recovery delay. Our quantitative measurements suggest that a two-party architecture yields better robustness than a three-party architecture. We discuss the underlying causes for this outcome. 1...|$|R
