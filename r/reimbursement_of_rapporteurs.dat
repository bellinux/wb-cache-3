The purpose of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive look at the issue <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial and enforcement proceedings. The thesis is composed of an introduction, two main sections which are dealing with <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial proceedings and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in the enforcement proceedings and conclusion. In the introduction I'm dealing with the reasons why I've chosen this topic. The actual text of the thesis is divided into two main parts - <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial proceedings and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in the enforcement proceedings. The first part deals with selected kinds of costs, with an emphasis on case law, and also deals with the issues connected with the abolition of regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll. Within subchapters 1. 2 and 1. 3 I analyze <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in the contentious and non-contentious proceedings, individual principles governing the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs and institutes related to reimbursement, specifically pre- action appeal and the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{requirements}} for the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars and to compare the reimbursement status, market share, and <b>reimbursement</b> costs <b>of</b> biosimilars in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from the following CEE countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The requirements for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars were reviewed for each country. Data on the extent <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biologic drugs (separately for original products and biosimilars) in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected for each country, along with data on the total pharmaceutical and total public health care budgets. Results: Our survey revealed that no specific criteria were applied for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars in the selected CEE countries; the price of biosimilars was usually reduced compared with original drugs and specific price discounts were common. Substitution and interchangeability were generally allowed, although in most countries they were at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment. Original biologic drugs and the corresponding biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed. The <b>reimbursement</b> rate <b>of</b> biosimilars in the majority of the countries was the same and amounted to 100 %. Generally, the higher shares of expenditures were shown for the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> original drugs than for biosimilars, except for filgrastim, somatropin, and epoetin (alfa and zeta). The shares of expenditures on the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilar products ranged from 8. 0 % in Estonia in 2014 to 32. 4 % in Lithuania in 2015, and generally increased in 2015. The share <b>of</b> expenditures on <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars in the total pharmaceutical budget differed between the countries, with the highest observed value for Slovakia and Hungary and the lowest—for Croatia. Conclusions: The requirements for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilar products as well as the access of patients to biologic treatment do not differ significantly between the considered CEE countries. Biosimilar drugs significantly influence the <b>reimbursement</b> systems <b>of</b> these countries, and the expenditure on the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars is increasing as they are becoming more accessible to patients...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the frequency <b>of</b> utilization and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the common diagnostic tests and treatment modalities used in testicular cancer care. Methods: LifeLink™ (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA) Claims Database was used. We identified 877 subjects with a primary diagnosis of testicular cancer (ICD 186. 9) between 2007 and 2012. Median <b>reimbursement</b> and frequency <b>of</b> the diagnostic/treatment modalities used were recorded. Results: The most common claim was a vein puncture with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 9. 11. Tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin, were ranked 6 th and 7 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 52. 13 and $ 48. 71, respectively. Chest X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest were ranked 9 th and 13 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 68. 51 and $ 769, respectively. A contrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was the 11 th most frequent claim with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 855. 89. The three invasive treatment modalities, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy were ranked 8 th, 15 th, and 164 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 2858. 38, $ 3988. 25, and $ 2009. 67, respectively. Conclusions: Testicular cancer is not an inexpensive disease. Surgery is the less utilized than radiation and chemotherapy despite lower cost. This may have implications to national guidelines and training since these treatments often carry the same grade of recommendation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to point out}} the {{increase}} of the amount of the petty cases, to analyze its reasons, to describe the development of the relevant legislation and case law and to deal with some main legal arguments related to the issue <b>of</b> the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the costs of proceedings in petty cases. The reason for my research is mainly its topicality and rapid evolution in a few past years. The boom of the mass claim recovery realized by the specialized "debt companies" was the reason of the legislative amendments and led to the ground-breaking decisions of the Constitutional Court, which resulted in the repeal of the regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll. The thesis is composed of the introduction, four chapters and conclusion. The introduction is focused on the reasons of my choice of the topic and on the definition of the specific kind of petty cases my thesis is related to. Chapter Two provides the general overview of the institute <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs of proceeings, examines the varieties of the costs of proceedings, explicates the general principles the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs of proceedings is based on, explores the remedies and deals with the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs of enforcement proceedings. Chapter Three describes the growing amount of the petty cases, analyzes its reasons and reviews [...] ...|$|R

The sphere <b>of</b> the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the costs of proceeding is undeservedly ignored, as the disputes are mainly focused on the core of a case, and the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the costs, though it is also the part of most decisions of disputes, has only marginal significance. The aim of this thesis is to analyse in detail the institute of the costs of the proceedings at law, and it also deals with the protection of this institute by the legal code in the Czech Republic as well as abroad, its application in practice, and with the problems arising in connection with the costs of the proceedings at law...|$|R
