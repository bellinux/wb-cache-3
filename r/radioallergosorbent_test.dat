40|$|What are the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of serum immunoassay testing in adults with allergic rhinitis? Evidence-Based Answer: <b>Radioallergosorbent</b> <b>testing</b> (RAST) of total serum IgE has poor sensitivity for allergic rhinitis; however, {{the sensitivity}} of RAST ranges from 64 % to 98 % and the specificity ranges from 90 % to 100 % for specific nasal allergens.

50|$|Blood {{testing is}} another way to test for allergies; however, it poses the same {{disadvantage}} and only detects IgE allergens and does not work for every possible allergen. <b>Radioallergosorbent</b> <b>testing</b> (RAST) is used to detect IgE antibodies present to a certain allergen. The score taken from the RAST is compared to predictive values, taken from a specific type of RAST. If the score is higher than the predictive values, a great chance the allergy is present in the person exists. One advantage of this test is that it can test many allergens at one time.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} data from three cross sectional surveys of 296 laboratory workers exposed to small mammals. Four indices of laboratory animal allergy were studied: symptoms suggestive of occupational asthma, symptoms suggestive of any occupational allergy, skin weals to animal urine extracts, and serum binding in <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests</b> with urine extracts. Pooled {{data from the}} three surveys showed an association between smoking and all indices except radioallergosorbent tests; the association was significant for symptoms of occupational asthma. One of the three surveys consistently showed a stronger association of allergy indices with smoking than with atopy (defined on skin tests with non-animal aeroallergens). Associations with smoking persisted after stratifying by atopic status, suggesting that smoking may be {{a risk factor for}} laboratory animal allergy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To compare {{findings}} of tests for nut allergy in children.  DESIGN—Retrospective survey of a clinical practice protocol.  SETTING—Children's hospital paediatric outpatient clinic.  SUBJECTS— 96 children referred by general practitioners and accident and emergency doctors over 27 months (1994 - 96).  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Allergic manifestations (generalised urticarial rash, facial swelling, bronchospasm, anaphylactic shock, vomiting on three occasions) related to specific nut IgE concentrations and following touch, skin prick, or oral ingestion of nuts.  RESULTS— 16 {{children from a}} sample of 51 who were tested for nut allergy had no reaction to an oral challenge. Positive IgE against peanuts was found in nine of these 16 children.  CONCLUSIONS—Skin prick testing and IgE measured by <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>testing</b> are inadequate tests for nut allergy. The definitive diagnostic test for nut allergy in the hospital setting is direct oral challenge. ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{laboratory}} test is the blood test for IgE (immunoglobulin production), {{such as the}} <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>test</b> (RAST) or the more recent enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST), implemented to detect high levels of allergen-specific IgE in response to particular allergens. Although blood tests are less accurate than the skin tests, they can be performed on patients unable to undergo skin testing. Imaging tests can be useful to detect sinusitis in people suffering from chronic rhinitis, and they can work when other test results are ambiguous. There is also nasal endoscopy, wherein a tube is inserted through the nose with a small camera to view the passageways and examine any irregularities in the nose structure. Endoscopy {{can be used for}} some cases of chronic or unresponsive seasonal rhinitis.|$|E
50|$|Food allergy is principally {{diagnosed}} by careful {{history and}} examination. When reactions occur immediately after certain food ingestion then diagnosis is straight forward {{and can be}} documented by using carefully performed tests such as the skin prick test (SPT) and the <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>test</b> RAST to detect specific IgE antibodies to specific food proteins and aero-allergens. However false positive results occur when using the SPT when diagnosis of a particular food allergen is hard to determine. This can be confirmed by exclusion of the suspected food or allergen from the patient's diet. It is then followed by an appropriately timed challenge under careful medical supervision. If there is no change of symptoms after 2 to 4 weeks of avoidance of the protein then food allergy {{is unlikely to be}} the cause and other causes such as food intolerance should be investigated. This method of exclusion-challenge testing is the premise by which the Elimination Diet is built upon, as explained in the sections below.|$|E

The post-test probability of clinical allergy to dog or cat allergen, based on the prevalence rates in the referral population (15. 1 % and 22. 5 % respectively), increased to between 46 % and 67 % for positive test results and decreased to between 4 % and 8 % for negative results, which suggests that the primary role of skin prick tests and RASTs is in eliminating the diagnosis of clinical allergy...|$|R
40|$|The {{document}} attached {{has been}} archived {{with permission from}} {{the editor of the}} Medical Journal of Australia. An external link to the publisher’s copy is included. A child with atopy produces IgE antibodies after exposure to common environmental allergens. The atopic diseases (eczema, asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis) are clinical syndromes each defined by a group of symptoms and signs. Not all children with atopy will have atopic disease or develop symptoms after exposure to an allergen. Both genetic and environmental factors determine the development of atopic disease. The presence of specific IgE antibodies to environmental allergens is determined with skin prick or <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>testing</b> in children with atopy. Test results should be interpreted {{in the context of the}} clinical history and further investigations (eg, allergen avoidance or challenge). Management of atopic disease is frequently symptomatic, but it is important to avoid identified allergen triggers. Immunotherapy may be considered in selected school-age children with severe rhinoconjunctivitis. Preventing atopic disease in high-risk infants and hindering progression of disease in children with established disease are the areas of active research. Michael S Gold and Andrew S Kem...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess whether, on {{the basis}} of one blood test, {{penicillin}} allergy might be excluded sufficiently for general practitioners to give oral penicillin to patients claiming a history of penicillin allergy. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of patients referred by general practitioners. SETTING [...] Outpatient allergy clinic in a district general hospital. PATIENTS [...] 175 referred patients who gave a history of immediate type reaction to penicillin, of whom 144 attended as requested and 132 completed the investigations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] History and examination, serum <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>test</b> to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin, and oral challenge with penicillin. RESULTS [...] Of 132 patients, four were confirmed to have penicillin allergy by the <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>test</b> and 128 had an oral penicillin challenge without ill effect. CONCLUSIONS [...] Most patients who gave a history of penicillin allergy are not so allergic, and their actual allergic state should be substantiated whenever feasible. For patients reporting minor or vague reactions negative findings with a <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>test</b> to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin provide sufficient evidence to give oral penicillin safely...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A 21 -year-old patient {{experienced}} asthmatic attacks when {{cleaning the}} cage of his budgerigar.

40|$|The {{association}} between helminth infections and childhood atopic diseases remains controversial. The majority {{of studies have}} been carried out in tropical areas, whereas less information is available from western countries with low intensity of helminth infections. In the Netherlands, the infection of pigs with Ascaris suum is very common, particularly on pig farms with outdoor facilities. This helminth can also infect humans, causing visceral larva migrans. This study aims at determining the prevalence of antibodies against A. suum and its association with allergic symptoms and sensitisation in a population of 4 -year-old children living in the Netherlands. Blood samples from 629 children from the prospective birth cohort Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) study were examined for Ascaris antibodies. Data on allergic symptoms and sensitisation were collected using questionnaires and <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests</b> (RAST). A total of 45 out of 629 (7 %) were found to be Ascaris-seropositive. In addition, a positive {{association between}} Ascaris seropositivity and wheeze in the last year, doctor-diagnosed asthma and food and aero-allergen sensitisation was found.

40|$|Background: Autoimmune {{pancreatitis}} {{is characterized}} by diffuse swelling of the pancreas and a high serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G 4 concentration. Histopathologically, dense infiltration of lymphocytes and IgG 4 -positive plasma cells with fibrosis are seen in the pancreas. Although allergic diseases complicating autoimmune pancreatitis have been reported, the clinical features of bronchial asthma complicated by autoimmune pancreatitis remain unclear. Case Summary: We report three cases of bronchial asthma preceding the onset of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis by 3 months to 30 years. All three cases were males with high serum IgG, IgG 4, and IgE concentrations. The <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests</b> were positive for common allergens such as mites and house dust. One case had a pulmonary manifestation {{that proved to be}} an inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung with an accumulation of IgG 4 -positive plasma cells. The asthma symptom was ameliorated by oral prednisolone therapy for autoimmune pancreatitis, and when the corticosteroid doses were reduced, asthma became worse in all three cases. Discussion: It is possible that atopy and increased Th 2 cell activity are related to a higher coincidence of IgG 4 -related diseases such as type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis. Because the present cases are few in number, further studies are necessary...|$|R

40|$|Immediate {{hypersensitivity}} {{to natural}} latex (NL) occurs in sensitized individuals after repeated exposure to products or devices containing NL components.

A number of latex proteins have been considered the major antigens, {{but they have been}} incompletely characterized. There is no standard material available for skin testing. In vitro diagnostic tests, such as the <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>test</b> (RAST), are time consuming and their sensitivity and specificity remain to be proven. We have developed a rapid microsphere-based, fluorescence-activated flow cytometry assay for the measurement of NL protein-specific human immunoglobulin E and have compared it with both the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>test</b> methods.

Forty seven other technicians who had stopped working with laboratory animals showed the same relative numbers of respiratory tract symptoms and of confirmed allergy to laboratory animals as did those currently handling animals. Seven of 23 animal keepers had work related symptoms. LAA symptoms were found in four and confirmed animal allergy in two. All four animal keepers with animal related symptoms had rhinitis, none had bronchial asthma. Positive animal RAST and skin tests were found only among people with animal related symptoms. A history of atopic disease was commoner among those with positive animal test results than among those with negative test results. No relation between smoking and the development of allergy to laboratory animals emerged.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} at 15 textile plants with dyehouses in western Sweden. Employees {{with a history of}} work related rhinitis, asthma, or skin symptoms were offered a clinical and immunological investigation including skin prick tests, skin patch <b>tests,</b> and <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests</b> (RASTs) to detect specific allergy to reactive dyes. Among the 1142 employees, 162 were exposed to reactive dyes and 10 of these (6 %) reported work related respiratory or nasal symptoms. An allergy to reactive dyes could be confirmed in five (3 %, 95 % confidence interval 1 - 7 %). All but one had been exposed to reactive dyes for one year or less before the onset of symptoms. Positive RASTs could be detected in four of the five patients. All of the RAST positive patients were positive to remazol black B, but six out of eight additional remazol dyes also elicited positive results. RAST and RAST inhibition showed a cross reactivity between some of the dyes. Seven persons with work related dermatitis and three with urticaria or Quincke oedema were found. In one patient contact dermatitis to a monoazo dye was shown, but no positive patch test reactions to reactive dyes.

40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a frequent}} chronic inflammatory skin disease. Some fungal colonization or infection of the skin may exacerbate AD severity, particularly the so-called head and neck variant. In addition, excessive intestinal colonization by Candida albicans may represent an additional triggering factor. Hence, there is a rationale to use antifungals in selected AD patients. Early trials with topical ketoconazole in head and neck AD showed a decrease in Malassezia colonization, but no significant improvement was observed in the clinical severity. In contrast, clinical improvement and decreased serum IgE were obtained in patients with positive Malassezia <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests</b> (RASTs) who were treated by oral ketoconazole. Some preliminary data suggested that oral itraconazole treatment in AD patients reduced the need for topical corticosteroids, provided clinical improvement particularly in head and neck AD, reduced the cutaneous and intestinal fungal colonization that may trigger AD, reduced the percentage of positive Malassezia cultures and demonstrated a decrease in C. albicans and Malassezia RAST values. Furthermore, beside its antifungal action, itraconazole in part relieves pruritus and inflammation. In conclusion, oral itraconazole treatment can alleviate AD severity in selected patients. Fluconazole is also effective. Further research is warranted to identify whether the load in skin surface fungal agents, the fungal RAST values and specific prick testing should be assessed in order to optimize the antifungal management in AD patients.

40|$|Background: Current {{diagnostics}} for allergies, such as skin prick and <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests,</b> do {{not allow}} for inexpensive, high-throughput screening of patients. Additionally, extracts used in these methods are made from washed pollen that lacks pollen surface materials that may contain allergens. Methodology/Principal Findings: We sought to develop a high-throughput assay to rapidly measure allergen-specific IgE in sera and to explore the relative allergenicity of different pollen fractions (i. e. surface, cytoplasmic, commercial extracts). To do this, we generated a protein microarray containing surface, cytoplasmic, and commercial extracts from 22 pollen species, commercial extracts from nine non-pollen allergens, and five recombinant allergenic proteins. Pollen surface and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared by extraction into organic solvents and aqueous buffers, respectively. Arrays were incubated with, 25 uL of serum from 176 individuals and bound IgE was detected by indirect immunofluorescence, providing a highthroughput measurement of IgE. We demonstrated that the allergen microarray is a reproducible method to measure allergen-specific IgE in small amounts of sera. Using this tool, we demonstrated that specific IgE clusters according to the phylogeny of the allergen source. We also showed that the pollen surface, which has been largely overlooked in the past, contained potent allergens. Although, as a class, cytoplasmic fractions obtained by our pulverization/precipitation method were comparable to commercial extracts, many individual allergens showed significant differences.

A questionnaire was mailed to all 418 farmers who were alive of the farmers originally participating in 1982. They were invited to an interview, spirometry, and blood sampling. Ninety-one per cent (380) of the farmers, 321 men and 59 women, responded to the questionnaire. The mean age was 56 years {{for the men and}} 55 years for the women. Of the group, 10 % were smokers, 25 % ex-smokers, and 65 % had never smoked. The population estimate for asthma in the farmers was 8. 9 % in 1994 compared to 2 % in 1982, and to 5. 4 %– 6. 6 % in the general population in the region in 1982. Of the asthmatic subjects, one-third had positive RAST <b>tests</b> (<b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests).</b> Almost 90 % of the new onset asthma cases since 1982 had non-IgE-mediated asthma.

40|$|A {{group of}} eight infants (six boys and two girls, 7 to 46 weeks of age) is reported, in whom a causal {{relationship}} between cow's milk allergy and chronic sleeplessness was suspected. They were referred because of waking and crying episodes that had occurred {{since the early days}} of life during sleep hours. During an average night, they slept about 4. 5 hours and woke their parents about five times. They cried a lot during the day and were described as fussy. Two infants had been treated with phenothiazine without improvement. No cause for chronic insomnia was found during a standard medical and psychologic workup. An all-night polygraphic recording confirmed the disrupted sleep pattern of these infants, as compared with that of normal infants, and excluded further causes of arousals. Due to a clinical suspicion of atopy, the infants were further subjected to a series of allergy tests. IgE levels were shown to be elevated in each child, and <b>radioallergosorbent</b> <b>tests</b> were positive for cow's milk protein. The infants were than fed exclusively with a hydrolyzed milk protein mixture for 4 weeks. Sleep normalized within 2 weeks in every infant: night sleep increased to a median of 10 hours, and the awakenings only occurred occasionally. In four infants less than 6 months of age, cow's milk was reintroduced in the diet, and within 1 week all four became severely sleepless. Cow's milk was again excluded from the diet and the babies' sleep behaviors were again normalized. It is concluded that, when no evident cause for sleeplessness can be found in an infant, the possibility of milk allergy should be given serious consideration. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.
