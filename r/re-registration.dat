This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the <b>re-registration</b> was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E

The National Health Service Central Register at Southport receives notifications of changes of a patient's Family Practitioner Committee. Such a change, or transfer, occurs when a patient registers with a new NHS doctor in an FPC other than that with which the patient was formerly registered. A 10 % systematic sample of these transfers is taken. In Scotland, <b>re-registrations</b> between Area Health Boards are notified to the National Health Service Central Register, Scotland. In Northern Ireland <b>re-registrations</b> {{from other parts of}} the United Kingdom are notified to Central Services Agency, Belfast. (No information is available on movements within Northern Ireland). These data provide an indication of internal migration flows within the United Kingdom.

40|$|Abstract – Modeling {{consists}} in aggregating separate pieces of knowledge, {{according to a}} given structure and rules. It allows studying the behavior of more or less complex systems by simulation techniques. Modeling is used in different state-of-the-art technological domains (meteorology, aeronautics). Its use has grown {{for the evaluation of}} medicines and medical devices, from conception to prescription (marketing authorization, reimbursement, price setting and <b>re-registrations).</b> It follows a scientific approach and is the object of good practice recommendations. Coupling models to virtual populations allows obtai-ning realistic results at the population level, testing diagnostic or therapeutic strategies, as well as estimating the consequences of transposing the results of clinical trials to the population. Through examples, the participants of the Round Table analyzed the contributions of the coupling of models and realistic virtual populations, and proposed guidelines for their judicious and systematic use.

25|$|By comparison, {{copyright}} law generally seeks to protect original literary, artistic and other creative works.

In {{preparation for the}} possibility of general elections and the certainty of municipal elections, the EBD had cleaned out their electoral rolls following the 1998 <b>re-registration</b> exercise, sought to boost voter confidence through the media, and trained fellow civil servants across the country to prepare for the rigorous test of conducting three separate elections in one day.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Australia, {{there is}} a Player and Official Deregistration Policy, which allows players and {{officials}} with a poor tribunal record to be deregistered from playing football for life. As of 2011, this deregistration is automatically applied to any player or official who, {{since the age of}} 16, has been suspended for a cumulative total of 16 matches or more in any suburban, country or state league, or in the AFL, except that for the purpose of the cumulative total, suspensions in the AFL count only 50% of their value. Players may appeal for <b>re-registration,</b> but if successful a further suspension will result in deregistration without the right to a further appeal. The rule was first established in 2007, and is applied uniformly across all levels of football in Australia.|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{university}} productivity {{show that}} {{little has changed}} though of the enforcement of DDMM 509 / 1999 and 270 / 2004 : the long-standing ills that had afflicted the Italian university under the previous system still continue to affect it even after {{the adoption of the}} " 3 + 2 ” reform. These considerations on productivity of the university system are alarming especially in terms of the objectives that the DM 509 / 1999 intended to achieve and the expectations of what was invested. These expectations concern the control on productivity (more regular graduates) and an approach to academic and working life, maintaining high standards of quality training. It seems that has not worked out in the process of change from the old to the new university system. Italian university has answered to external pressures absorbing change content in pre-existing organizational structures and cultural background. We are conducting a research that allows for an in-depth examination of the phenomenon of poor productivity of the university system, and also sheds light on some of the factors that combine to determine this result. The Sapienza University of Rome was identified as an ideal context for this analysis, due to its dimensions and complexity, and because of its variety of scientific and educational areas of academic training. The research involves conducting a secondary analysis of longitudinal data of administrative type for a description of the phenomena of late performance and student drop out. It focuses on the batches of students enrolled in specific key moments before (from academic year 1991 / 1992 to 2000 / 2001) and after the reform (from academic year 2001 / 2002 to 2006 / 2007). Each of these batches (about 410, 000 student enrolments) was monitored up to April 2008 (the official closing date of academic year 2006 / 2007). The analysis take into account ex novo enrolments, excluding both the <b>re-registrations</b> and students who have already obtained more than one degree. Longitudinal analyses (the generational approach) allow us to individually monitor students in a single generation for a number of years, reduce the risks associated with aggregate data. This data - required statistical office of Sapienza - were treated to obtain variables in line with the present research and then be reorganized into a diachronic database. From a practical point of view, we analyzed how the DM 509 / 1999 was introduced and implemented within and by the university organization (analyzing a wide variety of phenomena such as dropping out, delayed and decreasing graduations). From a methodological point of view, we came to the creation of longitudinal multidimensional models of the students’ careers, aiming at identifying the "mechanisms” through which from an initial state t 0, a subsequent state t 1 is generated. ...|$|R

500|$|The <b>re-registration</b> {{passed without}} much public comment, {{and the issue}} of his gender would remain a private one until 1965. That December, his elder brother died, leaving daughters but no sons, and thus posing a problem of inheritance. The barony could be {{inherited}} by heirs male or female, and so passed directly to Sempill's eldest daughter Ann, but the baronetcy – along with the bulk of the land – would have to pass to the first male heir. The family had assumed that Ewan would inherit, as the younger brother. Following the death of the Lord Sempill in December 1965, The Times cited Debrett's in reporting that the heir to the baronetcy was the Hon. Ewan Forbes-Sempill, [...] "formerly registered as Elizabeth". However, this was challenged by his cousin John Forbes-Sempill, who argued that the 1952 <b>re-registration</b> was invalid. This would mean that Forbes was still legally considered a woman, unable to inherit the title, and so it would pass to John Forbes-Sempill.|$|E
500|$|At the time, gender <b>re-registration</b> was {{permitted}} {{in a limited}} set of cases; the leading case, decided in 1965, had held that <b>re-registration</b> of this form was only permitted when [...] "the sex of a child was indeterminate at birth and it was later discovered ... that an error had been made". The challenge {{was taken to the}} Court of Session, where the case was heard in great secrecy – no papers were publicly filed, and the judge sat in a solicitor's office rather than in open court to hear the case. However, the records of the case have recently been made available via the National Archives of Scotland. They show that a total of twelve medical experts were called to give evidence, and their testimony was taken by the court to indicate that Forbes was a physical hermaphrodite, which would accord with the legal requirement of [...] "indeterminate at birth". However, the medical evidence was not conclusive; Professor Martin Roth observed in evidence that he felt Forbes' condition was closer to that of a transsexual, and Professor John Strong described the medical tests involved as [...] "not wholly conclusive". The judge ruled in favour of Forbes, though {{it has been suggested that}} the judge desired to ensure the estate and the title was inherited by the [...] "right" [...] candidate, and was flexible with his judgement to obtain this result. The ruling was appealed to the Lord Advocate, who referred the matter to the Home Secretary, James Callaghan. Callaghan finally ruled in December 1968 that Forbes was the rightful holder of the title, confirming the court's decision.|$|E
500|$|On {{moving to}} Alford, Forbes {{had begun to}} {{publicly}} present as a man. In 1952, he formally became male by the simple process of requesting a warrant for birth <b>re-registration</b> from the Sheriff of Aberdeen, registering himself as male, and changing his name to Ewan Forbes-Sempill. He announced this with a notice in the Aberdeen Press and Journal of 12 September 1952: [...] "Dr E. Forbes-Sempill henceforth wishes {{to be known as}} Dr Ewan Forbes-Sempill". His plans had been known in advance to many of his patients, who were reported as universally supportive. Forbes was equally candid with the press, describing the situation to one reporter as [...] "...a ghastly mistake. I was carelessly registered as a girl in the first place, but of course, that was forty years ago ... the doctors in those days were mistaken, too ... I have been sacrificed to prudery, and the horror which our parents had about sex".|$|E

2500|$|A one-off special, {{based on}} the metal-fuselaged DL-1, was built by the Detroit Aircraft Corporation, and {{exported}} to the United Kingdom for Lt. Cmdr. Glen Kidston. It was initially registered in the UK as G-ABFE, then was re-registered as G-ABGK to incorporate Kidston's initials. This Vega was used by him to set a record-breaking time from the UK to South Africa in April 1931. Following Kidston's death the following month, the aircraft was eventually sold to Australian airline owner Horrie Miller for entry by him into the MacRobertson Air Race. Piloted in the race by Miller's Chief Pilot, Capt. Jimmy Woods, it overturned on landing at Aleppo en route, whereupon Woods withdrew from the race and the DL-1A was eventually shipped to Australia. Following repairs and <b>re-registration</b> to VH-UVK, the aircraft was used for charter and leisure flying by Miller, before being impressed by the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941. [...] In 1944 the aircraft {{was transferred to the}} Dept. Civil Aviation. Via information from RAAF pilots, DCA declared the Vega to have serious pitch control problems and would be destroyed.

2500|$|The Free Movement of Workers Regulation {{articles}} 1 to 7 set out {{the main}} provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed {{that he should be}} able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held [...] "the transfer rules constitute an obstacle to free movement" [...] and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving [...] "horizontal" [...] direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was [...] "impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a <b>re-registration</b> charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was [...] "likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding [...] "social advantages", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was [...] "closely linked to the socio-economic situation" [...] of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are [...] "public policy, public security or public health", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for [...] "employment in the public service".|$|E
