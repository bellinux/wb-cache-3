The company began producing currycombs in 1900, and bicycle and automobile frames in 1904. Automobile frames became the company's chief business by 1907.

50|$|The most elaborate, but totally destructive, {{assay method}} is the fire assay, or cupellation. As applied to gold bearing metallics, as in {{hallmark}} assaying, {{it is also}} known as cupellation and can have an accuracy of 1 part in 10,000. In this process the article is melted, the alloys separated and constituents weighed. Since this method is totally destructive, when this method is employed for the assay of jewelry, it is done under the guise of random or selective sampling. For example, if a single manufacturer deposits a lot of <b>rings</b> or <b>watch</b> <b>cases,</b> while most are assayed using the non-destructive methods a few pieces from the lot are randomly selected for fire assay.|$|R

50|$|The {{tool and}} die {{engineer}} would place the <b>watch</b> <b>cases</b> in a fixture that would {{hold them in}} place. A Master Plate design was then selected for the design desired. The pantograph machine would then reduce the design and accurately reproduce it {{on the backs of}} the <b>watch</b> <b>cases.</b> The operator would use a lever that followed the Master Plate design and the diamond tipped cutting tools would cut the design into the blank <b>watch</b> <b>cases.</b> The pantograph machine invented by Andrew Hallberg around 1910 led to hand engraving of pocket watches becoming obsolete after 1930.|$|R

5000|$|The Clamshell's 15-year history {{began in}} 1936 when Gallet {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} a patent for the [...] "waterproof" [...] <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> design (Brevet N° 189190), invented by the Swiss firm of Schmitz Frères & Cie in the neighboring city of Grenchen. By inserting gasket sealed pushbuttons {{into the side of}} this unique <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> design, Gallet was able to expand the water resistant characteristics of the Schmitz Frères concept to the more complex wrist-worn chronograph. Originally engineered by Gallet for the adverse conditions of the battlefield, the Clamshell chronograph derived its nickname from the way that the upper and lower sections of the <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> compressed together over a specially flared crystal, protecting the delicate inner mechanisms from the intrusion of water, dirt, dust, and caustic chemicals.|$|R
