5|$|Pennsylvania has a {{long history}} of stone arch bridges, {{including}} the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. <b>Rubble</b> or third-class masonry construction used stones just as they came from the quarry; squared-stone or second-class masonry used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared; and ashlar or first-class masonry used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared. <b>Rubble</b> masonry was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest tolerances. Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using <b>rubble</b> masonry techniques.|$|E
40|$|A {{pebbling}} move on a graph removes two pebbles at a vertex {{and adds}} one pebble at an adjacent vertex. <b>Rubbling</b> is {{a version of}} pebbling where an additional move is allowed. In this new move, one pebble each is removed at vertices $v$ and $w$ adjacent to a vertex $u$, and an extra pebble is added at vertex $u$. A vertex is reachable from a pebble distribution if {{it is possible to}} move a pebble to that vertex using <b>rubbling</b> moves. The <b>rubbling</b> number is the smallest number $m$ needed to guarantee that any vertex is reachable from any pebble distribution of $m$ pebbles. The optimal <b>rubbling</b> number is the smallest number $m$ needed to guarantee a pebble distribution of $m$ pebbles from which any vertex is reachable. We give bounds for <b>rubbling</b> and optimal <b>rubbling</b> numbers.
