40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{multicast}} communications model using a <b>RingNet</b> hierarchy, called the <b>RingNet</b> model, {{which is a}} combination of logical trees and logical rings for multicast communications. The <b>RingNet</b> hierarchy consists of four tiers: Border Router Tier (BRT), Access Gateway Tier (AGT), Access Proxy Tier (APT), and Mobile Host Tier (MHT). Within the hierarchy, the upper two tiers are dynamically organized into logical rings with network entities. In this paper, based on the <b>RingNet</b> model, local group concept is proposed. For simple illustration, we choose each AG in AGT as the controller of each local group. Each local group has its own independent local group key. The member's join or leave in a local group only affects the local group, which makes multicast communications potentially scalable to very large groups. In this paper, we propose a novel key management scheme for secure multicast with the <b>RingNet</b> model. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{multicast}} communications model, called <b>RingNet,</b> {{which is a}} combination of logical trees and logical rings for multicast communications. Based on <b>RingNet,</b> we propose a reliable totally-ordered group mul-ticast protocol for mobile Internet. The network entities in the top logical ring of the <b>RingNet</b> hierarchy are responsi-ble for totally-ordering messages. All the network entities in all the logical rings are responsible for reliably trans-mitting multicast messages to their next nodes, children nodes, or their attaching mobile hosts, even in handoffs. The proposed protocol runs in a parallel and distributed way in the sense that each network entity only maintains in-formation about its possible neighbors, and independently decides whether, when, and where to order, forward, and deliver multicast messages. We prove that, compared with the multicast protocol without ordering requirement, our totally-ordered multicast protocol provides the same mul-ticast throughput, only with limited overhead on message latency and buffer sizes. 1...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, Internet {{computing}} {{and wireless}} communications are converging. The converged networks are usually called mobile Internet. We propose a novel group communication model called the <b>RingNet</b> model or the <b>RingNet</b> hierarchy for group communications in mobile Internet. This hierarchy {{is a combination}} of logical rings and logical trees, which takes advantages of the simplicity of logical rings and the scalability of logical trees. More importantly, this combination makes this hierarchy highly resilient to failures compared to other hierarchies such as a tree-based hierarchy. Based on this hierarchy, we propose a novel group communication protocol in mobile Internet. The proposed protocol consists of three algorithms: membership propagation, topology maintenance, and multicast dissemination. The proposed protocol is local-information-based in the sense that each network entity in the hierarchy independently propagates membership information along the hierarchy, and that each network entity only needs to maintain local information about its neighbors for topology maintenance, and also that each network entity independently disseminates multicast messages to some of its neighbors. Simulation studies show that the proposed protocol based on the <b>RingNet</b> hierarchy scales very well when the size of the network becomes large, and that it is highly resilient to failures when the node failure probability becomes large.

40|$|Payaos or {{anchored}} FADs {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} Philippine tuna fishery. Currently, spatial regulations on FAD use are implemented with limited observance or understanding of their potential impacts. A combination of semi-structured interviews (n= 150) {{and a total of}} six focus group discussions (n= 61) from purse seine, <b>ringnet</b> and handline fishers of General Santos City provided a coarse indication of fishers' operational patterns and decisions on fishing tactics and strategies. Over a period of about 25 years, Filipino FAD fishers moved from inshore areas to offshore areas to catch oceanic tunas and FAD associated small pelagics and neritic tunas. Presently their catch rates are reported to be significantly higher at more distant sites. Due to the high density and spatial limitations of FADs deployment in nearshore areas, offshore deployment of FADs in a spatial network that is owned by a company has become a strategy to maintain hold of a fishing ground. Purse seine and <b>ringnet</b> fishers, as area specialists, operate from 70 to 1000 km from the fishing port and have an average reported catch rate of 14 t per set. Handline fishers which roam freely between FAD areas claimed by purse seine and <b>ringnet</b> fishing companies which operate from 90 to 1500 km from the fishing port with an average reported catch rate of 1. 6 t per fishing trip. Strategic decisions on the deployment of FADs in fishing grounds were strongly modulated by availability of fishing space, environmental considerations and both experience and information on areas with good catches. Day to day tactical decisions were mainly explained by socially mediated information flows, weather patterns and economic factors, {{and to a lesser extent}} by fish behavior and regulations...|$|E

40|$|Juvenile Triportheus albus (Characidae) were sampled with a <b>ringnet</b> in the Central Amazon {{floodplain}} between March and April 1993. The microstructure of the otoliths of T. albus {{was analyzed}} under the scanning electron microscope. The lapillus shows regular increments when {{ground in the}} sagittal plane and can be utilized for age determination. There are marks or checks formed at intervals of 14 rings, sometimes of 7 rings. Broad increments (> 4. 5 mum) rarely show subrings. The first 160 increments can be counted easily. In individuals which are bigger than 100 mm the microstructures at the edge are often undistinguishable. The calculation by counting of the increments yields an estimated daily growth of 0. 426 mm (p < 0. 01) for juveniles of T albu...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{analytical}} {{models were}} derived {{for the performance}} evaluation of Local Area Networks (LANs) using actual network specification. The performance parameters considered are: maximum achieveable node data rate, average message delay, average node buffer size, maximum number of nodes the network can support, and the network saturation message rate to a node. Performance models were developed for the CSMA-CD, token passing bus, token passing ring, and PBX types networks. The message service disciplines considered are: the packet service discipline (the transmission of the first packet in a user queue), and the byte service discipline (the transmission of all bytes accumulated in a user queue);To facilitate {{the use of the}} derived analytical models, a software tool was developed for the performance evaluation and comparison of LANs. Application of the software tool in generating performance and comparison results for Ethernet, Arcnet, <b>Ringnet,</b> and CBX are included.

40|$|Yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares (Bonnaterre, 1788) and bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus (Lowe, 1839) {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important tuna species in the world. However, identification of their juveniles, especially at sizes less than 40 cm, is very difficult, often leading to misidentification and miscalculation of their catch estimates. Here, we applied the mitochondrial DNA control region D-loop, a recently validated genetic marker used for identifying tuna species (Genus Thunnus), to discriminate juvenile tunas caught by purse seine and <b>ringnet</b> sets around fish aggregating devices (FADs) off the Southern Iloilo Peninsula in Central Philippines. We checked individual identifications using the Neighbor-Joining Method and compared results with morphometric analyses and the liver phenotype. We tested 48 specimens ranging from 13 to 31 cm fork length. Morpho-meristic analyses suggested that 12 specimens (25 %) were bigeye tuna and 36 specimens (75 %) were yellowfin tuna. In contrast, the genetic and liver analyses both showed that 5 specimens (10 %) were bigeye tuna and 43 (90 %) yellowfin tuna. This suggests that misidentification can occur even with highly stringent morpho-meristic characters and that the mtDNA control region and liver phenotype are excellent markers to discriminate juveniles of yellowfin and bigeye tunas...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} a redescription of the little known Chaetognatha Sagitta bombayensis Lele and Gae (1936) "first {{described}} from the Bombay Harbour and subsequently recorded by Rao and Kelly (1962) from Lawsori's Bay, Waltair, {{is evident from the}} recent review of 'Chaetognaths' by Alvarino (1965). George (1949, 1952) considered S. bombayensis a synonym of S. robusta Doncaster (1903), but Rao and Kelly (1962) have drawn attention to a few differences between these two species, at the same time also recognising three stages of maturity which are inadequately described. Apparently the types, one mature and two immature specimens, have not been saved, as Lele and Gae (1936) do not mention of these being deposited in any recognised collection. Hence, in November 1966 one of us (E. G. S.) made special plankton collections from the Bombay Harbour using a half-metre <b>ringnet</b> of No. 20 Swiss Silk Bolting cloth for obtaining topotypes of S. bombayensis to enable a redescription of the species as well as for a taxonomical reappraisal of it. A graded series of the specimens obtained has enabled us to recognise five stages of maturity (including 0 -stage) all of which are described and illustrated in this account. The topotypes are deposited in the research collection of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Mandapam Camp...|$|E
40|$|The {{explosive}} growth of mobile and wireless communications has attracted {{interests in the}} integration of mobile and wireless networks with wired ones and the wired Internet in particular. In {{order to deal with}} the scalability and reliability issues for group communication services in such a network environment, many existing protocols divide the whole group into subgroups and organize them into a tree-based hierarchy. A special node in each subgroup is responsible for collecting acknowledgement messages and locally retransmitting lost messages within the subgroup. However, the tree-based hierarchy has the single point of failure problem, which may seriously affect the performance of group communications. We propose a <b>RingNet</b> hierarchy of proxies that is a combination of logical trees and logical rings. The proposed hierarchy has the self-organization property because it can heal itself as quickly as possible in the presence of failures. Therefore, it has no single point of failure problem. We formally prove that, with high probability of 99. 899 %, the proposed hierarchy with up to 10 000 proxies directly attached by a large number of mobile hosts only needs simple and efficient procedures to repair broken logical rings when the node failure probability is bounded by 0. 1 %. We also validate the proposed protocol by extensive simulations, which show that the proposed protocol scales very well when the size of the network becomes large, and that it is highly resilient to failures when the node failure probability becomes large.

40|$|The {{diversity}} {{and distribution of}} gelatinous zooplankton were investigated along the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) from June to August 2004. Here, we present results from macrozooplankton trawl sampling, as well as comparisons made between five different methodologies that were employed during the MAR-ECO survey. In total, 16 species of hydromedusae, 31 species of siphonophores and four species of scyphozoans were identified to species level from macrozooplankton trawl samples. Additional taxa were identified to higher taxonomic levels and a single ctenophore genus was observed. Samples were collected at 17 stations along the MAR between the Azores and Iceland. A divergence in the species assemblages was observed at the southern limit of the Subpolar Frontal Zone. The catch composition of gelatinous zooplankton is compared between different sampling methodologies including: a macrozooplankton trawl; a Multinet; a <b>ringnet</b> attached to bottom trawl; and optical platforms (Underwater Video Profiler (UVP) & Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)). Different sampling methodologies are shown to exhibit selectivity towards different groups of gelatinous zooplankton. Only ~ 21 % of taxa caught during the survey were caught by both the macrozooplankton trawl and the Multinet when deployed at the same station. The estimates of gelatinous zooplankton abundance calculated using these two gear types also varied widely (1. 4 ± 0. 9 individuals 1000 m- 3 estimated by the macrozooplankton trawl vs. 468. 3 ± 315. 4 individuals 1000 m- 3 estimated by the Multinet (mean ± s. d.) when used at the same stations (n = 6). While it appears that traditional net sampling can generate useful data on pelagic cnidarians, comparisons with results from the optical platforms suggest that ctenophore {{diversity and}} abundance are consistently underestimated, particularly when net sampling is conducted in combination with formalin fixation. The results emphasise the importance of considering sampling methodology both when planning surveys, as well as when interpreting existing data...|$|E
40|$|Since the Discovery Investigations of the 1920 s and 1930 s, {{seawater}} temperatures {{have increased}} in the Atlantic sector by ∼ 1 °C; greater than the global mean rise. The aims of this paper were first to rescue the Discovery macrozooplankton data, second to provide quantitative “baseline” distribution maps, relating these to indices of temperature and food. Our third aim was to use the relationships we derived between abundance and temperature to project the potential affect of a 1 °C warming on the Discovery era distribution patterns. Based on the 1 m <b>ringnet</b> data retrieved from 615 stations (Nov–March), four taxa comprised > 90 % of the Antarctic macrozooplankton abundance: Rhincalanus gigas, Thysanoessa spp., Euphausia superba, and Chaetognaths. Most of the taxa, especially the more abundant ones, were warm water species penetrating into Antarctica and thus total macrozooplankton abundance decreased about 100 -fold from 50 °S to 70 °S. While temperature correlated best with distribution at this large scale, food availability (proxied by a present-day satellite-based Chlorophyll a climatology) had a secondary effect, with the major euphausiids Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa spp. concentrated in high chl a areas. A modelled uniform 1 °C temperature rise produced a poleward shift for all taxa, but the Antarctic continent blocked this re-adjustment for the high latitude species, constricting their predicted range. More widespread polar/sub-polar species were predicted to increase their penetration into Antarctica by 4 – 12 ° in latitude, whereas the poleward shift in potential range of sub-Antarctic taxa were limited by the steep temperature gradient across the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). However, within the Scotia Sea the relatively warm temperatures of the northern Antarctic Zone, abundant food due to iron fertilisation and intense eddy activity provide a “gateway” for northern species to penetrate south of the APF. Our model predictions, based on measured distributional ranges and observed temperature increases, provide a yardstick with which to compare modern day data compilations and assess the potential effects of future temperature increases...|$|E
