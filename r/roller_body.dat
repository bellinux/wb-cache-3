40|$|Abstract. This study {{performs}} DEFORMTM 3 D three-dimensional {{finite element}} simulations {{to analyze the}} plastic deformation of A 1100 / A 3003 sandwich sheets during rolling. The finite element code {{is based on a}} rigid-plastic model, and the simulations in this study assume that the <b>rollers</b> are rigid <b>bodies</b> and that the deformation-induced change in temperature during rolling is negligible. The rolled product comprises a central sheet of A 1100 aluminum alloy sandwiched between upper and lower sheets of either A 3003 or A 6063 aluminum alloy. The simulations examine the effects of sheet thickness and reduction ratio on the maximum effective stress, maximum effective strain, Y-direction load, and maximum damage induced within the rolled product. This study also compares the simulation results for the final thicknesses of the three layers in the rolled A 1100 / A 3003 (A 6063) sandwich sheet with experimental measurements and bonding conditions...|$|R

5000|$|The {{raised band}} concept was {{expanded}} over {{the upper body}} to a repeating circumferential pattern, incised or stamped at first, then rolled with a seal-like <b>roller</b> around the <b>body</b> of the pithos {{while it was still}} fresh clay. Some common themes are spirals, meanders, and waves. Waves in relief give the appearance of slack rope; whether they were intended to be that is debatable. Slack rope lifts nothing; moreover, a rope around the neck of the pithos for lifting would only concentrate the weight on the neck, probably shattering it. Multiple lugs, loops and handles indicate that for lifting purposes some sort of harness to distribute the weight must have been used. Rope may have been used during decoration for impressing patterns. These rope-like waves, regardless of the potter's possible intent, have been termed [...] "rope patterns" [...] or [...] "rope decoration", with a certain ambiguity of meaning as to whether actual rope was used to physically impress them, or they are merely intended to visually resemble rope.|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{rotary machine}} with multi-supporting, such as rotary kiln and rope laying machine, {{is the key}} equipment in the architectural, chemistry, and agriculture industries. The <b>body,</b> <b>rollers,</b> wheels, and bearings constitute a chain multibody system. Axis line deflection is a vital parameter to determine mechanics state of rotary machine, thus body axial vibration needs to be studied for dynamic monitoring and adjusting of rotary machine. By using the Riccati transfer matrix method, the body system of rotary machine is divided into many subsystems composed of three elements, namely, rigid disk, elastic shaft, and linear spring. Multiple wheel-bearing structures are simplified as springs. The transfer matrices of the body system and overall transfer equation are developed, {{as well as the}} response overall motion equation. Taken a rotary kiln as an instance, natural frequencies, modal shape, and response vibration with certain exciting axis line deflection are obtained by numerical computing. The body vibration modal curves illustrate the cause of dynamical errors in the common axis line measurement methods. The displacement response can be used for further measurement dynamical error analysis and compensation. The response overall motion equation could be applied to predict the body motion under abnormal mechanics condition, and provide theory guidance for machine failure diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The present wave {{transformation}} models for random waves {{make use of}} an explicit formulation of the energy dissipation. A time-averaged model has been studied in which the dissipation rate per breaking wave is estimated from that in a bore of corresponding height. The probability of occurrence of breaking is derived from a wave height distribution in which all breaking waves have been assumed {{to have the same}} height. This probability can be interpreted as the fraction of waves that are breaking at a certain location. Comparisons with measurements show that with the calibrated values for the parameters the wave height decay is predicted well, The fraction of breaking waves however is underpredicted, especially for high steepness waves. A second drawback is an inaccurate prediction of the mean water level. The positive gradient in the mean water level is predicted too early compared to measurements. The prediction of the mean water level has been improved by taking the transition zone into account. In this zone shoreward of the breaker point the just broken wave develops its turbulence. It is characterised by a rapid wave height decay and roughly constant mean water level. The organised wave energy is not dissipated immediately, but transferred into kinetic energy of the so-called <b>roller,</b> a <b>body</b> of water at the front face of the wave. A recently developed model has been used for the contribution of the roller in which the fraction of breaking waves plays an important role. A sensitivity analysis of the model with respect to its parameter values has lead to two improvements in the model. The first improvement consists of a new choice of the two free parameters in the model. With the new parameter setting both wave height decay and fraction of breaking waves can be predicted well. The second improvement consists of a small change in the formulation of the dissipation rate. In this formulation the energy dissipation rate in a breaking wave more closely resembles the dissipation in a bore. The optimal parameter values yield similar predictions of wave height and fraction of breaking waves, but the parameters have a clearer physical meaning. For the parameters qualitative relations have been found with wave and bottom parameters. On non-monotonic profiles the predictions of the fraction of breaking waves are less satisfactory. The maximum fraction of breaking waves is not found at the bar-crest, as predicted, but some di stance beyond it. Also the model is not able to reproduce the breaking persistenee of the waves. In the analysis existing laboratory measurements have been used on both plane slopes and non-monotonic profiles. Video records of large scale experiments have been analysed for the fraction of breaking waves. The study has taken place at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona as part of the ERASMUS exchange program. Ocean wavesHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The high curve speed railway {{vehicles}} of the Japanese National Railways, {{the so called}} pendulum swing trains, have been running since 1973 {{with the aim of}} increasing speed on ordinary routes with a lot of curve track sections. The structure of high curve speed railway vehicles is designed to set up <b>rollers</b> between the <b>body</b> and the bogie, so as to be capable of running at higher speed at the curve sections, compared with that of older-type trains, by inclining the body when centrifugal force occurs. Although the aim of increased speed has been attained, it has been pointed out that the swing of the high curve speed railway vehicles is stronger than that of older-type trains. In this study, the author examined the motion sickness induced by the swing of these railway vehicles among both passengers and conductors with a selfadministrated questionnaire. The results are summarized as follows: 1) A higher percentage of passengers complaining of motion sickness and riding discomfort was observed in the high curve speed railway vehicles than in the control trains. The passengers pointed out the swing of the high curve speed vehicles most frequently as the reason for riding discomfort. 2) Conductors working on high curve speed railway vehicles complained of motion sickness symptoms at significantly higher rates on both outward and inward way than in the control trains. 3) Although more preventive measures against motion sickness were taken by conductors on high curve speed vehicles, they still suffered more from motion sickness and experienced more difficulties {{in the course of their}} work than those on the control trains. 4) It was considered that the difference between the rates of conductors and passengers complaining of motion sickness were due to the difference in responses to the riding on the train between the two groups. 5) Working on high curve speed railway vehicles brought conductors not only motion sickness but also subjective feeling of fatigue as well. Judging from these results, the high rate of subjective complaints of passengers and couductors riding on high curve speed railway vehicles resulted from the difference between the structure of these vehicles and that of older-type trains...|$|R
