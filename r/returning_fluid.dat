40|$|In an {{oil well}} {{drilling}} operation, a proper {{knowledge of the}} <b>return</b> <b>fluid</b> flowrate is necessary both for the stabilization of the bottom hole pressure of the well and also as a primary indication of a kick or loss. In practice, the drill fluid flowing through the return line is usually measured with Coriolis meters. However this method is both expensive and has some downsides. For instance {{there is a risk}} of blockage due to drill cuttings while measuring the discharge. The presence of gas and cuttings in the drilling fluid will also have a negative effect in the measurement i. e. for multi-phase fluid, the readings from Coriolis meters may not be accurate. A cheaper alternative would be to use an open channel for the measurement of the discharge from the return flowline. In this paper, a venturi rig is used as the open channel and modeled by the Saint Venant equations. Experimental verification of the simulation results show a promising behavior of the model based measurement of the <b>return</b> <b>fluid</b> flow...|$|R
50|$|The key to {{the torque}} converter's ability to {{multiply}} torque lies in the stator. In the classic fluid coupling design, periods of high slippage cause the fluid flow returning from the turbine to the impeller to oppose the direction of impeller rotation, leading to a significant loss of efficiency and the generation of considerable waste heat. Under the same condition in a torque converter, the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> will be redirected by the stator so that it aids {{the rotation of the}} impeller, instead of impeding it. The result is that much of the energy in the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> is recovered and added to the energy being applied to the impeller by the prime mover. This action causes a substantial increase in the mass of fluid being directed to the turbine, producing an increase in output torque. Since the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> is initially traveling in a direction opposite to impeller rotation, the stator will likewise attempt to counter-rotate as it forces the fluid to change direction, an effect that is prevented by the one-way stator clutch.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{radially}} straight blades {{used in a}} plain fluid coupling, a torque converter's turbine and stator use angled and curved blades. The {{blade shape}} of the stator is what alters {{the path of the}} fluid, forcing it to coincide with the impeller rotation. The matching curve of the turbine blades helps to correctly direct the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> to the stator so the latter can do its job. The shape of the blades is important as minor variations can result in significant changes to the converter's performance.|$|E
50|$|During {{the stall}} and {{acceleration}} phases, in which torque multiplication occurs, the stator remains stationary {{due to the}} action of its one-way clutch. However, as the torque converter approaches the coupling phase, the energy and volume of the fluid returning from the turbine will gradually decrease, causing pressure on the stator to likewise decrease. Once in the coupling phase, the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> will reverse direction and now rotate {{in the direction of}} the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator. At this point, the stator clutch will release and the impeller, turbine and stator will all (more or less) turn as a unit.|$|E

The Antarctic Geological Drilling (ANDRILL) {{researchers}} {{obtained a}} rock core from below the sea-floor in South McMurdo Sound (SMS), Antarctica. During the core retrieval, approximately 5. 6 x 105 liters of drilling fluid {{was lost in}} the subsurface. The loss of this fluid, which contained biodegradable components, may significantly alter the in situ microbial ecology as well as the geochemistry of the subsurface. The introduction of drilling fluid into the subsurface {{can be viewed as a}} source of contamination. However, it also provides the opportunity to indirectly study the microbial communities of the subsurface through analyses of the <b>return</b> drilling <b>fluids.</b> This study focused on the differences between new (uncirculated) <b>fluids</b> and the <b>return</b> drilling <b>fluids</b> circulated at depth, along with the chemical and microbial changes that took place during the biodegradation of drilling fluid. Drilling fluid samples were incubated for forty days at 4, 20 and 50 °C representing the in situ temperatures, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Geochemical analyses were completed and microbial community fingerprints were constructed and compared. The <b>return</b> <b>fluids</b> show significant differences in the geochemistry compared to the new fluids specifically in regards to the ions Barium, Thallium, Lead, Manganese, Iron, and Boron. The <b>return</b> drilling <b>fluids</b> have higher DNA concentrations than the new fluids counterparts within the first four days of the biodegradation experiment. The use of Biolog Ecoplates(TM) revealed that microbes in the <b>return</b> <b>fluids</b> utilized significantly less carbon substrates than those in the new fluids. RAPD-PCR results showed the <b>return</b> <b>fluids</b> exhibited significantly less diversity and species evenness than the microbes in the new fluids. DNA concentrations fluctuated over time, with a direct relationship among fluid type. There are shifts in the community structure and function as biodegradation occurs that varies between the different incubation environments. In situ temperatures ≤ 4 °C were recorded for the top ~ 21 meters of the borehole. In anaerobic environments and temperatures ≤ 4 °C, slower microbial metabolism may increase the residence time of the biodegradable drilling fluid components, allowing these components the opportunity to penetrate further into the surrounding formation through conduits. The 20 °C temperatures recorded at ~ 360 -~ 384 mbsf may be the most favorable conditions for the biodegradation of the drilling fluids allowing the least amount of migration of the biodegradable components into the surrounding formation. At a depth of ~ 1026 mbsf, 50 °C in situ borehole temperatures were recorded. From this depth through to the final depth of ~ 1139 mbsf and 57 °C, the higher temperatures may result in smaller microbial populations that are able to metabolize the drilling fluid, leading to further drilling fluid migration into the surrounding formation.

30|$|Blowout {{incidents}} {{not only}} lead to fatalities but also cause loss of assets, expensive clean-up, costly incident investigations and reports, and {{negative impact on the}} environment. The 2010 Macondo blowout accident in the Gulf of Mexico was an eye-opener for many oil and gas operators and oilfield service companies; thus, making early kick detection technology research one of the top industry agendas. However, only limited {{progress has been made in}} detection technologies that focus on downhole parameters due to the complexity of offshore drilling operations that is increasingly shifting towards the deepwater. Therefore, the current paper experimentally explores downhole drilling parameters for kick indication during drilling. The study utilizes a fully instrumented laboratory scale drilling rig coupled with an air injection and surface monitoring systems. This study observed a sudden jump in bottomhole pressure, increased volume of the <b>return</b> <b>fluid,</b> decreased density of the <b>return</b> <b>fluid,</b> reduced rate of penetration, and increased rotary speed as indicators of kick. The most significant new finding, which is also validated with field reports, is the dampening effects of the drilling vibrations due to kick. Frequency analysis of the axial bit–rock displacements/vibrations confirms the changes of frequencies due to kick induction during drilling. Coupling this important finding with dynamic drilling models, the response of the drilling system at surface (e.g. standpipe, choke pressures, etc.) indicating this change can be predicted.|$|R

50|$|Gastric lavage {{involves}} {{the passage of}} a tube (such as an Ewald tube) via the mouth or nose down into the stomach followed by sequential administration and removal of small volumes of liquid. The placement of the tube in the stomach must be confirmed either by air insufflation while listening to the stomach, by pH testing a small amount of aspirated stomach contents, or x-ray. This is to ensure the tube is not in the lungs. In adults, small amounts of warm water or saline are administered and, via a siphoning action, removed again. In children, normal saline is used, as children are more at risk of developing hyponatremia if lavaged with water. Because of the possibility of vomiting, a suction device is always on hand in case of pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents. Lavage is repeated until the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> shows no further gastric contents. If the patient is unconscious or cannot protect their airway then the patient should be intubated before performing lavage.

40|$|Background. Chronic {{haemodialysis}} (HD) may relieve {{some medical}} problems of terminal uraemia, but {{the life expectancy}} of patients is still significantly shortened, {{and there is a}} greatly increased morbidity. This includes pul-monary morbidity and chronic central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. Previous studies have shown that a considerable amount of air microbubbles emanate within the blood lines of the dialysis device and pass the air de-tector without sounding an alarm. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether microemboli can pass to the pa-tient and whether they could be detected in the carotid artery. Methods. A total of 54 patients on chronic HD (16 with central dialysis catheter) were investigated with an ultra-sound detector (Hatteland, Røyken, Norway) for the pres-ence of microemboli at the arteriovenous (AV) fistula/graft and at the common carotid artery before and during HD. Measurements were taken for 2 and 5 min, respectively. Non-parametric paired statistics were used (Wilcoxon). Results. The median number (range) and mean ± SD of microembolic signals detected at the AV access site before commencing dialysis and during HD were 0 (0 – 3) and 0. 2 ± 0. 5 versus 4 (0 – 85) and 13. 5 ± 20 (P = 0. 000); at the carotid artery, 1 (0 – 14) and 1. 7 ± 2. 9 versus 2 (0 – 36) and 3. 5 ± 5. 8 (P = 0. 008).

40|$|EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS An {{excellent}} view {{can often}} be obtained without any preparation, but if faeces obscure the view the immediate use of a rectal suppository may enable a complete sigmoid-oscopic examination to be made. The sigmoidoscope has been an essential adjunct to digital and radiological examination of the lower bowel since Bardenheuer first invented the instru-ment in 1863 (Norbury, 1949). Sigmoidoscopy permits the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} many disorders of the bowel, while it is equally valuable for excluding organic lesions in patients with psychological disturbances. In particular almost 80 % of cancers of the large bowel lie within reach of the sigmoidoscope (Smiddy and Goligher, 1957). The main object of sigmoidoscopy is to inspect the lining of the bowel which should therefore be as empty as possible for the examination. Though good views are usually obtained without preparation of the patient, it is often necessary in other cases to empty a loaded rectum by artificial means to carry out a thorough examination. Aperients are variable in effect and it may not be safe to give them before a diagnosis has been made because of the risk of aggravating such conditions as colitis or intestinal obstruction. A soap and water enema alone or followed by a bowel washout has three disadvantages; first, <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> often persistently floods the field of vision at sigmoid-oscopy; second, the procedures may cause local discomfort or even damage to the rectum; third, the length of time involved in this method of preparation makes it impracticable for use in out-patient clinics. To clean out the loaded rectum through the sig-moidoscope by means of sucker, swabs, and forceps may be effective but is truly a Herculean task.

The authors therefore investigated the efficacy of lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) alone as compared with blood plus LRS resuscitation on body weight change and mortality rate after severe trauma-hemorrhagic shock. Rats, 250 to 310 g (n = 85), had a midline laparotomy performed (i. e., trauma induced), the incision was closed, and a carotid artery, jugular vein, and femoral artery were cannulated. The unrestrained, nonheparinized rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia and were bled within 10 minutes to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mmHg. This MAP was maintained by removing more blood until the animal was unable to compensate (maximal bleedout; MB). The MAP was further maintained at 40 mmHg by <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> (LRS) until 50 % of the MB volume (MBV) was returned. The rats were then resuscitated: group 1 with LRS 4 times the MBV; group 2 with 5 x LRS; group 3 with the shed blood returned + 2 x LRS. There {{was no difference between}} the groups in the initial weights, MAP, or hematocrit (Hct), percentage of blood volume removed, time to MB, or time to end of hemorrhage.

Body weight gain was greater in group 2 compared with either of the other groups (p less than 0. 05) on day 1 after hemorrhage because of edema, but no differences were seen on subsequent days.
