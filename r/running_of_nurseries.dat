500|$|Within {{two months}} of the marriage, Victoria was pregnant. Albert started to take on public roles; he became President of the Society for the Extinction of Slavery (slavery had already been {{abolished}} throughout the British Empire, but was still lawful {{in places such as}} the United States and the colonies of France); and helped Victoria privately with her government paperwork. In June 1840, while on a public carriage ride, Albert and the pregnant Victoria were shot at by Edward Oxford, who was later judged insane. Neither Albert nor Victoria was hurt and Albert was praised in the newspapers for his courage and coolness during the attack. Albert was gaining public support as well as political influence, which showed itself practically when, in August, Parliament passed the Regency Act 1840 to designate him regent in the event of Victoria's death before their child reached the age of majority. Their first child, Victoria, named after her mother, was born in November. Eight other children would follow over the next seventeen years. All nine children survived to adulthood, a fact which biographer Hermione Hobhouse credited to Albert's [...] "enlightened influence" [...] on the healthy <b>running</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nursery.</b> In early 1841, he successfully removed the nursery from Lehzen's pervasive control, and in September 1842, Lehzen left Britain permanently—much to Albert's relief.|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to insufficiently studied aspects {{of the history of}} the Volga Germans. On the basis of the {{documents}} kept in the State Historical Archives of the Volga Germans, the author reveals the peculiarities of formation and development <b>of</b> the <b>nursery</b> care system in the USSR of Volga Germans in 1920 - 1930 s. In the article measures on preparing medical and pedagogical staff are reviewed. It was concluded that the establishment <b>of</b> <b>nurseries</b> led not only to improvement of children’s health, but also released labour force of peasant women for the national economy. The author found that the first information about the opening <b>of</b> <b>nurseries</b> in the German autonomy is related to 1921 – from that moment an active process of formation of the Soviet system <b>of</b> <b>nursery</b> facilities in the region had begun. Due to large-scale famine of the early 1920 s, existence <b>of</b> <b>nurseries</b> was under threat, despite the active government policy on this issue. Only in 1925 the matter of protection of motherhood and childhood stabilized, and with active support of female population of Volga Germans started to rapidly gain the momentum. In the mid- 1930 s more than 5 000 children in ASSR NP became pupils <b>of</b> <b>nurseries.</b> All the year round a woman was able to break free from the hassle of taking care of children and the young generation from the first years of life was brought up under state control. The operation <b>of</b> <b>nurseries</b> caused both a need and an interest among German women, in contrast to many other social projects of the Soviet power against women. The author concludes that the mass distribution <b>of</b> <b>nurseries</b> in the territory of ASSR NP and their introduction into the social environment, allows considering them as significant administrative practices aimed at the destruction of traditional ways of life of women, effective even in the national autonomy...|$|R
