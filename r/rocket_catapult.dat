2500|$|The first {{ejection}} seat fitted to early F-106s was {{a variation of}} the seat used by the F-102 and was called the Weber interim seat. It was a catapult seat which used an explosive charge to propel it clear of the aircraft.

It was designed with supersonic ejection as the primary criterion since the F-106 was capable of Mach-2 performance. Fighter pilots viewed high speed ejections as the most important. Seat designers viewed an ejection at low altitude and slow speed as the most likely possibility. The ejection sequence with the B-seat was quite complicated and there were some unsuccessful ejections that resulted in pilot fatalities. The third seat, that replaced the Convair B-seat, was the Weber Zero-Zero ROCAT (for <b>ROcket</b> <b>CATapult)</b> seat. Weber Aircraft Corporation designed a [...] "zero-zero" [...] seat to operate at up to [...] High-altitude supersonic ejections were rare and ejections at relatively low altitudes and low speeds were more likely. The Weber “zero-zero” seat was satisfactory and was retrofitted to the F-106 after 1965.|$|E

25|$|From April 1966 to February 1969, Intrepid {{made three}} Vietnam deployments, with Carrier Air Wing 10 embarked. Mid-1966 found Intrepid with the Pacific Fleet off Vietnam. Nine A-4 Skyhawks and six A-1 Skyraiders, loaded with bombs and <b>rockets,</b> were <b>catapulted</b> in seven minutes, {{with only a}} 28-second {{interval}} between launches. A few days later planes were launched at 26-second intervals. After seven months of service with the United States Seventh Fleet off Vietnam, Intrepid returned to Norfolk having earned her commanding officer, Captain John W. Fair, the Legion of Merit for combat operations in Southeast Asia.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of studies {{conducted}} for the U. S. Air Force Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories (1, 2) specification of the dynamic response index or DRI, which {{is a measure of}} human spinal compression and rrobability of injury, has been adopted as a new criterion for d,. temining the acceptable tolerance level of humans to the personnel ejection environment. Prior to the adoption of the DRI the maximum acceleration and maximum time rate of change of acceleration were the primary determinants. The specification of the DRI is more realistic, however, in that it relates directly to stresses actually developed within the ejectee. This study was conducted to determine a more optimum ballistic cycle for the catapult phase of <b>rocket</b> <b>catapult</b> operation in terms of minimization of the DRI for a selected class of acceleration-time output. THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE INDEX The dynamic response index arose from an attempt to analyticaliy describe the effect of acceleration on an ejectee in terms of spinal compression, 4 (ft), and then relate this effect to the probability of injury. A plot of the operational injury rate vs DRI is shown in Figure 1 (3). Experimental studies have led to a second order differential equation relating spinal compression k to the longitudinally applied acceleration, A(t). This relation i...|$|E
40|$|Emergency crew escape {{capabilities}} {{have been}} less than adequate for fighter aircraft since before WW II. From the over-the-side bailout of those days through the current ejection seat with a <b>rocket</b> <b>catapult,</b> escaping from a disabled aircraft has been risky at best. Current efforts are underway toward developing a high-tech, smart ejection seat that will give fighter pilots more room {{to live in the}} sky, but an escape capsule is needed to meet current and future fighter envelopes. Escape capsules have a bad reputation due to past examples of high weight, poor performance and great complexity. However, the advantages available demand that a capsule be developed. This capsule concept will minimize the inherent disavantages and incorporate the benefits while integrating all aspects of crew station design. The resulting design is appropriate for a crew station of the year 2010 and includes improved combat acceleration protection, chemical or biological combat capability, improved aircraft to escape system interaction, and the highest level of escape performance achievable. The capsule is compact, which can allow a reduced aircraft size and weighs only 1200 lb. The escape system weight penalty is only 120 lb higher than that for the next ejection seat and the capsule has a corresponding increase in performance...|$|E

Using group of newly invented <b>rockets,</b> the Nazis <b>catapult</b> the JSA into space. Hawkman lands on Saturn, Sandman on Uranus, Doctor Mid-Nite on Neptune, Starman on Jupiter, Atom on Mars, Spectre on Pluto, Johnny Thunder on Mercury, and Wonder Woman on Venus. Each member helps the natives on that world and then returns to Earth with technology to aid the war effort. On Earth, the reunited JSA defeats the Nazis who captured them. While on Venus and being watched by the goddess Aphrodite, who directs her rocket towards Venus, Wonder Woman first meets Desira, the Queen of Venus. Together they battle Solaris and his Meteor Men, who are killing {{the men of the}} planet, and Wonder Woman, after capturing the men, receives the gift of magnetic hearing, which enables her to read the Queen's mind.(All-Star Comics #13, All-Star Squadron #57) ...|$|R
