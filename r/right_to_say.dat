5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> where he should live.|$|E
25|$|States have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no {{to retail}} FDI within their jurisdiction. States {{have the right}} to add {{restrictions}} to the retail policy announced before they implement them. Thus, they can place limits on number, market share, style, diversity, homogeneity and other factors to suit their cultural preferences. Finally, in future, states can always introduce regulations and India can change the law to ensure the benefits of retail reforms reach the poorest and weakest segments of Indian society, free and fair retail competition does indeed lead to sharply lower inflation than current levels, small farmers get better prices, jobs created by organised retail pay well, and healthier food becomes available to more households.|$|E
25|$|Sirius Black owned {{a flying}} motorbike, which he lent to Hagrid the night Harry's parents died. It is first seen when Hagrid {{delivers}} the baby Harry to Number 4, Privet Drive {{in the first}} book, and then again when Hagrid uses it transport Harry to a safe house in the seventh volume. In Deathly Hallows, various modifications {{have been made to}} the bike by Mr. Weasley, allowing it to create a brick wall or a net that erupts from the exhaust pipe and to shoot dragon fire from the exhaust, impelling the bike's sudden acceleration. The dragon-fire feature is used to great effect by Hagrid and Harry when being chased by Voldemort; however, Mr. Weasley did warn that he was unsure of its safety and that they should use it only in an emergency. He was <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, as the sidecar of the motorbike, unaffected by Hagrid's magic dislodged after the abrupt acceleration.|$|E

Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament ... is being qualified ... The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. The fact that your Lordships {{have been willing to}} hear this appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament's legislative sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian Coe and Jacques Rogge then {{appeared}} on a stage {{that was in the}} form of an arrow pointing towards Rio. Coe thanked all of the people who had helped make the Olympics happen.

Coe thanked the country for getting behind the Games, and recalled his words from the Opening Ceremony [...] "these will be a games for everyone", concluding [...] "these were a games by everyone."

500|$|The Marcellus Formation, a shale rich {{in natural}} gas, lies {{thousands}} of feet below Worlds End State Park and much of Pennsylvania. As of June 30, 2012, there were 127 active gas wells in Sullivan County, with 14 of those in Forks or Shrewsbury Townships. The state did not purchase the mineral rights {{to much of the}} land it owns. Energy company Anadarko has [...] "reportedly purchased 50 percent of the mineral rights under the [...] state forest", and plans to drill in it. About 80 percent of the mineral rights to its state parks are not owned by Pennsylvania, and the owner of Worlds End State Park's mineral rights is unknown. According to William Kocher, Worlds End's manager, [...] "if the owner decided to drill ... the state would have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no."

500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|While all her contemporaries in Chile {{recognised}} her heroism, and {{the common}} soldiers she served with looked up to her as the [...] "nun of charity," [...] some men said Morales {{had gone too far}} for a woman by taking up a rifle. Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna praised her for her dedication and bravery and for her hatred for those who killed her husband, but in 1881 gave her the free advice that she should not put herself at such risk and should [...] "return quietly to her poor home and restart the life of a real woman in manual labor, in caring for her relatives, in work with the needle and thimble, and exchange, after several years of adventures and passions, the revolver for her honored and beloved sewing machine." [...] She did not follow this advice and remained in the army {{until the end of the}} war, fighting in the Battle of Huamachuco on 10 July 1883, the last battle of the war. Men like Mackenna were <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she put herself at unusual risk for a woman at the time, for several other Chilean cantinières were killed after being captured by Peruvians during the war.|$|E
500|$|On November 28, in {{response}} to this incident, a Chilean government spokesman stated that a scheduled visit to Chile by the Peruvian defense minister, Antero Flores Aráoz, might be inopportune given the circumstances. The following day, Flores Aráoz announced his decision to postpone his trip after conferring with the Foreign Affairs Minister, José García Belaúnde. Several members of the Peruvian government commented on the spokesman's remarks including president García who said the country [...] "did not accept pressure or orders from anybody outside of Peru". Donayre defended the video, declaring that Peruvian citizens have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whatever they want at private gatherings and that even though he is scheduled to retire on December 5 he will not be forced to resign early under external pressure. As a consequence of these exchanges, tensions between Peru and Chile rose again; president Bachelet met with top aides on December 1 to discuss the matter and possible courses of action. Meanwhile, in Lima, Congressman Gustavo Espinoza became the center of attention as the main suspect of leaking the video to Chilean press and politicians. Donayre ended his tenure as Commanding General of the Army on December 5, 2008, as expected; president Alan García appointed General Otto Guibovich as his replacement.|$|E

[...] In other words, gender factors may influence which of many possible scientific truths are discovered. They also suggest that, in criticising Irigaray, Sokal and Bricmont sometimes go beyond their area of expertise in the sciences and simply express a differing position on gender politics.|$|E
