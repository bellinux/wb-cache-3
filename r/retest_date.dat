40|$|This update warned workers {{about the}} {{possibility}} of respirator gas cylinder explosions during refilling with compressed air. The case in point involved a 47 year old firefighter who was killed when the neck portion of the cylinder separated and struck him in the upper chest and neck. Several other incidents were on record reporting the explosion of DOT-E 7235 4500 PSI cylinders. In October of 1985, NIOSH and the US Department of Transportation began requiring that these cylinders be retrofitted with a steel reinforcing ring. The cylinder involved in this specific fatal accident had not been retrofitted and was in service beyond its maximum 15 year service life. It was estimated that as many as 8, 000 of these cylinders may remain in service without the required retrofit. NIOSH urges that all compressed gas cylinders be examined, and that any of this type be removed from service if they have not been retrofitted or if they have exceeded the 15 year period of service. The last hydrostatic <b>retest</b> <b>date</b> stamped on the neck should be identified and the cylinder removed from service if the date is more than 3 years old. All compressed gas cylinders should be treated with caution. OtherOccupational Healt...|$|E
50|$|This {{standard}} {{is used in}} both Australia and New Zealand. Colloquially, the {{standard is}} often referred to as Test and Tag. Testing can be done by anyone deemed competent by training or experience. It does not require a registered electrician. Many businesses are required to maintain records of their compliance with AS/NZS 3760:2010 and can use tools such as PATorganiser to record testing dates, equipment tested and <b>retest</b> <b>dates.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 2009, {{the launch}} was {{expected}} to occur no earlier than November 29, 2009, however the launch was subsequently postponed ten more times, to launch dates in February, March, April, May, and June 2010, for multiple reasons including finding an open launch <b>date,</b> approvals, and <b>retesting.</b> The launch <b>date</b> was eventually set for June 4, 2010.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s “chronometric hygiene” {{radiocarbon}} dating aka, high-precision radiocarbon dating approach of samples also {{started to be}} employed causing further reconsideration of old orthodoxies. Using chronometric hygiene, previous samples from all around Hawai'i were retested. On the lowest calibration of testing the <b>retested</b> samples returned <b>dates</b> of between 1100-1200 AD, with some samples from Kaua'i going back to around 1000 AD.|$|R
40|$|To whom all {{correspondence}} should be addressed. tability {{is defined as}} the capacity of a drug substance or drug product to remain within established specifica-tions to maintain its identity, strength, quality, and pu-rity throughout the <b>retest</b> or expiration <b>dating</b> periods (1). Physical, chemical, and microbiological data are gener-ated as a function of time and storage conditions (e. g., tem-perature and relative humidity [RH]). Stability testing pro-vides evidence that the quality of a drug substance or drug product under the influence of various environmental factors changes with time (2). Although the storage conditions are relatively constant, the distribution environment can vary greatly, especially when a drug product is shipped between various climatic zones (1). Seasonal changes, mode of trans-portation, and the number of drop-off points are also vari...|$|R
