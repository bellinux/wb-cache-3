5|$|A {{small portion}} of Port <b>Republic</b> Road through Port <b>Republic</b> was {{included}} in the state highway system by the late 1920s as part of the highway between Waynesboro and Elkton. This section was paved in the early 1930s and carried three different route numbers until it was transferred to the secondary system in the early 1940s. Port <b>Republic</b> Road was placed on its modern alignment through Port <b>Republic</b> in the mid-1950s, by which time almost all of the highway was paved. SR 659, which was assigned to Port <b>Republic</b> Road from Harrisonburg to near Cross Keys, was extended southeast through Port <b>Republic</b> by the mid-1970s. Port <b>Republic</b> Road was expanded to four lanes within Harrisonburg in the mid-1990s and mid-2000s and along a short stretch south from the city limits in the early 2010s. SR 659 was brought into the primary highway system as SR 253 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, the {{territory}} was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, {{leading to the}} Cameroonian Independence War fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the <b>Republic</b> of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern part of British Cameroons federated with it in 1961 to form the Federal <b>Republic</b> of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in 1972.

When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the Dominican <b>Republic</b> issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti.

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican <b>Republic,</b> legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican <b>Republic</b> {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the Dominican <b>Republic</b> are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican <b>Republic.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1945, the Socialist Federal <b>Republic</b> of Yugoslavia was governed as {{a federal}} socialist state {{comprising}} six newly created republics– Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a majority Serb population to the Socialist <b>Republic</b> of Serbia and those with a Croatian majority to the Socialist <b>Republic</b> of Croatia. This left a large Serb minority in Croatian territory.|$|E

Although war between Britain and the Batavian <b>Republic</b> had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to be seized and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to the French.
