5000|$|The channel input strips {{are usually}} {{a bank of}} {{identical}} monaural or stereo input channels. Each channel has <b>rotary</b> knobs, <b>buttons</b> and/or faders for controlling the gain and equalization (e.g., bass and treble) of the signal on each channel. Depending on the mixer, a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes, turn on an attenuator [...] "pad", or activate other features.|$|R

30|$|For what it {{concerns}} HMI devices this scenario has {{the consequence of}} a growing number of displays and new input devices as <b>buttons,</b> <b>rotary</b> knobs and touch screens on the dashboard and the steering wheel but there is a general attempt, confirmed also by the results of the aforementioned research projects COMUNICAR and AIDE, to integrate the information and its management to optimize and rationalize the dialogue between the driver and the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|MIDI {{keyboards}} are a {{very common}} feature of a recording studio, and any DAW setup. Most include a transpose function {{and the ability to}} set different octaves. Many MIDI keyboards have pitch bend and modulation wheels. Some also have extra sets of assignable <b>rotary</b> knobs and/or <b>buttons</b> for sending custom MIDI messages to the synthesiser, sampler or DAW software. Devices with extra features (also including rhythm input, instrument selection, transport control) are sometimes called keyboard controllers.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that there}} were two {{distinct}} versions of the FM, depending on how the FM's light meter (see below) was activated when a motor drive was mounted. The original FM had a <b>rotary</b> switch shutter <b>button</b> collar to lock the shutter, or switch to motor drive mode when the MD-11 was mounted. The MD-12 activated the meter automatically and the switch was omitted on late (1979 or after) FMs. Nippon Kogaku also took the opportunity to construct late FMs more strongly internally than early FMs.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is design and {{construction}} of amplifier for high quality home listening experience. Device is able to process both analogue signal and high sampling frequency digital input with high audio bit depth. Scope of the thesis covers the design of all the functional units: input signal circuit, S/PDIF receiver, D/A converter, high performance class D amplifier and precise headphone amplifier for dynamic sound presentation. Thesis also cover design of all control circuits containing <b>rotary</b> encoder with <b>button</b> input, microcontroller unit, digital potentiometer and segment display...|$|R
50|$|Since control {{surfaces}} {{are designed to}} perform different functions, they vary widely in size, shape and number and type of controls. A basic control surface for mixing resembles a traditional analogue mixing console, featuring faders, knobs (<b>rotary</b> encoders), and <b>buttons</b> that can be assigned to parameters in the software. Other {{control surfaces}} are designed to give a musician control over the sequencer while recording, and thus provide transport controls (remote control of record, playback and song position). Control surfaces are often incorporated into MIDI controllers to give the musician more control over an instrument. Control surfaces with motorized faders can read and write console automation.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of drive by wire (or more properly, shift by wire) {{computer}} controlled transmissions (particularly {{in the case of}} automatics), the gear stick no longer needs to be mechanically connected to the transmission unit itself, and can therefore be made much smaller since {{there is no need to}} package either remote mechanisms or complex interlocking arrangements. This has allowed designers to replace the gear stick completely with either <b>buttons,</b> <b>rotary</b> knobs (current Jaguar and Range Rover models are good examples of this), or a miniaturized gear stick on the centre console. This can be seen in the Toyota Prius and some Audis, BMWs and the Lincoln Continental. Japanese finger shift is another example. It is a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the Chrysler push button PowerFlite and the Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic.|$|R
50|$|A large, 8.8-inch {{monitor in}} the center of the {{dashboard}} displays all the information the driver needs, apart from the speedometer and tachometer, which are conventional analog instruments. The monitor is positioned within the driver's field of vision, allowing it to be viewed while focusing attention on the road ahead. Controls are operated with a single large, multifunction knob located between the front seats. The control (called the Intuitive Interaction Concept) consists of a combination <b>rotary</b> and push <b>button</b> for selecting functions. Confirmation of the selected mode is displayed on the dash mounted screen. Several hundred functions can be controlled with this device. The concept of operating the Z9, which BMW calls Intuitive Interaction Concept, allows the driver to easily activate functions while driving without the need to constantly examine and manipulate conventional controls. It was an early prototype of the series production iDrive, introduced in 2001 on the BMW 7 Series (E65).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we report}} on our {{exploration}} of 3 D representations to support temporal navigation. We ground {{our discussion in a}} user study on the design of a tool that helps airliner pilots to manage dangerous and tall thunderstorm cells. The tool enables pilots to visualize thunderstorm cells, navigate into meteorological predictions in the near future and evaluate safe paths. The visualization is provided on the dual 2 D horizontal/vertical view that is already used on the flight deck. In lieu of t he standard 2 D vertical view, the tool use s a 3 D view t hat facilitates tracking of cells sliding along time slots and altitudes. The user navigates along two dimensions, heading and time slots, thanks to a <b>rotary</b> knob - <b>button.</b> The design is grounded in field studies with pilots. Prototypes have been iteratively evaluated during design walkthrough sessions with pilots. From the preliminary results of this study, we draw research questions related to the need of 3 D in the cockpit navigation display...|$|R
