40|$|There the {{technique}} of kinematic analysis with determination of static definability of hinge has been developed. The design formulae to determine the clearances in the kinematic pairs have been obtained. The calculation procedure of relative displacements and speeds of hinge parts has been developed. The structural distinctions of roller hinges for number of inductrial rolling mills have been determined; the constructions of roller spindle joints have been developed on invention level. The production process of spindle members have been improved. The universal <b>roller</b> <b>spindles</b> of main lines of rolling mills have been introduced at the Joint-Stock Company "Severstal". The production forms and records have been developedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|The DLR Planetary <b>Roller</b> <b>Spindle</b> Drive (PRSD), a new linear {{actuator}} {{developed at the}} German Aerospace Center (DLR), transforms fast rotation into slow but powerful linear movement. As part of the RObot Technolgy Experiment (ROTEX) on bord of the Spacelab D 2 -Mission, the PRSD passed its nail-proof successfully. To optimize dynamical behaviour and performance of modified PRSD design versions, modelling and calculation methods have been developed, {{taking into account the}} very special requirements of this new design. To analyze the operating characteristics and performance figures, the PRSD was modelled as a multibody system (MBS). Accompanying photoelastic experiments ensured the accuracy of the modelling. Computation of a PRSD showed satisfying accordance with testbench measurements...|$|R

5000|$|Similar to {{the ring}} and ball mill, the {{vertical}} <b>spindle</b> <b>roller</b> mill uses large [...] "tires" [...] to crush the coal. These mills are usually found in utility plants.|$|R
50|$|Detachable reel {{magazines}} can {{be fitted}} (e.g. {{to enable the}} projection of nitrate film in accordance with safety regulations), or removed (e.g. to enable projection using an external film transport device such as a platter or tower, or to fit an external audio reader) as needed. Special fire trap rollers for nitrate were also available, to comply with fire regulations in some jurisdictions. Separate magnetic and analog optical audio heads are built into the mechanism itself, enabling all 5/70 magnetic and 4/35 optical formats to be projected without the need to adjust or replace any audio components. The change of gauge is done by swapping some gate components, pad <b>roller</b> assemblies, reel <b>spindles</b> and the lens, {{and in some cases}} making minor adjustments to the lamphouse. This procedure can be completed by a competent projectionist in 5-10 minutes, which is a major reason for the DP70's popularity with venues that show 4/35 and 5/70 prints interchangeably.|$|R
5000|$|At a high-level, the {{multimachine}} {{is built}} using vehicle engine blocks combined in a LEGO-like fashion. It utilizes the cylinder bores and engine deck to provide accurate surfaces. Since cylinder bores are bored exactly parallel {{to each other}} and at exact right angles to the cylinder head surface, multimachine accuracy begins at the factory where the engine block was built. In the most common version of the multimachine, one that has a <b>roller</b> bearing <b>spindle,</b> this precision is maintained during construction with simple cylinder re-boring of the #3 cylinder {{to the size of the}} roller bearing outside diameter (OD) and re-boring the #1 cylinder to fit the overarm OD. These cylinder-boring operations can be done in almost any engine shop and at low cost. An engine machine shop provides the most inexpensive and accurate machine work commonly done anywhere and guarantees that the spindle and overarm will be perfectly aligned and at an exact right angle to the face (head surface) of the main engine block that serves as the base of the machine. Use a piece of pipe made to fit the inner diameter of the bearings as the spindle. A three-bearing spindle is used because the [...] "main" [...] spindle bearings just [...] "float" [...] in the cylinder bore so that the third bearing is needed to [...] "locate" [...] the spindle, act as a thrust bearing, and support the heavy pulley. The multimachine uses a unique way of clamping the engine blocks together that is easily built, easily adjusted, and very accurate. The multimachine makes use of a concrete and steel construction technique that was heavily used in industry during the First World War and resurrected for this project.|$|R
5000|$|Advertisements, jingles, and the top-of-hour station {{identification}} {{required by law}} were often on [...] "carts". Short for cartridges, these were endless tapes similar to 4-track tapes, were mechanically identical as well, and were called Fidelipacs. The primary difference between carts and 4 track is two fold. The Cart had only two tracks and the 4-track (obviously) had four. The Cart ran at 7 and 1/2 IPS whereas the 4-Track ran at 3 and 3/4 IPS. Carts had a slot for a pinch <b>roller</b> on a <b>spindle</b> which was activated by solenoid upon pressing the start button on the cart machine. The capstan was spinning at full speed and this allowed for nearly instantaneous playback start without artifacts. Mechanical carousels would rotate the carts {{in and out of}} multiple tape players as dictated by the computer. Time announcements were provided by a pair of dedicated cart players, with the even minutes stored on one and the odd minutes on the other. This meant an announcement would always be ready to play, even if the minute was changing when the announcement was triggered. The system did require attention throughout the day to change reels as they ran out and reload carts. It became obsolete when a method was developed to automatically rewind and re-cue the reel tapes when they ran out, extending 'walk-away' time indefinitely.|$|R
