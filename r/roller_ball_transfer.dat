In {{order to}} lay raw {{materials}} foundation {{for increasing the}} performance of insulating brick with the low grade quartz sand along the Yangtze River, the effect of ball milling methods on the properties of quartz sand powder was researched via the ball milling method in this paper. The results show the mean grain size of quartz powders are 11. 25 µm via a <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling, the mean grain size of quartz powders are 7. 37 µm via a planetary ball milling, and the particle size distribution of quartz powders milled via a <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling is wider than that of quartz powders milled via a planetary ball milling. The ball milling strength of planetary ball milling is {{higher than that of}} <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling. The planetary ball milling use more electronic energy than the <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling in the same time. The output of powder using the <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling is more than that of powder using the planetary ball milling. when the raw materials of quartz building materials is low particle size remand, and the output is more, the <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling methods is suitable to prepare the raw materials of quartz building materials...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens with liquid-ink {{are more}} likely to [...] "bleed" [...] through the paper. Liquid ink is more readily absorbed into the paper due to its lower {{viscosity}}. This viscosity also causes problems when leaving the tip on the paper (to pause for a thought for example). The bleed-through effect is greatly increased as the ink is continually absorbed into the paper, creating a blotch. This does not affect gel-ink <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens as much. This is one way through which the thickness of gel-ink gives it an advantage, in that it isn't as prone to being absorbed. Though the bleed-through effect of a gel-ink <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> is greater than that of a ballpoint, it is usually not too significant.|$|R

50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens or rollerball pens are pens {{which use}} ball point writing {{mechanisms}} with water-based liquid or gelled ink, {{as opposed to}} the oil-based viscous inks found in ballpoint pens. These less viscous inks, which tend to saturate more deeply and more widely into paper than other types of ink, give <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens their distinctive writing qualities. The writing point is a tiny ball, usually 0.5 or 0.7 mm in diameter, that transfers the ink from the reservoir onto the paper as the pen moves.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{evaluated}} Novasure ablation as {{a mechanical}} endometrial preparation agent before <b>Roller</b> <b>Ball</b> endometrial ablation {{in lieu of}} GnRH agonists in large uteri. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 20 consecutive patients undergoing Novasure ablation for mechanical endometrial preparation before <b>Roller</b> <b>Ball</b> ablation (RBNovasure group) was conducted and the results {{compared to that of}} 23 consecutive patients who received GnRH agonist (Leuprolide acetate) as a medical endometrial preparation before <b>Roller</b> <b>Ball</b> ablation (RB-Lupron group). The postoperative follow-up time frame was divided into immediate (3 mo), intermediate (3 to 12 mo) and long-term (12 to 32 mo). Rates of amenorrhea, heavy bleeding, cramping, and failure (repeat ablation or hysterectomy for heavy bleeding or persistent pain) were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The mean rates of amenorrhea for the patients not lost to follow-up at 3 mo, 3 to 12 mo, and 12 to 32 mo visits were 45. 5 %, 58. 8 %, and 44. 4 % for the RB-Lupron group, and 80 %, 86. 7 %, and 100 % for the RB-Novasure group (P =. 02, P =. 08, and P =. 02). Failure rates were 4. 8 %, 6. 2 %, and 55. 6 % for the RB-Lupron group; and 0 (0 / 20), 12. 5 % (2 / 16) and 0 (0 / 8) for the RB-Novasure group (P =. 51, P =. 50, and P =. 02). The RB-Novasure group had a significantly lower rate of heavy bleeding and cramping. 86. 4 %, 58. 8 %, and 33. 3 % patients reported satisfaction with their treatment in the RB-Lupron group and 100 %, 87. 5 %, and 75 % in RB-Novasure group (P =. 13, P =. 07, and P =. 11). CONCLUSION: Novasure ablation, for mechanical endometrial preparation before <b>Roller</b> <b>Ball</b> ablation, appears to be a superior alternative to medical preparation with GnRH agonists in patients with large uteri...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To save land {{resources}} {{by the use}} of low-grade natural resources to realize a high cost performance product, the technology of prepared superfine quartz sand powder via the ball milling methods were investigated. The results are shown the mean particle size of quartz sand powder is gradually become small varied with prolonging the ball milling time. Before 60 minutes, the mean particle size is slashed, however, the range of varying mean particle size is less after 60 minutes under the ball milling rotate speed for 200 r/min and the charge amount for 200 g/L, so the ball milling time for 60 minutes is decided. The mean grain size of quartz powders are decreased vary with an increasing the ball milling rotate speed, and the rotate speed is lower, the distribution is wider, however, the rotate speed is higher, the distribution is narrower. The mean grain size of quartz powders are 11. 25 µm via a <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling, the mean grain size of quartz powders are 7. 37 µm via a planetary ball milling, and the particle size distribution of quartz powders milled via a <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling is wider than that of quartz powders milled via a planetary ball milling, which shows the of quartz powders milled via a <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> milling is not more uniform than that of quartz powders milled via a planetary ball milling, the asymmetry powder is advantage for forming the high performance building materials body...|$|R

It allowed to simulate the real working conditions of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> unit during the experiments. Entire test cycle was divided into three phases. Initially the units were subjected to impact loading with falling weight under increasing impact energy up to destruction of a body. The influence of steel body hardness on unit dynamic strength was estimated. Then samples of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> units were loaded with static forces applied to central ball. Maximum failure load was determined and real safety factors were calculated subject to body hardness. Also unit operability at maximum load was investigated. It was estimated by possibility of full twisting central ball in the unit body. Findings. Optimum regimes of hardening of the body and the actual ultimate load safety factor at the normal loading of the unit were defined. Originality. New results on structural strength of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> unit with steel punching body were obtained. ???????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ???? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???
