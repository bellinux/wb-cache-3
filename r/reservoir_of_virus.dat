50|$|Insecticides against aphids are not {{effective}} for controlling AMV. Recommendations are sowing healthy seed (some seed companies sell seed tested for AMV), managing weeds, avoiding growing crops adjacent to infected pasture and other cultural practices to minimize AMV. Work {{has been done}} on creating transgenic AMV resistant plants. For example, DNA derived from AMV encoding the gene for the capsid has been inserted into alfalfa plants. This reduced the susceptibility of the plants to infection by AMV and the plants would be less of a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> for spread to other plants.|$|E
50|$|When {{only part}} of a litter is {{infected}} transplacentally, {{as is often the}} case, one or more littermates are frequently infected by subsequent intrauterine spread of virus. The same would apply if initial infection were through contaminated semen. As a result, any combination or all of the sequelae indicated in Table 1 can develop in the same litter. Intrauterine dissemination is probably less common when early embryos are infected because they are quickly resorbed after death, effectively removing the intrauterine <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus.</b> In such cases there is no evidence at farrowing for the cause of fewer pigs per litter.|$|E

40|$|AbstractInfection of resting {{peripheral}} mononuclear {{blood cells}} (PBMCs) with HIV- 1 is not productive {{due to a}} block prior to integration of the provirus into the host genome. Here we show that a unique restriction {{is determined by the}} status of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Proviral integration increases after addition of a GR ligand. The ligand dependent effect is confined to an early time period after infection and requires GR and the GR binding viral protein Vpr. Endogenous GR and transiently expressed Vpr are localized in the cytoplasm in unstimulated PMCs and comigrate into the nucleus upon ligand addition. Thus, the predominant cytoplasmic localization of GR seems to be a specific obstacle for HIV replication. Accordingly, efficient proviral integration in a cell line with a constitutive cytoplasmic GR requires addition of a GR ligand. The data suggest that steroids can overcome the restriction on HIV provirus formation and thereby increase the <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> producing cells...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Male genital {{infection}} {{by human}} papillomavirus {{is of particular}} importance since it is often asymptomatic. The patient generally presents no clinical lesion. Therefore, men represent an important <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus,</b> playing a special role in the transmission and perpetuation of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present prospective clinical trial study, 190 sex partners of women with genital infection by human papillomavirus, associated or not with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, were investigated. All patients were unaware of or denied {{the presence of a}} genital lesion. RESULTS: Cytologic examination revealed koilocytosis in 9 cases (4. 7 %) in the urethra and in 3 cases (1. 6 %) in the corona of the glans and the distal prepuce. Peniscopy with the previous use of 5 % acetic acid revealed white lesions in 97. 9 % of the patients. Toluidine blue stained most of the lesions. At least one fragment revealed koilocytosis in the histopathologic study of 97 cases (51. 05 %).

40|$|An {{important}} question in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) pathogenesis is whether HIV-infected bone marrow CD 34 + stem/progenitor cells serve as a significant <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in HIV-infected individuals. Our data indicate that infection of bone marrow stem/progenitor cells with HIV occurs rarely, if ever, in vivo. In the present study, CD 34 + cells were immunomagnetically purified from the bone marrow of HIV-seropositive individuals, and purified cells or colony-forming cells of the granulocyte/macrophage lineage were analyzed for HIV proviral DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. No HIV DNA was detected in colony-forming cells of the granulocyte/macrophage lineage from HIV-positive patients. Furthermore, no virus was found in CD 34 (+) -enriched cells from six of seven samples from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals and four of four samples from patients with AIDS-related complex or AIDS. Thus, infected stem cells are not {{a major source of}} persistent HIV and do not account for hematopoietic suppression.

The outbreak of this novel disease, {{caused by a}} novel coronavirus (the SARS-coronavirus), hit hardest in the Asian Pacific region, though eventually it spread to five continents. The speed of the spread of the SARS epidemic was unprecedented due to the highly efficient intercontinental transportation. An international collaborative effort through the World Health Organization (WHO) has helped to identify the aetiological agent about 1 month after the onset of the epidemic.

Results in patients with HIV and lymphoma have now led to studies that will test these principles in HIV patients without concomitant malignancy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Avian {{influenza}} (AI) viruses are Type A influenza viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family. There are 15 subtypes of {{the virus}} widespread in migratory waterfowl throughout the world. It has become increasingly evident that some low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H 5 or H 7 viruses {{have the capacity to}} mutate into the more virulent strains that cause extensive economic losses and high mortality. Recent AI disease outbreaks in several countries have increased attention and concern over low pathogenic H 5 and H 7 AI viruses. This heightened international concern increases the risk of unnecessary trade bans. For the US poultry industry, avian influenza continues to be a challenge to the flow of trade. On one hand, there is the increased focus of world attention on the H 5 and H 7 low pathogenic AI virus and the possibility of mutation. On the other hand, there are the factors contributing to our finding of infected flocks. Among these, perhaps the most important is the ever-present <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the migratory waterfowl population.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the persistence of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in the environment. Virus was impregnated onto two carrier materials (cotton tape and bovine liver) and exposed to environmental conditions on pasture during autumn in New Zealand. Samples were collected after 1, 10, 44 and 91 days and the viability of the virus was determined by oral inoculation of susceptible 11 - to 14 -week-old New Zealand White rabbits. Evidence of RHDV infection was based on clinical and pathological signs and/or seroconversion to RHDV. Virus impregnated on cotton tape was viable at 10 days of exposure but not at 44 days, while in bovine liver it was still viable at 91 days. The {{results of this study suggest}} that RHDV in animal tissues such as rabbit carcasses can survive for at least 3 months in the field, while virus exposed directly to environmental conditions, such as dried excreted virus, is viable for a period of less than 1 month. Survival of RHDV in the tissues of dead animals could, therefore, provide a persistent <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus,</b> which could initiate new outbreaks of disease after extended delays...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) to replicate in primary blood dendritic cells was investigated. Dendritic cells compose less than 1 % of the circulating leukocytes and are nondividing cells. Highly purified preparations of dendritic cells were obtained using recent advances in cell fractionation. The results of these experiments show that dendritic cells, in contrast to monocytes and T cells, support the active replication of all strains of HIV- 1 tested, including T-cell tropic and monocyte/macrophage tropic isolates. The dendritic cell cultures supported much more virus production than did cultures of primary unseparated T cells, CD 4 + T cells, and adherent as well as nonadherent monocytes. Replication of HIV- 1 in dendritic cells produces no noticeable cytopathic effect nor does it decrease total cell number. The {{ability of the}} nonreplicating dendritic cells to support high levels of replication of HIV- 1 suggests that this antigen-presenting cell population, which is also capable of supporting clonal T-cell growth, may {{play a central role}} in HIV pathogenesis, serving as a source of continued infection of CD 4 + T cells and as a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> infection...|$|E

Nonetheless, high levels of viral RNA production continue unabated for an additional 2 – 5 months. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that tissue macrophage in the lymph nodes, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney sustain high plasma virus loads {{in the absence of}} CD 4 + T cells. Quantitative confocal immunofluorescence analysis indicated that greater than 95 % of the virus-producing cells in these tissues are macrophage and less than 2 % are T lymphocytes. Interestingly, the administration of a potent reverse transcriptase inhibitor blocked virus production during the early T cell phase but not during the later macrophage phase of the SHIVDH 12 R infection. When interpreted in the context of HIV- 1 infections, these results implicate tissue macrophage as an important <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in vivo.

Here, we analyzed the epidemiology of prolonged and chronic immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived poliovirus cases in a registry maintained by the World Health Organization, to identify risk factors and determine the length of excretion. Between 1962 and 2016, there were 101 cases, with 94 / 101 (93 %) prolonged excretors and 7 / 101 (7 %) chronic excretors. We documented an increase in incidence in recent decades, with a shift toward middle-income countries, and a predominance of poliovirus type 2 in 73 / 101 (72 %) cases. The median length of excretion was 1. 3 [*]years (95 % confidence interval: 1. 0, 1. 4) and 90 % of individuals stopped excreting after 3. 7 [*]years. Common variable immunodeficiency syndrome and residence in high-income countries were risk factors for long-term excretion. The changing epidemiology of cases, manifested by the greater incidence in recent decades and a shift to from high- to middle-income countries, highlights the expanding risk of poliovirus transmission after oral poliovirus vaccine cessation.

Microvascular and macrovascular EC exhibit different biochemical and functional properties depending on the organ of origin. Phenotypic differences between microvascular and macrovascular EC may alter the ability of these cells to support HCMV replication. In this study, we compared the replication of HCMV in primary macrovascular aortic EC (AEC) with that in brain microvascular EC (BMVEC). An examination of IE 72, pp 65, and gB viral antigen expression in BMVEC and AEC by immunoflourescence revealed similar frequencies of infected cells. Intracellular production of virus was 3 log units greater in BMVEC than in AEC, while equal quantities of extracellular virus were produced in both cell types. HCMV infection of BMVEC resulted in rapid cellular lysis, while the virus was nonlytic and continuously released from HCMV-infected AEC for {{the life span of}} the culture. An examination of infected cells by electron microscopy revealed the formation of abundant nucleocapsids in both AEC and BMVEC.
