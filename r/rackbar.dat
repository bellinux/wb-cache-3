40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the different trashrack designs and their impact on fluid flow losses. Three different <b>rackbar</b> profiles were examined which cause different flow losses. A simple low-cost rectangle profile was used as a base-case and compared with two alternative aerodynamically-shaped profiles, which made the trashrack much more expensive. The river’s flow from 200 m upstream of the hydropower plant to the turbine inlet was simulated by 3 D CFD simulations using an ANSYS CFX 12 solver. The aim of the simulations was to predict the exact velocity field ahead of the trashrack. The local head-losses caused by the trashrack were then calculated using an empirical formula at each point of the velocity field, and finally integrated to obtain the gross head-loss caused by the specific trashrack design. Annual losses during electricity production were then predicted using experimentally-obtained river flow-rate data and the net profit then calculated, which served for the final study of the alternative trashrack design’s economics. The study showed that a profit from the alternative trashrack design could be expected after a period of 10 years, which may be of the interest when replacing an old or damaged trashrack with a new one...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 A failure {{analysis}} investigation was completed on the trashracks at Powerhouse One of Rock Island Dam. The investigation {{was part of}} the overall condition assessment and rehabilitation work being performed at the dam. The trashracks were deemed a faulty system in 2005 when MWH, a contractor for Chelan County PUD, initially inspected the racks. Building on the original work completed by MWH, this project compiled background information and conducted field inspections to evaluate the future reliability of the trashracks. The field inspections identified consistent failures of the diagonal tie rods, discovered cracks in the <b>rackbar</b> welds, and highlighted the noticeable presence of corrosion damage. Though localized failures were identified, a static analysis concluded that the overall structural design was adequate for continued operations. Field tests and a finite element model were compared in a dynamic analysis to ensure the vibration induced stresses did not reach the allowable limit. Ultimately, the trashracks received new diagonal braces constructed from angle iron to replace the failing tie rods. Damaged welds, caused by the propagation of cracks from welding defects, were repaired and the racks were sandblasted to remove corrosion debris and repainted to prevent future degradation...|$|E
