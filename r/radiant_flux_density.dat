To analyze the physical processes, which are characteristic of shading in terms of urban human-biometeorology, experimental investigations on the thermal effects of shading by a building and shading by tree canopies were conducted in Freiburg (Southwest Germany) during typical Central European summer weather.

The measuring setup consists of specific human-biometeorological stations, which enable the direct or indirect determination of Ta, Tmrt, and PET.

After the ground surface was covered with sandy sediments produced by the mechanical control of sand in the QinghaiâTibet Railway, the reflectivity increased, and the annual average reflectivity on the surface covered with sandy sediments was higher than that without sandy sediments, with the value increasing by 0. 043. Moreover, the surface shortwave radiation increased, whereas the surface net radiation decreased. The annual average value of the surface shortwave <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> on the sandy sediments was higher than that without sandy sediments, with the value increasing by 7. 291 Â WÂ·mâ 2.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the role of}} short- and long-wave radiant flux densities from different directions in complex urban settings for human thermal comfort on clear-sky summer days. The aims of the investigation are to quantify {{the importance of the}} sky view factor as an urban design-dependent variable for the 3 -D radiant flux densities absorbed by the standardized human-biometeorological reference person and to analyze the varying impact of the absorbed 3 -D short- and long-wave radiant flux densities on the mean radiant temperature (TmrtT_mrt), near-surface air temperature (TaT_a) and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). The results obtained by measuring campaigns and numerical simulations point to the different importance of the absorbed 3 -D radiant flux densities for human thermal comfort characterized by TaT_a, TmrtT_mrt and PET. The magnitude of TmrtT_mrt is mainly determined by the total of the absorbed 3 -D long-wave radiant flux densities. However, the fluctuations of TmrtT_mrt are mainly governed by the total of the absorbed 3 -D short-wave radiant flux densities. Their variance can be well explained by the variance of the sky view factor related to {{the southern part of the}} upper half space. Taking account of the different impact of the 3 -D radiant flux densities, TmrtT_mrt can be quite well estimated by a multiple regression using the total of the absorbed 3 -D short-wave radiant flux densities and the absorbed long-wave <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> from the lower half space as independent variables. PET can be well estimated by a multiple regression showing TmrtT_mrt and TaT_a as independent variables. On a hot summer day, the increase of the albedo of vertical building walls within a simple E-W oriented street canyon leads to a decrease of the surface temperature of the S-facing wall, but to an increase of TmrtT_mrt and PET at the S-facing sidewalk...|$|E

However, their fire resistant characteristics depend on the environmental conditions and require study. Particularly important is the response of these fabrics to varied environments and radiant heat from a source such as an adjacent fire. In this work, experiments were conducted to study the effect of oxygen concentration, external <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> and oxidizer flow velocity on the concurrent flame spread over two FR fabrics: Nomex HT 90 - 40 and a Nomex/Nylon/Cotton fabric blend. Results show that for a given fabric the minimum oxygen concentration for concurrent flame spread depends strongly on {{the magnitude of the}} external <b>radiant</b> <b>flux.</b> At increased oxygen concentrations the external <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> required for flame spread decreases. Oxidizer flow velocity influences the external <b>radiant</b> <b>flux</b> only when the convective heat flux from the flame has similar values to the external <b>radiant</b> <b>flux.</b> The results of this work provide further understanding of the flammability characteristics of fire resistant fabrics in environments similar to those of future spacecrafts...|$|R
