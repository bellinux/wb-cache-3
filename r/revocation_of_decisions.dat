The chief judge is {{positioned}} inside the ring, whereas the sub referees {{are located on}} the outside of the ring, one to the right and others to the left. If an unfair judgment is called or the chief referee is unable to render a decision, the sub referees can request a <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> or a rematch.

50|$|In its trial {{decision}} the Patent Office (Trial <b>Decision</b> No. 20103 <b>of</b> 1996) {{ruled that}} if a demand for a trial for invalidation is submitted within an exclusion period and the particular statutory provisions providing the grounds for invalidation are specified in the demand, and if within the period ordered for an amendment the demand is supplemented with a detailed account and evidence, even if the date on which these amendments are submitted falls after the lapse of the exclusion period, the amendment of the demand for a trial for invalidation ought to be allowed. The Patent Office held that since the demand for the trial decision {{in this case was}} made within the exclusion period, it should not be dismissed on procedural grounds. On that basis the JPO ruled on the substance of the claim, and it issued a <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> invalidation on the grounds that X's Trademark was in breach of Article 4(1)(xv). In response X brought court proceedings for the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> this <b>decision.</b>|$|R
