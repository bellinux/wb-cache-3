40|$|Most efforts {{devoted to}} {{modification}} of the combustion process to reduce NOx formation in fossil fuel fired boilers and furnaces involve the use of air or fuel staging. Low NOx burners utilize aerodynamic staging through the burner design to separate {{the majority of the}} combustion air from the fuel within the primary combustion zone to create a locally fuel rich <b>reducing</b> <b>zone.</b> Overfire air (OFA) employs furnace level air staging to create a high temperature fuel-rich <b>reducing</b> <b>zone.</b> Both strategies are used heavily in state-of-the art low-NOx coal-firing systems to achieve cost-effective NOx reductions and the majority of coal-fired utility boilers are presently equipped with combustion modifications of this type. In particular, since 1996, the majority of existing cyclone-fired boilers have been retrofit with OFA systems which have been demonstrated to reduce full load NOx emissions from 1 - 2 lb/MBtu down to emissions as low as 0. 2 – 0. 3 lb/MBtu. The lowest NOx emissions have been attained in units with good air flow measurement and controls to accommodate deep levels of staging (e. g. 0. 8 - 0. 9 barrel stoichiometric ratio) without compromising unit operability. However, even with significant levels of furnace staging, well-controlled and designed OFA systems are not expected to lead to full load NOx emissions below a 0. 15 lb/MBtu limit in most cyclone fired units, regardless of coal type. Rich Reagent Injection (RRI), co-developed by EPRI and REI, provides a strategy that works synergistically with air staging to yield significant additional NO...|$|E

This study examines geochemical data {{relevant to the}} distribution of redox impacts on processes associated with the potential transport of redox-sensitive radionuclides from the proposed conditions in the saturated zone, the relationships between redox state and solubility and sorption coefficients for technetium and neptunium, and sensitivity in transport model simulations. Results indicate evidence for a zone of reducing conditions in the volcanic rocks of the saturated zone located {{to the east and}} south of the repository and along the inferred flow paths from the repository. A working hypothesis is that these reducing conditions are related to the presence of minor pyrite in the matrix of some volcanic units. Chemical equilibrium modeling of technetium solubility using EQ 3 / 6 software codes is used to estimate the value of solubility limits as a function of Eh. Surface complexation modeling with the EQ 3 code is used to estimate neptunium sorption coefficient values as a function of Eh. A general analytical approach, one-dimensional reactive transport modeling, and the three-dimensional saturated zone site-scale transport model using the FEHM software code are used to evaluate the impacts of solubility limits and enhanced sorption in reducing zones on the simulated transport of technetium and neptunium in the saturated zone. Results show that if precipitation occurs in response to flow through a <b>reducing</b> <b>zone,</b> then the peak concentration released to the accessible environment will be restricted to the solubility limit. Simulations also show that enhanced sorption within a <b>reducing</b> <b>zone</b> of modest width leads to significantly greater retardation of radionuclides in the saturated zone...|$|E

40|$|While biologically {{mediated}} reductive dechlorination {{continues to}} be a significant focus of chlorinated solvent remediation, there has been an increased interest in abiotic reductive processes for the remediation of chlorinated solvents. In situ chemical reduction (ISCR) uses zero-valent iron (ZVI) –based technologies, such as nanoscale iron and bimetallic ZVI, as well as naturally occurring reduced minerals incorporating dual-valent iron (DVI), such as magnetite, green rust, and iron sulfides that are capable of dechlorinating solvents. A more recent area of development in ISCR has been in combining biological and abiotic processes. There are several ways in which biological and abiotic processes can be combined. First, the interaction between the two may be “causative. ” For example, the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment’s biogeochemical reductive dechlorination (BiRD) technology combines a mulch barrier with hematite and gypsum to create an iron-sulfide-based <b>reducing</b> <b>zone.</b> Biodegradation under sulfate-reducing conditions produces sulfide that combines with the hematite to form iron sulfides.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1993. Microfiche. xiii, 201 leaves, bound 29 cmNet {{ecosystem}} {{production of}} organic and inorganic phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon {{in the upper}} Gulf of Thailand was estimated by mass transport models. Human activities within 50 km from the coast supply about 50 % of the P and 40 % of the N requirements of the bay. Up to 40 % of the total N input may be derived from N 2 fixation by dense population of planktonic cyanobacteria Trichodesmium observed near the bay head. The upper Gulf of Thailand is a net consumer of DIP but a net producer of CO 2, This opposite trend occurs because the bay consumes high C:P (≈ 400 : 1) terrestrial organic material while producing low C:P (≈ 100 : 1) planktonic organic matter. Organic diagenesis in the upper Gulf of Thailand sediments was studied using an electron balance approach. Generally, O 2 reduction alone can explain benthic respiration {{in most parts of}} the Gulf of Thailand except at stations located less than 15 km from river mouths where organic matter input is high. At these locations, SO 4 ^ 2 - reduction is required to balance the budgets. Sediment denitrification is a minor reaction in terms of organic carbon respiration but can be an important N sink. Net denitrification in sediments near river mouths may be limited by the nitrification step which is subsequently limited by O 2 uptake across the sediment-water interface. In other parts of the bay, denitrification is limited by low sediment organic content. The same model is also applied to Tomales Bay (California) sediments where oxidant limitation is more severe. On average, Tomales Bay sediments require about 18 meq m^- 2 d^- 1 of oxidants, in addition to O 2, NO 3 ̄ and SO 4 ^ 2 -, in order to balance the electrons generated by organic carbon oxidation. This electron imbalance is explained by minor reduction reactions and groundwater nutrient input to the bay. Respiratory CO 2 regenerated in the Gulf of Thailand sediments reacts with CaCO 3. In oxic sediments, the coupling between organic carbon respiration and CaCO 3 dissolution is near 1 : 1. In the SO 4 ^ 2 - <b>reducing</b> <b>zone,</b> the coupling is about 0. 4 : 1 (assuming FeS formation).

Nitrate in the Willamette Valley is attenuated across the Willamette Silt, a semi-confining unit overlying a regionally important aquifer. To quantify the main mechanism responsible for nitrate attenuation, soil cores were taken at 19 locations, and profiles of nitrate concentrations were constructed for each site. In 7 locations a sharp, major geochemical transition - a "redoxcline" - is present near {{the base of the}} Willamette Silt; this redoxcline is characterized by a color change from red-brown to blue-gray, an increase in iron(II) concentration, a rise in pH, and the appearance of carbonate minerals.

Strong reflections of this kind are generally attributed to shallow and localized gas accumulations. We, however, observed that the reflection polarity of these strong reflections was positive, suggesting {{that they do not}} correspond to reflections from the upper boundary of a possible gas front. In this study, we evaluate these reflections to determine if they represent hydrogen sulphide-rich shallow gas hydrate layers, which would be an unusual gas hydrate occurrence in a shallow marine environment. The existence of gas hydrate formations in thermobaric conditions, as in our study area (shallower water depths and relatively higher temperatures), depends completely on the gas composition in the hydrate structure; it is possible for gas hydrates to be stable only if they are formed by a certain amount of hydrogen sulfide together with methane. We closely examined the hydrogen sulphide potential of the area and found that the maximum total hydrogen sulfide concentration in the surficial sediments in the area was, at 5550 ppm, enough to produce hydrogen sulphide-rich gas hydrates. Using geoacoustic and geochemical data, we propose a conceptual model for the formation of shallow hydrogen sulfide-rich gas hydrates. According to this model, conjectural gas hydrate layers in the area should be formed along the boundary between a sulphate-reducing zone and an underlying carbonate <b>reducing</b> <b>zone,</b> where methane comes into contact with hydrogen sulphide.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model for predicting sulphur distribution ratio LS between CaO-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 Al 2 O 3 -P 2 O 5 slags and liquid iron, i. e. the ion and molecule coexistence theory (IMCT) -L-S model, {{has been developed}} for slags in a large variation range of slag oxidisation ability based on the IMCT. The developed IMCT-LS model has been verified with measured data of oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur distribution equilibria berween the slags and liquid irpn from the literature. The {{results indicate that the}} desulphurisation reaction is mainly controlled by reaction (CaO) + [S] = (CaS) + [O] in the <b>reducing</b> <b>zone</b> with the optimised standard molar Gibbs free energy change of Delta(r) G(m,cas) (Theta) = 147023. 63 - 227. 94 T (J mol(- 1)); the desulphurisation reaction is dominated by reaction (FeO) + [S] = (FeS) + [O] in the oxidising zone with the reported standard molar Gibbs free energy change of Delta(r) G(m,Fas) (Theta) = 115526 - 33. 35 T (J mol(- 1)). The influence of CaO on the desulphurisation ability of the slags can be counteracted by that of FeO because higher CaO content corresponds to lower FeO content in the slags. An asymmetric V type relationship between sulphur distribution ratio L-S and the mass action concentration ratio N-Fe 2 O 3 /NCaO or N-Fe 2 O 3. Fe 2 O 3 /NCaO or N-FeO/N-CaO, or the mass percentage ratio (% FeO) /(% CaO) or (% Fe 2 O 3) /(% CaO) or (% FeO) /(% CaO) or the simplified complex basicity (% CaO) /[(% Al 2 O 3) + (% P 2 O 5) ] or optical basicity can be established for the slags equilibrated with liquid iron in a temperature range from 1811 to 1927 K (1538 to 16548 degrees C). The abovementioned mass action concentration ratios or mass percentage ratios of various iron oxides to basic oxide CaO can be recommended to represent the comprehensive effect of iron oxides Fe-O and basic oxide CaO on desulphurisation ability of the slags...|$|E
40|$|Redox {{conditions}} and associated changes in mobility of uranium (U) are tightly {{linked to a}} multitude of challenges connected with U mining in sandstone-hosted deposits and new methods that directly measure reduction or oxidation of U can inform on these questions. A novel proxy for understanding U redox chemistry has recently emerged, the volume dependent isotopic fractionation of uranium- 238 (²³⁸U) from uranium- 235 (²³⁵U). Novel measurements of ²³⁸U/²³⁵U isotopic ratio are combined with measurements of the more commonly utilized uranium- 234 /uranium- 238 activity [(²³⁴U/²³⁸U) ] ratio, as both isotopic ratios can be measured simultaneously. However, application of both U isotopic ratios in the contexts of exploration and environmental remediation of U ores requires characterization of these isotopic ratios {{across a variety of}} redox settings. Here, ²³⁸U/²³⁵U and (²³⁴U/²³⁸U) ratios are examined from eight transects in two U ore bodies (the Rosita and Kingsville Dome deposits) in South Texas; these sites are classic roll front deposits and exhibit a wide variety of both natural and altered redox conditions. Across all transects it is observed that (²³⁴U/²³⁸U) ratios decrease systematically towards the ore body from both the oxidizing and reducing sides, irrespective of whether the site has been mined or not. This pattern reflects geologically recent and significant U leaching and mobility and is characteristic of active roll fronts. Overall δ²³⁸U values in these transects decrease systematically towards the <b>reducing</b> <b>zone.</b> A simple Rayleigh fractionation model, where U ore is deposited from an increasingly isotopically depleted reservoir of dissolved U best explains the overall trend; very negative δ²³⁸U values likely reflect multiple cycles of U deposition and dissolution. The South Texas data set indicates that both (²³⁴U/²³⁸U) ratios and δ²³⁸U values can be variable at an individual mine site. However, overall low (²³⁴U/²³⁸U) ratios and negative δ²³⁸U values are characteristic of active roll front deposits. The comprehensive U isotopic composition of both ores and well waters represents a powerful new tool in prospecting of sandstone-hosted U ore and in environmental remediation following extraction of U ore...|$|E
40|$|Nitrate and arsenic {{frequently}} co-exist {{in natural}} water sources. While conventional drinking water treatment technologies fail to provide simultaneous removal of these contaminants, advanced technologies, such as reverse osmosis and ion exchange often are cost prohibitive. Furthermore, prevailing arsenic removal technologies are not sustainable as the arsenic-laden sludge releases arsenic under landfill conditions. It is therefore imperative {{to develop a}} treatment system that simultaneously removes these contaminants with minimum waste production. Utilizing microorganisms originating from natural groundwater, a train of two fixed-bed biologically active carbon (BAC) reactors removed 50 mg/L NO 3 - and 300 µg/L As to below the detection limit of 0. 2 mg/L NO 3 - and less than 10 µg/L As, respectively, at a total empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 30 min. Dissolved oxygen, nitrate, arsenate, and sulfate were utilized sequentially along the flow direction. Arsenic was removed by co-precipitation and adsorption on biologically generated iron sulfides (mackinawite) or precipitation of arsenic sulfides. While sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) closely related to complete oxidizers from the Desulfobacteraceae family dominated the system, three distinct clusters of dissimilatory arsenate reducing bacteria (DARB) were detected with a predominance of Geobacter uraniireducens-like DARB. After complete denitrification in {{the upper part of}} reactor A, sulfate and arsenate reducing activity co-existed and increased along the flow direction. After attaining a maximum level {{in the middle of the}} second reactor, both sulfate- and arsenate- reducing activity declined. The microbial community responded to changes in operational parameters and lowering the EBCT of reactor A resulted in a shift of sulfate <b>reducing</b> <b>zone</b> towards the second reactor. The co-location of sulfate- and arsenate reduction, iron(II) availability, and the generation of fresh iron sulfides were the key parameters for sustained arsenic removal. Lowering the phosphorus level in the influent from 0. 5 to 0. 2 and to 0. 1 mg/L P resulted in improved arsenic removal. Reactor performance was unaffected when air replaced nitrogen gas during backwashing of the first reactor. Overall, this research demonstrated the effectiveness of anaerobic bioreactors for the simultaneous removal of nitrate and arsenic and emphasized the need for the integration of molecular studies in understanding reactor performance...|$|E

40|$|Polyacrylic acid can be grafted onto {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) {{once the}} latter has been reduced locally by an electrode. Two reduction treatments are performed either by direct contact of an electrode or by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) leading to disc shaped <b>reduced</b> <b>zones</b> of, respectively, similar to 1 mm and similar to 100 mum diameter. Deactivation of <b>reduced</b> PTFE <b>zones</b> by air or oxidant exposure yields unsaturations on the polymeric surface that are prone to graft copolymerization. The grafted polymer, polyacrylic acid, is a cation exchanger that can complex to a fluorescent and reducible cation such as toluidine blue. Desorption of the cation from the polymeric film is characterized using UV-visible, fluorescence spectroscopies and also SECM. The latter technique is used to study the desorption kinetics, which is interpreted by a model {{taking into account the}} slow diffusion of the cation inside the membrane. The mean thickness of the film, which is initially similar to 100 mn is about the same after one year of air exposure, which emphasizes the stability of the film with time. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
