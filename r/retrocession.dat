Japanese forces in Southeast Asia surrendered on September 2, 1945, in Penang, September 10 in Labuan, September 11 in Kingdom of Sarawak and September 12 in Singapore. Taiwan's <b>Retrocession</b> Day (October 25), marked the end of Japanese rule of Taiwan and the subsequent rule by the Republic Of China government. It was not until 1947 that all prisoners held by America and Britain were repatriated. As late as April 1949, China still held more than 60,000 Japanese prisoners.

40|$|Reinsurance is a {{mechanism}} {{the insurance industry}} uses to spread the risk it assumes from policyholders. Through reinsurance, the industry's losses are absorbed and distributed {{among a group of}} companies so that no single company is overburdened with the financial responsibility of offering coverage to its policyholders. Catastrophes, unexpected liabilities, and a series of large losses that might be too great for an individual insurer to absorb can be handled through reinsurance. Without it, most insurers would be able to cover only the safest of ventures, leaving many risky but worthwhile ventures without coverage. The authors present a primer of reinsurance concepts, explaining such terms as ceding company, primary carrier, direct underwriter, cession, <b>retrocessions,</b> ceding commission, and surplus relief reinsurance. There are separate sections on: 1) The purposes of reinsurance (for example, underwriting capacity, earnings stability, reserve requirement reduction, and mechanism for existing business), 2) Methods of cession for reinsurance contracts (treaty, facultative, and automatic facultative), 3) Types of reinsurance contracts (proportional, nonproportional, hybrid, and <b>retrocessions),</b> 4) Prices and usage of reinsurance contracts, 5) The economics of risk transfer, 6) The characteristics of reinsurance risk, 7) The reinsurance market and 8) Reinsurance regulation.

5|$|Upon the war's end, Mihail Kogălniceanu and Ion Brătianu {{headed the}} Romanian {{delegation}} to the Congress of Berlin. In this capacity, they protested Russia's offer to exchange the previously Ottoman-ruled Northern Dobruja for Budjak, a portion of southern Bessarabia that Romania had received under the 1856 Treaty of Paris. This came after months of tension between Romania and Russia, generated over the territorial issue and the Russian claim to be representing Romania at Berlin: Kogălniceanu's envoy (Eraclie Arion) had even threatened the Russians with a Romanian denunciation of their alliance, and 60,000 Romanian soldiers were prepared for Budjak's defense. The Conference's ultimate decision (Berlin Treaty) {{was in favor of}} Russia's proposal, largely due to support from Andrássy and William Henry Waddington, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. Additional pressures came from Bismarck. The Russians themselves did register some setbacks {{by the end of the}} Conference. Their demands for Romania to allow indefinite military transit through Northern Dobruja were made ineffectual by the opposition of other European states, and Kogălniceanu was able to obtain the <b>retrocession</b> of Snake Island.|$|E
25|$|Largely as {{a result}} of the {{economic}} neglect by Congress, divisions over slavery, and the lack of voting rights for the residents of the District, a movement grew to return Alexandria to Virginia from the District of Columbia. From 1840 to 1846, Alexandrians petitioned Congress and the Virginia legislature to approve this transfer known as <b>retrocession.</b> On February 3, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly agreed to accept the <b>retrocession</b> of Alexandria if Congress approved. Following additional lobbying by Alexandrians, Congress passed legislation on July 9, 1846, to return all the District's territory south of the Potomac River back to Virginia, pursuant to a referendum; President James K. Polk signed the legislation the next day. A referendum on <b>retrocession</b> was held on September 1–2, 1846. The residents of the City of Alexandria voted in favor of the <b>retrocession,</b> 734 to 116; however, the residents of Alexandria County voted against <b>retrocession</b> 106 to 29. Despite the objections of those living in Alexandria County, President Polk certified the referendum and issued a proclamation of transfer on September 7, 1846. However, the Virginia legislature did not immediately accept the <b>retrocession</b> offer. Virginia legislators were concerned that the people of Alexandria County had not been properly included in the <b>retrocession</b> proceedings. After months of debate, the Virginia General Assembly voted to formally accept the <b>retrocession</b> legislation on March 13, 1847. In 1852, the Virginia legislature voted to incorporate a portion of Alexandria County to make the City of Alexandria, which until then had been only been considered politically as a town.|$|E

25|$|The electoral {{campaign}} ran between 3 October and 1 November and was overshadowed by several corruption scandals (Microsoftgate, EADS, illegal <b>retrocessions)</b> involving key figures of PSD, {{but also the}} candidate Elena Udrea. Outgoing President Traian Băsescu accused Victor Ponta of being an undercover spy, incompatible under the Romanian legislation with a public position, while Klaus Iohannis faced accusations of incompatibility filed by the National Integrity Agency after September 2013. Following very long voting times and {{large numbers of people}} who couldn't vote before the closing of polls in diaspora, large protests were staged in multiple cities across Romania and at Romanian embassies before the second round. This was regarded as both incapacity and unwillingness of Ponta's government to organize fair elections, and led to a surprisingly large turnout of over 64% (largest since 1996), and a surprise win for Iohannis in the second round.|$|R
40|$|A captive is an {{insurance}} or reinsurance company established by a parent group to finance its own risks. Captives mix internal risk pooling between the business {{units of the}} parent group and risk transfer toward the reinsurance market. We analyze captives from an optimal insurance contract perspective. The paper considers the vertical contractual chain that links firstly business units to insurance captives or to "fronters" through insurance contracts, secondly fronters to reinsurance captives through the cession of risks and thirdly insurance or reinsurance captives to reinsurers through cessions or <b>retrocessions.</b> In particular, the risk cession by fronters to a reinsurance captive trades o¤ the benefits derived from recouped premiums and from the risk sharing advantage of an "umbrella reinsurance policy", against the risks that result from the captive liabilities. The optimal captive scheme depends {{on the price of}} coverage in insurance and reinsurance markets and on the parent group's corporate capital. Since these variables fluctuate across time, the analysis developed in this paper corroborates the intertemporal variability of captives activity. self-insurance, captive, reinsurance, risk management...|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} reuniting the District of Columbia {{with the state}} of Maryland is {{referred}} to as <b>retrocession.</b> The District was originally formed out of parts of both Maryland and Virginia which they had ceded to the Congress. However, Virginia's portion was returned to that state in 1846; all the land in present-day D.C. was once part of Maryland. If both the Congress and the Maryland state legislature agreed, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland, possibly excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the United States Capitol, the White House and the Supreme Court building. If the District were returned to Maryland, citizens in D.C. would gain voting representation in the Congress as residents of Maryland. One problem with any of these proposals, according to one Virginia Republican in a 1999 interview, is that the state of Maryland does not currently want to take the District back. Further, although the U.S. Constitution does not specify a minimum size for the District, <b>retrocession</b> may require a constitutional amendment, as the District's role as the seat of government is mandated by the Constitution's District Clause. <b>Retrocession</b> could also alter the idea of a separate national capital as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. It may also violate the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution's granting of votes in the electoral college, as they would still be constitutionally granted to the district.|$|E

40|$|Motivation. The {{paper will}} {{address the issue of}} {{estimating}} the uncertainty in the run off of individual large claims in insurance portfolios, which is often the primary source of uncertainty in the reserving risk component of insurance risk. Method. The paper begins by reviewing current methodologies for estimating the uncertainty in loss reserves. Methods until now have focused on aggregate modeling of gross or net of reinsurance loss reserves, and no direct connection between the distribution of gross and net reserves. The paper develops a non-parametric framework to simulate the distribution of ultimate position of large claims, both reported and large IBNR claims. The method samples the development of individual claims based on the historic development of large claims, incorporating information at an aggregate level surrounding reserving strength. The model also predicts when claims will setde, and the dining of claim payments. Results. The method developed is not intended to replace existing aggregate modeling, but is an improvement to traditional methods which estimate the variability of gross of reinsurance loss reserves, and is a useful tool to allow for reinsurance recoveries more accurately. By indix 4 dually projecting the ultimate position of large claims, we can explicidy allow for policy or contract limits. Further, we can apply any reinsurance program structure to the gross results, including allowance for aggregate deductibles, incomplete placements, <b>retrocessions</b> to captive reinsurers, indexation clauses, and different treat 3, attachment rules (ie Losses Occurring During vs Risks Attaching). The paper then shows how the variability of attritional claims can be estimated using traditional stochastic methods, and the attritional and large results can be combined to estimate the variability of the aggregate portfolio of loss reserves...|$|R

Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the League of Nations. The League decided that Finland should retain sovereignty over the Åland Islands, but they should be made an autonomous province. Thus Finland was under an obligation to ensure the residents of the Åland Islands a right to maintain the Swedish language, as well as their own culture and local traditions. At the same time, an international treaty was concluded on the neutral status of Åland, under which it was prohibited to place military headquarters or forces on the islands.|$|E

The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 formally established Congressional jurisdiction over the new District. The Virginia <b>retrocession</b> of 1846-1847 returned that portion of the District of Columbia on the Virginia site of the Potomac River to the state of Virginia. This left in doubt the exact position of the District's border with Virginia (just as Maryland's southern border remained in doubt).|$|E
25|$|Formosa and the Penghu islands {{were put}} under the {{administrative}} {{control of the}} Republic of China (ROC) government in 1945 by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

However, due to the unresolved Chinese Civil War, neither the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco, as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally binding agreement. Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, {{ownership}} of the newly created land became an issue in a lawsuit. The boundary of the District of Columbia had been set by the Black-Jenkins Award, a decision by an arbitration panel in 1874 which resolved centuries of dispute by placing Virginia's boundary with Maryland at the low-water mark on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. The Virginia <b>retrocession</b> of 1846-1847 returned {{a portion of the}} District of Columbia on the Virginia site of the Potomac River to the state of Virginia. This left in doubt the exact position of the District's border with Virginia. In Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196 (1899), the Supreme Court of the United States held that land built in the Potomac River not only belonged to the District of Columbia but to the federal government (contrary to the claims of private landowners, who believed the property belonged to them). In Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1 (1910), the U.S. Supreme Court again affirmed that Maryland's southern border extended to the low-water mark {{on the far side of}} the Potomac River. The issue arose again in 1915, when the Washington Steel & Ordnance Company claimed it owned the newly created land in the Anacostia River created by the dredging operation. The District of Columbia Supreme Court held on December 29, 1915, that the federal government held title to the land. But this decision was overturned on technical grounds by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Washington Steel & Ordnance Company v. Martin, 45 App. 600 (1917). Nonetheless, in dicta in Washington Steel & Ordnance Company, the court of appeals made note of the Supreme Court's ruling in Morris v. United States and held that the reclaimed land belonged to the federal government. The issue as to who owned the dredged land and islands seemed settled.|$|E

Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his view only gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces—he expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted—but Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks. Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, <b>retrocession</b> of the Transvaal under British suzerainty, a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs. Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw and what exactly [...] "suzerainty" [...] meant.
