Cryo-scanning electron microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy of sections stained with berberine-aniline blue revealed that the exodermis is absent in the lateral roots.

50|$|Irvine {{commented that}} because cinema and books are {{different}} mediums {{that the best}} way of resolving this problem was, and is for filmmakers to concentrate on the main strength of cinema, namely its visuality, as cinema can depict what the books can only ask the reader to imagine. A recurring image in Austen films is that of women looking from a window onto the outside or walking in the countryside. The critic Julianne Pidduck in her essay “Of Windows and Country Walks” argues the former image symbolizes repression and a woman’s lot in Regency England, being trapped in a patriarchal society while the latter image symbolizes freedom. The critic Mary Favret in her 2000 essay “Being True to Jane Austen” argued that because film is literally just moving pictures that it resists the tendency of photography to have a fixed image, suggesting a world where change is always possible. In this connection Favret praised the 1995 version of Persuasion as the film used a wandering camera to capture in a kaleidoscopic way Anne Eliot’s unexpressed romantic-sexual feelings even when Anne (Amanda <b>Root)</b> <b>remains</b> still and silent. Irvine noted film adaptations of Austen’s work often used the physicality of the actors to show the sexual desires of the characters that Austen herself only hinted at, with Irving calling a “particularly notorious” example of this being the scene from the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice, where Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) dives into a pond and emerges with wet clothes clinging to his body before a clearly interested Miss Bennet (Jennifer Ehle).|$|E

In roots, SERK 1 expression was first detected in root vascular stem cells and was notably absent from the QC. In general, the SERK 1 protein level as visualized by expression of a SERK 1 -YFP fusion protein closely followed the pattern of gene expression.
