5|$|The {{most urgent}} problem facing the new Emperor was the {{scarcity}} of resources left in the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and to <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practice of auctioning the offices, obviously causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, {{with the help of}} the Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} each season, fans vote {{directly}} for the Player of the Season. Historically this has been conducted by post, but in recent years it has taken place on the Watford Observer's website.

5|$|Upon heating, α-berkelium {{transforms}} {{into another}} phase with an fcc lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group Fmm and {{the lattice constant}} of 500pm; this fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is metastable and will gradually <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original α-berkelium phase at room temperature. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.|$|E

5|$|Both {{carriers}} will {{be completed}} as originally planned, in a Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) configuration, deploying the Lockheed Martin F-35B. Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the British government had intended to purchase the F-35C carrier version of this aircraft, and adopted plans for Prince of Wales to be built to a Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. After the projected costs of the CATOBAR system rose to around twice the original estimate, the government {{announced that it would}} <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original design on 10 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|David’s good {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} 987 when he, anxious {{to make his}} extensive possessions a hereditary Bagratid domain, joined his long-time friend Bardas Phokas in a rebellion against the emperor Basil. Once the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine-Rus' forces in 989, Basil dispatched a strong force under John of Chaldea to punish the Georgians, and David had to submit. Reconciled with the emperor, he was granted, in c. 990, the title of kuropalates again in return for his promise that upon his death the lands previously placed under his sovereignty would <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Biman {{went through}} a {{rebranding}} exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman was forced to <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern revised version of its livery, that {{was applied to the}} new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.|$|E

5|$|In some stories, kitsune have {{difficulty}} hiding their tails {{when they take}} human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. A particularly devout individual may in some cases {{even be able to}} see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> form of a fox and flee.|$|E
5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} {{new rules}} {{to strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Davis GAA club instituted {{judicial}} review proceedings in the High Court in May 2006. Their main argument was that {{the decision of the}} council on 13 February 2006 to <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original plans for the stadium, which did not include a senior GAA pitch, was unlawful. Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer-only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture. The stadium, however, with the original design, could accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium's dimensions. It was only senior GAA games {{that would not have been}} facilitated.|$|E

5|$|The early 1960s were {{a period}} of {{strategic}} uncertainty and increasing commitments in South East Asia. Consequently, the Australian government re-introduced selective conscription in late-1964 and directed {{a significant increase in}} the strength of the Army. Yet unlike during the 1950s when National Servicemen bolstered the strength of CMF, under the new scheme they would serve for two years in the Regular Army instead. This substantial period of service for the regiment in Australia, Malaysia, and Vietnam saw the government direct the expansion of the regiment from four to nine battalions. By September 1965 the regiment consisted of seven battalions; by July 1966, eight; and by November 1967, nine. 4 RAR was formed in February 1964; 1 RAR abandoned the Pentropic Establishment (1,300 personnel) to <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tropical Establishment (800 personnel), allowing 5 RAR to form in March 1965; 6 RAR was formed from a cadre drawn from 2 RAR in June 1965; 3 RAR assisted the formation of 7 RAR in September 1965; 8 RAR formed in August 1966; and 9 RAR was raised in November 1967.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts to <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, {{resulting in an}} excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E

5|$|Monarchs of the Muhammad Ali dynasty reigned over Egypt from 1805 to 1953. Their rule also {{extended}} to Sudan {{throughout much of}} this period, {{as well as to}} the Levant, and Hejaz during the first half of the 19th century. The Muhammad Ali dynasty was founded by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian commander in the expeditionary force sent by the Ottoman Empire in 1801 to dislodge the French occupation of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The defeat and departure of the French left a power vacuum in Egypt, which had been an Ottoman province since the 16th century, but in which the pre-Ottoman Mamluk military caste maintained considerable power. After a three-year civil war, Muhammad Ali managed to consolidate his control over Egypt, and declared himself Khedive of the country. The Ottoman Porte refused to acknowledge this title, instead recognizing Muhammad Ali by the more junior title of Wāli (meaning governor or viceroy) on 18 June 1805, making Muhammad Ali the successor to Ahmad Khurshid Pasha in that position. In the years following his consolidation of power, Muhammad Ali extended Egypt's borders south into Sudan, and eastwards into the Arab Mashreq, particularly the Levant. In 1840, his demand for hereditary control of Egypt and Sudan to be passed to his heirs and successors was accepted and confirmed by the Convention of London, but he was compelled to agree that, upon his death, control over his territories in the Mashreq would <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Porte.|$|E
