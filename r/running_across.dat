5|$|In Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Army in April 1942, Herring {{was given}} command of Northern Territory Force. At this time Darwin was {{being subjected to}} Japanese air raids. As supply by sea or air was impractical, Herring developed a land line of communications <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the outback from Alice Springs.|$|E

She declines, but slips {{into his bedroom}} and makes love to him that night before leaving early the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest elects {{to go for a}} run. He decides to keep <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the country several times, over three and a half years, {{becoming}} famous in the process.|$|E
5|$|Loughor Castle is a ruined, medieval {{fortification}} {{located in}} the town of Loughor, Wales. The castle was built around 1106 by the Anglo-Norman lord Henry de Beaumont, during the Norman invasion of Wales. The site overlooked the River Loughor and controlled a strategic road and ford <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the Gower Peninsula. The castle was designed as an oval ringwork, probably topped by wicker fence defences, and reused the remains of the former Roman fort of Leucarum.|$|E

5|$|The {{house of}} one of the farmworkers was at the crash site. He first ran to his house, where he found that his wife had survived and was safe. Richards rescued one man from the {{wreckage}} and put him by an apple tree. Another survivor was on fire. In a contemporary inverview one of the rescuers says the survivor came <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the farmyard. 60 years later Richards said he rescued the survivor from the aircraft. Accounts agree that rescuers put the survivor in a horse trough to extinguish the flames and cool his burns.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} {{contains}} the Lord Warden's private apartments {{in the west}} bastion and the western half of the keep. In the southern bastion is the Duke of Wellington's Room and the Lucas Room, originally part of an apartment of rooms selected by William Pitt for his use, as they formed the warmest part of the castle. The corridor <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the castle through the keep was built by Pitt to link {{the north and south}} halves of the castle.|$|E
5|$|After brief {{footage of}} a tank driving across a desert {{landscape}} {{a baby is}} shown playing with a paper aeroplane. A hat {{is placed on the}} baby's head and the head is then removed and fitted onto the body of a bomber pilot. The next scene shows a fleet of bombers bombing a city while an anti-aircraft gunner fires at them and troops parachute down. A soldier is seen <b>running</b> <b>across</b> a bombed out city before two opposing troops are shown repeatably stabbing each other with bayonets on a battlefield landscape filled with human skulls. This scene is intercut with footage of two military leaders playing chess.|$|E

A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters <b>running</b> <b>across</b> a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to {{the ceiling of the}} Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} sees Taunton's {{traffic congestion}} problems {{as a serious}} obstacle to its continuing economic growth. An {{important part of the}} government's growth strategy for the town is new road infrastructure consisting of a new link road (Taunton's Third Way) which was completed 27 September 2011 at a cost of £7.5 million. A second link road, (the Northern Inner Distributor Road) planned for completion by the end of 2014 at a cost of £21 million, is still unfinished in 2016, with no completion in the near future. The road would link Staplegrove Road with Priory Avenue, <b>running</b> <b>across</b> Station Road.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{develops}} its narrative thread {{through the}} actions of its player-controlled protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa. Viewed from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical action-adventure fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or <b>running</b> <b>across</b> water. The game world {{is made up of}} several distinct regions, most of which are connected via the city of Tairon, which functions as a hub. Access to these regions are obtained by fighting enemies, finding keys, or solving puzzles, inspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda video games. Dragon busts scattered throughout the regions provide the means to save player progress, permitting gameplay to be resumed at a later time.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the entrance, and <b>running</b> <b>across</b> {{the middle}} of the court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E

5|$|The robin uses auditory, visual, {{olfactory}} {{and possibly}} vibrotactile cues to ﬁnd prey, but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection. It is frequently seen <b>running</b> <b>across</b> lawns picking up earthworms, and its running and stopping behavior is a distinguishing characteristic. In addition to hunting visually, {{it also has}} the ability to hunt by hearing. Experiments have discovered that it can find worms underground by simply using its listening skills. It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left, right or forward to detect movement of its prey. In urban areas, robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where sprinklers are in use. They also are attracted to freshly turned earth in gardens, where worms and grubs are abundant targets. Occasionally, they may visit bird feeders if mealworms or animal-fat suet is offered.|$|E
5|$|Operation of {{the first}} subway began on October 27, 1904, {{with the opening of}} all {{stations}} from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch. Service was extended to 157th Street on November 12, 1904, as that station's opening had been delayed because of painting and plastering work. The West Side Branch was extended northward to a temporary terminus at 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906 served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street. However, only the Dyckman Street, 215th Street, and 221st Street stations opened on that date as the other stations were not yet completed. The 168th Street station opened on April 14, 1906. The 181st Street station opened on May 30, 1906, and on that date express trains on the Broadway branch began running through to 221st Street, eliminating the need to transfer at 157th Street to shuttles. The station at 207th Street was completed in 1906, but since it was located in a sparsely occupied area, it did not open until April 1, 1907. The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains started <b>running</b> <b>across</b> the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, and the nearby 221st Street station was closed.|$|E
