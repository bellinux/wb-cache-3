Mineral salt broth (MSB) medium (0.5 L) and L-arginine hydrochloride (10 g) were placed in a 2.8-L Fernbach flask fitted with an air inlet tube and a vapor bulb extended through the closure of the flask mouth. The flask, fittings, and contents were sterilized in an autoclave. After cooling, the previously prepared flask of inoculum was transferred to the Fernbach flask using aseptic technique. The vapor bulb was charged with chlorobenzene (10 mL), and the flask was shaken on a <b>rotary</b> <b>shaker</b> at 150 rpm and 30° for 48 hours. The vapor bulb with excess chlorobenzene was removed, and the pH of the aqueous contents of the flask was measured and adjusted to pH ~9 if necessary. The aqueous mixture was divided equally into centrifuge tubes and the solids were separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at ~8,000 rpm. The aqueous supernatant was decanted, combined, saturated with NaCl, and extracted with EtOAc (4 × 100 mL).

The medium used for cultivation of biomass was lipid accumulation medium (LAM), containing excess of carbon and limited in nitrogen, according to Suutari et al.(1993) and contained (g L- 1), 30.0 glucose, 1.5 yeast extract, 0.5 NH 4 Cl, 5.0 Na 2 HPO 4.12 H 2 O, 7.0 KH 2 PO 4, 1.5 MgSO 4.7 H 2 O, 0.1 CaCl 2.2 H 2 O, 0.01 ZnSO 4.7 H 2 O, 0.08 FeCl 3.6 H 2 O and (mg L- 1) 0.1 CuSO 4.5 H 2 O, 0.1 Co [NO 32.6 H 2 O, 0.1 MnSO 4.5 H 2 O and pH adjusted to 5.5. An initial pre-inoculum of cells grown for 48 h in the abovementioned medium was used. The cells were washed with distilled water and count adjusted to 109 - 1010 cells. These cells were inoculated in 100 ml of above mentioned media and incubated on a <b>rotary</b> incubator <b>shaker</b> (120 rpm) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h at 30 °C for all the four strains except Y. lipolytica NCIM 3590, which was grown at 20 °C. For each sample, the experiments were carried out in triplicates.|$|R
