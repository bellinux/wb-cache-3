The novel concept consists of {{a new approach to}} {{coal liquefaction}} chemistry which avoids some of the inherent limitations of current high-temperature thermal liquefaction processes. The chemistry employed is based on hydride ion donation to solubilize coal at temperatures (350 - 400 {degrees}C) significantly lower than those typically used in conventional coal liquefaction. The process concept being explored consists of two reaction stages. In the first stage, the coal is solubilized by hydride ion donation. In the second, the products are catalytically upgraded to acceptable <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> The program explores not only the initial solubilization step, but integration of the subsequent processing steps, including an interstage solids-separation step, to produce distillate products. A unique feature of the process concept {{is that many of the}} individual reaction steps can be decoupled, because little recycle around the liquefaction system is expected. This allows for considerable latitude in the process design.

40|$|Pyrolysis of coal or any {{carbonaceous}} material {{is a good}} method for producing valuable products such as gases, liquids and char. It has the advantage, versus other conversion technologies, of promoting the transfer of hydrogen from the parent material to the gas and the liquid products, concentrating the carbon in the residual char which {{can be an important}} improvement in the present scenario, in which carbon-free or at least low carbon fuels need to be promoted to reduce CO 2 emissions. In this sense, pyrolysis has been claimed as an alternative to incineration or land filling for valorization of wastes of hydrocarbon nature. Yields and composition of each product fraction obtained after pyrolysis depend not only on the reaction conditions but also on the experimental system used for the process. In general, the liquids contain a complex mixture of compounds of 5 - 20 carbons with a high proportion of aromatics that can be used directly as fuels or as petroleum <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> The gas fraction which can also be used as a fuel is composed mainly of hydrogen and light hydrocarbons.

Since a low-reactive fuel is required to extend the ignition delay at elevated loads, controllability and stability issues occur at the low-load end. In this investigation seven fuel blends are used, all having a Research Octane Number of around 70 and a distinct composition or boiling range. Four {{of them could be}} regarded as ‘viable refinery fuels’ since they are based on current <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> The latter three are based on primary reference fuels, being PRF 70 and blends with ethanol and toluene respectively.

Experiments are conducted on a heavy duty diesel engine modified for single cylinder operation. In this investigation, emphasis is put on idling (600 rpm) and low load conditions. In particular, the so-called low-temperature heat release (LTHR) is studied. The LTHR is known to be an indicator for ignition behavior in cold conditions as it is the precursor of the main combustion event due to the chain-branching reactions occurring during this phase. LTHR is found to decrease with elevated intake temperatures. This effect is strongly fuel specific and is closely linked to the n-paraffins present in the fuel. It {{should be noted that the}} LTHR effect diminishes if ignition delays shorten. Both ethanol and toluene enhance the LTHR phase. This observation is opposite to effects observed in homogeneous combustion, which implies a significant effect of mixture strength...|$|E

A novel direct coal liquefaction technology was investigated in a program being conducted by CONSOL Inc. with the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research and LDP Associates. The process concept explored consists of a first-stage coal dissolution step in which the coal is solubilized by hydride ion donation. In the second stage, the products are catalytically upgraded to <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> Integrated first-stage and solids-separation steps were used to prepare feedstocks for second-stage catalytic upgrading. An engineering and economic evaluation was conducted concurrently with experimental work throughout the program. Parameters were established for a low-cost, low-severity first-stage reaction system. A hydride ion reagent system was used to effect high coal conversions of Black Thunder Mine Wyoming subbituminous coal. An integrated first-stage and filtration step was successfully demonstrated and used to produce product filtrates with extremely low solids contents. High filtration rates previously measured off-line in Task 2 studies were obtained in the integrated system. Resid conversions of first-stage products in the second stage {{were found to be}} consistently greater than for conventional two-stage liquefaction resids. In Task 5, elementally balanced material balance data were derived from experimental results and an integrated liquefaction system balance was completed. The economic analysis indicates that the production of refined product (gasoline) via this novel direct liquefaction technology is higher than the cost associated with conventional two-stage liquefaction technologies. However, several approaches to reduce costs for the conceptual commercial plant were recommended. These approaches will be investigated in the next task (Task 4) of the program...|$|E

40|$|HCCI is an {{advanced}} combustion concept, using premixed fuel and {{air with a}} diluted charge. This is thermodynamically favorable, leading to high efficiency and therefore lower CO 2 emissions. The well-premixed and diluted fuel charge gives lower cylinder temperatures than conventional diesel compression ignition and spark ignited gasoline combustion, resulting in low engine out emissions of both nitrogen oxides and soot. To be able to optimize and use the advanced combustion concepts in commercial engines, knowledge of fuel behavior is needed, {{and a way to}} describe it. This thesis work provides detailed information about HCCI auto-ignition by studying parameters such as low temperature heat release and auto-ignition temperatures. An HCCI Fuel Number is presented, developed with the purpose to describe fuel performance. By comparing fuels such as full distillate gasolines or biofuels to the required compression ratio for auto-ignition for reference fuels, a measure on HCCI fuel performance is gained. This fuel number was shown to correlate well with pre-reactions in the fuels. The thesis work is based on CFR engine experiments, studying over 40 different reference fuels consisting of blends of n-heptane, iso-octane, toluene, and ethanol, which are model surrogates for gasoline. In addition, 21 different full distillate gasoline fuels prepared from <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks,</b> some with addition of single components, were tested as well. Five different inlet air temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 150 °C were used to achieve different temperature-pressure histories, and the compression ratio was changed accordingly to keep a constant combustion phasing, CA 50, of 3 ± 1 ° after TDC. The main parts of the experiments were carried out in lean operation with a constant equivalence ratio of 0. 33 and with an engine speed of 600 rpm. Additional experiments were performed at higher engine speeds. Studied fuel effects include low temperature heat release quenching effects, were ethanol was found to quench low temperature heat release at all conditions, and toluene had an in comparison very weak effect on these pre-reactions. All conditions and fuels with extensive low temperature heat release showed similar auto-ignition temperatures. When LTHR diminished, either due to fuel quenching from ethanol or toluene, or when the inlet air temperature was increased, the auto-ignition temperature was increased...|$|E
40|$|Depletion {{of fossil}} fuel {{reserves}} along with growing environmental concerns has shifted focus towards {{renewable energy sources}} for liquid fuels production, such as biofuels. Most biofuels, like ethanol, are single-component fuels that cannot meet today 2 ̆ 7 s engine specifications unless they are blended with petroleum feedstocks. Current transportation infrastructure uses petroleum fuels that are mixtures of compounds. Therefore, {{it is important to}} be able to produce multi-component fuels in a cost effective way, from renewable resources. ^ Aqueous-phase hydrogenation reactions are crucial in converting biomass-derived molecules into liquid fuels and chemicals. It is possible to produce multi-component fuels through the hydrogenation of bio-oils in the aqueous phase. One of the hardest functionalities to be hydrogenated in bio-oils is the carboxylic acids. Our findings on acetic acid hydrogenation studies over monometallic catalysts will be discussed combined with insight learned from DFT calculations. Ruthenium has been shown to be the most active and selective catalyst towards ethanol formation. Acetyl species appears to be a key component as its formation is the rate-determining step for almost all catalysts. ^ Another way of making multi-component fuels is by the liquid-phase processing of the hemicellulose portion of biomass. It will be shown that hemicellulose-derived aqueous feedstocks can be converted into a petroleum feedstock that can readily be processed in existing petroleum refineries to make a variety of fuels. Furfural is produced in high yields from the dehydration of hemicellulose-derived sugar streams. The aldol condensation of furfural with acetone gives highly conjugated C 13 compounds along with some polymeric adducts. In the presence of supported metal catalyst these compounds undergo hydrogenation, and at the same time, form heavy cyclic molecules via Diels-Alder reactions. Through hydrodeoxygenation and isomerization over bifunctional catalysts these molecules produce <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks,</b> or more specifically, fluid catalytic cracker cycle oil substitutes, having carbon numbers up to C 31. This integrated catalytic process can be tuned to adjust the yield of the hydrocarbon products thereby selectively producing jet and diesel fuel range compounds or a heavier petroleum refinery feedstock. This study demonstrates that biomass can produce mixtures of components that can fit seamlessly into petroleum refinery infrastructure. ...|$|E

Parmi les diverses méthodes envisagées pour la réutilisation ou l'élimination des polymères usagés, les recyclages énergétiques et chimiques peuvent apporter des solutions satisfaisantes et complémentaires au recyclage de la matière. Cet article fait le point sur l'état d'avancement des techniques de valorisation énergétique et chimique des rejets de polymères et il propose une analyse critique des traitements actuels. Increased {{environmental protection}} requires {{the installation of}} new treatment techniques for polymer wastes. Competitive industrial facilities are not available from the economic standpoint for recycling spent plastic and rubber wastes in the form of materials, especially when mixtures are involved. It is only by using other treatment method for the chemical or energy upgrading of polymers, as a supplement to the recycling of materials, that {{it should be possible to}} make a significant reduction in the amount of spent polymers currently being scrapped. The energy upgrading of wastes by incineration with energy recovery or by pyrolysis with the formation of fuels in an interesting approach for a great many countries. When no reuse is possible, the energy content of the material is upgraded before the subsequent scrapping of an ultimate residue that is reduced to its incompressible minimum after having been inerted. There are currently several technical solutions for incineration furnaces and the treatment of the fumes produced, which meet the more and more severe requirements concerning environmental protection. Incineration systems with energy recovery can recover about 8000 thermies per ton of unsorted plastics. They already have an important position, albeit a varying one, from one European country to another (Table 6). They should develop considerably further in the years to come. The pyrolysis or controled thermolysis of polymer wastes is a future route for the recovery of upgradable products in the form of gaseous, liquid or solid fuels, and sometimes in the form of oligomers or monomers. Pyrolysis systems preferably use rotary reactors or a fluidised bed with a view to obtaining a more uniform composition of the products. Chemical upgrading holds an intermediate position between the recycling of materials and energy recycling. It consists in chemically decomposing macromolecules, e. g. by cracking or hydrocracking, hydrolysis, alcoholysis, saponification, etc., with a view to obtaining products or monomers that can be reused for manufacturing new polymers. Chemical recycling is eminently suitable, in particular, for polyolefins, polyesters, polyurethanes and polyamides. To conclude, as our understanding of the effects of incineration improves and as further progress is made in the technological field, incineration with energy recovery should make up a more widely accepted alternative solution for increasing the recycling of polymers. In the medium term, it is thought that pyrolysis, and, more probably, low-temperature thermolysis will be the main routes for the recycling of spent polymers with a view to recovering upgradable raw materials with sufficient degrees of purity. However, the economic cost effectiveness of such processes remains to be proved on the industrial scale. Most experts think that the technology of cracking is potentially the most advantageous among all chemical recycling techniques, but that another 5 to 10 years will be needed for the transformation of polyolefin wastes into <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstocks,</b> to be marketed and industrially applied...|$|E

The contents of the FCC gasoline are primarily paraffins, naphthenes, olefins, aromatics, and undesirables such as sulfur and sulfur containing compounds in low quantities. The proportions of these components in the FCC gasoline invariable determine its quality as well as the performance of the associated downstream units. The increasing demand for cleaner and lighter fuels significantly influences the need not only for novel processing technologies but also for alternative <b>refinery</b> and petrochemical <b>feedstocks.</b> Current and future clean gasoline requirements include increased isoparaffins contents, reduced olefin contents, reduced aromatics, reduced benzene, and reduced sulfur contents. The present study is aimed at investigating the effect of processing an unconventional <b>refinery</b> <b>feedstock,</b> composed of blend of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) on FCC full range gasoline yields and compositional spectrum including its paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, napthenes, and aromatics contents distribution within a range of operating variables of temperature (500 – 700 °C) and catalyst-feed oil ratio (CFR 5 – 10) using spent equilibrium FCC Y-zeolite based catalyst in a FCC pilot plant operated at the University of Alicante’s Research Institute of Chemical Process Engineering (RICPE). The coprocessing of the oil-polymer blend led to the production of gasoline with very similar yields and compositions as those obtained from the base oil, albeit, in some cases, the contribution of the feed polymer content as well as the processing variables on the gasoline compositional spectrum were appreciated. Carbon content analysis showed a higher fraction of the C 9 –C 12 compounds at all catalyst rates employed and for both feedstocks. The gasoline’s paraffinicity, olefinicity, and degrees of branching of the paraffins and olefins were also affected in various degrees by the scale of operating severity. In the majority of the cases, the gasoline aromatics tended toward the decrease as the reactor temperature was increased. While the paraffins and iso-paraffins gasoline contents were relatively stable at around 5 % wt, the olefin contents on the other hand generally increased with increase in the FCC reactor temperature.

A linear programming (LP) model was developed which simulates a generic 150, 000 barrel per day refinery in the Midwest U. S. Data from upgrading tests conducted on the coal liquids and related petroleum fractions in the pilot plant testing phase of the Refining and End Use Study was inputed into the model. The coal liquids were compared against a generic petroleum crude feedstock. under two scenarios. In the first scenario, {{it was assumed that}} the refinery capacity and product slate/volumes were fixed. The coal liquids would be used to replace a portion of the generic crude. The LP results showed that the DL 1 material had essentially the same value as the generic crude. Due to its higher quality, the DL 2 material had a value of approximately 0. 60 $/barrel higher than the petroleum crude. In the second scenario, it was assumed that a market opportunity exists to increase production by one-third. This requires a <b>refinery</b> expansion. The <b>feedstock</b> for this scenario could be either 100 % petroleum crude or a combination of petroleum crude and the direct coal liquids. Linear programming analysis showed that the capital cost of the refinery expansion was significantly less when coal liquids are utilized.

Depending on the coal liquid flow rate, the value of the DL 1 material was 2. 5 - 4. 0 $/barrel greater than the base petroleum crude, while the DL 2 material was 3. 0 - 4. 0 /barrel higher than the crude. Co-processing the coal liquids with lower quality, less expensive petroleum crudes that have higher sulfur, resid and metals contents was also examined. The coal liquids have higher values under this scenario, but the values are dependent on the prices of the alternative crudes...|$|R
