30|$|The {{data sets}} {{included}} in the WDMAM often overlap, sometimes over very large areas. All data are not of the same quality; therefore, it is advisable to define an order of preference between data sets. In particular, the data set used to fill the gaps (see Table 1, indices = 45, 46, 47) are either of poor quality or low resolution. National grids derived from aeromagnetic data are usually all of similar quality. Marine data are generally of lower quality than airborne data despite their <b>re-levelling</b> (Quesnel et al. 2009). We therefore limit the overlap between two adjacent compilations to few tens of kilometres and, in some cases, avoid any overlap.|$|E
40|$|Put simply, dumping is the {{exporting}} {{of produce}} {{at less than}} production cost to the material detriment of competitor industries in the importing country. The recourse by the plaintiff – the importing country - is to impose import bans and/or compensating duties (duty orders) on the rogue products in legitimate protection of their own industry – i. e. a <b>re-levelling</b> of the playing field. These are called Anti- Dumping Measures (ADMs). Theoretically this is a technical issue that {{should be subject to}} economic logic and legal argument. In practice it is highly political, can be arbitrary and is often raised at the behest of an industry finding its self-unable to compete for harsh but fair economic reasons...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{integrity}} of the Australian Height Datum (AHD) has remained in some question ever since its adoption in 1971. Indeed, its creators com-mented that using 30 tide gauges ‘placed a strain ’ on the least-squares network adjustment of the ~ 97, 230 km of spirit levelling used to realise the AHD. Al-though the AHD seems to have served Australians well, the question remains – can the AHD be improved? Of course, <b>re-levelling</b> an entire continent the size of Australia is prohibitively expensive, especially in the current climate of eco-nomic rationalism. Therefore, a proposal is made to enhance and redefine the AHD using the additional levelling data collected since 1971, mean sea level observations made at new tide gauges, models of the sea-surface topography, nation-wide GPS height networks and a regionally refined gravimetric geoid model. This proposal is balanced against the argu-ments in favour of retaining the existing AHD, cou-pled with a geoid model that has been warped to fit the existing AHD using nation-wide GPS networks co-located with AHD benchmarks...|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} <b>re-levelling</b> of {{the precise}} levelling network of Singapore {{was carried out}} to derive the reduced levels of some 2000 plus benchmarks, which comprise new Precise Levelling Bench Marks (PLBMs), existing PLBMs, their witness marks and existing Integrated Survey Network (ISN) marks. A geometric geoid model for Singapore was also computed from the geoidal heights derived from the RTK ellipsoidal heights and the adjusted reduced levels of 406 marks which comprise PLBMs, witness marks, offset marks and ISN marks. 43 independent variables dependent on the easting and northing coordinates were initially used to compute the multiple regression surface to best fit 464 benchmarks with geoid separations (GS) which are the dependent variable in the formulation. 58 benchmarks {{were found to have}} outlying GS and subsequently found to have gross errors in their RTK heights. Recommendations had been made to avoid such spurious RTK heights. Stepwise multiple regression using the method of forward selection was used to compute the polynomial equation for the geometric geoid. Only five (5) independent variables and a constant term were ultimately adopted in the formulation. The geometric geoid as determined using multiple regression forward stepwise method, RTK heighting and the precise leveling, is able to achieve accuracy to within ± 0. 030 m, ± 0. 040 m and ± 0. 050 m for 82 %, 95 % and 99 %, respectively, of the 464 benchmarks/offset marks/witness marks surveyed...|$|E

5000|$|The {{horizontal}} and vertical axes of a theodolite must be perpendicular; if not then a [...] "horizontal axis error" [...] exists. This can be tested by aligning the tubular spirit bubble parallel to a line between two footscrews and setting the bubble central. A horizontal axis error is present if the bubble runs off central when the tubular spirit bubble is reversed (turned through 180°). To adjust, the operator removes 1/2 the amount the bubble has run off using the adjusting screw, then <b>re-level,</b> test and refine the adjustment.|$|R
50|$|A mix of {{structural}} resins and hardener is injected into foundation ground beneath footings. On entering the ground the resin and hardener mix and expansion occurs {{due to a}} chemical reaction. The expanding structural resin mix fills any voids and crevices, compacts any weak soil and then, if the injection is continued, the structure above may be raised and <b>re-levelled.</b> This relatively new method of underpinning has been in existence for approximately 30 years, and {{because it does not}} involve any construction or excavation set-up, is known to be a clean, fast and non-disruptive underpinning method.|$|R
40|$|Subsidence {{occurring}} at geothermal fields requires monitoring, analysis, {{and understanding of}} the mechanisms {{in order to ensure that}} it does not affect field operations. This study utilised a broad range of techniques including spatial analysis, three-dimensional modelling, and the comparison of samples of the cover sequences to investigate the subsidence at Kawerau Geothermal Field. Subsidence at Kawerau is of concern because the Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill is located within the geothermal field and utilises machinery with small alignment tolerances that are sensitive to ground deformation. A probabilistic hazard analysis of Kawerau was completed and maps created indicating the potential for subsidence in the future. Spatial analysis of benchmark <b>re-levelling</b> surveys revealed two types of subsidence features: 1) field wide subsidence and 2) subsidence anomalies. Field wide subsidence, currently covering ~ 17 km 2, is driven by thermal contraction of reservoir deep formations and/or compaction of the reservoir due to effective stress increases related to pressure drawdown. Four local subsidence anomalies each covering 150 – 400 m 2 are likely driven by varying shallow processes. Two of these features, termed Bowls B and D, south of the Kawerau Geothermal Ltd. power station are the main focus of this thesis along with an assessment of the Tasman Mill site, its potential to develop an anomaly, and the mechanism of subsidence currently occurring across it. Three-dimensional modelling of the cover sequences to 750 m below relative level was completed in Leapfrog Geo using well logs from Kawerau. Modelling revealed an anomalous thickness of Tahuna Formation below Bowls B and D, and relatively uniform thicknesses across the mill site of other shallow formations. The anomalous thickness of Tahuna Formation was hypothesised as being responsible for the presence of the subsidence bowls by being more compressible than the overlying Caxton Formation which is thicker across the mill site while the Tahuna Formation is thinner. Alternative hypotheses were explored by mapping the relative level of the Matahina ignimbrite, thickness of the Caxton Formation, and distribution of brecciation. To test the main hypothesis, samples of Tahuna and Caxton formations were collected from the Kawerau Core Shed and tested for their physical properties and relative compressibility. XRD and thin section analysis was also completed on the samples. Tahuna Formation was found to have more than three times the porosity of the Caxton Formation and have smectite clays present. Using a method developed for testing the relative compressibility of weak rock the Tahuna Formation was found to generally be twice as compressible and elastic as the Caxton Formation when saturated. Samples of Recent alluvium from the mill site were also tested for their physical properties and found not to have the potential to contribute to subsidence across the mill site. However further investigation is required to confirm the mechanisms of Bowls B and D. A hazard analysis of Kawerau Geothermal Field found that the field has a low annual probability of being impacted by volcanic and volcanogenic, earthquake, and flooding events. Probabilities are calculated based on the reoccurrence intervals for each event. A hazard map for subsidence at Kawerau is also developed and outlines four zones of risk. Infrastructure at risk based on trends of subsidence is also analysed for its susceptibility to subsidence and mitigation methods discussed. The overall conclusion is that the geological conditions beneath the mill site are unlikely to form a local subsidence anomaly, and the mill site is largely unaffected by the field wide subsidence bowl. Ground tilt values are within mill machinery tolerances, and based on current trends the spatial extent of subsidence anomalies will remain approximately the same into the future...|$|E

The new architect, Mr. Waldron noticed a dangerous shift in weight and hired Fred Metcalf to observe this shift. An order went out to remove all 24 pillars, excavate underneath, <b>re-level</b> the ground and reset 22 pillars. The decision to drop the two remaining pillars allowed {{the elimination of the}} clerestory wall connecting the nave and the chancel, thus opening the transept a full one-hundred-sixty-five feet. As the arches and clerestory began to rise {{in the latter half of}} 1910, extra reinforcement was provided in the form of steel girders at the clerestory level down either side of the nave and around the ambulatory.|$|R
50|$|The field {{which is}} now widely {{considered}} one of the best playing surfaces in New Zealand received a renovation in 2012 by Mexted Performance Sport Surfaces. The park had a build-up of organic matter and contaminants so the surface was holding water and wasn’t draining away, affecting playability. Mexteds’ Contracts used a planer, to take 100mm off the playing surface in two 50mm passes, then <b>re-levelled</b> the sub-grade and installed new primary drainage in between the existing drain lines. The sand based park has a 250mm layer of dune sand and over the years a build-up of organic matter in the top 100mls has stopped the water from draining away. For the majority of times it rained, the surface would hold water. Mexteds introduced a new 50mm layer of clean turf sand.|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} a very common problem {{encountered}} in many automotive industries. Automotive companies try to level the production of different models over time based on the demands for these models in the market. In order to achieve this, they introduce a leveled stream of cars {{in the beginning of}} the production line. But because of many reasons this leveled stream gets disturbed in its course. In order to <b>re-level</b> the stream, buffers are used between the shops. One such buffer is called as selectivity bank and it sits between paint shop and assembly shop. This buffer receives a disturbed sequence from the paint shop. The thesis tries to develop different algorithms that can be used to discharge cars from this buffer in order to achieve better leveling in the presence of rework and assembly constraints. These algorithms continuously try to steer the system from an undesirable state to a more desirable state by keeping track of current conditions in the plant. A simulation model is developed, which gives a platform for comparing relative performance of these logics under different conditions. The simulation tool is also helpful in designing optimum size of this buffer that will result in desired leveling performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement {{on the basis of the}} published text and agreed schedule of commitments. We find that the Agreement reinforces existing patterns of comparative advantage between Canada (agriculture and resource-based sectors) and Korea (autos and other industries). The sensitive sectors that held up the deal for years - autos into Canada and beef into Korea - witness major trade gains, but are not unduly disrupted. In both economies, the major output gains otherwise come in non-traded services sectors, driven by income effects. We find that trade diversion effects are quite significant; this lends support for the domino theory of major free trade agreements - since the Korea-EU agreement broke the ice, the pressure has intensified on third parties to <b>re-level</b> playing fields by striking their own deals. The study breaks new ground in modelling services trade by developing policy impacts based on the extent to which the text of the Agreement modifies Korea's and Canada's scores on the OECD's Services Trade Restrictiveness Index and by providing estimates of Mode 3 Services trade impacts. The analysis of the Agreement as negotiated, the present study, in our view, is a step forward in understanding the impact of modern free trade agreements...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{gasoline}} DI {{injection equipment}} has been modified to generate single hole pulsed gas jets. Injection experiments {{have been performed}} at combinations of 3 different pressure ratios (2 of which supercritical) respectively 3 different hole geometries (i. e. length to diameter ratios). Injection was into a pressure chamber with optical access. Injection pressures and injector hole geometry were selected to be representative of current and near-future DI natural gas engines. Each injector hole design has been characterized by measuring its discharge coefficient for different <b>Re-levels.</b> Transient jets produced by these injectors have been visualized using planar laser sheet Mie scattering (PLMS). For this the injected gas was seeded with small oil droplets. The corresponding flow field was measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) laser diagnostics. From the corresponding measurements, both the jet spreading angle and penetration have been determined according to different definitions and the interrelation between these definitions has been examined. Results show that -beyond the initial transition period and almost up to the tip vortex region - (average) jet angle is almost constant. Furthermore, jet penetration is well predicted by correlations that implicitly assume momentum conservation at constant static pressure. Measurements suggest a different time-averaged velocity profile from that typically assumed {{in some of these}} correlations.

5000|$|Having won the toss and {{choosing}} {{to kick off}} Australia raced to a 9-0 lead through two penalties taken by Weissel and a try by Frank O'Connor which Weissel converted. It wasn't {{until late in the}} first half that England scored when Stanley Smith touched down for a try. At half-time the score was 9-3. For the second half England moved Gus Risman from stand off where on his debut he had not had a good first half and played Stan Brogden at stand off instead. This change unsettled the Australians who in attempting to cover Brogden often left Evans, the scum half, free to play the ball to the three-quarter line. While Australia scored first in the half, another Weissel penalty, the greater speed of the English three-quarters eventually came to the fore. Brogden was the first to score a try to make the score 11-6 to Australia. Shortly afterwards Smith raced over and with Sullivan converting the try made the score 11-11. England then took the lead 13-11 as Sullivan kicked a drop goal; Weissel then <b>re-levelled</b> the scores with another penalty. With under 10 minutes left to play Smith completed his hat trick with a try in the corner, with Sullivan converting the try this made the score 18-13 to England and with no further scoring England took the series 2-1 as the game ended.---- ...|$|R
