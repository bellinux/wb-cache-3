40|$|What {{an agent}} {{ought to do}} is {{determined}} by competition between <b>reasons</b> bearing on the options open to her. The popular metaphor of balancing or weighing <b>reasons</b> on a scale to represent this competition encourages a focus on competition between <b>reasons</b> for competing options. But what an agent ought to do also depends on the <b>reasons</b> against those options. The balancing metaphor does not provide an obvious way to represent <b>reasons</b> against. Partly as a result of this, there is a serious lack of work on <b>reasons</b> against. A simple view {{is that there is no}} problem here, since <b>reasons</b> against an option are really just more <b>reasons</b> for—in particular, <b>reasons</b> for certain alternatives. This simple view lets us maintain the balancing metaphor, and more importantly, it simplifies theorizing about the competition between <b>reasons.</b> This is because if it’s true, there is really just one kind of competition, the competition between <b>reasons</b> for competing options. This paper challenges the simple view, arguing against several ways of identifying which alternatives to an option the <b>reasons</b> against it are <b>reasons</b> for. I also sketch a competing view, according to which <b>reasons</b> against are distinct from <b>reasons</b> for—these are two different normative relations. If this kind of view is correct, then our theory of the competition between <b>reasons</b> will need to recognize at least two kinds of competition: the one between <b>reasons</b> for competing options, and the one between the <b>reasons</b> for an option and the <b>reasons</b> against it.

40|$|My {{concern is}} the ongoing debate {{regarding}} {{the relationship between the}} <b>reasons</b> for which an agent acted (motivating <b>reasons)</b> and the <b>reasons</b> which count in favour of that action (normative <b>reasons).</b> Normative <b>reasons</b> seem to be facts, whereas motivating <b>reasons</b> seem to be psychological states. Agents look to be capable for acting for the <b>reasons</b> that favour an action, which would require that motivating <b>reasons</b> are capable of being {{the same kind of thing}} as normative <b>reasons,</b> which in turn is in conflict with the different natures of normative and motivating <b>reasons.</b> My object in my dissertation is to resolve this conflict. I examine Bernard Williams’ “reasons internalism” and Michael Smith’s Humean account of motivating <b>reasons.</b> Both argue that motivating <b>reasons</b> are psychological states. I disagree. I argue, based on Smith 2 ̆ 7 s position, that the right account of the psychological states that make up motivation is not identical to our theory of motivating <b>reasons.</b> I then discuss Dancy 2 ̆ 7 s argument for an anti-psychological account of <b>reasons,</b> according to which no <b>reasons</b> are necessarily psychological states of the agent. His position is unable to account for agents acting in the light of false beliefs. Drawing on McDowell 2 ̆ 7 s epistemological disjunctivism, I conclude that the correct account of <b>reasons</b> is that when an agent is acting in the light of true beliefs, an agent 2 ̆ 7 s <b>reasons</b> are anti-psychological, whereas when an agent acts in the light of false beliefs, the agent 2 ̆ 7 s <b>reasons</b> are psychological...|$|R

40|$|Joseph Raz has {{developed}} a concept of authority based on the special relationship between <b>reasons</b> and action.

Authorities do this by providing special <b>reasons</b> via directives to their subjects. These special <b>reasons</b> are what Raz calls “protected <b>reasons.</b> ” Protected <b>reasons</b> are both first-order <b>reasons</b> for action and second-order “exclusionary reasons” that exclude the subject from considering some <b>reasons</b> in the balance of <b>reasons</b> for or against any action.

5|$|Qiyas or analogical <b>reason</b> is {{the fourth}} source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision.

40|$|In this paper, I {{develop a}} theory of how claims about an agent’s {{normative}} <b>reasons</b> {{are sensitive to the}} epistemic circumstances of this agent, which preserves the plausible ideas that <b>reasons</b> are facts and that <b>reasons</b> can be discovered in deliberation and disclosed in advice.

40|$|I {{discuss the}} {{respective}} roles of traits and <b>reasons</b> in {{the explanation of}} action.

Because traits require motivation by <b>reasons,</b> it is often possible to explain {{one and the same}} action by an appeal to either the agent's traits or to her <b>reasons.</b> I then ask whether it follows from here that traits and <b>reasons</b> explanations of action are equivalent – though perhaps offered from different points of view – or whether they differ in interesting ways. I argue that the differences are interesting and important – traits and <b>reasons</b> explanations answer different “why” questions regarding action: a <b>reasons</b> explanation tells us what <b>reasons</b> motivated the agent acting; a traits explanation, by contrast, indicates something about an agent’s <b>reasons</b> but tells us something else in addition: it tells us why the agent acted on those as opposed to other available <b>reasons...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Are <b>reasons</b> {{for action}} facts or {{psychological}} states? There are two answers {{in the literature}} on the ontology of <b>reasons.</b> According to the Standard Story, normative <b>reasons</b> are facts, while motivating <b>reasons</b> are psychological states. According to the factualist, both normative and motivating <b>reasons</b> are facts. In this paper I argue that neither of these views is satisfactory. The Standard Story errs in thinking that the two kinds of <b>reasons</b> are different ontological entities. The factualist gets this right, but incurs some distasteful ontological commitments by thinking of motivating <b>reasons</b> as facts. We should, thus, give a proper hearing to the only serious logically possible alternative to the two existing views: both motivating and normative <b>reasons</b> are psychological states...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an opinionated {{guide to the}} {{literature}} on normative epistemic <b>reasons.</b> After making some distinctions in § 1, I begin in § 2 by discussing the ontology of normative epistemic <b>reasons,</b> assessing arguments for and against the view that they are mental states, and concluding {{that they are not}} mental states. In § 3, I examine the distinction between normative epistemic <b>reasons</b> there are and normative epistemic <b>reasons</b> we possess.

Finally, in § 5, I look at the role of <b>reasons</b> in epistemology, considering challenges to viewing <b>reasons</b> as the building blocks of epistemic normativity and maintaining that the challenges recommend a novel bi-level epistemology rather than a marginalization of <b>reasons</b> in epistemology...|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} classes of <b>reasons</b> and values (i.e., agent-relative and agent-neutral) emphasized in Nagel's later work are situated within a Sidgwickian {{model in which}} one's moral commitments are thought of objectively, such that one's personal <b>reasons</b> and values are simply incomplete parts of an impersonal whole. The structure of Nagel's later ethical view is that all <b>reasons</b> must be brought into relation to this objective view of oneself. Those <b>reasons</b> and values that withstand detached critical scrutiny are objective, but more subjective <b>reasons</b> and values can nevertheless be objectively tolerated. However, the most striking part of the earlier argument and of Sidgwick's view is preserved: agent-neutral <b>reasons</b> are literally <b>reasons</b> for anyone, so all objectifiable <b>reasons</b> become individually possessed no matter whose they are. Thinking reflectively about ethics from this standpoint, one must take every other agent's standpoint on value as seriously as one's own, since one's own perspective is just a subjective take on an inter-subjective whole; one's personal set of <b>reasons</b> is thus swamped by the objective <b>reasons</b> of all others.|$|R
40|$|<b>Reasons</b> {{can play}} a variety of roles {{in a variety of}} contexts. For instance, <b>reasons</b> can motivate and guide us in our actions (and omissions), {{in the sense that we}} often act in the light of <b>reasons.</b> And <b>reasons</b> can be grounds for beliefs, desires and {{emotions}} and can be used to evaluate, and sometimes to justify, all these. In addition, <b>reasons</b> are used in explanations: both in explanations of human actions, beliefs, desires, emotions, etc., and in explanations of a wide range of phenomena involving all sorts of animate and inanimate substances. This diversity has encouraged the thought that the term ‘reason’ is ambiguous or has different senses in different contexts. Moreover, this view often goes hand in hand with the claim that <b>reasons</b> of these different kinds belong to different ontological categories: to facts (or something similar) in the case of normative/justifying <b>reasons,</b> and to mental states in the case of motivating/explanatory <b>reasons.</b> In this paper I shall explore some of the main roles that <b>reasons</b> play and, on that basis, I shall offer a classification of kinds of <b>reasons.</b> As will become clear, my classification of <b>reasons</b> is at odds with much of the literature in several respects: first, because of my views about how we should understand the claim that <b>reasons</b> are classified into different kinds; second, because of the kinds into which I think <b>reasons</b> should be classified; and, finally, because of the consequences I think this view has for the ontology of <b>reasons...</b>|$|R
