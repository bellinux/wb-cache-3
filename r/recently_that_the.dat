5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the UC campuses run {{a quarter}} system (with the {{exception}} of UC Berkeley, UC Merced, the UCLA medical school, and all UC law schools) {{while most of the}} CSU campuses operate on a semester system, with {{the exception of}} six campuses. It was announced <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remaining six campuses in the CSU, Cal State East Bay, Cal State San Bernardino, CSULA, CSU Bakersfield, Cal Poly SLO, and Cal Poly Pomona will all be switching into the semester system {{by the end of the}} decade. This was part of a comprehensive study conducted by the CSU.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} {{class of}} model proposes that observers {{are limited by}} the total number of items which can be encoded, either because the capacity of VSTM itself is limited (e.g., Cowan, 2001; Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988). This type of model has obvious similarities to urn models used in probability theory (see, for example, Mendenhall, 1967). In essence, an urn model assumes that VSTM is restricted in storage capacity to only a few items, k (often estimated to lie in the range of three-to-five in adults, though fewer in children (Riggs, McTaggart & Simpson, 2006)). The probability that a suprathreshold change will be detected is simply the probability that the change element is encoded in VSTM (i.e., k/N). This capacity limit has been linked to the posterior parietal cortex, the activity of which initially increases with the number of stimuli in the arrays, but saturates at higher set-sizes (Todd & Marois, 2004). Although urn models are used commonly to describe performance limitations in VSTM (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988; Sperling, 1960), it is only <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actual structure of items stored has been considered. Luck and colleagues have reported a series of experiments designed specifically to elucidate the structure of information held in VSTM (Luck & Vogel, 1997). This work provides evidence that items stored in VSTM are coherent objects, and not the more elementary features of which those objects are composed.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{reviews for}} the single were mostly positive, with Billboard {{magazine}} describing the song as a [...] "Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing." [...] Record World magazine also praised the song, commenting [...] "It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights." [...] In the UK, Music Echo described the song as [...] "wild and oriental but still beaty".

500|$|Rhenium {{is one of}} {{the rarest}} {{elements}} in Earth's crust with an average concentration of 1ppb; other sources quote the number of 0.5ppb making it the 77th most abundant element in Earth's crust. Rhenium is probably not found free in nature (its possible natural occurrence is uncertain), but occurs in amounts up to 0.2% in the mineral molybdenite (which is primarily molybdenum disulfide), the major commercial source, although single molybdenite samples with up to 1.88% have been found. Chile has the world's largest rhenium reserves, part of the copper ore deposits, and was the leading producer as of 2005. It was only <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first rhenium mineral was found and described (in 1994), a rhenium sulfide mineral (ReS2) condensing from a fumarole on Russia's Kudriavy volcano, Iturup island, in the Kuril Islands. Kudryavy discharges up to 20–60kg rhenium per year mostly in the form of rhenium disulfide. Named rheniite, this rare mineral commands high prices among collectors.|$|E

2500|$|Even though Mexico {{is a very}} {{ethnically diverse}} country, {{research}} about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field, in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of Mexico's government to unify all Mexicans under a single ethnic identity (that of the [...] "Mestizo"). As a result, since 1930 the only ethnic classification that has been included in Mexican censuses has been that of [...] "Indigenous peoples". Even then, across the years the government has used different criteria to count Indigenous peoples, with each of them returning considerably different numbers. It is not until very <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mexican government begun conducting surveys that considered the Afro-Mexican and Euro-Mexican population that lives in the country.|$|E
2500|$|Barbey’s {{research}} {{investigates the}} effects of human brain damage on [...] intellectual [...] and social functions, with particular emphasis on the prefrontal cortex. Studies of patients with frontal lobe damage {{have a long history}} in the neuroscience of intelligence and provide a direct way to test whether regions within the prefrontal cortex are necessary for specific intellectual abilities. However, it was only <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> limited applicability and specificity of small sample studies of focal brain damage were overcome by contemporary lesion mapping approaches. In a series of landmark studies, Barbey's research group investigated almost 200 patients with focal brain injuries and mapped the architecture of executive, social, and emotional brain systems. His research has helped to identify and characterize the neural systems underlying general intelligence, emotional intelligence, social intelligence, fluid intelligence, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and discourse comprehension. Barbey's research has also revealed molecular genetic markers that predict general intelligence following traumatic brain injury.|$|E

2500|$|The Bhairab once {{flowed from}} the Ganges, across the present beds of the Jalangi, and further eastwards towards Faridpur. [...] The Bhairab {{is no more}} a very active river. [...] The Mathabhanga is a younger stream than Jalangi {{and it was not}} till very <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> river {{completed}} its junction with the Hooghly by adopting the River Churni (now its lower reaches) for its main course. Earlier most of the water of the Mathabhanga ran off to the east down the Kumara, Chitra, Coboduk (Bhairab), and Ichamati, but all these escape routes have been shut off, except a small amount for the Ichamati. The point to note is that while earlier the rivers in the region flowed in a south-easterly direction, but later some force pulled the Jalangi and the Mathabhanga in a south-westerly direction. The inference is that it occurred because of a local subsidence, which was active for some period prior to 1750 and which has since become inactive.|$|E
2500|$|Hotson {{himself had}} {{considered}} {{the possibility that the}} witnesses had [...] "concocted a lying account of Marlowe's behaviour, to which they swore at the inquest, and with which they deceived the jury" [...] but came down against that scenario. Others, however, began to suspect that this was indeed the case. Writing to the Times Literary Supplement shortly after the book's publication, Eugénie de Kalb disputed that the struggle and outcome as described were even possible, and Samuel A. Tannenbaum (a graduate of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons) insisted the following year that such a wound could not have possibly resulted in instant death, as had been claimed. Even Marlowe's biographer John Bakeless acknowledged that [...] "some scholars have been inclined to question the truthfulness of the coroner's report. There is something queer about the whole episode" [...] and said that Hotson's discovery [...] "raises almost as many questions as it answers." [...] It has also been discovered more <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> apparent absence of a local county coroner to accompany the Coroner of the Queen's Household would, if noticed, have made the inquest null and void.|$|E
2500|$|For instance, one author {{summarized}} the accepted scientific {{view of the}} time with the words: [...] "Stereopsis will never be obtained unless amblyopia is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for stereopsis ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age, {{but we do not}} know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing." [...] For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as medical state of the art as follows: [...] "If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any amblyopia or depth perception, so the goal may be simply cosmetic – to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned – though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision." [...] It has only been accepted very <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> therapeutic approach was based on an unquestioned notion that has, since, been referred to as [...] "myth" [...] or [...] "dogma".|$|E
