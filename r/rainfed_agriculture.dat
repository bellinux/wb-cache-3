40|$|Climate change-related {{drought in}} recent years has emerged as a source of household-level {{vulnerability}} in <b>rainfed</b> hill <b>agriculture</b> of Nepal. The farmers cannot grow crops when there is no rainfall during the cropping season. They have weak adaptive capacity against drought due to the poor asset base and low access to services and facilities. The government also has limited resources to support these farmers, which calls for prioritising both the adaptation indicators and beneficiary farmers. However, current literature on vulnerability is inadequate, and there is still uncertainty in measurement at household level. Amidst this uncertainty, this research uses an objective method of vulnerability analysis, applying multivariate independence techniques. Information collected by participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and household survey of 158 farms from August 2008 to January 2009 was used. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to prioritise the indicators, and cluster analysis (CA) was used to classify farmers into different vulnerability groups. The indicators, arranged from highest to lowest priority, were access to land, access to irrigation, employment diversification, access to markets, crop-livestock integration, access to social networks and access to agricultural training. Similarly, 63 %, 18 % and 19 % of all farms were classified as highly vulnerable, moderately vulnerable and less vulnerable, respectively. The article then discusses constraints and relevant areas of adaptation interventions for each vulnerability group of farmers. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Using long-term daily rainfall records from 22 meteorological stations spread across AEZ of Mali, four (4) known methods were applied to determine the onset dates of the rain. The mean onset dates were statistically compared with the farmer’s planting window for the selected weather stations to determine the suitable dates of OGS and LGS. The hypothesis considered a time lag minimum of 7 days between the mean onset date and traditional farmer sowing dates for the crops. Then, the preferred method was used to estimate OGS based on early, normal and late dates respectively across the stations. Also, the estimated LGS according to each zone was evaluated using probability distribution chart with duration to maturity for varieties of the same crops. The results showed that Def_ 4 was found appropriate for Sahelian and Sudano-Sahelian zones; Def_ 3 satisfied the criteria and exhibited superior capacity into farmer’s average planting date over Sudanian and Guinea Savannah zones.

40|$|<b>Rainfed</b> {{smallholder}} <b>agriculture</b> in semi-arid {{areas of}} southern Africa {{is subject to}} numerous constraints. These include low rainfall with high spatial and temporal variability, and significant loss of soil water through evaporation. An experiment was established at Matopos Research Station, Zimbabwe, {{to determine the effect}} of mulching and minimum tillage on maize (Zea mays L.) yield and soil water content. The experiment was run for two years at two sites: clay (Matopos Research Station fields) and sand (Lucydale fields) soils, in a 7 × 3 factorial combination of mulch rates (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha− 1) and tillage methods (planting basins, ripper tine and conventional plough). Each treatment was replicated three times at each site in a split plot design. Maize residue was applied as mulch before tillage operations. Two maize varieties, a hybrid (SC 403) and an open pollinated variety (ZM 421), were planted. Maize yield and soil water content (0 – 30 and 30 – 60 cm depth) were measured under each treatment. On both soil types, neither mulching nor tillage method had a significant effect on maize grain yield. Tillage methods significantly influenced stover production with planting basins giving the highest stover yield (1. 1 t ha− 1) on sandy soil and conventional ploughing giving 3. 6 t ha− 1 on clay soil during the first season. The three tillage methods had no significant effect on seasonal soil water content, although planting basins collected more rainwater {{during the first half of}} the cropping period. Mulching improved soil water content in both soil types with maximum benefits observed at 4 t ha− 1 of mulch.

The cultivation of improved, drought-tolerant perennial forages can alleviate these constraints. This study aimed to support breeders in choosing target species and plant types, and agronomists in setting site-specific forage recommendations for the western Mediterranean basin. Three-year dry matter (DM) yield and final survival of two cultivars of cocksfoot (Kasbah, completely summer dormant; Jana, non-dormant) and two of tall fescue (Centurion and Flecha, both incompletely dormant) that were top-performing in previous studies were assessed in six rainfed sites of Algeria, France, Italy, Morocco and Portugal. Site mean annual water for the crop ranged from 321 to 669 mm. On average, tall fescue displayed higher DM yield and a slight trend towards greater persistence than cocksfoot. However, species and cultivars within species displayed interaction with location. Factorial regression was preferable to other techniques for modelling adaptive responses. Cultivar DM yield was modelled {{as a function of}} spring–summer (April–September) drought stress and late-spring (May–June) daily maximum temperatures of locations, whereas cultivar final survival was modelled as a function of mean annual water available and absolute minimum temperature of locations. Indications on expected best-performing material were produced for combinations of these climatic variables, highlighting the excellent yielding ability of Flecha across drought-prone environments, the good persistence of Flecha and Kasbah in most environments, and the adaptation of the remaining cultivars to specific climatic conditions. Besides driving cultivar recommendations, our results can support breeders’ decisions also in view of predicted climate changes. Tall fescue has general interest for Mediterranean drought-prone areas. Completely summer-dormant cocksfoot germplasm could also be useful for these areas, especially the warmer ones, if its yielding ability in the cool season could definitely be improved...|$|R

Such unmitigated hydro-logical variability 1 currently costs the Ethiopian economy over one-third of its growth potential. The very structure of the Ethiopian economy, with its heavy reliance on <b>rainfed</b> subsistence <b>agriculture,</b> makes it particularly vul-nerable to hydrological variability.

Up until now, most policy and macro-economic deci-sions have been based on growth models that assume rainfall is consistently at historical average levels. These models do not take into account shocks to the economy caused by extreme water events, such as floods and droughts.

The study found that considering the effects of water variability reduced projected rates of economic growth by 38 % per year and increased pro-jected poverty rates by 25 % over a twelve year period. Furthermore, the variability of rainfall increased value-added of water investments, such as irrigation, that reduce vulnerability to rainfall.
