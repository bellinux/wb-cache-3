5|$|A <b>rigid</b> {{division}} of labor is established which clearly identifies the regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system.|$|E
5|$|In theory, {{if enough}} {{satellites}} were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid {{version of the}} Dyson shell mentioned below. Such a shell would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell {{as high as the}} <b>rigid</b> form. Such a shell would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the <b>rigid</b> form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see below).|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the noun phrase is {{characterized}} by a <b>rigid</b> order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.|$|E
5|$|The Wellington bypass was {{constructed}} by contractor M. J. Gleeson Ltd, from 1973 to 1975. Many problems {{followed in the}} two years after completion; the <b>rigid</b> concrete carriageway broke up, due to the road being built on a poor subbase with <b>rigid</b> concrete along a historically heavily mined route. The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original carriageway had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|The {{width of}} the keel was {{increased}} {{to provide a more}} <b>rigid</b> structure amidships to resist stress while docking.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{localised}} {{examples of}} the <b>Rigid</b> Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum).|$|E
5|$|A {{capacity}} for aggressive behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted. Within groups, the animals are extremely peaceful and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not <b>rigid</b> and the animals easily share roles.|$|E
5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For <b>rigid</b> origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of <b>rigid</b> material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|An extended, {{structurally}} <b>rigid,</b> highly anisotropic shape {{seems to}} be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior, and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings.|$|E
5|$|COBOL code {{is split}} into four {{divisions}} (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a <b>rigid</b> hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions {{and just one}} class.|$|E
5|$|Compulsive {{behaviors}}: Time-consuming behaviors {{intended to}} reduce anxiety {{that an individual}} feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to <b>rigid</b> rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increasing}} {{concerns about the}} use of chess engines and outside communication, in 2014 FIDE banned all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions, under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament. However, the rules also allow for less <b>rigid</b> enforcement in amateur events.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are <b>rigid</b> protein structures, about 20nanometres in {{diameter}} and up to 20micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{set up in}} a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Mario Balotelli, David Silva and Yaya Touré playing behind lone striker Carlos Tevez, and Nigel de Jong and Gareth Barry in {{defensive}} midfield roles. Stoke City {{set up in a}} <b>rigid</b> 4–4–2 formation, {{with two}} wingers in Jermaine Pennant and Matthew Etherington to support strikers Kenwyne Jones and Jonathan Walters.|$|E
5|$|Metis lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Adrastea), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces slowly cause its orbit to decay. If its density is similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its <b>rigid</b> Roche limit.|$|E
5|$|Noémi's {{influence}} on Raymond during the inter-war years was substantial. She {{encouraged him to}} break away from Wright's <b>rigid</b> style and explore the design of the Reinanzaka House. She increased her interest in Japanese art and philosophy, including ukiyo-e woodblock prints and introduced Raymond to various influential people, including the mystic philosopher Rudolf Steiner.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April, Princess Matoika {{carried a}} group of 18 men and three {{officers}} of the U.S. Navy who were to attempt a transatlantic flight in the <b>rigid</b> airship R38, being built in England for the Navy. Several {{of the group that}} traveled on the Matoika were among the 45men killed when the airship crashed on 24August 1921.|$|E
5|$|Other orders {{such as the}} Dermaptera (earwigs), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets), Mantodea (praying mantis) and Blattodea (cockroaches) have <b>rigid</b> {{leathery}} forewings that aren't flapped while flying, {{sometimes called}} tegmen (pl. tegmina), elytra, or pseudoelytron.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as <b>rigid</b> stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic <b>rigid</b> stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome <b>rigid</b> body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E
5|$|Several {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} via bronchoscopy {{for the management}} of airway obstruction or bleeding. If an airway becomes obstructed by cancer growth, options include <b>rigid</b> bronchoscopy, balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement. Laser photosection involves the delivery of laser light inside the airway via a bronchoscope to remove the obstructing tumor.|$|E
5|$|Similar in appearance, all treecreepers {{are small}} birds with {{streaked}} and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long <b>rigid</b> tail feathers that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.|$|E
5|$|Since the anemone lacks a <b>rigid</b> skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it <b>rigid.</b> When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability {{of children with}} AS often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into <b>rigid</b> behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears <b>rigid</b> or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
5|$|The leaf {{blades of}} the summer rosettes of P. moranensis are smooth, <b>rigid,</b> and succulent, varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour. The laminae are {{generally}} obovate to orbicular, between 5.5 and 13centimeters (2–5in.) long and supported by a 1 to 3.5centimetre (⅜–1⅜in.) petiole.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanically}} <b>rigid</b> {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are <b>rigid</b> segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride {{on top of the}} asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} financial pressure {{meant that}} little rebuilding occurred until 1906, {{and when it}} resumed Balfour's influence was diminished. He had little affinity with the hedonistic young Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke (grandson of the 1st), who Edwin Lutyens and others had persuaded to adopt a less <b>rigid</b> architectural policy.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{arise from}} the meso- and meta-thoracic {{segments}} and are similar in size in the basal groups. In more derived groups, the meso-thoracic wings are larger with more powerful musculature at their bases and more <b>rigid</b> vein structures on the costal edge.|$|E
5|$|With the Mercedes-Benz O305s {{approaching}} their 25-year age limit, tenders {{were called}} in 2007 for replacements. The new buses were Scania K230UB/K280UB <b>rigid</b> and Scania K320UA articulated buses bodied by Custom Coaches. , these along with one MAN SL202, and one Mercedes-Benz O405NH make up the fleet.|$|E
25|$|If the {{principle}} of virtual work for applied forces is used on individual particles of a <b>rigid</b> body, {{the principle}} can be generalized for a <b>rigid</b> body: When a <b>rigid</b> body that is in equilibrium is subject to virtual compatible displacements, the total virtual work of all external forces is zero; and conversely, if the total virtual work of all external forces acting on a <b>rigid</b> body is zero then the body is in equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|A Heavy <b>Rigid</b> (HR class) license {{covers a}} <b>rigid</b> vehicle with 3 or more axles with a towed trailer not {{weighing}} more than 9 tons GTM. Also articulated buses.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{formulation of}} <b>rigid</b> body dynamics {{that has a}} number of convenient features is obtained by considering the virtual work of forces acting on a <b>rigid</b> body.|$|E
25|$|A Medium <b>Rigid</b> (MR class) license {{covers a}} <b>rigid</b> vehicle with 2 axles and a GVM {{of more than}} 8 tons, with a towed trailer not {{weighing}} more than 9 tons GTM.|$|E
25|$|A <b>rigid</b> {{motion of}} the {{framework}} is a motion such that, at each point in time, the framework is congruent to its original configuration. <b>Rigid</b> motions include translations and rotations of Euclidean space; the gradients of <b>rigid</b> motions form a linear space having the translations and rotations as bases, of dimension , which must always be a subspace of the nullspace of the rigidity matrix.|$|E
25|$|The set of {{translations}} and rotations together {{form the}} <b>rigid</b> motions or displacements. This set forms a group under composition, {{the group of}} <b>rigid</b> motions, a subgroup of the full group of Euclidean isometries.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in higher}} {{dimensions}} not every -tight graph is minimally <b>rigid,</b> and characterizing the minimally <b>rigid</b> graphs (the bases of the rigidity matroid {{of the complete}} graph) is an important open problem.|$|E
