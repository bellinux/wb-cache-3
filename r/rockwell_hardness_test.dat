40|$|This paper {{covers the}} effect of heat {{treatment}} on the mechanical properties of medium carbon steel. The main objective of this project is to investigate the hardness and impact properties of medium carbon steel treated at different heat treatment processes. Three types of heat treatment were performed in this project which are annealing, quenching and tempering. During annealing process, the specimens were heated at 900 oC and soaked for 1 hour in the furnace. The specimens were then quenched in a medium of water and open air, respectively. The treatment was followed by tempering processes which were done at 300 oC, 450 oC, and 600 oC with a soaking time of 2 hours for each temperature.

The interest in natural fibre reinforced polymeric composites is rapidly springing up in terms of research and industrial applications. The increased applications of these natural fibres in such composites are a proof to this claim. The paper deals with the detailed study of bamboo fibre, banana fibre and linen fibre cut into 2 − 4 mm of length with epoxy resin having random orientations. Various tests like Impact test (IZOD and CHARPY test), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) test and <b>Rockwell</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>test</b> were conducted on 10 specimens of bamboo epoxy resin composite, bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite and bamboo−linen epoxy resin composite.

40|$|Abstract The <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is {{commonly}} used and accepted by many industrial users, but the hardness value requires conversion between scales because the geometry of the indenters and the load ranges are different. On the other hand, hardness calculation using pyramidal indenters is quite simple and {{can be applied to}} any load range, though it is much more complicated to calibrate the frame compliance and the truncation of indenters in nanoindentation measurement. For this reason, nanoindentation measurement is not yet fully industrially friendly. In order to improve the above situation, newly developed industrial hardness test methods and a new concept of Equivalent indentation depth (or indentation depth index) were proposed and investigated in this paper. These methods are based on the principle of similarity of Vickers and other pyramidal indenters, and take advantage of the industrial and practical usability of the <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test.</b> Experimental results that covered macroscopic through nanoscopic ranges show that the methods can be applied {{to a wide range of}} test loads. One of the expected advantages of the methods of performing nanoindentation and other instrumented indentation tests (ISO 14577) is that the hardness is not significantly influenced by the frame compliance or the truncation of indenters. Other advantages over conventional hardness tests are also discussed in this paper. More experimental work is necessary to confirm and establish the new methods.

40|$|Abstract The direct {{verification}} of Rockwell testing machines comprises four parts such as test force, indenter, depth measuring device, and testing cycle {{as seen in}} ISO 6508 - 2.

In addition to this, most of commercial <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machines produced nowadays are automatically controlled by the embedded software, which makes {{it much more difficult}} to calibrate the testing cycle. It implies that even though <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machines are advanced more, the calibration of the testing cycle does not keep up with their advancement. To overcome this problem, an on-site calibration system was developed to calibrate the testing cycle of both the automatically controlled as well as manually controlled <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machines. The calibration system is composed of load cell, indentation depth measuring apparatus and embedded clock. Using this system, measurement of test force, application velocity of test force, and indentation depth are possible simultaneously in real time, which enhances the efficiency and reliability of calibration procedure...|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} {{assessment of}} the integrity of welds is a complicated NDE problem that {{continues to be a}} challenge. To be able to completely characterize a weld, detailed knowledge of its tensile strength, ductility, hardness, microstructure, macrostructure, and chemical composition is needed. NDE techniques which can provide information on any of these features are extremely important. In this paper, we examine a seldom used approach based on the thermoelectric (TE) effect for characterizing welds and their associated heat affected zone (HAZ). The thermoelectric method monitors the thermoelectric power which is sensitive to small changes in the kinetics of the conduction electrons near the Fermi surface that can be caused by changes in the local microstructure. The technique has been applied to metal sorting, quality testing, flaw detection, thickness gauging of layers, and microscopic structural analysis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for characterizing welds, a series of tungsten-inert-gas welded Inconel- 718 samples were scanned with a computer controlled TE probe.
