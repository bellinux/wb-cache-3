40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of measurements of aerosol optical properties which were made between 2006 and 2008 within the framework of various international projects in different locations such as Spitsbergen, northern Norway and Crete. The investigations were made under different baric topography conditions and in various seasons of the year which facilitated the investigations of spatial and temporal dependencies between upper troposphere mass state and spectral variations of aerosol properties. The results of aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements showed significant episodes during which jet stream events (300 hPa surface) over the Arctic were present. The mean spectral characteristics of AOD from “before ” and “after ” the event differ by 0. 14 versus the “during ” phase of the episode.

Section 2 contains the derivalions which {{are necessary to}} cornpute the energy conversion for a large region {{on the basis of}} vertical velocities and <b>relative</b> <b>topography</b> as obtained from a two-parameter model presently used by the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit. The energy conversion is divided into three parts: (1) energy conversion due to a mean vertical velocity over the region, (2) energy conversion in meridional planes, and (3) energy conversion in the zonal planes. Section 3 contains a discussion of the results obtained for the months January and A-pril 1959. The energy conversion is positive for each day in both months, but the conversion in the meridional planes has a different sign in the two months, beirlg positive in January and negative in April. The pattern of the mean meridional circulation is discussed and the frictional dissipation estimated. Section 4 describes a procedure for an evaluation of t,he energy conversion for the different wave numbers, and discusses the results for the same two months. The same section contains a comparison with results obtained from a linear, adiabatic theory. Section 5 contains a discussion of the modifications to the results in section 4 caused by the diabatic heating of the atmosphere It is made plausible that. the maximum conversion found for the small wave numbers by an adiabatic computation is greatly altered due to the effects of the heating. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of discoidal apo A-I-phospholipid complexes, representing the metabolic precursors of mature high-density lipoprotein particles, was studied {{by a combination}} of both a theoretical and an experimental approach. The secondary {{structure of}} the complex was determined by circular dichroic measurements, while the relative orientation of the apo A-I helical segments and of the phospholipid acyl chains was determined by ATR infrared measurements. Fluorescence energy transfer between the tryptophan residues of apo A-I and fluorescent phospholipid probes yielded an estimation of the <b>relative</b> <b>topography</b> of the lipid and apolipoprotein components in discoidal and spherical particles. The theoretical approach consisted of the identification of the helical segments in various apo A-I species. These segments were then oriented at a lipid/water interface by minimization of their hydrophobic and hydrophilic transfer energies. The calculation of the hydrophobicity profiles along the axis of the helices leads to the identification of specific interactions between pairs of helices. The helices were further assembled together with the phospholipids by computer modelling, enabling an estimation of the dimensions of the complex. The combination of the experimental and theoretical results yielded a model for discoidal apolipoprotein-phospholipid complexes, in which the amphipathic helical segments are oriented along the edges of the discs. Such a model can be extended to the conversion of these complexes into mature spherical HDL, through the formation of a cholesteryl ester core. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Rodent whisking is an {{exploratory}} behavior {{that can be}} modified by sensory feedback. Consistent with this, many whisker-sensitive cortical regions project to agranular motor (MI) cortex, but the <b>relative</b> <b>topography</b> of these afferent projections has not been established. Intracranial microstimulation (ICMS) evokes whisker movements {{that are used to}} map the functional organization of MI, but no study has compared the whisker-related inputs to MI with the ICMS sites that evoke whisker movements. To elucidate this relationship, anterograde tracers were placed in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and in the primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortical areas so that their labeled projections to MI could be analyzed with respect to ICMS sites that evoke whisker movements. Projections from SI and SII terminate in a narrow zone that marks the transition between the medial (AGm) and lateral agranular (AGl) cortical areas, but PPC projects more medially and terminates in AGm proper. Paired recordings of MI neurons indicate that the region between AGm and AGl is highly responsive to whisker deflections, but neurons in AGm display negligible responses to whisker stimulation. By contrast, AGm microstimulation is more effective in evoking whisker movements than microstimulation of the transitional region between AGm and AGl. The AGm region was also found to contain a larger concentration of corticotectal neurons, which could convey whisker-related information to the facial nucleus. These results indicate that rat whisker motor cortex is comprised of at least two functionally distinct subregions: a sensory processing zone in the transitional region between AGm and AGl, and a motor output region located more medially in AGm proper...|$|E
40|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} and flood episodes in Europe {{are related to}} cyclogenesis and frontal systems. When cyclones develop in the Mediterranean, often deep convection is associated: large and long lasting cell clusters are forced by larger scale disturbances during the warm season and even Mesoscale Convective Systems are detected. Deep, organized convective systems were studied and their link with cyclonic development in the Mediterranean region was analyzed. We studied a one-month period (25 Aug. - 25 Sep. 1998) when 4 cyclonic episodes and several convective clusters occurred in the Mediterranean. In particular two MCS induced by cyclonic motion are studied (28 - 29 August, 8 - 9 September 1998). The analysis is based on Meteosat imagery (IR and WV) and on meteorological conventional data (ECMWF data). We analyzed the PVA (potential vorticity anomalies) at 250 and 200 hPa, {{in conjunction with the}} geopotential height at 850 hPa, the wet-bulb potential temperature at 500 and 850 hPa, the <b>relative</b> <b>topography</b> 300 - 700 hPa, the wind fields and radiosoundings. We proposed and evaluated a conceptual model of develop of such systems in the Mediterranean. The proposed conceptual model consists of two interlocking flows. The first is a radial flux of cold-dry air caused by the coupling of the low pressure at low levels (850 hPa) with the potential vorticity anomaly (tropopause sink) at high levels (250 - 200 hPa). This flow is visible by a decreasing of the thickness 300 - 700 hPa. The flux of clod-dry air travels eastward and interacts with the second warm-moist air flux, advected from south-west from the cyclonic rotation. The convection develops within few hundreds kilometers east of the surface low. In fact the dry air pushes the warm-moist air up, triggering new thunderstorms few kilometers ahead. The coupling between the PVA and the pressure low is less marked in the last phase of the system development...|$|E

40|$|The cycling {{of water}} in the {{landscape}} is influenced by climate change on different time scales and in different directions regarding warming or cooling trends. Along with a changing climate, also the landscape and subsurface conditions, such as permafrost extent, may change in a long-term perspective. Permafrost and hydrology are intimately connected but the interactions between them are poorly understood, and the hydrological response to climate change is complex. The first part of this thesis investigates the effects of different drivers of future changes in hydrological flow and water storage components in the present day temperate Forsmark catchment in Sweden. The role of taliks and their influence on the exchange of deep and shallow groundwater in permafrost environments are also studied. This is done by a simulation sequence where the site is exposed to the landscape, climate and permafrost changes expected from site-specific numerical modeling. In the second part of this thesis, present day periglacial hydrological processes are studied in the Two Boat Lake catchment in western Greenland by field and model investigations of the site. The presence of a through talik below the Two Boat Lake, and data from a deep bedrock borehole into the talik, enable studies of the hydrological interactions between the lake and the talik. The spatial and temporal variability of the different water balance components of the catchment are quantified and the interactions between the surface water and the supra- and sub-permafrost groundwater are analyzed. The results show that the investigated changes in climate and permafrost influence hydrology more than the investigated landscape changes. Under permafrost conditions, {{the general direction of the}} exchange between deep and shallow groundwater may change relative to unfrozen conditions. The simulation studies of Forsmark show that the <b>relative</b> <b>topography</b> between taliks governs the recharging and discharging conditions, which is consistent with results from Two Boat Lake. The lake is located at high altitude relative to other taliks and hydraulic measurements indicate recharging conditions. The talik recharge is small compared to other water balance components and does not influence the lake level, which instead is found to be controlled by evapotranspiration and water inflow from the active layer. This is concluded from numerical simulations that take into account and combine evapotranspiration with other surface and subsurface hydrological processes. This thesis highlights the need to integrate surface and subsurface process modelling in order to quantitatively understand and represent the dynamics and complexity of hydrological interactions in periglacial catchments...|$|E

Regression models quantified relationships between topographic parameters and temperature gradient statistics for our spatially distributed dataset. Demonstration of the <b>relative</b> importance of <b>topography</b> in influencing spatial snowpack temperature gradients could aid future modeling of snow layer development and behavior, with benefits for avalanche and snowmelt modeling. This spatial, or geographic, analysis of the relationship of snow temperature gradient patterns to topography, utilizes landscape-scale modeling in an attempt to identify responses in complex, mountainous terrain. During the snow season of 2001 - 2002, 30 temperature profiles were sampled on nine sample days. Profiles were collected through the use of a portable snow temperature profile probe (Deems, 2001). These data were used to calculate temperature gradients for each profile. Topographic attributes were derived using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Linear regression assessed the relationship between the topographic variables and snow temperature gradient patterns, and demonstrates the relative importance of the terrain variables in determining spatial patterns of temperature gradients. Analysis of the regression models shows a complex pattern of relationships between average temperature gradients and topographic variables.

The two predictions about variation in demography <b>relative</b> to <b>topography</b> are: 1) specialists on their favored habitat outperform other species on the same habitat; we call this the resident vs. foreign hypothesis, where resident refers to the local specialists and foreign refers to specialists of other habitats; 2) specialists perform better on their favored habitat than they do elsewhere: the home vs. away hypothesis. To test these hypotheses, we estimated growth and mortality rates of 272 species in the 50 -ha forest plot and examined how rates varied across five topographic habitats along the ridge-valley catena.

40|$|We {{interpret}} the three-dimensional seismic wave-speed {{structure of the}} Australian upper mantle by comparing its azimuthal anisotropy to estimates {{of past and present}} lithospheric deformation. We infer the fossil strain field from the orientation of gravity anomalies <b>relative</b> to <b>topography,</b> bypassing the need to extrapolate crustal measures, and derive the current direction of mantle deformation from present-day plate motion. Our observations provide the depth resolution necessary to distinguish fossil from contemporaneous deformation. The distribution of azimuthal seismic anisotropy is determined from multi-mode surface-wave propagation. Mechanical anisotropy, or the directional variation of isostatic compensation, is a proxy for the fossil strain field and is derived from a spectral coherence analysis of digital gravity and topography data in two wavelength bands. The joint interpretation of seismic and tectonic data resolves a rheological transition in the Australian upper mantle. At depths shallower than V 150 ^ 200 km strong seismic anisotropy forms complex patterns. In this regime the seismic fast axes are at large angles to the directions of principal shortening, defining a mechanically coupled crust^mantle lid deformed by orogenic processes dominated by transpression. Here, seismic anisotropy may be considered ‘frozen’, which suggests that past deformation has left a coherent imprint on much of the lithospheric depth profile.

Initial studies explored the potential of US to infer the presence of pneumothoraces in veterinary settings [33], after lung biopsies [18, 34, 35], and in a mixed group that included three stable trauma patients [22]. Much of the pioneering work arose from Dr. Lichtenstein’s [21, 24, 26] group in Paris. North American interest in this technique was greatly facilitated by specific space medicine-related needs arising from the presence aboard the International Space Station of a high quality ultrasound capability, without any other medical diagnostic capabilities. NASA-associated research thus examined basic science and clinical questions both in terrestrial- and space-analog environments [23, 29, 36 – 42].
