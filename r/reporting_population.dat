40|$|The Alaotran {{gentle lemur}} Hapalemur alaotrensis is a Critically Endangered lemur, which {{exclusively}} inhabits the marshes around Lac Alaotra in northeast Madagascar. In the past decades {{the population of}} H. alaotrensis has experienced a dramatic decline due to poaching, habitat destruction and degradation. Surveys {{have been carried out}} periodically to follow the status of the population. Here we present the results of a survey carried out between May and June 2008 in the southwestern part of the marshes around Alaotra and discuss the key findings derived from the analysis of the data collected. Our study indicates that the probability of detecting the species in an area where it is present is very low and depends on factors that vary in space and time. These results stress the need to account for imperfect detection when monitoring this species, an issue especially relevant when <b>reporting</b> <b>population</b> trends. Our analyses also show that habitat fragmentation is a key determinant of habitat suitability for H. alaotrensis, with fragmented areas of marsh showing low suitability. Finally, our observations and analysis suggest that the protection provided by the local community to H. alaotrensis in Andreba is contributing to the conservation of this Critically Endangered species. This highlights the need to continue working on engaging the local communities in the conservation of the marshes at Lac Alaotra as a critical element to secure the future of H. alaotrensis...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{practical}} limits in characterizing the safety profiles of therapeutic products prior to marketing, manufacturers and regulatory agencies perform post-marketing surveillance {{based on the}} collection of adverse reaction reports (&quot;pharmacovigilance&quot;). The resulting databases, while rich in real-world information, are notoriously difficult to analyze using traditional techniques. Each report may involve multiple medicines, symptoms, and demographic factors, {{and there is no}} easily linked information on drug exposure in the <b>reporting</b> <b>population.</b> KDD techniques, such as association finding, are well-matched to the problem, but are difficult for medical staff to apply and interpret. To deploy KDD effectively for pharmacovigilance, Lincoln Technologies and GlaxoSmithKline collaborated to create a webbased safety data mining web environment. The analytical core is a high-performance implementation of the MGPS (Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker) algorithm described previously by DuMouchel and Pregibon, with several significant extensions and enhancements. The environment offers an interface for specifying data mining runs, a batch execution facility, tabular and graphical methods for exploring associations, and drilldown to case details. Substantial work was involved in preparing the raw adverse event data for mining, including harmonization of drug names and removal of duplicate reports. The environment can be used to explore both drug-event and multi-way associations (interactions, syndromes). It has been used to study age/gender effects, to predict the safety profiles of proposed combination drugs, and to separate contributions of individual drugs to safety problems in polytherapy situations...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{species can}} {{demonstrate}} strong genetic differentiation and population structure despite {{the hypothesis of}} open seas and high connectivity. Some suggested drivers causing the genetic breaks are oceanographic barriers and the species' biology. We assessed the relevance of seven major oceanographic fronts on species connectivity while considering their dispersal capacity and life strategy. We systematically reviewed the scientific articles <b>reporting</b> <b>population</b> genetic differentiation along the Mediterranean Sea and across the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition. We retained those considering at least one sampling locality at each side of an oceanographic front, {{and at least two}} localities with no-front between them to correctly assess the effect of the front. To estimate the impact of life history characteristics affecting connectivity we considered the planktonic larval duration (PLD) and adult life strategy. Oceanographic barriers in the Mediterranean Sea seem to reduce gene flow globally; however, this effect is not homogeneous considering the life history traits of the species. The effect of the oceanographic fronts reduces gene flow in highly mobile species with PLD larger than 2 - 4 weeks. Benthic sessile species and/or with short PLD (< 2 weeks) have more significant genetic breaks between localities than species with higher motility; however, genetic differentiation occurs independently of the presence of a front. Genetic connectivity is important for populations to recover from anthropogenic or natural impacts. We show that species with low mobility, mostly habitat-formers, have high genetic differentiation but low gene flow reduction mediated by the front, therefore, considering the importance of these species, we emphasize the vulnerability of the Mediterranean ecosystems and the necessity of protection strategies based on the whole ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Modelling {{studies are}} used widely to help inform {{decisions}} {{about health care}} and policy and their use is increasing. However, in order for modelling to gain strength {{as a tool for}} health policy, it is critical that key model factors are transparent so that users of models can have a clear understanding of the model and its limitations. Reporting guidelines are evidence-based tools that specify minimum criteria for authors to report their research such that readers can both critically appraise and interpret study findings. This study was conducted to determine whether there is an unmet need for population modelling reporting guidelines. Methods We conducted {{a review of the literature}} to identify: 1) guidance for <b>reporting</b> <b>population</b> modelling studies; and, 2) evidence on the quality of reporting of population modelling studies. Guidance for reporting was analysed using a thematic approach and the data was summarised as frequencies. Evidence on the quality of reporting was reviewed and summarized descriptively. Results There were no guidelines that specifically addressed the reporting of population modelling studies. We identified a number of reporting guidelines for economic evaluation studies, some of which had sections that were relevant population modelling studies. Amongst seven relevant records, we identified 69 quality criteria that have distinct reporting characteristics. We identified two papers that addressed reporting practices of modelling studies. Overall, with the exception of describing the data used for calibration, there was little consistency in reporting. Conclusions While numerous guidelines exist for developing and evaluating health technology assessment and economic evaluation models, which by extension could be applicable to population modelling studies, there is variation in their comprehensiveness and in the consistency of reporting these methods. Population modelling studies may be an area which would benefit from the development of a reporting guideline. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature investigating {{the incidence of}} fatal and or nonfatal low-speed vehicle run-over (LSVRO) incidents in children aged 0 – 15 years. Methods: The following databases were searched using specific search terms, from their date of conception up to June 2011 : Cochrane Library, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, AMI, Sociological Abstracts, ERIC, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, Urban Studies and Planning; Australian Criminology Database; Dissertations and Thesis; Academic Research Library; Social Services Abstracts; Family and Society; Scopus; and Web of Science. A total of 128 articles were identified in the databases (33 found by hand searching). The title and abstract of these were read, and 102 were removed {{because they were not}} primary research articles relating to LSVRO-type injuries. Twenty-six articles were assessed against the inclusion (<b>reporting</b> <b>population</b> level incidence rates) and exclusion criteria, 19 of which were excluded, leaving a total of five articles for inclusion in the review. Findings: Five studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The incidence rate in nonfatal LSVRO events varied in the range of 7. 09 to 14. 79 per 100, 000 and from 0. 63 to 3. 2 per 100, 000 in fatal events. Discussion: Using International Classification of Diseases codes for classifying fatal or nonfatal LSVRO incidents is problematic as there is no specific code for LSVRO. The current body of research is void of a comprehensive secular population data analysis. Only with an improved spectrum of incidence rates will appropriate evaluation of this problem be possible, and this will inform nursing prevention interventions. The effect of LSVRO incidents is clearly understudied. More research is required to address incidence rates in relation to culture, environment, risk factors, car design, and injury characteristics. Conclusions: The lack of nursing research or policy around this area of injury, most often to children, indicates a field of inquiry and policy development that needs attention...|$|E

40|$|Patient-reported {{outcomes}} (PROs) play {{an increasingly}} important role in clinical practice and research. Modern psychometric methods such as item response theory (IRT) enable the creation of item banks that support fixed-length forms as well as computerized adaptive testing (CAT), often resulting in improved measurement precision and responsiveness. Here we describe and discuss the case for developing an international core set of PROs building from the US PROMIS® network. PROMIS is a U. S. -based cooperative group of research sites and centers of excellence convened to develop and standardize PRO measures across studies and settings. If extended to a global collaboration, PROMIS {{has the potential to}} transform PRO measurement by creating a shared, unifying terminology and metric for reporting of common symptoms and functional life domains. Extending a common set of standardized PRO measures to the international community offers great potential for improving patient-centered research, clinical trials <b>reporting,</b> <b>population</b> monitoring, and health care worldwide. Benefits of such standardization include the possibility of: international syntheses (such as meta-analyses) of research findings; international population monitoring and policy development; health services administrators and planners access to relevant information on the populations they serve; better assessment and monitoring of patients by providers; and improved shared decision making. The goal of the current PROMIS International initiative is to ensure that item banks are translated and culturally adapted for use in adults and children in as many countries as possible. The process includes 3 key steps: translation/cultural adaptation, calibration, and validation. A universal translation, an approach focusing on commonalities, rather than differences across versions developed in regions or countries speaking the same language, is proposed to ensure conceptual equivalence for all items. International item calibration using nationally representative samples of adults and children within countries is essential to demonstrate that all items possess expected strong measurement properties. Finally, it is important to demonstrate that the PROMIS measures are valid, reliable and responsive to change when used in an international context. IRT item banking will allow for tailoring within countries and facilitate growth and evolution of PROs through contributions from the international measurement community. A number of opportunities and challenges of international development of PROs item banks are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inadequate {{descriptions}} of interventions in reports of research studies impede evidence synthesis, {{and result in}} unnecessary research duplication and suboptimum real-world implementation. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) provides guidance for reporting interventions, and is primarily focussed on interventions delivered to individuals or small groups. We aimed to assess {{the need for additional}} reporting guidance for population health and policy (PHP) interventions and, if appropriate, develop an extension to TIDieR. Methods: This study was the preliminary stage of an expert consensus consultation. We drew on our collective experience of evaluating and synthesising evidence of PHP interventions that fall within the scope of Cochrane Public Health to purposively select a diverse range of interventions and compare these with the original TIDieR checklist and to assess whether additional reporting items were needed. Interventions studied included tobacco and alcohol regulation, health service reorganisation, welfare system changes, conditional incentives for behaviour change, and environmental or infrastructural improvement programmes. Intervention descriptions from published evaluations were abstracted independently by four authors. Items that could be fitted into TIDieR were identified, and new categories were developed for those items that did not fit the existing template. A revised TIDieR-PHP reporting template was created through an iterative process of incorporating items into the draft template and testing them against additional interventions. Findings: Six example intervention studies were selected for analysis, covering categories including incentive-based, regulatory, infrastructural, material benefits, systems and policy, and taxation and pricing interventions. Many population-level interventions have characteristics that do not fit well within the existing TIDieR framework, but affect intervention implementation and success. Attributes of PHP interventions not adequately captured include the policy and organisational setting of the intervention; political acceptability and relevant co-interventions; and key features of the dose involved (eg, for interventions offering transfer payments or imposing sanctions). Interpretation: This preliminary stage of the development of TIDieR-PHP found that important features of population-level interventions might not be easily captured by existing guidelines. TIDieR-PHP aims to provide guidance for <b>reporting</b> <b>population</b> health and policy interventions so that learning from population health research is maximised. It will be further developed via a modified Delphi survey...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary The {{activities}} of large, internationally active financial institutions have grown increasingly complex and diverse in recent years. This increasing complexity has necessarily {{been accompanied by}} a process of innovation in how these institutions measure and monitor their exposure to different kinds of risk. One set of risk management techniques that has attracted {{a great deal of}} attention over the past several years, both among practitioners and regulators, is "stress testing", which can be loosely defined as the examination of the potential effects on a firm’s financial condition of a set of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible events. This report represents the findings of a Working Group on Macro Stress Testing established by the Committee on the Global Financial System. The group was asked to investigate the current use of stress testing at large financial institutions, in line with the Committee’s overall mandate to improve central banks’ understanding of institutional developments relevant to global financial stability. The term "macro" in the group’s name indicates another element of the group’s mandate, namely to explore the possibility that aggregating financial firms’ stress test results might produce information that is of use to central banks, other financial regulators, and private-sector practitioners. Members of the group interviewed risk managers at more than twenty large, internationally active financial institutions, both in their home countries and as a group at a meeting hosted by the Banque de France. From these interviews, the group gained a substantial base of knowledge on the current "state of the art" in the design and implementation of stress tests and on the role of stress testing in risk management decisions at the corporate level. Drawing on this knowledge, the group then considered some of the issues relating to the aggregation of the results of stress tests conducted at different financial firms. The group concluded that, under ideal circumstances, aggregate stress tests could potentially provide useful information in a number of areas. Aggregate stress tests might be used by financial firms to help make ex ante assessments of market liquidity risk under stress when evaluating the riskiness of a trading strategy. Central banks and financial regulators might use them to more effectively monitor broad patterns of risk-taking and risk-intermediation in financial markets. However, the group also noted that it is as yet unclear whether such ideal circumstances prevail. In particular, it is unclear whether an appropriate <b>reporting</b> <b>population</b> can be assembled, whether the stress tests currently conducted by financial firms are compatible with one another, and whether the information obtained would justify the reporting burden. The report concludes that stress testing is likely to remain an important element of the risk management strategies of large financial firms, and that further information about stress testing practices could prove informative regarding the vulnerabilities faced by the financial system. Accordingly, the report recommends that a one-off survey of the scenarios currently used by risk managers be conducted. The report is organised as follows. The first chapter summarises current practices in stress testing and discusses some of its limitations. Chapter 2 of the report examines the potential usefulness of aggregate stress tests, discusses the methodologies that could be used to construct aggregate stress tests and gives a preliminary discussion of the trade-offs that would be involved in an aggregate stress testing program. Chapter 3 presents and discusses the proposed census of scenarios. There are three annexes to the report: a bibliography, a conceptual discussion of what aggregate stress tests might tell us about market liquidity risk, and a discussion of the issues raised by the dynamic aspects of market behaviour under stress. ...|$|E
