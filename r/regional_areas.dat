Methods: Data were collected from a School Dental Service based in an Aboriginal-owned medical health service and standard school dental clinics in the <b>regional</b> <b>area</b> from March 2001 to March 2006. State-level data were obtained over a 12 -month period in 2003. Caries prevalence (per cent dmft or DMFT > 0) and severity (mean dmft or DMFT, SiC and SiC 10) measures {{were used to assess}} dental disease experience. Results: In the <b>regional</b> <b>area,</b> Indigenous children aged 0, mean dmft, SiC primary and SiC 10 primary, respectively, of their non-Indigenous counterparts, while Indigenous children aged 6 + years had 1. 3, 1. 7, 1. 7 and 1. 6 times the percent DMFT > 0, mean DMFT, SiC permanent and SiC 10 permanent, respectively, of non-Indigenous children. Indigenous children in the <b>regional</b> <b>area</b> had significantly higher caries prevalence and severity than Indigenous children at a state-level. Conclusion: Indigenous children in South Australia’s mid-north region are dentally disadvantaged in comparison with their non-Indigenous counterparts and with the general South Australian Indigenous child population.
