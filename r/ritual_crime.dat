5000|$|A {{few months}} before a car of faith held in Avila in which three {{converts}} and two Jews condemned by the Inquisition were burnt alive for an alleged crime of <b>ritual</b> <b>crime</b> against a Christian child (who will {{be known as the}} of the Guard contributed to create the propitious environment for the expulsion.The Catholic Kings had precisely entrusted to the general Tomás de Torquemada and its collaborators the writing of the decree fixing to them, according to the historian Luis Suarez, three previous conditions Which would be reflected in the document: to justify the expulsion by charging Jews with two sufficiently serious offenses - usury and [...] "heretical practice"; That there should be sufficient time for Jews to choose between baptism or exile; And that those who remained faithful to the Mosaic law could dispose of their movable and immovable property, although with the provisos established by the laws-they could not draw either gold, silver, or horses. Torquemada presented the draft decree to the kings on March 20, 1492, and the monarchs signed and published it in Granada on March 31. According to Joseph Perez, that the kings commissioned the drafting of the decree to Torquemada [...] "demonstrates the leading role of Inquisition in that matter." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{dragging}} on of {{the proceedings}} attracted general attention. The country was greatly agitated. A number of pamphlets appealed to the passions of the people, and attempted to establish the guilt of the accused. Lajos Kossuth, then living in exile at Turin, raised his powerful voice to castigate {{the action of the}} authorities and to deprecate this stirring up of anti-Jewish prejudices. The suspicion of ritual murder, he considered, was a disgrace to Hungary; to present as a racial crime or as a <b>ritual</b> <b>crime</b> a murder which at the worst was an individual one was, he said, unworthy of modern civilization. This cry of indignation from the veteran patriot was strangely in contrast with the fury of persecution and prejudice which raged throughout the country and which was echoed in the House of Deputies. An interpellation addressed to the minister of justice by the deputy Ernő Mezei in November 1882, called forth exciting scenes. The attorney-general Havas was then sent to Nyíregyháza, and he found that, despite the official declaration of the examining judge, the accused had not had a single hearing. He released some prisoners; but, realizing he was hampered by powerful influences in his endeavor to accelerate the affair, he offered his resignation, which was readily accepted.|$|E

5000|$|Wilton {{was accused}} of being a right-wing antisemite. He was a proponent of blood libel, {{claiming}} in his 1920 book The Last Days of the Romanovs that the execution of the Romanovs was a ritual murder by the Jews. [...] He was criticized by several liberal British journalists for supporting the attempted military coup by Lavr Kornilov. In 1919 he published [...] "Russia's Agony", which claimed (p. ix) that [...] "Bolshevism is not Russian - it is essentially non-national, its leaders being almost entirely in the race Jews that lost its country and its nationhood long ago". According to Semyon Reznik, Wilton also assisted Russian antisemites in fabrication of photographic evidence of <b>ritual</b> <b>crimes</b> by Jews.|$|R
5000|$|Julio Valdeón {{affirms that}} the {{decision}} of the Catholic Monarchs, who [...] "showed themselves, in their first years of rule, clearly protective of the Hebrews," [...] was due to [...] "pressure from the rest of Christianity" [...] and to [...] "the constant pressure of Church, who often preached against those he called [...] "deicides", as well as the [...] "tremendous animosity that existed in the Christian people against the Jewish community." [...] In this sense he quotes the thesis of the Israeli historian Benzion Netanyahu that the expulsion was the consequence of the climate of racism that was lived in the Christian society of the time. A thesis the latter - that the kings decided the expulsion to ingratiate themselves with the masses in which the anti-Jewish sentiments predominated - that Joseph Perez considers without foundation. [...] "Why should kings have to worry about what the masses felt about Jews and converts when they did not serve the more concrete interests of those masses?" [...] Of the three surviving versions of the expulsion edict, only the third term [...] "usury", which was signed only by Don Fernando, refers to the subject of usury, in very harsh terms, and in the other two versions we do not read a single mention or even the slightest mention of this matter. Accusations that had been repeated for centuries against the Jews: people deicide, desecration of hosts, <b>ritual</b> <b>crimes</b> ... do not appear in any of the three versions." ...|$|R
