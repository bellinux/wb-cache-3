40|$|This project {{entails the}} design and {{development}} of a digitally controlled, modular electronic load. The proposed load is unique from existing designs because it has the added ability to increase its maximum current level by adding identical modules in parallel. Each module is designed to sink a maximum of 5 A at 60 V but more modules allow for more current. The cost and simplicity of the design are considered such {{that it can be}} reproduced in-house to replace, whenever possible, the <b>resistor</b> <b>box</b> for load testing of any analog circuits but more specifically power electronic circuits. The design process as well as the hardware development is explained in detail in this report. Results from hardware testing are also provided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an experiment in an electrical power systems laboratory using Hall tension and current sensors, an A/D board and the LabVIEW software (National Instruments) to monitor electrical variables, and to calculate and analyze the power, energy and power factor of a mini power system in low tension. The minisystem contains synchronous generators of 2 kVA- 220 V, a transmission line model with reactors and capacitors, and a <b>resistor</b> <b>box</b> to represent a passive charge or an induction motor. The A/D board allows the control of digital outputs, which in turn, can control contactors that switch on or off elements of the circuit under analysis. A program was developed in four main screens: the first screen enables the monitoring of and intervention in the experimental assembly; the second shows the waveform of the signals monitored in the minisystem with their respective harmonics; the third screen shows the phasor graphs of all current and tension signals simultaneously; the fourth and last screen provides a virtual synchronoscope, allowing the analysis of tension and frequency adjustments in the parallelism operation of the minisystem with the local power company. The program allows remote access to the experimental assembly of the mini power system from the computers installed on each laboratory bench. With the experiment, the concepts studied in theory are consolidated. A set of new and future implementations are presented too...|$|E
25|$|A {{resistance}} decade <b>box</b> or <b>resistor</b> substitution <b>box</b> is a unit containing resistors of many values, {{with one}} or more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete resistances offered by the box to be dialed in. Usually the resistance is accurate to high precision, ranging from laboratory/calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inexpensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient way of selecting and quickly changing a resistance in laboratory, experimental and development work without needing to attach resistors one by one, or even stock each value. The range of resistance provided, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one box offers resistances from 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resolution 0.1 ohm, accuracy 0.1%.|$|R
40|$|Multi-gate FET, e. g. FinFET {{devices are}} the most {{promising}} contenders to replace bulk FETs in sub- 45 nm CMOS technologies due to their improved sub threshold and short channel behavior, associated with low leakage currents. The introduction of novel gate stack materials (e. g. metal gate, high-k dielectric) and modified device architectures (e. g. fully depleted, undoped fins) affect the analog device properties significantly. First measurements indicate enhanced intrinsic gain (gm/gDS) and promising matching behavior of FinFETs. The resulting benefits regarding the speed-accuracy-power trade-off in analog circuit design will be shown in this work. Additionally novel device specific effects will be discussed. The hysteresis effect caused by charge trapping in high-k dielectrics or self-heating due to the high thermal <b>resistor</b> of the <b>BOX</b> isolation are possible challenges for analog design in these emerging technologies. To gain an early assessment {{of the impact of}} such parasitic effects SPICE based models are derived and applied in analog building blocks...|$|R
