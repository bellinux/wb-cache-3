Diversity of new medical diagnostic problems urges the development of special data mining methods. The latter, although based on different theoretical ideas from mathematics, statistics, and artificial intelligence, mainly are developed experimenting with real world data. To guarantee sufficiently wide applicability of the developed methods, experimentation should be performed with the databases representing <b>relevant</b> <b>populations</b> of patients. The present paper concerns the problem of compatibility of various medical databases related to the heart rate analysis aimed to diagnostics of sleep disorders...|$|R

Mathematically, the g factor is a source of variance among individuals, which entails that one cannot meaningfully speak of any one individual's mental abilities consisting of g or other factors to any specified degrees.

Almost every naturally occurring comparison group, however, will differ from the composition of a non-random treatment group, usually because of selection bias (outside of an experiment, people choose to receive the treatment or choose not to).
