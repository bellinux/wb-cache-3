25|$|<b>Redlining</b> is the {{practice}} of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. The most devastating form of <b>redlining,</b> and the most common use of the term, refers to mortgage discrimination. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation {{was a product of}} collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Redlining</b> is the {{practice}} of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination. Racial profiling or <b>redlining</b> {{has a long history}} in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.|$|E

25|$|Discriminatory laws such as <b>redlining</b> {{have existed}} in many countries. In some countries, {{controversial}} attempts such as racial quotas {{have been used}} to redress negative effects of discrimination.|$|E
25|$|All {{states have}} {{provisions}} in their rate regulation laws {{or in their}} fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination, often called <b>redlining,</b> in setting rates and making insurance available.|$|E
25|$|Before the Act was passed, {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of credit available to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In their 1961 report, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that African-American borrowers were often {{required to make}} higher downpayments and adopt faster repayment schedules. The commission also documented blanket refusals to lend in particular areas (<b>redlining).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Redline</b> Bicycles: September 1994-December 1998. This was {{the third}} {{association}} with <b>Redline.</b> He was also the team manager at this time. Greg Hill would return to <b>Redline</b> for a fourth time, this time in a non racing capacity in Late September 1999 driving the <b>Redline</b> factory truck nationals, and promoting his company Sinister Steering Systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Redline</b> Engineering: September 1984-December 1986. His {{first race}} for <b>Redline</b> was the USBA Southern California National in Azusa, California on October 28, 1984. He left under bad circumstances. <b>Redline</b> {{allegedly}} had a verbal agreement with Scott to race another year as their only pro. However, {{with the coming}} of Greg Hill Scott departed <b>Redline.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Redlining</b> {{has helped}} {{preserve}} segregated living patterns {{for blacks and}} whites in the United States because discrimination motivated by prejudice is often contingent on the racial composition of neighborhoods where the loan is sought and {{the race of the}} applicant. Lending institutions have been shown to treat black mortgage applicants differently when buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Though Italians in Philadelphia would {{experience}} {{high levels of}} discrimination and prejudice (including intense <b>redlining),</b> Italians in Philadelphia also significantly altered the city's culture and cuisine, creating the Italian Market, the cheesesteak, the hoagie, and water ice, and introducing pizza and other Italian cuisine to the city. Italian and Irish immigrants and their children in South Philadelphia also revived, altered, and continued the Philadelphia tradition of the Mummers Parade.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{responsibilities}} may include: daily {{operations of}} field work activities {{and organization of}} subcontractors; coordination of {{the implementation of a}} project, ensuring it is being built correctly; project schedules and forecasts; interpretation of drawings for tradesmen; review of engineering deliverables; <b>redlining</b> drawings; regular project status reports; budget monitoring and trend tracking; bill of materials creation and maintenance; effective communications between engineering, technical, construction, and project controls groups; and assistance to the project manager.|$|E
50|$|<b>Redline</b> Bicycles/Troy Lee Designs/Maxxis: October 3, 2006-Present. De Wilde {{is under}} {{contract}} with <b>Redline</b> Bicycles (now {{owned by the}} Accell Group, a Dutch company) through 2008 and will race the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China sponsored by <b>Redline.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Redline</b> Engineering: March 3 to March 10, 1984. Very {{briefly with}} <b>Redline</b> and {{only on the}} support team at this time. He {{never got a chance}} to wear the <b>Redline</b> uniform however before {{accepting}} a better offer from Huffy Corporation.|$|R
50|$|Also {{there will}} be one {{appearance}} package available on the Equinox know as the <b>Redline</b> Edition. The <b>Redline</b> Edition is only available on the LT trim without the panoramic sunroof or diesel engine. The <b>Redline</b> Edition will be available in October 2017.|$|R
25|$|The largest influxes of {{minority}} populations occurred during World War II, as the African American population grew {{by a factor}} of 10 for wartime work. After World War II, the Vanport flood in 1948 displaced many African Americans. As they resettled, <b>redlining</b> directed the displaced workers from the wartime settlement to neighboring Albina. There and elsewhere in Portland, they experienced police hostility, lack of employment, and mortgage discrimination, leading to half the black population leaving after the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} practices of <b>redlining,</b> mortgage discrimination, and racially restrictive covenants {{contributed to the}} overcrowding and physical deterioration of areas where minorities chose to congregate. Such conditions are considered to {{have contributed to the}} emigration of other populations. The limited facilities for banking and insurance, due to a perceived lack of profitability, and other social services, and extra fees meant to hedge against perceived profit issues increased their cost to residents in predominantly non-white suburbs and city neighborhoods. According to the environmental geographer Laura Pulido, the historical processes of suburbanization and urban decentralization contribute to contemporary environmental racism.|$|E
25|$|Detroit {{remains one}} of the most racially {{segregated}} cities in the United States. From the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of Blacks moved to Detroit to escape Jim Crow laws in the south and find jobs. However, they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city—through violence, laws, and economic discrimination (e.g., <b>redlining).</b> White residents attacked black homes: breaking windows, starting fires, and exploding bombs. The pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs. One of the implications of racial segregation, which correlates with class segregation, may be overall worse health for some populations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Redline</b> {{was founded}} in 1999. <b>Redline's</b> first product, the AN-50 {{point-to-point}} wireless Ethernet bridge, was launched in February 2002.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{cars have}} {{computer}} systems that prevent the engine from straying too {{far into the}} <b>redline</b> by cutting fuel flow to the fuel injectors/fuel rail (in a direct-injected engine)/carburetor or by disabling the ignition system until the engine drops to a safer operating speed. This device {{is known as a}} rev limiter and is usually set to an RPM value at <b>redline</b> or a few hundred RPM above. Most Electronic Control Units (ECUs) of automatic transmission cars will upshift before the engine hits the <b>redline</b> even with maximum acceleration (The ECU in a sports car's automatic transmission will allow the engine to go nearer the <b>redline</b> or hit the <b>redline</b> before upshifting). If manual override is used, the engine may go past <b>redline</b> for a brief amount of time before the ECU will auto-upshift. When the car is in top gear and the engine is in <b>redline</b> (due to high speed), the ECU will cut fuel to the engine, forcing it to decelerate until the engine begins operating below the <b>redline</b> at which point it will release fuel back to the engine, allowing it to speed operate once again.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the Works Progress Administration dubbed the area “the Park Avenue for the Middle Class”, {{and the area}} {{maintained}} that reputation through the 1950s. The Concourse inspired visits by presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and John F. Kennedy. However, after 1960, the area began to decline quickly due to white flight, incentives {{to move to the}} suburbs, <b>redlining,</b> the development of Co-Op City, disinvestment by New York City, and arson. While no buildings burned down in the Concourse during the period, the population of the area declined until the 1990s when the population started to rebound.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, white {{residents}} in several neighborhoods {{left the city}} for the suburban areas – in many Northern American cities, a process known as white flight – as African Americans continued to move beyond the Black Belt. While home loan discriminatory <b>redlining</b> against blacks continued, the real estate industry practiced what became known as blockbusting, completely changing the racial composition of whole neighborhoods. Structural changes in industry, such as globalization and job outsourcing, caused heavy job losses for lower skilled workers. In 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Albert Raby led the Chicago Freedom Movement, which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J. Daley and the movement leaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} of <b>redlining</b> and the stabilization {{of the real}} estate market in the late 1970s and the redevelopment of the Southwest Corridor set the stage for gentrification that began in the 1990s. A hot real estate market has driven dramatic increases in the value of older homes in the Parkside, Pondside and Sumner Hill neighborhoods and conversion of some larger residential properties and older commercial buildings into condominia. Numerous formerly vacant structures are being converted to residential use, among them the ABC Brewery, the Gormley Funeral Home, the Eblana Brewery, the Oliver Ditson Company, 319 Centre Street, Jackson Square, JP Cohousing, Blessed Sacrament, Our Lady of the Way, and 80 Bickford Street.|$|E
50|$|<b>Redlines</b> vary {{anywhere}} from a few hundred revolutions per minute (rpm) (in very large engines {{such as those in}} trains and generators) to more than 10,000 rpm (in smaller, usually high-performance engines such as motorcycles and sports cars with pistonless rotary engines). Diesel engines normally have lower <b>redlines</b> than comparatively sized gasoline engines, largely because of fuel-atomization limitations. Gasoline automobile engines typically will have a <b>redline</b> at around 5500 to 7000 rpm. The Ariel Atom 500 has the highest <b>redline</b> of a piston-engine road car rated at 10,600. The Renesis in the Mazda RX-8 has the highest <b>redline</b> of a production rotary-engine road car rated at 9000 rpm.|$|R

Based on the SXT Plus trim, the Rallye <b>Redline</b> package includes unique exterior accents, Black chrome 20-inch wheels with <b>Redline</b> Red accents, performance suspension and brakes, a 3.06 rear-axle ratio and available Radar Red Nappa leather interior.|$|R
50|$|<b>Redline</b> Coaches {{was formed}} in July 1963 when Frank Larissey {{purchased}} Sutton's Motor Service, Launceston with four buses and renamed it <b>Redline</b> Coaches.|$|R
25|$|In the 20th century, many {{suburban}} areas, {{especially those}} {{not within the}} political boundaries of the city containing the central business area, began to see independence from the central city as an asset. In some cases, suburbanites saw self-government {{as a means to}} keep out people who could not afford the added suburban property maintenance costs not needed in city living. Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of <b>redlining</b> by banks and other lending institutions. In some cities such as Miami and San Francisco, the main city is much smaller than the surrounding suburban areas, leaving the city proper with {{a small portion of the}} metro area's population and land area.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} is {{the practice}} of identifying the social characteristics of an individual based on auditory cues, in particular dialect and accent. The theory was first developed by Professor John Baugh to explain discriminatory practices {{in the housing market}} based on the auditory <b>redlining</b> of prospective clientele by housing administrators. Linguistic profiling extends to issues of legal proceedings, employment opportunities, and education. The theory is frequently described as the auditory equivalent of racial profiling. The bulk of the research and evidence in support of the theory pertain to racial and ethnic distinctions, though its applicability holds within racial or ethnic groups, perceived gender and sexual orientation, and in distinguishing location of geographic origin.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} law school, Kaine {{was a law}} clerk for Judge R. Lanier Anderson III of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in Macon, Georgia. Kaine then joined the Richmond law firm of Little, Parsley & Cluverius, P.C. In 1987, Kaine became a {{director}} with {{the law firm of}} Mezzullo & McCandlish, P.C. Kaine practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, specializing in fair housing law and representing clients discriminated against {{on the basis of race}} or disability. He was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal, which he represented in a landmark <b>redlining</b> discrimination lawsuit against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. arising from the company's practices in Richmond. Kaine won a $100.5 million verdict in the case; the judgment was overturned on appeal, and Kaine and his colleagues negotiated a $17.5 million settlement.|$|E
