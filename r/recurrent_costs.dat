40|$|Background: Detailed cost {{analysis}} {{is an important}} tool for review of health policy and reforms. We provide an estimate of cost of service and its detailed breakup on out-door patient visits (OPV) to basic health units (BHU) in Pakistan. Method: Six BHUs {{were randomly selected from}} each of the five districts in Khyber Pukhtonkhawa (KPK) and two agencies in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan for this study. Actual expenditure data and utilization data in the year 2005 – 06 of 42 BHUs was collected from selected district health offices in KPK and FATA. Costs were estimated for outpatient visits to BHUs. Perspective on cost estimates was district-based health planning and management of BHUs. Results:Average recurring cost was PKR. 245 (USD 4. 1) per OPV to BHU. Staff salaries constituted 90 % of <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost.</b> On the average there were 16 OPV per day to the BHUs. Conclusion: <b>Recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> per OPV has doubled from the previous estimates of cost of OPV in Baluchistan. The estimated <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> was six times higher than average consultation charges with the private general practitioner (GP) in the country (i. e.,PKR 50 / GP consultation). Performance of majority of the BHUs was much lower than the performance target (50 patients per day) set in the sixth five - year plan of the government of Pakistan.

50|$|Before 1994, the Italian {{water and}} {{sanitation}} sector was highly fragmented with about 13,000 local {{water and sanitation}} service providers, often providing water and sewer services separately in the same locality. Municipalities were both service providers and regulators, creating a conflict of interest. Investments were typically financed through government susbsidies, while <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> of service provision were covered by tariff revenues. Tariffs were accordingly much lower than for example in France or in Germany. Furthermore, Italian utilities often provided and still do provide water at public fountains for free. However, because of high debt levels the government was less and less able to provide the subsidies to maintain the existing infrastructure and to improve service quality. The latter was particularly poor in Southern Italy where water supply was often intermittent. Furthermore, wastewater was often being discharged without treatment or with insufficient treatment. In order {{to comply with the}} EU Wastewater Directive of 1991, new expensive investments in wastewater treatment were necessary in addition to investments needed to maintain the ageing infrastructure. These investments were to be financed by the water service providers using their own resources instead of government subsidies. In order to make this possible, on the one hand tariffs were to be increased. On the other hand, service providers were to become more efficient, reducing <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> and non-revenue water so that a higher share of their revenues would become available for investments to maintain and improve service quality. Investments in wastewater treatment and bulk water supply were to be planned in a more rational way within the boundaries of river basins. Furthermore, fragmented service provision by municipalities was to be consolidated in regional utilities that were expected to be more efficient. Each local government on its own would not give up the responsibility for water supply, and mayors were reluctant to increase water tariffs for fear of losing votes. Therefore, the national government prepared a law that would force municipalities to regroup themselves and form regional utilities, as well as to achieve cost recovery from tariff revenues. Under the planned law, regional governments would have an important role in setting the geographic boundaries of the new regional utilities.|$|E

MethodsThree different types of data collection approaches were used, namely, 1) observation checklist, 2) in-depth interviews, and 3) expenditure data review. Wound dressing processes were observed. Retrospective health facility cost data of Buruli ulcer (BU) wound treatment for the year 2011 were used. Cost data gathered covered medical and nonmedical items. Cost analyses were carried out to determine the health facility’s financial and economic costs. ResultsThe total annual financial cost was US $ 121, 189. 16, of which 99 % was <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost.</b> This constitutes about 13 % of the expenditure by the Amasaman Government Hospital for the year 2011. The total annual economic cost was US $ 143, 609. 22, of which 93 % was <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost.</b> The main cost driver for both financial and economic costs was personnel. The annual BU wound treatment costs per capita were US $ 1615. 86 for financial cost and US $ 1914. 79 for economic cost, respectively. The study did not cover household patient costs. ConclusionsThe cost of BU wound treatment takes {{a considerable amount of}} the hospital’s expenditure. This shows the importance of health facility cost as one of the decision-making tools for both resource allocation and mobilization. Hospital management must therefore constantly examine its staffing norms and the associated cost to improve the hospital’s resource allocation...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the existing literature, which explains the <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> problem as largely the result of institutional impediments to LDC welfare maximization, this paper analyzes the problem by constructing a series of scenarios in which the less developed country would be led to reduce the flow of recurrent inputs to a development project {{in order to maximize}} its own welfare. A distinction is drawn between situations in which the project design is correct ex ante, and those in which it is wrong ex ante. If the project design is correct ex ante, then the recipient country which deviates from the project design does so at a cost to its own welfare unless {{one or more of the}} assumptions embodied in the project design have turned out to be false. This paper develops a typology of the possible "surprises" that could lead a host country to reduce recurrent input to a project in order to maximize social welfare. It is proposed that donors use such a typology to help determine the true cause of recurrent input reduction in any given instance. An alternative possible reason for the host country to reduce recurrent inputs to a project is that the project was incorrectly designed in the first place: i. e. the project design could be wrong ex ante. The paper uses a simple model of donor and recipient nation objectives to describe the contractarian relationship between the two nations with respect to the project design and implementation process. According to the model, the donor and recipient countries have a common interest in the output of the development project, but their interests are not identical. In the situation described by the model, both nations have an incentive to agree to a project design that is wrong ex ante. Subsequently the LDC’s reduction of recurrent input can be viewed as its attempt to do the best it can given the inappropriate project with which it is saddled. The analysis is illustrated with a modified Edgeworth-Bowley box diagram. Finally, the paper demonstrates that, like the free-rider problem, the <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> problem can be formulated as a variety of the “prisoner’s dilemma” game form. This observation leads to several policy recommendations for the resolution of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> problem which are analogous to the solutions that have been developed for the general free-rider problem as it is characterized by the prisoner’s dilemma. The paper concludes by summarizing the major policy recommendations of the analysis and by discussing some of the possible difficulties that would arise in attempting to implement the recommended policies. ...|$|R

He outlined his vision of how primary health care could be revitalized by generating funds in communities through the sales of drugs at a price considerably higher than cost.Following this speech, the African ministers of health present at the meeting adopted a resolution in which they called for the acceleration of primary health care by: * defining and implementing self-financing mechanisms at district level * encouraging social mobilization and * ensuring a regular supply of drugs. Positive experience with revolving drug funds was cited as a reason for the implementation of community financing mechanisms that rely on revenue out of the sales of drugs.|$|E

Subsequently, the corrosion performances of various inhibitors were evaluated in stirred vessels. Corrosion rates were determined via mass loss and electrochemical methods (i. e., linear polarisation, Tafel). It was observed that inhibitors based upon chromate provide superior protection under the conditions investigated in this study. In lime treated, high chloride waters, chromate gave over 80 % protection at levels of 10 100 ppm with no evidence of pitting...|$|R
