25|$|The {{provisional}} {{election results}} were announced at 18:30 (UTC+2) on June 12, 2011. The official election <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> announced when all votes are counted.|$|E
25|$|Election {{results are}} {{announced}} through live broadcasts by {{radio and television}} stations. Some newspapers print special editions to cover the election results.

In some rural constituencies and constituencies that need recounts, the results may not be announced until the next day.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the public}} has to choose one winning {{existing}} slogan out of 4 current slogans. CANBERRA - THE NATION'S CAPITAL, CANBERRA-AGE FRIENDLY CITY, FEEL THE POWER OF CANBERRA and the Parliament House logo. The losing 3 slogans will then be phased out once the new slogan plates will be manufactured {{in the middle of}} 2017. <b>Results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> announced in March 2017.|$|E

25|$|Double-blind {{methods can}} be applied to any {{experimental}} situation {{in which there is a}} possibility that the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> affected by conscious or unconscious bias on the part of researchers, participants, or both. For example, in animal studies, both the carer of the animals and the assessor of the results have to be blinded; otherwise the carer might treat control subjects differently and alter the results.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{collaboration}} {{can help}} to reduce costs dramatically. Firms can release a specific software or product to be evaluated or debugged by online communities. The <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more personal, robust and error-free products created in {{a short amount of}} time and costs. New ideas can also be generated and explored by collaboration of online communities creating opportunities for free R outside the confines of the company.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 {{the same}} company started a project to use 23,000 liters of water in a {{seasonal}} storage tank, heated up by evacuated solar tubes throughout the year, with the aim to provide the house with enough heat throughout the winter months thus {{eliminating the need for}} any electrical heat to keep the house comfortably warm. The system is monitored and documented by a research team from The University of Ulster and the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> included in part of a PhD thesis.|$|E

25|$|A small {{investment}} fund can potentially yield a higher return {{because it can}} concentrate its investments in {{a small number of}} good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large {{investment fund}} must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> closer to market average.|$|E
25|$|Three leading cricket sides - England, Ireland and the West Indies - do not {{correspond}} to Olympic national teams, a problem also faced in rugby and association football. The United Kingdom competes at the Olympics as Great Britain with athletes from England, Scotland, Wales and those British Overseas Territories without their own Olympic team. Athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to represent either Great Britain or Ireland. In cricket, Scotland has its own team, Welsh players play for the England team, and the Ireland team represents the Republic and Northern Ireland together. In rugby, Team GB have to nominate one Home Nations team whose <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> used to determine whether Great Britain as a whole qualifies for the Olympics, but players from all the Home Nations can play for the combined team according to the usual Olympic rules.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April 2009, Voronin {{called on}} the Constitutional Court of Moldova to {{authorise}} a recount of the votes. On 12 April 2009, it decided {{that there would be}} a recount. The recount was then set to take place on 15 April 2009. On 14 April, Serafim Urechean announced that the three main opposition parties would boycott the recount, citing fears that the government would use it to increase its majority to the 61 seats required to elect the next president. The recount is scheduled to finish by 16 April 2009 and <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> submitted by 21 April 2009 to the CEC. The result of the election was not changed through the recount, as no serious errors were determined. The opposition maintain that the ballot was rigged, saying that recounting fraudulent ballots could only yield fraudulent results.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E
25|$|Node lookups {{can proceed}} asynchronously. The {{quantity}} of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes {{in its own}} k-buckets that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, they will look in their k-buckets and return the k closest nodes to the desired key that they know. The requester will update a results list with the results (node ID's) he receives, keeping the k best ones (the k nodes that are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these k best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Because every node has a better knowledge of his own surroundings than any other node has, the received <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> other nodes that are every time {{closer and closer to}} the searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer than the best previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are the ones in the whole network that are the closest to the desired key.|$|E
500|$|Harrison played [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as {{an encore}} {{at both of}} the Madison Square Garden shows on 1 August 1971, with the evening {{performance}} being selected for inclusion on the Concert for Bangladesh triple live album. After the familiar introduction to the song, the band [...] "threw their full weight behind Harrison", Lavezzoli writes, [...] "playing the darkest and heaviest music of the show". On release that December, Jon Landau of Rolling Stone identified the song as [...] "the concert's single greatest performance by all concerned", and added that by {{the close of the}} show, the lyrics to Harrison's single were [...] "no longer an expression of intent but of an accomplished mission – help has been given, people have been reached, an effort has been made and <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> felt".|$|E

500|$|A {{red flag}} is shown when {{there has been}} an {{accident}} or the track conditions are poor enough to warrant the race being stopped. The flags are displayed by the marshals at various points around the circuit. A Global Positioning System (GPS) marshalling system was introduced in 2007. It involves a display of flag signals in the driver's cockpit, which alerts them to the accident. Following a red flag being shown, the exit of the pit lane is closed and cars must proceed to the pit lane slowly without overtaking, lining up at the pit exit. From 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane. Previously, the race was restarted in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown. If a race is unable to be resumed, [...] "the <b>results</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> taken {{at the end of the}} penultimate lap before the lap during which the signal to suspend the race was given". If 75 per cent of the race distance has not been completed and the race cannot be resumed, half points are awarded. No points are awarded if the race cannot be restarted and less than two laps have been completed.|$|E

2500|$|Stem {{cells have}} been used in a {{clinical}} trial for lens regeneration in twelve {{children under the age of}} two [...] with cataracts present at birth.
