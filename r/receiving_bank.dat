50|$|Wire {{transfer}}: A {{wire transfer}} is an electronic transfer of funds. Wire transfers {{can be done}} by a simple bank account transfer, or by a transfer of cash at a cash office. Bank wire transfers are often the most expedient method for transferring funds between bank accounts. A bank wire transfer is a message to the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> requesting them to effect payment in accordance with the instructions given. The message also includes settlement instructions. The actual wire transfer itself is virtually instantaneous, requiring no longer for transmission than a telephone call.|$|E

50|$|Formally {{known as}} the Federal Reserve Wire Network, Fedwire is a {{real-time}} gross settlement funds transfer system operated by the United States Federal Reserve Banks that enables financial institutions to electronically transfer funds between its more than 9,289 participants (as of March 19, 2009). Transfers can only be initiated by the sending bank once they receive the proper wiring instructions from the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank.</b> These instructions include: the receiving bank's routing number, account number, name and dollar amount being transferred. This information is submitted to the Fed via the Fedwire system. Once the instructions are received and processed, the Fed will debit the funds from the sending bank's reserve account and credit the receiving bank's account. Wire transfers sent via Fedwire are completed in the same day, while some are completed instantly.|$|E

50|$|To {{eliminate}} the need for collateral (the poor man's obstacle to <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> loans), village banks rely on a variation of the solidarity lending methodology. It relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure makes it possible for even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network. Village banks are highly democratic, self-managed, grassroots organizations. They elect their own leaders, select their own members, create their own bylaws, do their own bookkeeping, manage all funds, disburse and deposit all funds, resolve loan delinquency problems, and levy their own fines on members who come late, miss meetings, or fall behind in their payments.|$|E
5000|$|SWIFT or IBAN wire {{transfers}} are {{not completely}} free of vulnerabilities. Every intermediary bank that handles a wire transaction can take a fee directly out of the wire payload (the assets being transferred) without the account holder's knowledge or consent. In many places, there is no legislation or technical means to protect customers from this practice. If bank S is the sending bank (or brokerage), and bank R is the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> (or brokerage), and banks I1, I2 and I3 are intermediary banks, the client may only have a contract with bank S and/or R, but banks I1, I2 and I3 can (and often do) take money from the wire without any direct arrangement with the client. Clients are sometimes taken by surprise when less money arrives at bank R. Contrast this with cheques, where the amount transferred is guaranteed in full, and fees (if there are any) can be charged only at endpoint banks.|$|E
50|$|Interbank Clearing System {{started to}} {{function}} on May 7, 2001.

It is an interbank fund transfer system designed to handle a high volume of low-value payment transmitted from the originating bank to another <b>banks</b> (<b>receiving</b> <b>banks).</b> Currently, IBG is adopting batch processing where the electronic fund transfer can either be executed by job scheduler or manual human intervention. Almost everyday, there is delay from originating banks in submitting the IBG files to MEPS. At MEPS, the extension of time will result in non-efficient services and incur loss to the organization. This in-efficiency service, thus impact the MEPS distribution processes to <b>receiving</b> <b>banks</b> as per MEPS‘s Service Level Agreement (SLA). Since the inefficiency caused by the originating bank, the alternative is for MEPS to reduce the processing time by streamlining and automating the processes at MEPS.

40|$|A {{majority}} of the payments that are carried out today are executed through the electronic payment systems. Payments that are executed through these systems are administrated by payment service providers, these providers are, in general, banks. In spite of the socio-economic importance of payments and payment intermediation, there is an uncertainty regarding {{the legal status of}} payments and payment intermediation. Some describe payment intermediation as transport of means of payments, while some describe it in terms of claims and intermediation of information. There is, in other words, a need for clarification. Since the international trade is increasing, more and more payments are made to receivers abroad. The trade with Germany is very important for Sweden. Therefore, it can be an advantage for Swedish tradesmen, who are involved in businesses with German tradesmen, to know of the differences between Swedish and German law, when it comes to payments and payment intermediation. Also, in international trade, situations can occur that generally do not occur in domestic trade. EC-law must as well be taken into consideration, when discussing international payment intermediation between Sweden and Germany. I have in the thesis described the German legal system, in general features, and I have also made a brief outline of the Swedish international private law regulations that can be applied to a payment intermediation between Sweden and Germany. I have furthermore given {{a brief description of the}} relevant EC- regulations and -directives, in order to see to what extent a harmonization has been made, regarding payments and payment intermediation. One of my conclusions, after having studied Swedish, German and international law, is that when the sender of a payment wants to execute a payment through the payment systems, he gives the sending bank a commission to transfer a certain amount to the receiver. In return, the sender denounces claims towards the bank, equivalent to that amount. The sending bank then gives the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> a commission to credit the receiver’s account. In return, the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> obtains compensation from the sending bank. The commission is final when the correct account has been credited with the correct amount at the correct time by the correct sender. I have further come to the conclusion that the receiver’s claim towards the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> arises already when the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> acquires the commission from the sending bank, and not when the receiver’s account is being credited. I have thoroughly studied payments and payment intermediation according to both Swedish and German law, in order to see whether there are any differences between the legal systems. I have concluded, that there is a major difference in determining at what point of time a payment has been made, and therefore also whether the sender is in delay with the payment or not. According to Swedish law, the point of time when the receiver’s account is being credited is decisive. According to German law, at first hand, the point of time when the sender gives the commission to the sending bank is decisive. Another important difference is which legal relations the participators have with each other. In Swedish law, this matter has not been closely discussed, while in German law, in harmony with EC-law, the matter has been thoroughly analysed. The legal relations, concerning a payment intermediation, are to be regarded separately. This implies that the sender does not have legal relations with any other participant in the payment intermediation, for instance the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank.</b> I find that this model also is applicable to Swedish conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-period model to analyze why banks need bank reserves for interbank payments despite {{the availability of}} other liquid assets like Treasury securities. The model shows that banks need extra liquidity if they settle bank transfers without the central bank. In this case, each pair of banks sending and <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> transfers must determine the terms of settlement between them bilaterally in an over- the-counter transaction. As a result, a <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> can charge a sending bank a premium for the settlement of bank transfers, because depositors'demand for timely payments causes a hold-up problem for a sending bank. In light of this result, the large value payment system operated by the central bank {{can be regarded as}} an interbank settlement contract to save liquidity. A third party like the central bank must operate this system because a custodian of collateral is necessary to implement the contract. This result implies that bank reserves are not independent liquid assets, but the balances of collateral submitted by banks to participate into a liquidity-saving contract. The optimal contract is the floor system. Whether a private clearing house can replace the central bank depends on the range of collateral it can accept. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|E
40|$|In {{the normal}} course of {{business}} a bank accepts customer deposits that include checks and similar items drawn on other banks or institutions. The <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> passes those checks on to the institution on which they are drawn and receives cash (or credit for cash) in return (referred to as the "collection process"). The term deposit float refers to the amount of deposited items that the bank has accepted but has not yet collected. The universally followed practice until the end of 1983 had been for the <b>receiving</b> <b>bank</b> to reflect the deposited checks as liabilities to customers and as cash. In most cases, the bank pays interest from the date of deposit. Two financial institutions netted at least some portion of those amounts in their December 31, 1983 financial statements. One financial institution justified its accounting by asserting that it is merely an agent for the customer until the checks are collected and therefore has no liability or asset. The issues are (1) whether banks should be permitted to change their accounting to recognize assets and liabilities relating to customer deposits of checks only after funds have been collected from the drawee bank and (2) whether a change in the method of accounting for customer deposits would constitute an "accounting change " under Opinion 20.
