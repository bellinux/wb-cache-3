40|$|Abstract. The Klang {{river basin}} is {{located within the}} state of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Klang River drains an area of 1, 288 km 2 from the steep {{mountain}} rain forests of the main Central Range along Peninsular Malaysia to the <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> in <b>Port</b> Klang, covering a distance of 120 km. It originates from {{the northern part of}} Selangor, drains the Klang Valley, and finally discharges itself into the Straits of Malacca. The pollution discharges for various locations along the river basin was obtained from the Water Quality and GIS group. The pollutants can come from point sources (PS) such as industrial wastewater, municipal sewers, wet market, sand mining and landfill. Pollutants can also come from non-point sources (NPS) such as agricultural or urban runoff, and commercial activity such as forestry, and construction due to rainfall event. Mathematical–computational modeling of river water quality is possible but requires an extensive validation. Besides it requires previous knowledge of hydraulics and hydrodynamics. To overcome these difficulties, a water quality index (WQI) was developed. The water quality index (WQI) is a mathematical instrument used to transform large quantities of water quality data into a single number. The purpose of this research is to classify the upstream and downstream of the Klang main river based on WQI value...|$|R

In this paper, characteristic morphological change at the Naruse <b>River</b> <b>mouth</b> is shown with the use of aerial photographs and morphological maps. Furthermore, time-variation of water-level in the <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> is compared with tidal variation.

40|$|The {{shoreline}} analysis {{around the}} Nanakita <b>River</b> <b>mouth</b> has been performed by utilizing aerial photographs {{to reveal the}} different behavior between left and {{right side of the}} <b>river</b> <b>mouth.</b> The shoreline on left side of <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> has been moving more dynamically than the right side. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method is also applied on the shoreline data to reveal the behavior of shoreline change. The first mode of variability reflects the cross-shore movement which is shown by uniform advance and retreat movement along the beach. The shoreline change around the Nanakita <b>River</b> <b>mouth</b> is dominated by the cross-shore movement which is shown by around 80 % contribution of first mode. The second mode of variability depicts the longshore sediment movement which is shown by different shoreline movement between left and right side of <b>river</b> <b>mouth.</b> The longshore movement only contributes around 10 % to the shoreline change around the Nanakita <b>River</b> <b>mouth.</b> The second mode also reveals the influence of <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> to the longshore sediment transport characterized by different shoreline response between left and right side...|$|R

40|$|Occupation of {{the coast}} has {{significantly}} increased in recent decades, mostly due to a greater demand for recreation and tourism. Today, erosion threatens many human-made structures and activities, requiring an integrated approach for the understanding of coastal dynamics and identification of alternatives to associated problems. This study investigates a 64 km-long coastal physiographic unit in the northern microtidal littoral of Tuscany (Italy). Vertical aerial photographs and direct field surveys were used to retrieve changes in shoreline position over 1938 – 1997 and 1997 – 2005 time intervals. Significant beach accretion was observed during the first period updrift of Carrara (84 m) and Viareggio (280 m) harbours and at Marina di Pietrasanta (100 m), whereas severe erosion occurred downcoast of Carrara harbour (− 130 m, at Marina dei Ronchi) and on the northern side of Arno <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> (− 400 m). Similar trends were observed between 1997 and 2005; beach slope between the 1997 shoreline position and the closure depth correlated well with the distribution of erosion/accretion patterns from the 1938 – 1997 period (slopes were lower in eroded areas than at sites under accretion). Longshore distribution of erosion/accretion patterns was controlled by coastal compartmentalisation. Three of the main littoral cells were mostly formed by natural limits (i. e., Punta Bianca promontory, Marina di Pietrasanta, the Arno <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> and the <b>port</b> of Livorno). Several sub-cells were created within these cells due {{to the introduction of}} human-made structures (such as Carrara and Viareggio harbours), which formed artificial fixed limits that allowed the transport of sediments (exclusively fines) in one direction only. Results will help improve the understanding of coastal processes and manage littoral sediment transport in a sustainable manner. This will reduce the need for structural interventions, such as breakwaters and groynes, which in the past decades prevented coastal retreat at local scale but shifted erosion downdrift, leading to degradation of the investigated area and requiring continuous maintenance...|$|R
40|$|During the Holocene, the {{position}} of the Ashley <b>River</b> <b>mouth</b> has varied between 8 km south and 6. 5 km north of Waikuku. Northward migration of the <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> is a recurring process indicated by two major phases of migration since European settlement: 1900 - 1923 (when the <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> reached its northern limit); and 1979 - 1991. The pre- 1923 migration phase was terminated by a major flood event of the Ashley <b>River.</b> Historical <b>mouth</b> migration rates exceed 200 m per year. Survey results for the past 12 months indicate that the mouth migrated 150. 6 m. It is apparent that the rate of migration is lower than the mean rate for the past decade, perhaps indicating a slowing of <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> migration.

40|$|The Da Rang <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} rivers in the Southern Central Area of Vietnam and it has a typical lagoon type. It usually opens for 3 - 4 months during the rainy season and closes for 6 - 7 months during the dry season. In recent years, the {{topographic}} change of Da Rang <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> increases its rate with time. This phenomenon is governed by a micro-tidal regime and a wave dominant coastal dynamics. Strong seasonal variation of the river discharge and the incident wave climate are important factors. The closure of the <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> during the dry season causes a lot of problems to the socio-economic developments in the area including navigation and flood water discharging. This paper presents an analysis of the morpho-dynamics and the mechanism of seasonally and yearly topographic change of the Da Rang <b>river</b> <b>mouth,</b> which was affected by exogenous causes such as river floods, ocean waves and currents.

Sediment samples from 10 stations in the Kaohsiung <b>River</b> <b>mouth</b> were collected and characterized for Hg, aluminum, water content, organic matter, total grease, and grain size. The results show that samples collected at all monitoring stations near the <b>mouth</b> of Kaohsiung <b>River</b> contain 0. 15 – 1. 15 mg/kg of Hg with average of 0. 68 ± 0. 30 mg/kg. The spatial distribution of Hg reveals that the Hg concentration is relatively high in the <b>river</b> <b>mouth</b> region, and gradually diminishes toward the harbor region. This indicates that upstream industrial and municipal wastewater discharges along the river bank are major sources of pollution. The enrichment factor (EF) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo) indicate that the sediment at Kaohsiung <b>River</b> <b>mouth</b> has the moderately severe to severe degree enrichment and moderate to strong accumulation of Hg.
