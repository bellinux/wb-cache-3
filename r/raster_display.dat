25|$|A {{video game}} is an {{electronic}} game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback {{on a video}} device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a <b>raster</b> <b>display</b> device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.|$|E
2500|$|Color raster {{graphics}} display of molecular models began around 1978 {{as seen in}} this paper by Porter on spherical shading of atomic models. [...] Early raster molecular graphics systems displayed static images that could take around a minute to generate.

2500|$|Early {{interactive}} {{molecular computer}} graphics systems were vector graphics machines, which used stroke-writing vector monitors, sometimes even oscilloscopes. [...] The electron beam does not sweep left-and-right as in a <b>raster</b> <b>display.</b> [...] The display hardware followed a sequential list of digital drawing instructions (the display list), directly drawing {{at an angle}} one stroke for each molecular bond. [...] When the list was complete, drawing would begin again {{from the top of}} the list, so if the list was long (a large number of molecular bonds), the display would flicker heavily. [...] Later vector displays could rotate complex structures with smooth motion, since the orientation of all of the coordinates in the display list could be changed by loading just a few numbers into rotation registers in the display unit, and the display unit would multiply all coordinates in the display list by the contents of these registers as the picture was drawn.|$|E
40|$|Color {{computer}} graphics techniques were investigated {{as a means}} of rapidly scanning and interpreting large sets of transient heating data. The data presented were generated to support the conceptual design of a heat-sink thermal protection system (TPS) for a hypersonic research airplane. Color-coded vector and <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> of the numerical geometry used in the heating calculations were employed to analyze skin thicknesses and surface temperatures of the heat-sink TPS under a variety of trajectory flight profiles. Both vector and <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> proved to be effective means for rapidly identifying heat-sink mass concentrations, regions of high heating, and potentially adverse thermal gradients. The color-coded (<b>raster)</b> surface <b>displays</b> are a very efficient means for displaying surface-temperature and heating histories, and thereby the more stringent design requirements can quickly be identified. The related hardware and software developments required to implement both the vector and the <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> for this application are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Laser {{lighting}} display {{techniques are}} combined with computer emulation in the LaserMAME project. It is a vector-based system, unlike the <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> thus-far described.

50|$|Space Wars was {{the first}} arcade game to utilize black & white vector {{graphics}}, which enabled it to display sharp, crisp images. Space Wars had graphics which were far more detailed than the <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> of the time. Cinematronics shipped over 30,000 units and was a top seller in 1978.|$|R

50|$|Some refresh vector {{displays}} use {{a normal}} phosphor that fades rapidly and needs constant refreshing 30-40 times per second {{to show a}} stable image. These displays such as the Imlac PDS-1 require some local refresh memory to hold the vector endpoint data. Other storage tube displays such as the popular Tektronix 4010 use a special phosphor that continues glowing for many minutes. Storage displays do not require any local memory. In the 1970s, both types of vector displays were much more affordable than bitmap <b>raster</b> graphics <b>displays</b> when megapixel computer memory was still very expensive. Today, <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> have replaced nearly all uses of vector displays.|$|R
50|$|Cinematronics Incorporated was a {{pioneering}} arcade game developer that had its heyday {{in the era}} of vector display games. While other companies released games based on <b>raster</b> <b>displays,</b> early in their history, Cinematronics and Atari released vector-display games, which offered a distinctive look and a greater graphic capability (at the time), at the cost of being only black and white (initially).|$|R

50|$|The 4000 series {{were much}} less {{expensive}} than earlier graphics terminals, such as the IBM 2250, because no additional electronics were needed to maintain the display on the screen. They remained popular until the introduction of inexpensive graphics workstations in the 1980s. The new graphics workstations used <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> and dedicated screen buffers that became more affordable as solid state memory chips became cheaper.|$|R
25|$|The Golden Age {{also saw}} {{developers}} experimenting with vector displays, which produced crisp lines that couldn't be duplicated by <b>raster</b> <b>displays.</b> A {{few of these}} vector games became great hits, such as 1979's Asteroids, 1980's Battlezone and Tempest and 1983's Star Wars from Atari, as well as 1982's Star Trek from Sega. However, vector technology fell out of favor with arcade game companies due to {{the high cost of}} repairing vector displays.|$|R
50|$|The PDS-1 {{screen was}} {{repeatedly}} refreshed or redrawn 40 times per second to avoid visible flickering. But irregular beam motion was {{slower than the}} steady motions on <b>raster</b> <b>displays.</b> The beam deflections were driven by magnetic coils, and those coils fought against rapid changes to their current. The screen flickered when filled with more than 800 inches of lines or more than 1200 characters, because the beam then needed more than 1/40th of a second to retrace everything.|$|R

50|$|Vector {{displays}} do {{not suffer}} from the display artifacts of aliasing and pixelation (especially, B&W ones; color displays keep some artifacts, due their discrete nature). But they are limited in that they can display only a shape's outline (advanced vector systems can provide {{a limited amount of}} shading). Text is crudely drawn from short strokes. Refresh vector displays are limited in how many lines or how much text can be shown without refresh flicker. Irregular beam motion is slower than steady beam motion of <b>raster</b> <b>displays.</b> Beam deflections are typically driven by magnetic coils, and those coils fight against rapid changes to their current.|$|R

He also demonstrated the potential of scanned <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> for computer graphics.

5000|$|The PPI display {{provides}} a 2-D [...] "all round" [...] {{display of the}} airspace around a radar site. The distance out {{from the center of}} the display indicates range, and the angle around the display is the azimuth to the target. The current position of the radar antenna is typically indicated by a line extending from the center to the outside of the display, which rotates along with the antenna in realtime. It is essentially a B-scope extended to 360 degrees. The PPI display is typically what people think of as a radar display in general, and was widely used in air traffic control until the introduction of <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> in the 1990s.|$|R
