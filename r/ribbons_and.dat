5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E

5|$|In their off-duty hours, SPARS contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts for the men overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and war chest and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the SPARS and the country. In general, SPARS looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the SPARS were gradually discharged. They were separated from the service on a point system, and on the basis of their jobs. However, many SPARS were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (SPARS) was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> affixed to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E

25|$|The {{locations}} where {{the band and}} ribbons attach to a shoe is critical, as incorrect placement {{can result in a}} poorly fitting shoe. Optimal placement depends on the physical attributes of the foot to which it will be mated, and consequently the <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> elastic bands cannot be attached during the shoe manufacturing process. After acquiring a new pair of pointe shoes, a dancer must determine the appropriate attachment locations for the <b>ribbons</b> <b>and</b> elastic bands and then sew them, or arrange for them to be sewn, onto the shoes.|$|E
