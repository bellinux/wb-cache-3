Although some clinical trials produce positive results, multiple systematic reviews have indicated that this is because of chance, flawed research methods, and <b>reporting</b> <b>bias.</b> Continued homeopathic practice, despite the evidence that it does not work, has been criticized as unethical because it discourages the use of effective treatments, with the World Health Organization warning against using homeopathy to try to treat severe diseases such as HIV and malaria. The continued practice of homeopathy, despite a lack of evidence of efficacy, has led to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities as nonsense, quackery, and a sham.|$|E

The author cites contemporary examples of the media attacking Gordon Brown and the expected win of the Conservative Party at the 2010 general election. Hitchens begins Chapter 2, [...] "The Power of Lunch", by asserting, based on his time as a reporter at Westminster, that political journalists are uninterested in serious political debate; propagate received centre-left standpoints on issues; and consult {{with each other and}} politicians about media stories. Chapter 3, [...] "Time for a Change", describes how a media <b>reporting</b> <b>bias</b> is attempting to facilitate a Tory general election win. Hitchens states one of his motivations in writing the book was to frustrate this exercise. Hitchens claims in Chapter 4, [...] "Fear of Finding Something Worse", that Labour has reached [...] "the most significant moment in its history – the complete acceptance of its programme by the Conservatives". The author invokes the closing image of George Orwell's Animal Farm to illustrate how close the two parties have become. Chapter 5, [...] "The Great Landslide", discusses how a number of left-wing writers and newspapers have begun describing the Conservatives in favourable terms, and how this no longer constituted [...] "a form of treason".|$|E

Both parents of 124 preschoolers completed the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Autism-spectrum Quotient. Acceptable agreement existed between mother and father reports of children's mean scores of autistic traits, but interrater reliability for rank-order correlations was only fair. No evidence was found for <b>report</b> <b>bias</b> regarding parent-offspring autistic traits. However, adult autistic ratings were strongly biased: spouse-ratings were higher than self-ratings, correlations were only fair when both parents reported about the same person, and resemblance was higher for reports from the same person than for spouses' separate self-reports. It is advisable to involve multiple informants when assessing autistic traits, and to use procedural and/or statistical remedies to control for <b>report</b> <b>bias...</b>|$|R
50|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to overcome the effects of the <b>reporting</b> <b>biases,</b> including statistical adjustments to the results of published studies. None of these approaches has proved satisfactory, however, and there is increasing acceptance that <b>reporting</b> <b>biases</b> must be tackled by establishing registers of controlled trials and by promoting good publication practice. Until these problems have been addressed, estimates of the effects of treatments based on published evidence may be biased.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{on tests}} {{in which there}} is control over {{reporting}} (e. g., cued recall with the option to withhold responses) can be characterized by four parameters: free- and forced-report retrieval (correct responses retrieved from memory when the option to withhold responses is exercised and when it is not, respectively), monitoring (discrimination between correct and incorrect potential responses), and <b>report</b> <b>bias</b> (willingness to <b>report</b> responses). Typically, researchers do not examine all these components in cued-test performance; blanks are sometimes counted the same as errors, meaning that the (free-report) performance index is contaminated with <b>report</b> <b>bias</b> and monitoring ability. In this research, a two-stage testing procedure is described that allows measures of free- and forced-report retrieval, monitoring, and bias to be derived from the original encoding specificity experiments (Thomson & Tulving, 1970).

5000|$|In {{empirical}} research, {{the term}} {{may be used}} to refer to authors under-reporting unexpected or undesirable experimental results, attributing the results to sampling or measurement error, while being more trusting of expected or desirable results, though these may be subject to the same sources of error. In this context, <b>reporting</b> <b>bias</b> can eventually lead to a status quo where multiple investigators discover and discard the same results, and later experimenters justify their own <b>reporting</b> <b>bias</b> by observing that previous experimenters reported different results. Thus, each incident of <b>reporting</b> <b>bias</b> can make future incidents more likely. [...] Sociologist Christopher B. Doob refers to this practice as selective reporting in explaining the Power of the Press and defines it as biased coverage of news issues that promotes corporate interests and downplays, denigrates, or ignores issues and groups challenging these issues.|$|E

40|$|The {{immediate}} expensing of R&D expenditures {{is often}} {{justified by the}} conservatism principle. However, no accounting procedure consistently applied can be conservative throughout the firm' life. We ask the following questions: (a) When is the expensing of R&D conservative and when is it aggressive, relative to R&D capitalization? and (b) What are the capital market implications of these <b>reporting</b> <b>biases?</b> To address these questions we construct a model of profitability <b>biases</b> (differences between <b>reported</b> profitability under R&D expensing and capitalization) and show that the key drivers of the <b>reporting</b> <b>biases</b> are the differences between R&D growth and earnings growth (momentum), and between R&D growth and return on equity (ROE). Companies with a high R&D growth rate relative to their profitability (typically early cycle companies) report conservatively, while firms with a low R&D growth rate (mature companies) tend to report aggressively under current GAAP. Our empirical analysis, covering the period 1972 - 2003, generally supports the analytical predictions. In the valuation analysis we find evidence consistent with investor fixation on the reported profitability measures: we detect undervaluation of conservatively reporting firms and overvaluation of aggressively reporting firms. These misvaluations appear to be corrected when the <b>reporting</b> <b>biases</b> reverse from conservative to aggressive and vice versa. ...|$|R
