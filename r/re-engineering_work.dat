40|$|Workflow {{systems are}} {{catching}} on rapidly {{due to the}} success of many workflow-based innovations in practice. Streamlining or even redesigning workflows in the primary business is observed to be effective in organisations that have problems coordinating work. In order to learn how and why workflow management systems are built, twelve organisations that use workflow systems have been analysed. The observations done in this project have led to the definition of terms, a modelling technique and knowledge about the innovation process of implementing automated workflow. This paper is interesting for methodologists who want to learn how workflow analysis can be done, for managers who want to learn what workflow means in practice, and for researchers to learn which practical problems require research attention.

Formal logical analysis is invaluable for isolating defects, determining code corrections, eliminating side-effects, and code <b>re-engineering.</b> Logical analysis <b>works</b> well in software maintenance because many defects can be isolated to small segments of code. These small segments can then be analyzed manually or with code analysis tools. The result is lowered software maintenance costs due to the benefits of defect prevention, reduction of code complexity metrics, productivity improvements, and better specifications and documentation. It would be beneficial to use logical code analysis in the earlier phases of the software life-cycle, such as quality assurance and inspectio...|$|R

The team was working on a complex legacy systems re-engineering project and needed a new approach. The prime challenge of the <b>re-engineering</b> <b>work</b> was to clarify the underlying ontology of the systems and the work focussed on developing a process for mining ontologies and a top ontology that formed the foundation for the analysis.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and analyses {{a solution to}} the problem of formally re- engineering program data structures, allowing new representations of a program to be developed. The work is based around Ward's theory of program transformations which uses a Wide Spectrum Language, WSL, whose semantics were specially developed for use in proof of program transformations. The re-engineered code exhibits equivalent functionality to the original but differs in the degree of data abstraction and representation. Previous transformational <b>re-engineering</b> <b>work</b> has concentrated upon control flow restructuring, which has highlighted a lack of support for data restructuring in the maintainer's tool-set. Problems have been encountered during program transformation due to the lack of support for data re-engineering. A lack of strict data semantics and manipulation capabilities has left the maintainer unable to produce optimally re-engineered solutions. It has also hindered the migration of programs into other languages because it has not been possible to convert data structures into an appropriate form in the target language. The main contribution of the thesis is the Data Re-Engineering and Abstraction Mechanism (DREAM) which allows theories about type equivalence to be represented and used in a re-engineering environment. DREAM is based around the technique of "ghosting", a way of introducing different representations of data, which provides the theoretical underpinning of the changes applied to the program. A second major contribution is the introduction of data typing into the WSL language. This allows DREAM to be integrated into the existing transformation theories within WSL. These theoretical extensions of the original work have been shown to be practically viable by implementation within a prototype transformation tool, the Maintainer's Assistant. The extended tool has been used to re-engineer heavily modified, commercial legacy code. The results of this have shown that useful <b>re-engineering</b> <b>work</b> can be performed and that DREAM integrates well with existing control flow transformations...|$|E

We find, using engineered proteins of known structure, that {{only one of the}} two cofactor wires connecting the positive and negative termini of this reaction centre is capable of conducting unidirectional current under a suitably oriented bias, irrespective of the magnitude of the bias or the applied force at the tunnelling junction. This behaviour, strong functional asymmetry in a largely symmetrical protein-cofactor matrix, recapitulates the strong functional asymmetry characteristic of natural photochemical charge separation, but it is surprising given that the stimulus for electron flow is simply an externally applied bias. Reasons for the electrical resistance displayed by the so-called B-wire of cofactors are explored...|$|R
30|$|Jeremy Rifkin {{identified}} {{that the world}} led by the progress of technological innovation {{is the end of}} work. For a growing number of working people who find themselves either underemployed or unemployed, the concept of trickle-down technology is of very little solace (Rifkin & Kruger, 1996, p. 165). He said the characteristics of the new society are the decline of the global labor force, the reduction of the middle class, a new division between high-tech winners and losers, an increasing rate of unemployment, and a more dangerous world. As a result, Ripken predicted that globalizing the social innovation economy would be realized by <b>re-engineering</b> the <b>work</b> week, a new social contract, and empowering the third sector (Rifkin & Kruger, 1996, p. 275). In this third industrial revolution, the lateral power is the transforming energy, the economy, and the world. Ripken said mutual cooperative, horizontal, and open economic system, which are different from the existing system, would be established, and is being established (Rifkin, 2011, p. 277). That is the sharing economy or the Collaborative Commons, summarized as the zero marginal cost society (Rifkin, 2014, p. 7). It refuted the opinion of Hardin that in the end, all commons are destined to collapse head-on. It also completely coincides with that of Rose and Ostrom who once raised the question on the old idea thought by economists {{for a long time that}} individuals pursue only their self-interest in a market (Hardin, 1968; Ostrom, 1990; Rose, 1986).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the works of Gal-or (1993) and Cavalluzzo et al., (1998) on {{strategic}} common cost allocation in business organisations operating both in business and monopoly segments to provide goods and services to customers. A business unit of a large public sector city council in Australia has been studied to empirically examine how strategic cost allocation is used to prepare a competitive bid in response {{to changes in the}} provision of services according to the National Competition Policy (NCP) guidelines. A case study approach has been used and data have been collected through semi-structured interviews, and study of archival documents. The analysis of the results reveals that strategic cost allocation can significantly improve the competitive position and productivity of a business unit in the short term. The sources of such improvement stem from the employees’ sense of urgency to improve efficiency reduce slacks in work processes, <b>re-engineering</b> <b>work</b> processes and finally distancing service provision from funding side through an internal purchaser-provider split. The study also reveals that excessive or unfair common cost allocation, used in conjunction with strategic cost allocation, does not change the status quo of the services provided by the monopoly segments. The study, however, does not endorse the long-term use of such strategic cost allocation because such practice may disadvantage the monopoly segment in terms of cost of service provision or unfairly subjecting services to competition...|$|E

40|$|Management of today’s {{systems is}} {{becoming}} increas-ingly complex {{due to the}} heterogeneous nature of the in-frastructure under which they operate and what the users of these systems expect. Our interest is {{in the development of}} mechanisms for automating the management of such sys-tems to enable efficient operation of systems and the utiliza-tion of services. Central to autonomic management is the need for systems to monitor, evaluate, and adapt their own behavior to meet the different, and at times seemingly com-peting, objectives. Policy-driven management offers sig-nificant benefit to this effect since the use of policies can make it more straightforward to define and modify systems behavior at run-time, through policy manipulation, rather than through <b>re-engineering.</b> This <b>work</b> examines the effec-tiveness of Reinforcement Learning methodologies in deter-mining how to best use a set of active (enabled) policies to meet different performance objectives. We believe that Reinforcement Learning offers significant potential benefits, particularly in the ability to modify existing policies, learn new policies, or even ignore some policies when past expe-rience shows it is prudent to do so. Our work is presented {{in the context of an}} adaptive policy-driven autonomic man-agement system. The learning approach is based on the analysis of past experience of the system in the use of poli-cies to dynamically adapt the choice of policy actions for adjusting applications and system tuning parameters in re-sponse to policy violations.

40|$|Aim: To test {{changes in}} {{adherence}} to nurses’ falls prevention work resulting from improving attitudes and ownership of practice. Background: Workforce surveys indicate that nurses leave nursing because they cannot deliver {{the care they}} value. When challenged why, nurses claim no power of decision-making or authority to change their work with dissatisfaction and disengagement with work ensuing. Nurses espouse ‘caring’ but are observed taking risks with patients’ safety reflecting poor congruence between values and behaviours. Attitudes and decision-making involvement are factors that influence work behaviours. Hence, increased adherence should be achieved by improving nurses’ attitudes through active decision-making surrounding practice. Design: Mixed methods study. Methods: Mixed methods were employed during 2004 by surveying attitudes (self-esteem, professional values and work satisfaction) before and after <b>re-engineering</b> nurses’ <b>work</b> using practice development (PD) to gain time to spend in prevention work. Practice behaviour was observed and measured at intervals during the study. Results: Initially, nurses had good self-esteem and professional values but were not satisfied with their work. Following the PD, self-esteem and professional values were unaffected; however, nurses expressed increased sense of ownership and greater satisfaction. Nurses were observed to engage in more prevention work. More effective ways of assessing and communicating risk and monitoring nurses’ performance of prevention work were created and evaluated. Patients’ environments were made safer and more patient-centred. Conclusion: Manipulation of attitudes and values is not warranted if attitudes and values are good. However, participation in work-related decision-making engages practitioners and leads to greater congruence between values and behaviour. Recommendations include promoting reflection and action to achieve cultural change and person-centred care. Relevance to clinical practice: This study is relevant to international readership as adds to {{what is known about}} nurses’ practice behaviours related to falls prevention and will assist others when designing and implementing programs that address patient safety and optimise nurses’ adherence...|$|R
40|$|The high efficiency, {{reliability}} and flexibility of modern passenger car Diesel engines makes these power units quite attractive for steady power plants totally or partially running on fuels derived from biomass, in particular on syngas. The engine cost, which is obviously {{higher than that}} of current industrial engines, may not be a big obstacle, provided that the <b>re-engineering</b> <b>work</b> is limited and that performance and efficiency are enhanced. The goal of this work is to explore the potential of a current automotive turbocharged Diesel engine running on both Diesel fuel and syngas, by means of a comprehensive experimental investigation focused on the combustion process. The engine is operated at the most typical speed employed in steady power plants (3000 rpm), considering three different loads (50 – 100 – 300 Nm/ 16 – 31 – 94 kW). For each operating condition, the syngas rate is progressively increased until it provides a maximum heating power of 85 kW, while contemporarily reducing the amount of injected Diesel oil. Maximum care is applied to guarantee a constant quality of the syngas flow throughout the tests, as well as to maintain the same engine control parameters, in particular the boost pressure. It is found that in-cylinder pressure traces do not change very much, even when drastically reducing the amount of Diesel fuel: this is a very encouraging result, because it demonstrates that {{there is no need to}} radically modify the standard stock engine design. Another promising outcome is the slight but consistent enhancement of the engine brake efficiency: the use of syngas not only reduces the consumption of Diesel oil, but it also improves the combustion quality. The authors acknowledge that this study is only a starting basis: further investigation is required to cover all the aspects related to the industrial application of this syngas-Diesel combustion concept, in particular the impact on pollutant emission and on engine durability...|$|E
40|$|In the {{information}} society {{the use of}} technology is becoming increasingly important. This is especially relevant to government institutions in South Africa (SA). In South Africa the public service is the sole supplier or provider of particular products or services that citizens in the country have to utilize This paper provides an overview of information technology initiatives undertaken by the South African government. The paper cites some cases where information technology initiatives are currently undertaken. Cape Online Strategy, which is an information technology initiative by the provincial government of the Western Cape in SA, {{is an example of a}} global trend towards greater levels of interactivity between government and citizens. This initiative is an excellent example of how Web-based solutions can be used to deliver certain services to citizens. Another excellent example is an eJustice initiative, undertaken by the Department of Justice. The initiative aims at promoting a more efficient system of Justice in SA. The purpose of the eJustice programme is to reform and modernize the administration and delivery of Justice through the <b>re-engineering</b> of <b>work</b> processes using enabling technologies. The paper also provides an evaluation of where information technology currently stands and what are the implications for SA. There are a number of factors that have contributed to the success of information technology initiatives in SA, such as it enjoys strong political support from government. However, there are also challenges that impact on the progress and success of e-government, such as the persistent lack of infrastructure in rural and semi-rural areas in SA. The SA government would therefore need to make a more comprehensive effort, so that citizens can benefit from the circle of technological transformation for service delivery...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The elderly {{population}} consumes {{a large share}} of medical resources in the western world. A significant portion of the expense is related to hospitalizations. Objectives To evaluate an intervention program designed {{to reduce the number of}} hospitalization of elderly patients by a more optimal allocation of resources in primary care. Methods A multidimensional intervention program was conducted that included the <b>re-engineering</b> of existing <b>work</b> processes with a focus on the management of patient problems, improving communication with outside agencies, and the establishment of a system to monitor quality of healthcare parameters. Data on the number of hospitalizations and their cost were compared before and after implementation of the intervention program. Results As a result of the intervention the mean expenditure per elderly patient was reduced by 22. 5 %. The adjusted number of hospitalizations/ 1, 000 declined from 15. 1 to 10. 7 (29. 3 %). The number of adjusted hospitalization days dropped from 132 to 82 (37. 9 %) and the mean hospitalization stay declined from 8. 2 to 6. 7 days (17. 9 %). The adjusted hospitalization cost ($/ 1, 000 patients) dropped from $ 32, 574 to $ 18, 624 (42. 8 %). The overall clinic expense, for all age groups, dropped by 9. 9 %.
