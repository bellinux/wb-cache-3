50|$|To {{counter the}} 2000 Stock Market Crash and {{subsequent}} economic slowdown, the Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>eased</b> credit availability and drove interest rates down to lows {{not seen in}} many decades. These low interest rates facilitated the growth of debt {{at all levels of}} the economy, chief among them private debt to purchase more expensive housing. High levels of debt have long been recognized as a causative factor for recessions. Any debt default has the possibility of causing the lender to also default, if the lender is itself in a weak financial condition and has too much debt. This second default in turn can lead to still further defaults through a domino effect. The chances of these follow-up defaults is increased at high levels of debt. Attempts to prevent this domino effect by bailing out Wall Street lenders such as AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac have had mixed success. The takeover is another example of attempts to stop the dominoes from falling.There was a real irony in the recent intervention by the Federal Reserve System to provide the money that enabled the firm of JPMorgan Chase to buy Bear Stearns before it went bankrupt. The point was to try to prevent a domino effect of panic in the financial markets that could lead to a downturn in the economy.|$|R

40|$|In the postglobal {{financial}} crisis period, the central {{banks of the}} advanced economies pursued unconventional monetary policies, such as the United States (US) Federal <b>Reserve's</b> quantitative <b>easing</b> (QE).

For example, emerging markets experienced substantial financial instability during the taper tantrum triggered by the US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's May 2013 announcement of the potential unwinding of QE. In this paper, we examine the spillovers from the taper tantrum on emerging markets more rigorously by using econometric analysis to empirically assess the effect on equity markets in emerging markets.

Using an event-study approach, this paper estimates the impact of "Fed tapering" on EME financial markets and capital flows for 19 EMEs. Results suggest that EMEs with strong fundamentals (e. g., stronger growth and current account position, lower debt, and higher growth in business confidence and productivity), saw more favourable responses to Fed communications on tapering.

However, in a pure QE regime, the focus of policy is the quantity of bank reserves, which are liabilities of the central bank; the composition of loans and securities on the asset side of the central bank's balance sheet is incidental. Indeed, although the Bank of Japan's policy approach during the QE period was quite multifaceted, the overall stance of its policy was gauged primarily in terms of its target for bank reserves.

Nevertheless, the yield curve steepened on average, benefiting net interest margins. The decline in longer-term interest rates also boosted realized gains on securities. The low interest rates strengthened the ability of households and businesses to service their debt, which also supported bank profitability. Finally, a change in accounting rules that largely eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill caused a one-time drop in expenses. Despite the largest decline in commercial and industrial loans since the 1990 - 91 recession, the expansion of bank balance sheets quickened last year, driven primarily by real estate lending and substantial acquisitions of securities.

40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{financial}} crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve has been engaging in quantitative easing. Quantitative easing is a form of open market operation in which the Federal Reserve buys long-term U. S. government and other securities, versus traditional open market operations that occur through the short-term Treasury bill market. At the same time, the shadow bank system, which is a system of financial intermediaries that perform unregulated credit intermediation outside of traditional banks, has contracted significantly. Some argue that this contraction is due to a collateral crunch induced by quantitative easing in the shadow bank system—a crunch that occurred when the Federal <b>Reserve’s</b> quantitative <b>easing</b> program took high-quality collateral off the market. I will focus specifically on repurchase agreements, an instrument within the shadow banking that uses the same types of securities that the Federal Reserve has been buying during quantitative easing as collateral, to determine whether quantitative easing has led to a contraction of the repurchase agreement market. I find that increases in Federal Reserve asset holdings from 2005 - 2013, and specifically during QE 1, are associated with decreases in primary dealer repurchase agreements. This shows that under certain circumstances, Federal Reserve asset purchases lead to contractions in the shadow bank system. This paper aims to increase understanding of how monetary policy affects shadow banking and understanding of the unintended consequences of monetary policy, such as decreased shadow bank lending caused by quantitative easing...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} better understand the unconventional monetary policies that the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have been conducting for the past decade and how these policies influence the markets of government securities, money, and credit. In the first chapter, I study market friction and its implication for the Federal <b>Reserve's</b> quantitative <b>easing</b> policies. Given sufficient market friction, changes in the supply of Treasury securities can affect yields. This research adds {{to our understanding of the}} supply effects of quantitative easing because the mechanics of Treasury auctions and the Federal Reserve's implementation of quantitative easing are similar. I examine the slopes of Treasury auction demand based on the bids and the changes in interest rates around the times of Treasury auctions between January 2000 and January 2011. From the implied quantity impact of these estimates, I infer an upper bound on the supply effects of quantitative easing. The finding suggests that quantitative easing is more effective when market frictions are high. Forward guidance is another way a central bank can ease the economy. My second chapter uses the Svensson yield curve model to fit and calculate a measure of policy duration to infer the effects of central bank guidance. Using the policy duration and interest rate time series for both the US and Japan, I attribute their movements to various types of news from newswire reporting. I find that much of the movements from the time series are due to non-central bank events. Monetary policy ultimately seeks to affect the real economy. My final chapter (co-authored with Ulrike Schaede) looks at the real effects of monetary policies in Japan. The Japanese Tankan survey is used to disentangle the change in bank lending and the change in firm borrowing at the industry level. Thus, we can examine how policy variables correlate with trade credit as well as bank lending needs from the 1980 s to 2009. We find that the relationship of trade credit and bank loan is different depending on whether firms are constrained on the supply or demand sid...|$|R

40|$|Last {{year was}} a {{difficult}} one for {{the economy of the}} United States. The slowdown in the growth of economic activity that had become apparent in late 2000 intensified {{in the first half of}} 2001, as businesses slashed investment spending and declines in manufacturing output steepened. Foreign economies also slowed, further reducing the demand for U. S. production. The aggressive actions by the Federal <b>Reserve</b> to <b>ease</b> the stance of monetary policy in the first half of the year provided support to consumer spending and the housing sector. Nevertheless, the weakening in activity became more widespread through the summer, job losses mounted further, and the unemployment rate moved higher. The devastating events of September 11 further set back an already fragile economy. The economic fallout of the events of September 11 led the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut the target federal funds rate early the following week and again at each meeting through the end of the year. Firms moved quickly to reduce payrolls and cut production after mid-September; manufacturing and industries related to travel, hospitality, and entertainment bore the brunt of the downturn. Consumer spending, however, remained surprisingly solid over the final three months of the year in the face of enormous economic uncertainty, widespread job losses, and further deterioration of household balance sheets from the sharp drop in equity prices immediately following September 11. With businesses having positioned themselves to absorb a falloff of demand, the surprising strength in household spending late in the year resulted in a dramatic liquidation of inventories. In the end, real GDP posted a much better performance than had been anticipated in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. More recently, there have been encouraging signs that economic activity is beginning to firm. The FOMC left its target for the federal funds rate unchanged in its meeting in January 2002, but reflecting a concern that growth could be weaker than the economy's potential for a time, the Committee retained its assessment that the balance of risks were tilted unacceptably toward economic weakness. The extent and persistence of any recovery in production will, of course, depend critically on the trajectory of final demand in the period ahead, a period in which the economy faces considerable risk of subpar economic performance.

40|$|The Federal <b>Reserve</b> aggressively <b>eased</b> {{monetary}} policy during the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut {{the federal funds}} rate target to near zero, and the Board of Governors introduced a number of novel liquidity facilities. In addition, the FOMC purchased long-term Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities on a large scale. These actions caused the Fed’s balance sheet to balloon.; As the balance sheet grew to unprecedented size, the Open Market Desk at the New York Fed found {{it increasingly difficult to}} achieve FOMC’s target funds rate. In response, in October 2008, as authorized under the Financial Services Regulatory Act of 2006 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Federal Reserve began paying interest on excess reserves. This interest rate expected to establish a floor under the federal funds rate. The discount rate—which since January 2003 has been set as a penalty rate the funds rate target—was expected to limit upward pressure on the funds rate; With these moves, the Federal Reserve’s operating framework now incorporates the essential elements of a “channel” or “corridor” system. In such a system, the target for the federal funds rate would typically be set within the corridor established by the discount rate at the ceiling and interest rate on excess reserves at the floor. Although the Federal Reserve has not formally adopted a channel system, establishing a under the federal funds rate target will be especially important as the Federal Reserve begins to exit its highly accommodative policy stance.; Kahn examines how a corridor system works in theory and practice. While such a framework may offer a number of advantages as an operating system, it may also create new challenges. The key advantages are that it could help the Federal Reserve achieve its target for the federal funds rate while allowing the balance sheet to act as an independent tool of policy. A key question is whether the discount rate will be an effective ceiling and the interest rate on excess reserves an effective floor. In addition, how changes in the funds rate target, the discount rate and the rate on excess reserves will be sequenced is unclear. In particular, the roles of the FOMC, Board of Governors, and Reserve Bank Boards of Directors in such a system may need to be clarified. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the Ringgit was de-pegged in {{the middle}} of June 2005, the {{awareness}} for Malaysian corporates to hedge its currency position has increased steadily. Past research works on the effects of hedging using derivatives on firm value remains mixed. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out the impact of currency derivatives usage on firm value in the context of Malaysian companies, utilizing a sample size of 20 non-financial firms, represented approximately 50 % of the top 100 companies in term of market capitalization on Bursa Malaysia from the year 2006 to 2012, as at 1 st January 2013. All data compiled were secondary in nature from companies’ annual reports. This research paper also extended its study to investigate the effect of foreign exchange derivatives based on the samples selected on firm value before (2006 & 2007), during (2008 & 2009) and after the global financial crisis (2010 - 2012). The investigation concluded that currency derivatives usage does not significantly influence firm value. Meanwhile, on the control variables, dividend per share and return of assets are positively correlated with firm value while being statistically significant, suggest that the bigger the dividend payout to shareholders, the higher the firm value. Meanwhile, for profitability, represented by return of asset, indicated that the more profitable a company is, the firm value will also increase alongside. Currency derivatives impact on firm value pre-crisis and during the global financial meltdown, the findings showed a positive relationship despite being statistically insignificant, while post global financial crisis, the relationship turned negative. The US Federal <b>Reserve</b> launched quantitative <b>easing</b> program to boost the US economy which subsequently weakened the Dollar and strengthened the Asian currencies on the back of the monetary policy action which resulted in Malaysian firms reducing its hedging needs. However, the relationship was statistically insignificant...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the overall impact of financial liberalisation on Nepal�s financial system and economy. The study is specifically directed towards analysing the rationale of executing a financial liberalisation policy; preparing {{an account of}} the evolution, process and sequencing of the financial liberalisation; and evaluating the impact of the various liberalisation measures on financial and economic developments of Nepal with cointegration and causality tests. The study makes significant contributions {{in the area of the}} impact evaluation of financial liberalisation. Most of the previous studies focus on the economic growth aspect of financial liberalisation in detail, but attach less importance to the redistribution of income and stability of the financial systems. To bridge this gap, an aggregated framework for impact evaluation, which includes all of the three dimensions, is implemented in this study. The framework implemented in this study is useful not only for the impact evaluation of financial liberalisation policy, but also for other public policies. A summary index of the financial liberalisation comprising eight policy instruments is employed in this study. As some of these instruments have not been immediately fully employed, the index is designed to take into account their gradual implementation. The instruments are interest rate deregulation, removal of entry barriers, reduction in <b>reserve</b> requirement, <b>easing</b> in credit controls, implementation of prudential rules, stock market reform, privatisation of state-owned banks and external account liberalisation. A sequential procedure has been applied to test for unit roots on time series data. This procedure helps to determine the optimal test method for each time series under consideration and reduces the risk of model misspecification and biased results. The empirical test results obtained using the Nepalese quarterly data from 1970 - 2003 suggest that financial liberalisation in Nepal has had a mixed impact on the financial system and the national economy. The number of per capita bank branches is found to be positively associated with the widening of the financial sector, which in turn affects financial development positively. The real deposit interest rate affects the volume of time deposits (savings) positively, but the increase in gross domestic product does not affect time deposits. The volume of time deposits affects the volume of bank loans positively, but the lending rate does not have a significant impact on the volume of bank loans. Collectively, the financial liberalisation measures are positively associated with per capita income as well as with industrial development. The population density per bank branch is found to be positively associated with the volume of bank credit to the poor, while the overall measures of financial liberalisation are negatively associated with such credit. The results also suggest that financial liberalisation is positively associated with the credit-deposit ratio of the commercial banks. However, the higher credit-deposit ratio is not only associated with higher return, but also with higher risk. Therefore, it can be argued that financial liberalisation has brought instability in the Nepalese financial sector. The overall finding of this study is that financial liberalisation is positively associated with growth, but negatively associated with income equality and financial stability. However, the study does not find any causal relationship between financial development and economic growth in Nepal. Hence, the financial liberalisation in Nepal has not facilitated a financial development to the extend that contributed significantly to the economic development of the country...|$|R
