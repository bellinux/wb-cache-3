25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E
500|$|Based on such safety concerns, US {{federal judge}} Richard Posner, Future of Humanity Institute {{research}} associate Toby Ord {{and others have}} argued that the LHC experiments are too risky to undertake. In the book , English cosmologist and astrophysicist Martin Rees calculated an upper limit of 1 in 50 million for the probability that the Large Hadron Collider will produce a global catastrophe or black hole. However, Rees has also reported not to be [...] "losing sleep over the collider," [...] and trusts the scientists who have built it. He has stated: [...] "My book has been misquoted in one or two places. I would <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> to the up-to-date safety study." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Smith {{claimed that}} Facsimile No. 1 portrays Abraham {{fastened}} to an altar, with the idolatrous priest of Elkenah attempting to sacrifice him. [...] The Book of Abraham makes explicit reference to this facsimile, noting: [...] "That {{you may have}} a knowledge of this altar, I will <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> to the representation at the commencement of this record." [...] Egyptologists, however, claim that it is a vignette taken from a version of The Book of Breathings, also known as the [...] "Breathing Permit", copied for a Theban priest named Hôr. A comparison of Smith’s interpretation of the facsimile, and that of Egyptologists is as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Arkell v. Pressdram (1971), the {{plaintiff}} {{was the subject of}} an article. Arkell's lawyers wrote a letter which concluded: [...] "His attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of your reply." [...] Private Eye responded: [...] "We acknowledge your letter of 29th April referring to Mr J. Arkell. We note that Mr Arkell's attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of our reply and would therefore be grateful if you would inform us what his attitude to damages would be, were he to learn that the nature of our reply is as follows: fuck off." [...] In the years following, the magazine would refer to this exchange as a euphemism for a blunt and coarse dismissal, for example: [...] "We <b>refer</b> <b>you</b> to the reply given in {{the case of}} Arkell v. Pressdram". As with [...] "tired and emotional" [...] this usage has spread beyond the magazine.|$|E

60|$|My Lords, I next {{stated that}} this recriminatory charge {{consisted}} of two distinct parts,--injustice and delay.
