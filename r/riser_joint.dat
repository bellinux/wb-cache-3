40|$|AbstractAlthough the {{complete}} stress field of a structure is available after finite element analysis, traditional S-N based fatigue assessment is merely {{based on the}} (peak) stress cycles at the critical location of the structure and generally deterministic in its nature. This is true both for fatigue assessment by “hand” and by post-processor. At the design stage, fatigue-crack growth is generally limited to “worst-case” cracks. This paper gives a brief presentation of a novel tool for probabilistic fatigue assessment, LINKpfat, both capable of performing weakest-link fatigue analysis and fatigue-crack growth analysis based on computationally efficient determination of stress-intensity factors by means of weight functions. Both the traditional peak-stress module and the weakest-link module of LINKpfat are applied to the fatigue assessment of an offshore <b>riser</b> <b>joint</b> with moderate stress concentrations for three different load cases. It {{turns out that the}} peak-stress analysis may overestimate the load capability of the riser with about 35 % by neglecting the size effect. The latter is consistently accounted for by the weakest-link module...|$|E

30|$|In 2004 a 3 D {{seismic survey}} was {{conducted}} along the rupture zone of the 1944 East Nankai Earthquake. The data clearly imaged the décollement, the splay faults and forearc basin sedimentation patterns [4]. Based on this dataset, the NanTroSEIZE Project Management Team (PMT) developed a strategy for a 5 -year drilling campaign. The drilling strategy of the NanTroSEIZE was divided into four phases: (1) reconnaissance of lithology, structural framework and geotechnical properties of the shallower region of the megathrust; (2) medium depth riser drilling; (3) deep riser penetration into the seismogenic zone; and (4) long-term borehole observatory installation [1] (Figure  4). The drill sites are mostly located near the axis of the Kuroshio Current, which complicates riser operations because of the 5 + knot velocity which causes current-induced vortex vibration of the <b>riser</b> <b>joints.</b> Some of these issues have been overcome by the Center of Deep Earth Exploration (CDEX) of Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) by deploying faring fins around the <b>riser</b> <b>joints</b> combined with real-time riser motion monitoring and fatigue-life models, which were constructed after careful analysis of riser dynamics [5, 6].|$|R
30|$|There are two {{locations}} {{at which the}} deepwater test system is most susceptible to fatigue: {{in the vicinity of}} the splash zone and the lower flex joint. These locations should be given special attention in managing the fatigue life of the deepwater test string. The fatigue damage in the sections located at the top of the test string in the splash zone primarily results from wave loads and the platform heaving motion, whereas the sections adjacent to the lower flex joint are mainly influenced by the offset motion of the floating platform. When the rotational stiffness of the flex joints is lower than that of the <b>riser</b> <b>joints,</b> the bending deformation and the vibration amplitude of the riser and the test string at this position are more significant.|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe push in the {{industry}} towards increasing the weather window for marine operations offshore leads to a focus on new technology. When performing workover operations in a subsea well, the workover riser is a physical connection between the well and the floating workover vessel. A floating vessel will experience wave induced motion and is therefore equipped with a heave compensator to allow for this relative motion without increasing the load to the riser. If the heave compensator fails or if the heave of the vessel exceeds the stroke length of the heave compensator, the workover riser can be subjected to an excessive axial force that could rupture the riser and damage subsea well barriers. A safety joint {{that is to be}} installed in the riser can improve the window for safe operation while reducing consequences if an accident were to occur. It is called the Telescopic Safety Joint (TSJ) and has been developed by FMC Technologies. The joint is designed to telescope when subjected to a predetermined axial force. The telescoping function of the joint will ensure that there is sufficient time for personnel onboard the vessel to activate the emergency disconnect function so that the riser can safely be disconnected from the well. The safety joint is a weak link. During installation of the workover system, the riser experiences loading conditions exceeding that of normal operation. There is a concern that the safety joint may take plastic damage during this installation. Hence the TSJ is equipped with an over-ride function that temporarily can increase the strength of the joint. The over-ride function works by pumping hydraulic pressure into external cylinders. The increase in the strength of the joint from the over-ride function depends upon the hydraulic pressure. This thesis studies the effect the over-ride function has on the weather window for installation of a workover system, comparing a fully pressurized over-ride function to a semi-pressurized over-ride function. Simulations in Orcaflex for various environmental conditions found the loads that the TSJ must be able to withstand for installation to be possible. A model of the joint was created in AUTODESK Inventor. Using ANSYS workbench, the model was tested to find out which loads that are acceptable and which loads leads to plastic damage of the joint both for the fully pressurized and semi-pressurized over-ride function. Combining the results for the fully- and semi-pressurized over-ride function test, with the results from the dynamic simulations performed in Orcaflex revealed an increase in installation window when using the fully pressurized over-ride function. The joint using the full capacity of the over-ride function was able to withstand 620 kNm before plastic damage took place. The joint using a semi-pressurized over-ride function began taking plastic damage at 400 kNm. The over-ride function increases the bending moment capacity of the joint by 55 %. Using the scatter diagram for the Draugen field to see how many observations has been made of the different sea states, the increased availability for installation when using the full capacity of the over-ride function, as opposed to the semi-pressurized joint was calculated. When installing the TSJ as the 2 nd <b>riser</b> <b>joint,</b> the availability increased by 21, 7 %. Installing the TSJ as the 3 rd joint increases the availability by 16, 7 %. Installation of the TSJ on the 4 th and 5 th joint gives an increase of respectively 2, 8 % and 0, 3 % when the full over-ride capacity is used. The over-ride functions proved to be so effective that the joint became stronger than the actual workover riser. Hand calculations showed that the riser would yield before the safety joint and thus the safety joint would not be a limiting factor for the workover installation activity if the over-ride function is active...|$|E
40|$|When {{offshore}} drilling {{needs to be}} conducted in deepwater and ultra-deepwater area, a significant increase of weight to be accommodated by the drilling rig due to more <b>riser</b> <b>joints</b> and larger drilling mud volume becomes a challenge {{that has to be}} carefully looked after. However, with the growing technology of semisubmersible drilling rigs, drilling systems and methods, subsea and downhole systems, and so on, the deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling operation has been more enabled than ever. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} world record for drilling depth has exceeded 10000 ft (3048 m) today. With more and more weight to be handled as the water depth goes deeper, and especially when heavy density drilling fluid needs to be used as well, drilling rig may arrive at a level where its capacities also need to be increased. Otherwise, it will not be adequate to fulfill the required parameters as stated by the regulating standards. A smart concept for drilling riser was then introduced with main objective to reduce the excessive weight resulted from deepwater application by replacing the conventional 21 inch diameter drilling riser with the slim 16 inch diameter drilling riser. As the weight and requirements related to this will be reduced, there is a possibility that the slim riser can be utilized further to even deeper water area without modifying existing capacities of the drilling rig, or even by using smaller capacity rigs...|$|R
40|$|Transferring a {{drilling}} rig and its subsea equipment from one location to another by conventional means {{tends to be}} time consuming. With low oil prices and increasing rig rates, operators are looking into making drilling rigs more efficient. This thesis will examine a method called BOP sailing, which may expedite the process of moving {{a drilling}} rig and its subsea equipment from one location to another. It will also {{make sure that the}} BOP sailing method is feasible from a safety and design point of view. The BOP sailing operation is modelled and simulated in the riser analysis software RIFLEX for three riser column lengths: 	 311 m 	 800 m 	 1225 m The <b>riser</b> <b>joints</b> for each of the riser column length have the same diameters and submerged weight per unit length. Weather conditions, current profiles and sailing speeds were defined prior to running the simulations. The results obtained from RIFLEX is then further analyzed by calculating a usage factor, n, based on the combined loading equation from the DNV-OS-F 201 standard. This equation is used to perform riser analysis using tension and bending moments, and the value of the calculated usage factor may not exceed a critical value. The usage factor is calculated at two locations on each of the riser columns for all of the weather conditions. One of the locations is located {{at the top of the}} riser column where the riser column is attached to the drilling vessel. The second location is where the maximum dynamic bending moment takes place. Based on the simulation results, it is found that the value of n increases with an 	Increase in sailing speed 	Increase in wave height 	Increase in riser column length However, the value of n did not exceed the limiting value in any of the simulations. One can therefore conclude that it is safe to sail with a suspended marine drilling riser and subsea BOP for all of the weather conditions and sailing speeds used in the RIFLEX simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a deep water composite production riser from a system perspective is presented, and its advantages are articulated through comparisons with a typical steel riser under identical service conditions. The composite <b>riser</b> <b>joints</b> {{in this study were}} considered {{to be a part of}} a single Tension Leg Platform (TLP) riser string to be installed at a depth of 6000 ft in Gulf of Mexico. A series of numerical analyses ??????burst, collapse, fatigue, global and local ?????? have been performed, and the capacities of the composite riser have been determined utilizing long-term strength properties. The capacities associated with the hoop direction, i. e., burst and collapse, are limited by the presence of a steel internal liner whose function is to ensure pressure and fluid tightness. The collapse capacity of the riser can be drastically impaired by the presence of a debond between the liner and composite. Due to the high strength to weight ratio of the carbon/epoxy composite, its response under combined axial tension and bending moment showed great safety margins, favoring pursuits of greater water depths. The study also constructed damage envelopes associated with axial tension and bending moment, which facilitate feasibility checks for expanding the use of the composite joints to other locations or systems. The fatigue life of the composite body is expected to greatly exceed its design life, and the most critical element is the welds between the liner and metal end pieces. Since there is wide dispersion of S-N relationships for carbon/epoxy composites depending on the combinations of constituent materials, a parametric study was carried out in this study to suggest the range of acceptable S-N relationships. The composite riser is estimated to offer only moderate damping, due primarily to its specially orthotropic lay-up. The study also demonstrates that the use of Rayleigh stiffness proportional damping may not be suitable for deep water risers. A series of forced excitation analyses show that the system in sea water does not show notable resonance due to fluid drag. When compared with the steel riser, vibration amplitudes at low elevations are much lower...|$|R
40|$|The main {{concerns}} during drilling {{operations are}} riser integrity and maintaining well control. This thesis has mainly been {{focusing on the}} problems and challenges faced with the marine riser system to illuminate high risk areas related to riser integrity. A marine riser system consists generally of four main elements; the upper marine <b>riser</b> package, <b>riser</b> <b>joints,</b> lower marine <b>riser</b> package, and the blowout preventer, each playing {{an important part in}} the marine riser system. The marine riser function is to supports and guide the auxiliary lines used to control the well, and connect and provide for fluid communication between the drilling vessel and the wellhead. Failure to the marine riser is related to technical problems associated with old design and lack of correct operating procedure and maintenance method. Elements like the telescopic joint haven’t change the design since the 1960 ’s and are exposed to problems like unplanned discharge caused of premature war to the packer element. Problems with the telescopic joint are not unique there are also experienced failure with tensioner system, flex joint and blowout preventer. Studies show that blowout preventer failure cases the longest downtime and most expensive repairs. Over 50 % of blowout preventer failures are related to the control system and are caused by failure to the hydraulic components. Exploration activity forces the drilling contractor further out and into deeper water depths, like the Gulf of Mexico or outside the Coast of Brazil. Greater water depths challenge the riser system on many places. Deepwater operations means harsher environment and problems in the forms of large waves, strong currents and increased pressure from the water column, all affecting the operations and riser pipe in several ways. The environmental issues causes the riser to fail due to increased tensile load, vortex induced vibrations, environmentally induced cracks and increased corrosion attacks. The increased tensile load on the riser pipe place importance on the top tension capacity of the rig and the riser pipe wall thickness. Moving into deeper ground, many rigs reach their tension capacity and must use buoyancy modules to provide sufficient tension to the riser. Many of the problems could be addressed using simple solution, like implementing correct maintenance program or address the issues in the design phase. But economical impetus holds the development back. Solutions like redesign of the telescopic joint and blowout preventer is advised by operators, but some of the solution are proven to be economical unprofitable...|$|R
40|$|Due to an {{increased}} demand from operator companies for deep-water drilling solutions, an interest in Dual Gradient technologies has risen. An {{example of such a}} technology is Controlled Mud Level (CML) drilling, where a subsea pump integrated in one of the <b>riser</b> <b>joints</b> actively controls the riser level. Reducing the hydrostatic component of the system helps to control pressures down-hole very accurately and fast. For this type of pressure control, an understanding of down-hole parameters as well as precise pressure estimate is required. This can be done by different numerical schemes. The scheme used in this thesis is AUSMV numerical scheme used mostly for academic purposes. In this work, a coupling between this scheme and CML technology mentioned before has been introduced. This thesis has undertaken a literature survey from which it was concluded that CML is a promising technology, which finds compromises between several drilling aspects and makes operations more simple and less time consuming. A detailed review of the historical, technical and operational aspects of the technology was performed. Already existing commercial field applications confirms the future interest in CML. One of the breaking innovations with CML is early kick detection, which allows determining the reservoir influx in less than a minute. Well Control procedures used for the CML are close to Driller’s method. This is an advantage taking into consideration the time used for the training of the personnel. After the technology has been reviewed in detail, simulations in Matlab have been performed to examine the ability of the AUSMV scheme to handle this type of well operations. Special focus was placed on the numerical boundary treatment on top of the well. Several ways of defining the outlet pressure boundary were investigated. In the end, setting the outlet pressure flux equal to 1 atm was concluded to be the best alternative. The scheme was available in two versions, 1 st order and 2 nd order. The updated 2 nd order scheme differs from the original 1 st order scheme by using slope limiters. This reduces numerical diffusion, which is a common problem with numerical schemes. After a comparison of the two schemes, the 2 nd order showed more realistic and smoother results. The simulations of the 1 st order scheme confirmed the problem of negative velocity fields for static conditions. Moreover, the problem with an outlet pressure representation at the beginning of simulations was discovered, which needs further investigation. Next objective for this thesis was to adapt the scheme for the small-scale experimental flow-loop located at University of Stavanger (UIS). Two methods for achieving stable numerical solutions were found. Since the pressures delivered by the approximated small-scale model were very low, the first method involved pressurizing the system with 10 bars. This was a remedy introduced due to the problems the model had with handling the low pressures encountered in this simulation set-up. This was not optimal since it would not be possible to pressurize the system experimentally. However, an alternative method was found by editing a specific pressure condition in the code, which was there initially to assure stability but in this set-up was causing a problem. Both methods were compared and the alternative method was concluded to be the best out of the two. Nevertheless, it is important to test the experimental set-up with the proposed method first to be able to assess its efficiency. The simulation results found that the model is extremely friction dominated, a very important conclusion in this case. This might cause problems in studying this particular simulation case as it mostly relies on pressure control based on manipulations of the hydrostatic pressure component. Furthermore, the results showed that the effect of these manipulations was almost entirely masked by friction. A possible solution for this problem would be to move the suction point higher up in the well, which would reduce the height of the fluid column above. This fluid column was found to be the main contributor to the negative friction effect...|$|R
40|$|Marine risers {{that connect}} the surface {{floating}} facilities and the subsea wells are generally made of heavy duty girth welded tubulars. When experience dynamic loads, weld defects {{can cause the}} marine risers to fail prematurely due to fatigue cracks initiation. In order to investigate the fatigue performance of marine risers, a fatigue test system was designed. The components of the test setup part and the data measurement part were described. A mathematical model of free massive beam is built to find the natural frequencies and natural modes of the testing specimen of marine riser to guide the test. Adding end masses is an effective method to control the natural modes and stress amplitude. Based on this system, the fatigue performance of a specimen of marine <b>riser</b> with flange <b>joint</b> is evaluated and the principle and process of the test were illustrated. The mathematical model was used to predict the lateral displacement and the bending moment of the excitated specimen. The maximum error between the test and the theoretical results of bending stress is + 4. 93 %, which verified the model. This study brought promotional values for fatigue performance evaluation of marine risers with different welded tubulars and connections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Offset of a {{dynamically}} positioned {{drilling vessel}} from the setpoint location above the wellhead affects {{a number of}} operational parameters which influence {{the point at which}} a disconnect should be initiated. Factors establishing disconnect limits, among others, include bottom flex <b>joint</b> angle, top <b>riser</b> angle, slip <b>joint</b> strokeout, <b>riser</b> t nsioner strokeout, and riser/moonpool contact. For each of these parameters, the vessel x,y positions at which the physical disconnect limit is reached are variable {{over the course of a}} drilling operation. Furthermore, in an emergency situation, the speed at which the vessel is moving and the time it takes for execution of the disconnect sequence bears directly on the point in time when the disconnect should be initiated. Conventionally the bottom flex joint angle has been used as the determining disconnect parameter. With increasing water depth, either the surface slip <b>joint</b> strokeout or <b>riser</b> t nsioner strokeout will become the physical limit. Depending on a particular rig’s configuration, the existing weather conditions and/or drilling conditions, other equipment parameters may constitute the limiting factor.

40|$|A {{workover}} riser {{is a top}} tensioned riser, {{in essence}} similar to a marine riser. Workover risers differ from marine risers mainly by smaller dimensions, as well as simpler solutions at the riser ends. For instance, the lower flex joint of the marine riser is in the workover riser replaced by a tapered stress joint, and the workover riser has no telescopic joint at the upper end. The similarities between workover and marine risers make it convenient to apply the knowledge acquired for marine risers when performing analyses for workover risers. However, {{based on the findings}} in this thesis, one must be careful when assuming similarities between marine and workover risers. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of a monitoring system for workover risers. This investigation requires an understanding of a workover riser s behavior, and its response to relevant excitations. A literature review has been done, describing the various workover riser components, as well as the actual applications for a workover riser. The monitoring system suggested will utilize a set of strain sensors. Strain sensors are already mounted on the <b>riser</b> s stress <b>joint</b> and tension joint. A review of strain sensor technology is included. A workover riser system has been modeled in two separate softwares, Flexcom and RIFLEX. A brief review of selected aspects of these softwares are provided. Two separate softwares were required in order to validate the analysis results, as the riser s dynamic behavior was different from what was expected. The unexpected results occurred as the level of current was changed. It was found that an increased current magnitude is beneficial with respect to the riser s fatigue life. By reducing the current magnitude, from the design condition with one year return period, by a factor of ten, the lifetime of certain riser components has been found to drop by a factor of approximately 16 in one of the softwares. This trend was also validated by the other software, though the factor by which the fatigue life drops remains disputable. A monitoring system is suggested, where the fatigue damage of each component is extrapolated from the known values at the <b>riser</b> s stress <b>joint.</b> This system requires two extrapolation factors; one factor considers each component s location compared to the stress joint, while the other factor accounts for the environmental conditions. Determining the value of the factor accounting for environmental conditions has proved the biggest challenge. Particularly, the effect of current and current direction must be mapped thoroughly. Measuring the current with sufficient accuracy can prove difficult as well. Riser tension must also be studied further, as it is not only an influential parameter itself, but it also affects other parameters. Based on the analyses done in this thesis, it is concluded that the feasibility of a riser monitoring system for estimation of fatigue damage is promising. A definite conclusion cannot be drawn, as large amounts of work remain in order to map the influence of all important parameters accurately. It is found that the development of such a monitoring system is an ambitious undertaking, though it appears possible...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear {{coupling}} problems {{between the}} multiple bodies or between the mooring/riser and the offshore platform are {{incorporated in the}} CHARM 3 D-MultiBody, a fully coupled time domain analysis program for multiple bodies with moorings and risers. The nonlinear spring connection module and the three dimensional beam module are added to appropriately solve the structural connection problem. The nonlinear spring connection module includes the hydro-pneumatic tensioner module with the friction & stick/slip implementation, the tendon/mooring disconnection (breakage/unlatch) module with the tendon down-stroke check, and the contact spring with the initial gap with the friction force implemented. The nonlinear coupling may happen in many places for the offshore floating structures, such as hydro-pneumatic tensioner, tendon of TLP down stroke at the bottom joint, stick-slip phenomena at the tie down of the derrick {{and most of the}} fender-to-steel or steel-to-steel contact problem with initial gap during the installation. The mooring/tendon broken and unlatch can be a nonlinear connection problem once the transient mode is taken into account. Nonlinearity of the stiffness and friction characteristics of the tensioner combined with stick-slip behavior of <b>riser</b> keel <b>joint</b> is investigated. The relationship between tensions and strokes for hydro-pneumatic tensioner is based on the ideal gas equation where the isotropic gas constant can be varied to achieve an optimum stroke design based on tensioner stiffness. A transient effect of tendon down-stroke and disconnection on global performance of ETLP for harsh environmental condition is also investigated by incorporating the nonlinear boundary condition of the FE tendon model in CHARM 3 D. The program is made to be capable of modeling the tendon disconnection both at the top and the bottom connection as well as the down stroke behavior for the pinned bottom joint. The performance of the tie-down clamp of derrick is also investigated by using six degrees of freedom spring model and the three(3) dimensional FE beam model. The coupling of the TLP motion with the reaction force at the tie-down clamp is considered by using exact nonlinear dynamic equations of the motion with the reaction forces modeled with the spring or FE beam model. The method reduces too much conservatism when we design the tie-down system by the conventional method, in which all the environmental forces are combined without the phase lag effect between them. The FE beam model is also applied to the connectors between the semisubmersible and the truss for the pre-service and in-place conditions to be verified with the model test results, which shows good agreements...|$|R
