30|$|Data {{were drawn}} from the parent study, the Rural Breast Cancer Survivors Study (RBCS), a {{population-based}} study conducted in the State of Florida evaluating the dissemination and implementation of cancer survivorship interventions among rural breast cancer survivors. The RBCS was approved by Institutional Review Boards and the State of Florida Department of Health (DOH). Participants were identified through Florida cancer registry. Eligibility criteria included: at least 21  years of age, Florida rural <b>residence,</b> <b>telephone</b> access, and diagnosis of Stage 0 -III breast cancer in the previous three years. Survivors receiving anti-hormonal therapy were eligible. Survivors with metastatic disease, men with breast cancer, and those lacking reliable telephone access were not eligible.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a case-control study of 325 men ages 30 - 69 who {{were diagnosed with}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD) between 1976 and 1984, and resided in four urban areas of Michigan in 1984. Cases were selected from the Michigan Kidney Registry and excluded men with diabetic, congenital, and obstructive nephropathies. Controls were selected by random-digit dialing and were pair-matched to cases for age, race, and area of <b>residence.</b> <b>Telephone</b> {{interviews were conducted with}} 69 percent of eligible cases and 79 percent of eligible controls. Risk of ESRD was significantly related to phenacetin or acetaminophen consumption (odds ratio(OR) = 2. 66), moonshine consumption (OR = 2. 43), a family history of renal disease (OR = 9. 30); and regular occupational exposures to solvents (OR = 1. 51) or silica (OR = 1. 67). Particular occupational exposures with elevated risk were solvents used as cleaning agents and degreasers (OR = 2. 50) silica exposure in foundries or brick factories (OR = 1. 92), and silica exposure during sandblasting (OR = 3. 83). Little or no trend of increased risk with duration of exposure was found for these occupational exposures, with the exception of silica in sandblasting. Limitations of these data include representativeness of cases, possible overreporting by cases, and misclassification of exposures inherent in self-reports...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{observational}} {{studies have}} reported protective effects of hand-washing in reducing upper respiratory infections, {{little is known about}} the associations between hand-washing and good hygienic habits and seasonal influenza infection. We conducted a case-control study to test whether the risk of influenza transmission associated with self-reported hand-washing and unhealthy hygienic habits among residents in Fujian Province, southeastern China. Laboratory confirmed seasonal influenza cases were consecutively included in the study as case-patients (n 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60100). For each case, we selected 1 control person matched for age and city of <b>residence.</b> <b>Telephone</b> interview was used to collect information on hand-washing and hygienic habits. The associations were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Compared with the poorest hand-washing score of 0 to 3, odds ratios of influenza infection decreased progressively from 0. 26 to 0. 029 as hand-washing score increased from 4 to the maximum of 9 (P 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 600. 001). Compared with the poorest hygienic habit score of 0 to 2, odds ratios of influenza infection decreased from 0. 10 to 0. 015 with improving score of hygienic habits (P 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 600. 001). Independent protective factors against influenza infection included good hygienic habits, higher hand-washing score, providing soap or hand cleaner beside the hand-washing basin, and receiving influenza vaccine. Regular hand-washing and good hygienic habits were associated with a reduced risk of influenza infection. These findings support the general recommendation for nonpharmaceutical interventions against influenza. 26986125 PMC 483990...|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, a 1000 Hz {{tone for}} 200 ms {{represents}} a 10p coin, and 1000 Hz for 350 ms represents a 50p coin. Prior to this system, the earliest UK pay-on-answer payphones used a resistance, {{inserted into the}} loop for one or several short periods followed by a short flash (complete disconnection), to signal units of money inserted. Phreaks simulated these signals by unscrewing the microphone cover of the handset and inserting into the microphone circuit a resistor in parallel with a press-to-open push-button, getting the timing correct was difficult and failure to do this {{would result in the}} relay set controlling the call at the exchange to release, dropping the call.

50|$|Charles Smith died in December 1880, his {{interest}} in the Marburg saw mill and land passing to his son Thomas. TL Smith named the property Woodlands, expanded the saw mill - adding a joinery plant - and in the early 1880s, as the district converted to agriculture, moved into sugar cultivation and manufacture. The first sugarcane was planted , a sugar mill was erected next to the saw mill in 1882, and the first crushing and sugar manufacture took place in 1883. TL Smith invested heavily in the sugar mill, erecting a sugar refinery in 1884, an electric light system in 1885 (illuminating the mills, offices, stables, and his private <b>residence),</b> a <b>telephone</b> line between the Marburg mills and Walloon (the nearest telegraph station) in 1885 and a large rum distillery near the mills in 1886. In 1888 he installed more powerful machinery in the sugar mills and distillery, and laid steel tramways on the Woodlands estate to transport sugar cane and other produce to the mills. By 1889, TL Smith's sugar mill and distillery were considered the most powerful and by far the most modern, in Southern Queensland. In March 1889, giving evidence before the Royal Commission into the Queensland Sugar Industry, TL Smith stated that he was employing 36 South Sea Islanders at Woodlands, which comprised about 1200 acres, with 250 acres under cane. He claimed to have invested £20-25,000 in the sugar mill, distillery, planting, fencing, and tramway. In the late 1880s, Smith also began to plant grapes on the Woodlands estate, intending to expand into the production of wines and brandies.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To compare {{rates of}} past {{reported}} {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) in a prisoner sample with those in a control group drawn from the same location of usual residence. Method: The prisoner group comprised a consecutive sample of men (n= 200) received into custody and screened by face-to-face interview. The control group comprised men (n= 200) matched for location of usual <b>residence</b> screened by <b>telephone</b> interview. Participants were asked about past TBIs and screened for drug and alcohol abuse, impulsivity and dissocial personality disorder. Results: Eighty-two per cent of prisoners and 71. 5 % of community participants reported at least one past TBI of any severity (i. e. {{with or without a}} loss of consciousness (LOC)) and 64. 5 % of prisoners and 32. 2 % of community participants reported at least one TBI associated with a LOC. Prisoners {{were more likely to report}} persisting side-effects of TBI and were much more likely to screen positive for impulsivity and dissocial personality disorder. Multivariate analyses found no significant association between TBI frequency or severity and custody/community group membership. Conclusions: High reported rates of TBI in prisoner populations may reflect the excess of socio-demographic risk factors for TBI. Results of the current study do not support a role for TBI as causally related to criminal conduct...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} public health problems in Tanzania and was declared as a national public health emergency in 2006. Community and individual knowledge and perceptions are critical factors in the control of the disease. The objective of this study was to analyze the knowledge and perception on the transmission of TB in Tanzania. Multinomial Logistic Regression analysis was considered in order to quantify the impact of knowledge and perception on TB. The data used was adopted as secondary data from larger national survey 2007 - 08 Tanzania HIV/AIDS and Malaria Indicator Survey. The findings across groups revealed that knowledge on TB transmission increased with an increase in age and level of education. People in rural areas had less knowledge regarding tuberculosis transmission compared to urban areas [OR= 0. 7]. People with the access to radio [OR= 1. 7] were more knowledgeable on tuberculosis transmission compared to those who did not have access to radio. People who did not have telephone [OR= 0. 6] were less knowledgeable on tuberculosis route of transmission compared to those who had telephone. The findings showed that socio-demographic factors such as age, education, place of <b>residence</b> and owning <b>telephone</b> or radio varied systematically with knowledge on tuberculosis transmission. ...|$|R
