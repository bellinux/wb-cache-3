The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions {{of as many as}} ten and as few as two subfamilies.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two goals. In the first half，this paper will re-define <b>relative</b> clauses of {{different}} kinds of languages，with emphasis on Hawaiian. Although <b>relative</b> clauses in other languages have similarity to English, the indentification of the <b>relative</b> clause in other languages is not consistent because of variation in syntax. This paper will propose a definition of the <b>relative</b> clause which can be used regardless of the variation in syntax. The revised definition will consist of two parts:(1) a <b>relative</b> clause has a structure of one of possible predicate types in that particular language，and (2) a noun modified by a <b>relative</b> clause corresponds to an element inside of the <b>relative</b> clause. The above definition makes it possible to generalize <b>relative</b> clauses in different kinds of languages. In the second half，this paper will analyze <b>relative</b> clauses in Hawaiian，using the above definition. In doing so，two types of <b>relative</b> clauses(i. e. ，the verbal <b>relative</b> clause and the prepositional <b>relative</b> clause) will be introduced...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates two {{strategies}} of <b>relative</b> clause formation in Zulu, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa. The standard way of forming a <b>relative</b> clause in Zulu involves a prefix (a so-called 'relative concord') which {{is attached to}} the predicate of the <b>relative</b> clause. In this strategy, the <b>relative</b> concord expresses agreement with the subject of the <b>relative</b> clause. In a second strategy, the <b>relative</b> concord seems to be prefixed to the first word of the <b>relative</b> clause; in this position, it agrees with the head noun. The main claim of this article is that the second strategy of <b>relative</b> clause formation in Zulu is an example of phrasal affixation. I show that the <b>relative</b> concord does not merge morphologically with the first word of the <b>relative</b> clause, but {{is attached to the}} whole <b>relative</b> clause. Following Anderson (1992), I analyse this kind of phrasal affixation as an inflectional process; the <b>relative</b> clause is a predicate, and the <b>relative</b> concord in the second strategy expresses agreement between this phrasal predicate and the head noun...|$|R
40|$|The <b>relative</b> marking in Hausa marks {{discourse}} presupposition in perfective and imperfective <b>relative</b> clauses and out-of-focus clauses {{of focus}} and fronted wh-questions. However, the <b>Relative</b> Perfective also appears in storyline narrative clauses and various accounts {{try to find}} a common feature between <b>relative</b> clauses and narrative context. This paper rejects the common feature approach to Hausa <b>relative</b> marking and presents a systematic grammaticalization account of the functions of the <b>Relative</b> Perfective. The paper shows that in temporal when <b>relative</b> clauses headed by look?cin d? 'time that', the aspectual contrast <b>Relative</b> Imperfective vs. <b>Relative</b> Perfective has vanished, and the <b>Relative</b> Perfective indexes the specific time of the event. The temporal <b>relative</b> clauses differ from locative and manner adverbial <b>relative</b> clauses, whose semantics (location and manner) are not usual inflectional categories and they therefore maintain the aspectual contrast between <b>Relative</b> Perfective and <b>Relative</b> Imperfective. The paper shows that the new temporal category, the Specific Time Marker, spread to other environments and incorporated a time orientation feature in main clauses of narrative and dialogical discourse to become a simple past.
