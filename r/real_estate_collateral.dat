Since a lender could not re-sell the property until it had been in uncontested possession for years, or unless it could show changed circumstances, the value of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>collateral</b> was significantly impaired. Impaired, that is, until lawyers concocted the bill of foreclosure, whereby a mortgagee could request a decree that unless the mortgagor paid the debt by a date certain (and after the law date set in the mortgage), the mortgagor would thereafter be barred and foreclosed of all right, title and equity of redemption in and to the mortgaged premises.|$|E
50|$|Omaisuudenhoitoyhtiö Arsenal Oy ("Asset Management Corporation Arsenal") is a {{corporation}} {{founded by the}} Government of Finland for management of assets.

(The contribution of the Säästöpankki group to the total damages to the government was 96%.) The defaulted debts led to a large amount property being passed to the government as collateral, with concomitant bankruptcy court cases where the state had an interest. In 1994, Arsenal held 4.822 million euros of assets and had 12.684 customers. In 1999, the business managing the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>collateral</b> was spun off as Kapiteeli Oyj, which was bought by Sponda in 2006. (Sponda was also founded as a result of the same crisis around real estate and stocks from the collapsed SKOP Bank, but since 2012 has had no government ownership.) Most of the remaining collateral was sold between 2000 and 2003. In 2003, Arsenal voluntarily started liquidation proceedings. As of May 2013, Arsenal had 121 debtors and 28 court cases ongoing, and kept four employees.|$|E

40|$|The shocks to {{real estate}} prices {{potentially}} have effects on banks' balance sheets, their lending behavior, and eventually economic activities. We examine {{the existence of the}} bank lending channel in Japan during the 2007 – 2013 global financial crisis. We identify the heterogeneous shocks {{to real estate}} prices that affect banks by summarizing the land prices of their borrowing firms. We use a comprehensive database on firm-bank relationships as well as information on land prices for more than 20, 000 locational points in Japan. We find that after controlling for fixed effects, a bank that faces a rise in land prices increases its capital, total loans, real estate loans, and loans backed by <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>collateral.</b> We also find that the increased land prices do not significantly change the amount of non-real estate loans or loans without <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>collateral.</b> Further, after controlling for time-varying firm fixed effects, increased land prices cause banks to reduce their transactional relationships with firms both in terms of extensive and intensive margins.

Most of the literature on systemic risk measures are about banking, as banks have long been known as a source of systemic risk.

However, the continued increase in loan default with low corresponding recovery of same has reached a worrisome dimension globally. The huge credit losses arising largely from unrecovered defaulted mortgages have attracted the attention of practitioners and academia which has led to serious empirical researches. However, it is pertinent to note that much more attention has been given to loan default than the recovery of defaulted mortgage loans. The current paper attempts to investigate the determinants of recovery of defaulted mortgage loans in Nigerian lending industry. Data on three thousand, one hundred and ninety seven (3, 197) defaulted mortgages from 1999 - 2011 were gathered from the databases of some selected Commercial Banks (CB) and Primary Mortgage Institutions (PMIs) in Nigeria. Using Logistics Regression Model (LRM), the result reveals that growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), borrower status, borrower’s history of default, year of borrower, business relationship with bank, loan supervision, age of collateral and location of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>collaterals</b> are significantly positive determinants of loan recovery.

This paper represents the first empirical test of the screening role of loan contracts that consider collateral-interest margins simultaneously. For our empirical analysis, we use a unique data set composed of bank loans granted by 28 Spanish banks to SMEs.

40|$|Consumer {{leverage}} {{can generate}} nancial crises characterized by increased bankruptcy, tightened credit access and reduced demand for goods. This paper embeds nancial frictions in the mortgage contracts of homeowners within a two-sector economy to show that, even at moderate initial levels, household indebtedness {{can create a}} lasting nancial downturn such as the subprime mortgage crisis. Using two seemingly positive disturbances that triggered the subprime mortgage crisis-an increased housing supply and a relaxation of borrowing conditions- the model demonstrates that the subprime downturn was not a precedent but the natural consequence of nancial frictions. The oversupply of houses lowers asset prices and reduces {{the value of the}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>collateral</b> used in the mortgage. This worsens the leverage of indebted consumers and raises their bankruptcy prospects generating a pro-cyclical risk premium.
