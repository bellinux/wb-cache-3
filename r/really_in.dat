5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never <b>really</b> <b>in</b> doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Jill, a {{manicurist}} {{working to}} support her family, befriends the wealthy Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), who hires her as a personal assistant. However, things turn sour when Jill has an affair with Kay's neglected husband who didn't love her, Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes). Jill ends up pregnant, and Phillip divorces Kay in the Dominican Republic. Kay offered to drive him home from the airport, but ends up running the car over a cliff, killing him. On his death bed, he invalidly married Jill. Kay offered Jill $1 million for her baby, which she declined. She gave birth to Phillip Chancellor III (eventually portrayed by Thom Bierdz) in 1976. She romances David Mallory, who was the recipient of her late father Bill's eye cornea. However, she never loved him. He proposed, but she declines after Liz warned her of a loveless marriage. She {{had an affair with}} Derek Thurston (Joe Ladue) and later romanced Stuart Brooks (Robert Colbert), whose wife Jennifer had just died. He was <b>really</b> <b>in</b> love with her mother Liz, but Jill tricked him into marriage following a one-night stand. He left her after she faked a pregnancy and miscarriage. Jill wanted to reunite with Derek, who marries Katherine after she promised him a salon and a $100,000 trust for Jill's son. Derek's ex-wife Suzanne Lynch (Ellen Weston) arrives in town and wanted him back. Kay was briefly presumed dead and finding himself free of Suzanne and Kay, Derek planned to marry Jill. Kay showed up alive at the wedding and reclaimed her life with Derek.|$|E
5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is <b>really</b> <b>in</b> order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E

25|$|The most {{convenient}} site {{is often the}} arm, especially the veins {{on the back of}} the hand, or the median cubital vein at the elbow, but any identifiable vein can be used. Often it is necessary to use a tourniquet which restricts the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge. Once the needle is in place, it is common to draw back slightly on the syringe to aspirate blood, thus verifying that the needle is <b>really</b> <b>in</b> a vein. The tourniquet should be removed before injecting to prevent extravasation of the medication.|$|E

After ritually declining three times, Ögedei was proclaimed Khagan of the Mongols on 13 September 1229. Chagatai continued to support his younger brother's claim.|$|E

25|$|No. 487 (NZ) Squadron {{came into}} being on 15 August 1942. Formed as a day bomber unit, it was {{initially}} equipped with Lockheed Venturas crewed by Royal New Zealand Air Force pilots, and based at RAF Feltwell in Norfolk. The Ventura, an update of the Lockheed Hudson, acquired a poor reputation in Europe as its performance was not <b>really</b> <b>in</b> the same league as British and German aircraft of the period. Nevertheless, operations began in December, with the squadron's first being a 16-plane raid on the Phillips factory at Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, during which it lost three aircraft, including the one flown by its commanding officer, Wing Commander F.C. Seavill.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} Bruce Report {{not only}} recommended {{the construction of}} two major new railway stations, but also {{the construction of an}} inner ring road of motorway that circled the city centre. Despite being proposed {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War it was not until the 1960s that this project was begun. This involved the construction of the M8 motorway through the east end of the city along the route of the old Monkland Canal. This part of the project was fairly non controversial as the canal was in a poor state and not <b>really</b> <b>in</b> use by this time. This portion of the ring road would form the northern flank.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh had a game {{to forget}} against Bermuda, being bowled out for 67 with only Nazim Shirazi {{reaching}} double figures as Lionel Thomas took 4-13. The Bermudians lost three wickets in reply, but were never <b>really</b> <b>in</b> trouble as they reached their target from 15.5 overs. An opening stand of 94 between KW Arnold (54) and DC Patel (52) laid the foundations for East Africa's 220/7 against Fiji, and 4-21 from Desai made sure of an 88-run victory. Malaysia put up 128 in an all-south-east-Asian clash with Singapore, but their opponents glided to a six-wicket win with more than 15 overs to spate thanks to a knock of 67 from FJR Martens.|$|E

Since the inception of Super League in 1996, they have won the title on six occasions, and have added seven Challenge Cups to their five previous successes. Indeed, they won the inaugural Super League, albeit by finishing top of the league before the play—off era. St Helens defeated Bradford 8—6 in the 1999 Super League Grand Final, their first Grand Final, with more than 50,000 people witnessing Chris Joynt lift the trophy at Old Trafford.

In January and March 1991 he posted reasonable scores of 11–4 but was never <b>really</b> <b>in</b> contention for the championship in either tournament, although {{he did have a}} memorable win over the young rising star Takahanada in March. He had to wait until May 1991 for his first title as a yokozuna, when he defeated Konishiki twice on the last day, once in their regulation match and once in the playoff, to finish with a fine 14–1 record.|$|E
25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe that someone might want another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (to take a stand against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a fait accompli in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was <b>really</b> <b>in</b> Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E
