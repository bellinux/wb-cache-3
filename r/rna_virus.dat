5|$|A {{virus has}} either a DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} DNA virus or an <b>RNA</b> <b>virus,</b> respectively. The vast {{majority}} of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of <b>RNA</b> <b>virus,</b> the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called reassortment.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of viruses infecting {{animals and plants}} today are <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> [1]. There are double-stranded (ds) <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> with dsRNA genomes, as well as (+) and (2) <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> whose genomes are single-stranded (ss) RNA of either positive or negative polarity. <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> have small genomes that rarely exceed 30 kb in size, and {{a large portion of}} their genomes is used to encode proteins involved in viral RNA replication. Viral RNA synthesis is catalyzed by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which lacks any proofreading activity. Although the details of RNA replication greatly vary among viruses, common principles clearly exist in the organization of the replication machinery of different <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> (+) <b>RNA</b> <b>Viruses</b> Replicate Their Genomes on the Surface of Host Membranes For many (+) <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses,</b> <b>RNA</b> replication requires vira...|$|R

5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an <b>RNA</b> <b>virus</b> of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an <b>RNA</b> <b>virus.</b> In 80% of people {{infected}}, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected {{for the remainder of}} their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Racaniello and Baltimore used {{recombinant}} DNA {{technology to}} generate the first infectious clone of an animal <b>RNA</b> <b>virus,</b> poliovirus.

50|$|A {{significant}} percentage of newly emerging <b>viruses</b> are <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> It is believed {{this is due to}} the fact that <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> have a much higher nucleotide mutation rate than DNA viruses.|$|R
30|$|Thus far, {{little is}} known about the {{biological}} features of archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> Whether such viruses exist in the environment requires further study via isolation and identification. However, based on these available sequences, specific primers can be designed to survey the distribution, diversity and dynamics of these putative archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> in various interesting environments. In addition, additional metagenomic sequencing work needs to be performed, which would contribute greatly to the discovery of novel archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses,</b> which in turn would provide additional insight into the diversity, evolution and ecology of archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> and their hosts.|$|R
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an <b>RNA</b> <b>virus.</b> In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded <b>RNA</b> <b>virus.</b> Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the viral particle {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. This region of the viral genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} virus attachment to host cell. Replication follows the negative stranded <b>RNA</b> <b>virus</b> replication model. Negative stranded <b>RNA</b> <b>virus</b> transcription, using polymerase stuttering is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning, ribosomal shunting, and RNA termination-reinitiation. The virus exits the host cell by budding.|$|E
30|$|Bolduc et al. {{identify}} two genomic {{fragments of}} the putative archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> (Bolduc et al. 2012). In this study, we find 9 assembled sequences {{that are related to}} the putative archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> Each sequence represents one possible novel viral genogroup or genotype. At least three viral lineages were observed phylogenetically, indicating that putative archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> are genetically diverse in the acidic hot springs and that archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> may have great diversity in light of the diversity and number of archaeal hosts in the environment being {{the same as that of}} the viruses of Bacteria and Eukarya.|$|R

40|$|Stimulator of {{interferon}} genes (STING) {{is known}} {{be involved in}} control of DNA viruses but has an unexplored role in control of <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> During infection with DNA viruses STING is activated downstream of cGAMP synthase (cGAS) to induce type I interferon. Here we identify a STING-dependent, cGAS-independent pathway important for full interferon production and antiviral control of enveloped <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses,</b> including influenza A virus (IAV). Further, IAV interacts with STING through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP). Interestingly, FP antagonizes interferon production induced by membrane fusion or IAV but not by cGAMP or DNA. Similar to the enveloped <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses,</b> membrane fusion stimulates interferon production in a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent manner. Abolishment of this pathway led to reduced interferon production and impaired control of enveloped <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> Thus, enveloped <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> stimulate a cGAS-independent STING pathway, which is targeted by IAV...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that genetic recombination occurs in many <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> We limit the discussion here to <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> that use <b>RNA</b> as their sole genetic material; therefore, these recombination events must happen at the RNA level, without utilizing a DNA intermediate. The following questions arise. Which <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> undergo recombination and at what frequency?

5|$|Some {{nucleic acids}} of <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> {{function}} directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> In other <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses,</b> the <b>RNA</b> is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses {{rely on the}} cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production {{is similar to that}} of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.|$|R

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, DNA viruses {{replicate}} within the nucleus while <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> replicate within the cytoplasm.

5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded <b>RNA</b> <b>viruses</b> largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded.
