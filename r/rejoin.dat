40|$|The {{repair of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in germinating spores was studied in {{comparison}} with that in vegetative cells. Radiation-induced single-strand breaks in the DNA of spores and of vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis were <b>rejoined</b> during postirradiation incubation. The molecular weight of single-stranded DNA was restored {{to the level of}} nonirradiated cells. The rate of the <b>rejoining</b> of DNA strand breaks in irradiated spores was essentially equal to that in irradiated vegetative cells. The <b>rejoining</b> in spores germinating in nutrient medium occurred in the absence of detectable DNA synthesis. In this state, normal DNA synthesis was not initiated. Very little DNA degradation occurred during the <b>rejoining</b> process. On the other hand, in vegetative cells the <b>rejoining</b> process was accompanied by a relatively large amount of DNA synthesis and DNA degradation in nutrient medium. The <b>rejoining</b> occurred in phosphate buffer in vegetative cells but not in spores in which germination was not induced. Chloramphenicol did not interfere with the <b>rejoining</b> process in either germinating spores or vegetative cells, indicating that the <b>rejoining</b> takes place in the absence of de novo synthesis of repair enzyme. In the radiation-sensitive strain uvs- 80, the capacity for <b>rejoining</b> radiation-induced strand breaks was reduced both in spores and in vegetative cells, suggesting that the <b>rejoining</b> mechanism of germinating spores is not specific to the germination process...|$|R

5|$|The Representatives' Centralization's {{relationship}} to the SPD was ambivalent. The organization was allied with the SPD and supported the Erfurt Program. At the same time, the party mostly opposed {{the founding of the}} Representatives' Centralization and called upon its members to <b>rejoin</b> the centralized trade unions. The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD, which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split would lead to a large loss of members. The FVdG stated it would <b>rejoin</b> the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG's organizational principles.|$|E

40|$|Five {{established}} human {{breast cancer}} cell lines and one established human bladder cancer cell line of varying radiosensitivity {{have been used}} to determine whether the <b>rejoining</b> of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs) shows a correlation with radiosensitivity. The kinetics of dsb <b>rejoining</b> was biphasic and both components proceeded exponentially with time. The half-time (t 1 / 2) of <b>rejoining</b> ranged from 18. 0 +/- 1. 4 to 36. 4 +/- 3. 2 min (fast <b>rejoining</b> process) and from 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 to 5. 1 +/- 0. 2 h (slow <b>rejoining</b> process). We found a statistically significant relationship between the survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF 2) and the t 1 / 2 of the fast <b>rejoining</b> component (r = 0. 949, P = 0. 0039). Our results suggest that cell lines which show rapid <b>rejoining</b> are more radioresistant. These results support the view that, as well as the level of damage induction that we have reported previously, the repair process is a major determinant of cellular radiosensitivity. It is possible that the differences found in DNA dsb <b>rejoining</b> and the differences in DNA dsb induction are related by a common mechanism, e. g. conformation of chromatin in the cell...|$|R
