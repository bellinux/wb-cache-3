5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders <b>released</b> <b>Last</b> Splash in August 1993; {{the album was}} very successful, and its release was {{followed}} by much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One reason was that Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album {{was going to be a}} Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal wanted to do a solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be part of any immediate Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E

David Smith scored the PlayStation 2 version 9.4 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Award" [...] and calling the Dark Alliance engine [...] "one of the best 3D engines yet devised." [...] He dismissed criticisms of the game as a [...] "Diablo clone," [...] arguing the gameplay is much deeper than such a comparison suggests. His only criticisms were some anti-climatic boss fights and repetitive music. He concluded [...] "There is honestly {{not a great deal}} to complain about here [...] Snowblind has put together one of the best engines on PS2 {{and one of the best}} hacks in the business, certainly the best a console has ever seen." [...] Kaiser Hwang scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but wrote [...] "What hurts this game's score is the fact that it is almost exactly the same game that was <b>released</b> <b>last</b> year, not that that's a bad thing. The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making. But an extra level or character, or really any added extras would've been great." [...] Fran Mirabella III scored the GameCube version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a downgrade from the PS2 version." [...] He criticized the [...] "bafflingly destroyed frame rate," [...] and commented [...] "When it was released on the PS2 a year ago, few could believe what Snowblind had pulled off on Sony's stubborn console. A year later, and quite magically, High Voltage couldn't get the engine running smoothly on GameCube." [...] Craig Harris scored the Game Boy Advance version 8 out of 10, arguing that [...] "Even though it's missing a few key elements from the original design it's based upon, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance works out very well in portable form." ...|$|E
