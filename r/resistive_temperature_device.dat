40|$|The {{development}} of environmental continuous monitoring of physicochemical parameters via portable small and inexpensive instrumentation {{is an active}} field of research as it presents distinct challenges. The {{development of}} a PCB MEMS-based inexpensive CTD system intended for the measurement of environmental parameters in natural waters, is presented in this work. Novel PCB MEMS fabrication techniques have also been developed to construct the conductivity and temperature transducers. The design and fabrication processes are based on PCB MEMS technology that combines Cu-clad liquid crystal polymer (LCP) thin-film material with a direct write photolithography tool, chemical etching and metallization of layers of electroless nickel, gold, and platinum.

40|$|The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) is {{the primary}} carrier for "pressurized" {{logistics}} {{to and from the}} International Space Station (ISS). The MPLM is transported in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle and is docked to the ISS for unloading, and reloading, of contents within the ISS shirt sleeve environment. Foil heaters, controlled originally with bi-metallic thermostats, are distributed across the outside of the MPLM structure and are utilized to provide energy to the structure to avoid exposure to cold temperatures and prevent condensation. The existing bi-metallic, fixed temperature set point thermostats have been replaced with Programmable Thermostats Modules (PTMs) in the Passive Thermal Control Subsystem (PTCS) 28 Vdc shell heater circuits. The goal of using the PTM thermostat is to improve operational efficiency of the MPLM on-orbit shell heaters by providing better shell temperature control via feedback control capability. Each heater circuit contains a programmable thermostat connected to an external temperature sensor, a <b>Resistive</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Device</b> (RTD), which is used to provide continuous temperature monitoring capability. Each thermostat has programmable temperature set points and control spans. The data acquisition system uses a standard RS- 485 serial interface communications cable to provide digital control capability. The PTM system was designed by MSFC, relying upon ALTEC support for their integration within the MPLM system design, while KSC performed the installation and ground checkout testing of the thermostat and RS- 485 communication cable on the MPLM FM 1 flight module. The PTMs were used for the first time during the STS- 121 /ULF 1. 1 mission. This paper will describe the design, development and verification of the PTM system, as well as the PTM flight performance and comparisons with SINDA thermal model predictions...|$|E

40|$|NASA field center Marshall Space Flight Center (Huntsville, AL), has {{invested}} in advanced wireless sensor technology development. Developments for a wireless microcontroller back-end were primarily focused on the commercial Synapse Wireless family of devices. These devices have many useful features for NASA applications, good characteristics {{and the ability to}} be programmed Over-The-Air (OTA). The effort has focused on two widely used sensor types, mechanical strain gauges and thermal sensors. Mechanical strain gauges are used extensively in NASA structural testing and even on vehicle instrumentation systems. Additionally, thermal monitoring with many types of sensors is extensively used. These thermal sensors include thermocouples of all types, <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>devices</b> (RTDs), diodes and other thermal sensor types. The wireless thermal board will accommodate all of these types of sensor inputs to an analog front end.

40|$|In {{this project}} {{we will be}} {{developing}} a system to help monitor temperature in data centers. This system will include software and a circuit to route <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>devices</b> (RTDs) (Figure 1) to a microchip which will output their readings as data. The system {{should be able to}} connect with 64 RTDs, read the temperatures from them, and make the data accessible over a network. This system could also be used in other situations besides data centers. The user would decide where to place the devices and how to use the temperature data. This system will allow more RTDs to be monitored by the microchip than can currently be monitored. Currently one of the microchips can control 8 RTDs in a daisy chain configuration. The system will also allow the data to be accessed over a network. With this capability the user can check on the temperatures in the data center remotely. If successful, this project will give data center managers the capability to monitor for hot spots more easily and thoroughly. The system will be composed of the circuit which routes the RTDs to the chip and the software on the computer to control everything. To design the circuit block, diagrams will be used to represent the components and their functions. More detailed models will be made using circuit design software (Figure 2). Block diagrams will also be used to lay out the functions of the software. The software will need to send the current RTD routing data to the circuit, translate the data from the microchip, store the data, and supply the data in response to queries on the network. The system will use category 5 Ethernet cables for all connections, and the MAX 31865 chip to read the RTDs. A raspberry pi device will be used as the controlling computer and will be programmed using the python programming language. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} fabricate a flexible micro <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor {{to measure the}} junction temperature of a light emitting diode (LED). The junction temperature is typically measured using a thermal resistance measurement approach. This approach is limited in that no standard regulates the timing of data capture. This work presents a micro temperature sensor that can measure temperature stably and continuously, and has the advantages of being lightweight and able to monitor junction temperatures in real time. Micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technologies are employed to minimize {{the size of a}} temperature sensor that is constructed on a stainless steel foil substrate (SS- 304 with 30 μm thickness). A flexible micro <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor can be fixed between the LED chip and the frame. The junction temperature of the LED can be measured from the linear relationship between the temperature and the resistance. The sensitivity of the micro temperature sensor is 0. 059 ± 0. 004 Ω/°C. The temperature of the commercial CREE® EZ 1000 chip is 119. 97 °C when it is thermally stable, as measured using the micro temperature sensor; however, it was 126. 9 °C, when measured by thermal resistance measurement.
