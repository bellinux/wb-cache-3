500|$|... 3 Count collectively won the WCW Hardcore Championship on WCW Monday Nitro in February 2000. This win made 3 Count {{the first}} trio {{to win the}} Hardcore Championship. At Uncensored, Brian Knobbs {{defeated}} all members of 3 Count to win the Hardcore Championship. During a match, Helms suffered a broken nose, and was sidelined while he recovered. Upon his <b>return,</b> <b>Tank</b> Abbott had {{been added to the}} group, as a fan, and was utilized in an enforcer role. 3 Count had a long-running feud (scripted rivalry) with The Jung Dragons, with the Dragons attempting to steal 3 Count's fictional recording contract. This led to a ladder match between the two teams at New Blood Rising, which 3 Count won due to Abbott's interference. As a result, Abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of 3 Count, and was kicked out by the other three members, leading to a feud.|$|E

5000|$|Open-loop: Pump-inlet and motor-return (via the {{directional}} valve) {{are connected}} to the hydraulic tank. The term loop applies to feedback; the more correct term is open versus closed [...] "circuit". Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow. The flow is <b>returned</b> to <b>tank</b> through the control valve's open center; that is, when the control valve is centered, it provides an open <b>return</b> path to <b>tank</b> and the fluid is not pumped to a high pressure. Otherwise, if the control valve is actuated it routes fluid to and from an actuator and tank. The fluid's pressure will rise to meet any resistance, since the pump has a constant output. If the pressure rises too high, fluid <b>returns</b> to <b>tank</b> through a pressure relief valve. Multiple control valves may be stacked in series. This type of circuit can use inexpensive, constant displacement pumps.|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} several scoping {{tests with}} both Tank 50 H surrogate materials (KTPB and phenol) {{as well as}} with actual Tank 50 H solids. These tests examined whether we could destroy the tetraphenylborate in the surrogates or actual Tank 50 H material either by use of Fenton's Reagent or by hydrolysis (in Tank 50 H conditions at a maximum temperature of 50 degrees C) under a range of conditions. The results of these tests showed that destruction of the solids occurred only under a minority of conditions. (1) Using Fenton's Reagent and KTPB as the Tank 50 H surrogate, no reaction occurred at pH ranges greater than 9. (2) Using Fenton's Reagent and phenol as the Tank 50 H surrogate, no reaction occurred at a pH of 14. (3) Using Fenton's Reagent and actual Tank 50 H slurry, a reaction occurred at a pH of 9. 5 in the presence of ECC additives. (4) Using Fenton's Reagent and actual Tank 50 H slurry, after a thirty three day period, all attempts at hydrolysis (at pH 14) were too slow to be viable. This happened even in the case of higher temperature (50 degrees C) and added (100 ppm) copper. Tank 50 H is scheduled to <b>return</b> to HLW <b>Tank</b> Farm service with capabilities of transferring and receiving salt supernate solutions to and from the Tank Farms and staging feed for the Saltstone Facility. Before <b>returning</b> <b>Tank</b> 50 H to Tank Farm service as a non-organic tank, less than 5 kg of TPB must remain in Tank 50 H. Recently, camera inspections in Tank 50 H revealed two large mounds of solid material, one {{in the vicinity of the}} B 5 Riser Transfer Pump and the other on the opposite side of the tank. Personnel sampled and analyzed this material to determine its composition. The sample analysis indicated presence of a significant quantity of organics in the solid material. This quantity of organic material exceeds the 5 kg limit for declaring only trace amounts of organic material remain in Tank 50 H. Additionally, these large volumes of solids, calculated as approximately 61 K gallons, present other obstacles upon <b>returning</b> <b>Tank</b> 50 H to HLW service. The concerns include the potential for retention of flammable gases, nuclear criticality safety implications, and possible combustible solids formation. A recent document describes the initial results of that work...|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are provided for delivering lunar generated fluid to Earth orbit from lunar orbit. Transport {{takes place in}} an external tank of a shuttle which has been suitably outfitted in Earth orbit for reusable travel between Earth orbit and a lunar orbit. The outfitting of the external tank includes the adding of an engine, an electrical system, a communication system, a guidance system, an aerobraking device, and a plurality of interconnected fluid storage tanks to the hydrogen and oxygen tanks of the external tank. The external tank is then propelled to lunar orbit the first time using Earth-based propellant. In lunar orbit, the storage tanks are filled with the lunar generated fluid with the remainder tank volumes filled with lunar generated liquid oxygen and hydrogen which serve as propellants for <b>returning</b> the <b>tank</b> to Earth orbit where the fluid is off-loaded. The remaining lunar generated oxygen and hydrogen is then sufficient to <b>return</b> the external <b>tank</b> to lunar orbit so that a subsequent cycle of fluid delivery is repeated. A space station in a higher Earth orbit is preferably used to outfit the external tank, and a lunar node in lunar orbit is used to store and transfer the fluid and liquid oxygen and hydrogen to the external tank.

50|$|One {{of these}} tanks, {{along with a}} variety of {{personal}} items recovered with it, has been purchased by an American company, Overlord Research, LLC, based in West Virginia. The owners intend to <b>return</b> the <b>tank</b> to the United States, preferably for public display in an American Museum such as the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana or the National Museum of the United States Army, to be constructed at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Details of the repatriation of the DD Tank and its final location in the United States are still being determined. As the tank was submerged for many years, Overlord believes preservation in its current condition, which shows its loss at sea as it approached Omaha Beach, is an aspect which is more historically important than attempting a restoration.|$|R

5000|$|The {{jack-in-the-box}} {{effect is}} only known {{to occur in}} tanks which are [...] "buttoned-up" [...] (i.e. with all hatches closed and locked), and which have internally stored ammunition and no blow-off panels on the ammunition storage area. Tanks of the World War II era were frequently seen to have lost their turrets in this manner, largely owing to poor design (most designers had not yet recognized the need for special shielding of the ammunition storage compartments of tanks.). Many modern tanks (for instance, the M1 Abrams, Leopard 2, Challenger 2 and Leclerc series, to name a few) feature ammunition compartments designed to fail safely under fire as a firepower kill—when damaged, vents open to channel ignited propellants and explosives away from the crew cabin. The intact crew can then <b>return</b> the <b>tank</b> to a maintenance center or, at least, escape their disabled vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Frequent {{inlet flow}} changes {{typically}} cause problems for averaging level controllers.
