50|$|A {{hemolytic}} crisis, or hyperhemolytic crisis, {{is characterized}} by an accelerated rate of red blood cell destruction leading to anemia, jaundice, and <b>reticulocytosis.</b> Hemolytic crises are a major concern with sickle-cell disease and G6PD deficiency.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a slight}} {{correlation}} between polychromasia and <b>reticulocytosis.</b> It {{is much easier to}} test for polychromasia in blood cells than to perform special staining for <b>reticulocytosis.</b> If polychromasia is found in the blood cells, the reticulocyte count is taken to detect further disease or stress. If a low count of reticulocytes are found, it usually indicates bone marrow stress. If a high reticulocyte count is found, it is usually linked to hemolysis, but a Coombs test may be performed in this case to rule out immune-mediated hemolysis. Polychromasia can also be seen in blood smears when there is a normal reticulocyte count. This can be caused by infiltration of the bone marrow due to tumors as well as fibrosis, or scarring, of the marrow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reticulocytosis</b> is a {{condition}} where there {{is an increase in}} reticulocytes, immature red blood cells. It is commonly seen in anemia. They are seen on blood films when the bone marrow is highly active in an attempt to replace red blood cell loss such as in haemolytic anaemia, haemorrhage.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} production of red blood cells to overcome chronic or severe loss of mature red blood cells, such as in a haemolytic anemia, {{there is often a}} markedly high number and percentage of reticulocytes.

Anemia is classified as microcytic or macrocytic if the MCV value is above or below the expected normal range; anemias are classified as normocytic if the MCV is within the expected range. Other conditions that can affect MCV include thalassemia, <b>reticulocytosis,</b> alcoholism, chemotherapy, vitamin B12 deficiency, and/or folic acid deficiency.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{study on}} a three year old that was a carrier of the {{hemoglobin}} variant of Hopkins-2. The child had mild anemia and <b>reticulocytosis,</b> which is commonly seen in anemia. There were, however, no sickled cells found in the blood {{and they had no}} symptoms relating to sickle cell. There was also a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is the average volume of red blood cell count.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a natural}} way the body tries to treat this disease. It {{increases}} the erythrocyte production (<b>reticulocytosis)</b> because reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that still contain mitochondria and so can produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, a treatment option in extremely severe cases is to perform a splenectomy. This does not stop the destruction of erythrocytes but it does help {{increase the amount of}} reticulocytes in the body since most of the hemolysis occurs when the reticulocytes are trapped in the hypoxic environment of the spleen. This reduces severe anemia and the need for blood transfusions.|$|E
50|$|Hemolytic {{disease of}} the newborn, also known as {{hemolytic}} {{disease of the}} fetus and newborn, HDN, HDFN, or erythroblastosis fetalis, is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus, when the IgG molecules (one of the five main types of antibodies) produced by the mother pass through the placenta. Among these antibodies are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, breaking down and destroying the cells (hemolysis). The fetus can develop <b>reticulocytosis</b> and anemia. This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) {{are present in the}} fetal blood, and so these forms of the disease can be called erythroblastosis fetalis (or erythroblastosis foetalis).|$|E
50|$|The {{severity}} of disease produced by M. haemofelis varies, with some cats having mild anemia and no clinical signs to cats having marked depression and severe anemia. Clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, and anemia. M. haemofelis infection is suspected in cats with regenerative anemia, in which polychromasia and <b>reticulocytosis</b> are noted. During the acute phase of infection, M. haemofelis {{can be readily}} identified on stained blood films however M. haemofelis can disappear and reappear in the peripheral blood {{throughout the course of}} infection and can be mistaken for stain precipitate or vice versa. Commercially available PCR assays that detect the Mycoplasma 16s rRNA are more reliable means of diagnosis. Many such assays are species specific. Currently, no serological test for M. haemofelis is commercially available. Additional clinical findings may include positive Coombs test results, hypoglycemia, and dehydration.|$|E

40|$|Stimulated erythropoiesis and <b>reticulocytosis</b> can {{be induced}} by daily bleeding, or by {{phenylhydrazine}} (PHZ) treatment. We compared the in vivo effects of PHZ and bleeding treatment on haematological, energy and redox status parameters in {{red blood cells}} (RBC) of rats. The results showed that all followed haematological parameters were significantly lower in bleeding, compared to PHZ-treated rats. PHZ induced even 2. 58 -fold higher <b>reticulocytosis</b> as compared to bleeding treatment. Although PHZ induced higher <b>reticulocytosis,</b> respiration intensity and energy production was lower than in bleeding-induced reticulocytes. These alterations were the consequence of increased superoxide anion and peroxynitrite concentrations in PHZ-treated rats. Bleeding treatment resulted in increased activity of an antioxidative enzyme, superoxide dismutase. In conclusion, differences in these two experimental models for <b>reticulocytosis</b> {{may be used as}} tools for appropriate pharmacological testing of redox-active substances considering energy and redox processes, as well as apoptosis pathways...|$|E

By treating Plasmodium chabaudi AS–infected C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice, which are resistant to malaria, with polyclonal anti–human Epo neutralizing antibody, we demonstrated that Epo-induced <b>reticulocytosis</b> was important for alleviating malarial anemia and for host survival. By inducing erythropoiesis in A/J mice, which are susceptible to malaria, and in B 6 mice at various periods during infection, by use of exogenous recombinant murine Epo, untimely onset of <b>reticulocytosis</b> was shown to augment multiplication of parasites and result in lethal infection. However, timely inducement of <b>reticulocytosis</b> with Epo treatment alleviated malarial anemia and increased survival. Our data reveal {{the important role of}} Epo-induced <b>reticulocytosis</b> in modulating the course and outcome of blood-stage malaria. However, the mechanisms underlying the increased mortality associated with untimely treatment with Epo and the increased protection associated with timely treatment with Epo remain to be investigated.

40|$|Babesia microti is a tick-borne {{red blood}} cell {{parasite}} that causes babesiosis in people. Its most common vertebrate reservoir is the white-footed mouse. To determine whether B. microti invades reticulocytes, as does the canine pathogen B. gibsoni, we infected the susceptible inbred mouse strains C. B- 17. scid and DBA/ 2 with a clinical isolate of B. microti. Staining of fixed permeabilized {{red blood cell}}s with 4 ′, 6 ′-diamidino- 2 -phenylindole or YOYO- 1, a sensitive nucleic acid stain, revealed parasite nuclei as large bright dots. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that parasite DNA is primarily found in mature erythrocytes that expressed Babesia antigens but not the transferrin receptor CD 71. In contrast, CD 71 -positive reticulocytes rarely contained Babesia nuclei and failed to express Babesia antigens. Accordingly, the frequency of YOYO- 1 -positive, CD 71 -negative cells strongly correlated with parasitemia, defined as the frequency of infected red blood cells assessed on Giemsa-stained blood smears. Importantly, the absolute numbers generated by the two techniques were similar. Parasitemia was modest and transient in DBA/ 2 mice but intense and sustained in C. B- 17. scid mice. In both strains, parasitemia preceded <b>reticulocytosis,</b> but reticulocytes remained refractory to B. microti. In immunocompetent C. B- 17 mice, <b>reticulocytosis</b> developed early, despite a marginal and short-lived parasitemia. Likewise, an early <b>reticulocytosis</b> developed in resistant BALB/cBy and B 10. D 2 mice. These studies establish that B. microti has a tropism for mature erythrocytes. Although reticulocytes are rarely infected, the delayed <b>reticulocytosis</b> in susceptible strains may result from parasite or host activities to limit renewal of the mature erythrocyte pool, thereby preventing an overwhelming parasitemia...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Among older {{children}} with sickle cell anemia, leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, and <b>reticulocytosis</b> have previously been suggested as disease severity markers. Here we explored whether these blood parameters {{may be useful}} to predict early childhood disease severity when tested in early infancy, defined as postnatal ages 60 – 180 days. Study Design: Data from fifty-nine subjects who were followed at Children’s National Medical Center’s Sickle Cell Program {{for at least three years}} was retrospectively analyzed. Comparisons were made between white blood cell counts, hemoglobin and reticulocyte levels measured at ages 60 – 180 days and the clinical course of sickle cell anemia during infancy and childhood. Results: A majority of subjects had demonstrable anemia with increased <b>reticulocytosis.</b> Only increased absolute reticulocyte levels during early infancy were associated with a significant increase in hospitalization during the first three years of life. Higher absolute reticulocyte counts were also associated with a markedly shorter time to first hospitalizations and a four-fold higher cumulative frequency of clinical manifestations over the first three years of life. No significant increase in white blood cell counts was identified among the infant subjects. Conclusions: These data suggest that during early infancy, increased <b>reticulocytosis</b> among asymptomatic SCA subjects i...|$|E
40|$|Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an {{inherited}} hemolytic anemia with compensatory <b>reticulocytosis.</b> Recent {{studies have shown}} that increased levels of <b>reticulocytosis</b> during infancy are associated with increased hospitalizations for SCA sequelae as well as cerebrovascular pathologies. In this study, absolute reticulocyte counts (ARC) measured prior to transfusion were analysed among a cohort of 29 pediatric SCA patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) for primary and secondary stroke prevention. A cross-sectional flow cytometric analysis of the reticulocyte phenotype was also performed. Mean duration of CTT was 3. 1 ± 2. 6 years. Fifteen subjects with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) -vasculopathy had significantly higher mean ARC prior to initiating CTT compared to 14 subjects without MRA-vasculopathy (427. 6 ± 109. 0 K/μl vs. 324. 8 ± 109. 2 K/μl, p< 0. 05). No significant differences in hemoglobin or percentage sickle hemoglobin (HbS) were noted between the two groups at baseline. Reticulocyte phenotyping further demonstrated that the percentages of circulating immature [CD 36 (+), CD 71 (+) ] reticulocytes positively correlated with ARC in both groups. During the first year of CTT, neither group had significant reductions in ARC. Among this group of children with SCA, cerebrovasculopathy on MRA at initiation of CTT was associated with increased <b>reticulocytosis,</b> which was not reduced after 12 months of transfusions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{contribution}} of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes to acquired immunity to blood-stage infection with the murine malaria species Plasmodium chabaudi AS was investigated. C 57 BL/ 6 mice, which are genetically resistant to infection with this hemoprotozoan parasite and exhibit a transient course of infection, were treated intraperitoneally with monoclonal antibodies to T-cell epitopes, either anti-Thy- 1, anti-CD 4, or anti-CD 8. After intraperitoneal infection with 10 (6) parasitized erythrocytes, control C 57 BL/ 6 mice exhibited a peak parasitemia on day 9 of approximately 35 % parasitized erythrocytes and eliminated the infection within 4 weeks. Mice depleted of Thy- 1 + or CD 4 + T cells had significantly higher parasitemias on day 7 as well as significantly higher peak parasitemias. These mice were unable to control the infection and developed a persistent, high parasitemia that fluctuated between 40 and 60 % until the experiment was terminated on day 56 postinfection. Depletion of CD 8 + T lymphocytes {{was found to have}} no effect on the early course of parasitemia or on the level of peak parasitemia. However, mice depleted of CD 8 + T cells experienced two recurrent bouts of parasitemia during the later stage of the infection and required more than 5 weeks to eliminate the parasites. After the peak parasitemia, which occurred in control and experimental animals on day 9, there was a sharp drop in parasitemia coinciding with a wave of <b>reticulocytosis.</b> Therefore, {{the contribution of}} the influx of reticulocytes, which are not the preferred host cell of this hemoprotozoan parasite, to limiting the parasitemia was also examined by determining the course of <b>reticulocytosis</b> during infection in control and T cell-depleted animals. Early in infection, there was a marked and comparable <b>reticulocytosis</b> in the peripheral blood of control and T cell-depleted mice; the <b>reticulocytosis</b> peaked on day 12 and coincided with the dramatic and sudden reduction in parasitemia occurring in all groups. In both control and CD 8 -depleted mice the percentage of reticulocytes decreased as the infection was resolved, whereas in CD 4 -depleted mice marked <b>reticulocytosis</b> correlated with high, persistent parasitemia. These results thus demonstrate that both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells are involved in acquired immunity to blood-stage P. chabaudi AS and that the influx of reticulocytes into the blood that occurs just after the peak parasitemia may contribute temporarily to limiting the parasitemia...|$|E

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{evaluation of}} anemia {{begins with a}} complete blood count and reticulocyte count.

The serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity, serum ferritin level and hemoglobin electrophoresis generally separate the microcytic anemias. The erythrocyte size-distribution width may be particularly helpful in distinguishing iron deficiency from thalassemia minor.

40|$|Various {{investigators}} {{have stated that}} liver extracts, effective {{in the treatment of}} pernicious anemia, cause a {{rise in the number of}} reticulocytes in the guinea pig (1, 2, 3, 4). The route of administration (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, oral) does not affect the type of response nor the height of the reticulocyte rise, but it appears to change slightly the time of the peak of the <b>reticulocytosis.</b> Jacobson (2) defines a positive response as " a rise of the reticulocyte count to at least 2. 0 per cent on two successive days, within 6 days after the administration of the substance to be tested. " According to his data it falls on the 4 th to 7 th day following the injection. All the substances tested by him were administered intraperitoneally. Landsberg and Thompson (3) who daily injected commercial liver extract subcutaneously in the abdominal wall obtained a <b>reticulocytosis</b> with peaks between the 5 th and 11 th days following the beginning of the treatment, most of them falling on the 8 th day or later. Miller and Rhoads (4), administering liver extract orally, found the maximum <b>reticulocytosis</b> occurred between the 7 th (Received for publication February 25, 1936) and 12 th days. These data indicate that the antianemic substance, when injected intraperitoneally, produced a reticulocyte peak at an earlier time than when given either subcutaneously in the abdominal wall or orally. Liver extracts are not the only substances which cause this <b>reticulocytosis</b> in guinea pigs. Miller and Rhoads (4) found that oral administration of extracts of rice polishings and vegex, when incubated with gastric juice, will also give a similar response. The same is also true of gastric juice incubated with beef muscle, with or without pepsin, provided the gastric juice is not heated to 90 ° C. before intraperitoneal administration (2).

40|$|Severe anemia {{is a major}} {{life-threatening}} {{complication of}} malaria. Inappropriately low <b>reticulocytosis</b> in malaria patients with anemia suggests insufficient erythropoiesis, of which the mechanisms and implications are not clear. The principle growth factor that promotes erythropoiesis is erythropoietin (Epo). Studies determining the serum level of Epo in malaria infected patients have been inconclusive. Furthermore, the role of Epo and the erythropoietic response to Epo stimulation during malaria have never been examined. The purpose of the experiments performed in this thesis was, thus, to investigate the role of Epo and erythropoiesis in relation to anemia during blood-stage malaria using the murine model of Plasmodium chabaudi AS. A murine Epo specific ELISA, which {{was determined to be}} less biased by the presence of other cytokines in the samples as compared to the conventional Epo bioassay, was first developed to facilitate the research. The kinetics of Epo production in the kidney and the levels in the serum were characterized. It was demonstrated that Epo production during blood-stage malaria is mainly regulated by the degree of anemia and that renal cytokines may have only a minor effect on this response. Next, the roles of Epo and erythropoiesis during blood-stage malaria were investigated by neutralization of endogenous Epo or by administration of exogenous Epo. Timely onset of Epo-induced <b>reticulocytosis</b> was shown to be important for the alleviation of malarial anemia and survival. However, <b>reticulocytosis</b> in response to Epo stimulation is severely suppressed by infection with malaria. Dissection of the upstream events of erythropoiesis demonstrated that blood-stage malaria compromises the generation of reticulocytes by suppressing the proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of erythroid-lineage cells at various stages of erythroid development.
