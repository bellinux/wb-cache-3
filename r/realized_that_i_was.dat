500|$|Martin O'Donnell {{described}} Bungie's workplace {{culture as}} [...] "a slightly irreverent attitude, and not corporate, bureaucratic or business-focused"; artist Shi Kai Wang noted {{that when he}} walked into Bungie for an interview, [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the one who was over-dressed, [...] I knew this was the place I wanted to work." [...] Frank O'Connor comically noted that at a Gamestop conference, the Bungie team was told to wear business casual, to which O'Connor replied [...] "We [...] don't do business casual." ...|$|E
500|$|Then Farel, who {{was working}} with {{incredible}} zeal to promote the gospel, bent all his efforts to keep me in the city. [...] And when he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> determined to study in privacy in some obscure place, and saw that he gained nothing by entreaty, he descended to cursing, and said that God would surely curse my peace if I held back from giving help {{at a time of}} such great need. Terrified by his words, and conscious of my own timidity and cowardice, I gave up my journey and attempted to apply whatever gift I had in defense of my faith.|$|E
2500|$|Stallman {{started the}} project {{on his own and}} describes: [...] "As an {{operating}} system developer, I had the right skills for this job. So even though I could not take success for granted, I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Silverstone {{is noted}} {{for being an}} animal rights and {{environmental}} activist. She became a vegan in 1998 after attending an animal rights meeting, saying [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the problem … I was an animal lover who was eating animals." [...] She has stated she struggled with childhood vegetarianism, stating [...] "at eight years old it's hard to stick to your guns – and so through the years I was always starting and stopping {{trying to be a}} vegetarian." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Goldsmith {{composed}} the energetic Fireworks: A Celebration of Los Angeles to conclude his first concert {{series with the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. [...] Looking back on the experience, Goldsmith later said, [...] "After starting to write {{what was to be}} a big fireworks extravaganza, I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing about the city where I was born and had lived my entire life. [...] I decided instead to make the piece a grand celebration of my childhood, growing years, my years of maturity, and all the events that climaxed with my first appearance at the Hollywood Bowl." ...|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey said {{figuring}} out how to portray all these aspects of the character was the most challenging part. [...] "For me, it was about finding that mix between vulnerability and tension and a wiseness beyond her years," [...] she said. A director advised her that less is more, and she adapted to the character, and learned more about her, via portrayal. [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> slowly developing all of these things. Someone was like, 'Is it a thing you've chosen to do, to not blink all the time?' I was like, 'Wow!' When it comes to Lexa, she's very steely-gazed, all the time. There's a presence about her and a knowingness, and she's always observant." [...] By making calculated choices, she is used to getting what she wants.|$|E

6000|$|... "Strange. I {{know your}} home town quite well. But I {{have not yet}} made my birthplace famous; in fact, I doubt whether I ever shall. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{beginning}} to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one of the failures." ...|$|R
30|$|To {{be quite}} honest, not really… I {{have learned a}} lot of math but <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> more applied math, the math {{department}} at [my school] on the whole is not an applied math department. It is much more theory-based.|$|R
2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as I found out I was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't {{want to be part of}} that game." [...] Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.|$|E
2500|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} Get Out, Peele curated a film series for the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) called The Art of the Social Thriller. The series featured classic horror films like [...] Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, and the first film of Wes Craven's Scream series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy-thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview of Get Out was preceded by the 1967 comedy-drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, [...] "It’s not an actual thriller, it’s just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of how we deal with race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand. Anybody can relate to the fear of meeting your potential in-laws for the first time... At a certain point with Get Out, I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making a sort of thriller take on Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the guy who just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E

2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E

6000|$|All at once {{a terrible}} thing {{happened}} ... at least, I thought it a terrible thing then.

6000|$|... "I'm {{not on the}} sick-list," [...] he said, gruffly.

60|$|It was odd {{to wake up}} and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in London. Years {{seemed to}} have passed since I had left it.
