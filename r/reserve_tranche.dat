Each member of the IMF is assigned a quota, part of which is payable in SDRs or specified usable currencies ("reserve assets"), and part in the member's own currency. The difference between a member's quota and the IMF's holdings of its currency is a country's <b>Reserve</b> <b>Tranche</b> Position (RTP). <b>Reserve</b> <b>Tranche</b> Position is accounted among a country's foreign-exchange reserves.|$|E
40|$|This 2002 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} that Spain {{experienced a}} {{second year of}} subdued growth in 2002 â€”albeit at a rate still well above the euro area average. This was largely owing to the relative resilience of Spain’s domestic demand, which in turn {{was supported by a}} comparatively stronger showing of investment, sustained by booming construction activity and a continued public infrastructure effort. After having been the mainstay of the earlier upswing, private consumption lost momentum, as households coped with rising inflation and higher indebtedness.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{evolution}} of monetary cooperation among BRICS members and on testing the bilateral trade andexchange rate indicators to target transaction costs as they drive export growth. It starts with the formal arrangements toensure the settlement of trade among BRICS in local currencies. An analysis of the export structures of BRICS membersreveals benefits from shifts in export structure from 2009 to 2013, first from China’s role in vertical trade integration andthen, second, as a growing source of demand for BRICS economies. With regard to the exchange rate indicators, mosttrade responses to exchange rate deviations were found to depend on the overall structure of exports. Some BRICS currencydevaluations that anticipate inflation are attributed to exchange rate discrepancies and dumping. With regard to thedivergent effects on export, Russia’s export grew largely through mineral fuel and Brazil has gained from its deepened traderelationships. Therefore, transaction costs may be reduced via common trade settlement arrangements and trade facilitation. The author introduces ideas for designing BRICS payment and settlement mechanisms. One suggestion is to build aclearing union on the platform of BRICS conditional currency reserves similar to the <b>reserve</b> <b>tranche</b> mechanism used by theInternational Monetary Fund. Another addresses cross border local currency payment systems with fine-tuning transac -tions among national clearing systems and banks...|$|E

40|$|This 2004 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} {{that over}} the past two decades, Chile has adhered to a sound and consistent policy framework. During 2000 – 03, the actual overall balance of the central government registered a deficit of just below 1 percent of GDP. Since the beginning of 2004, economic activity has picked up, {{in the context of a}} favorable external environment. The global economic recovery has helped boost export demand, particularly copper, the price of which has nearly doubled since end- 2002.

40|$|This 2002 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} {{that since}} 2000, {{economic growth in}} Costa Rica has slowed to about 2 percent. Inflation has remained at 10 percent, and unemployment has remained at about 6 percent. The external current account deficit has increased to about 5. 5 percent of GDP, reflecting {{a sharp increase in}} imports of capital goods by public enterprises, and a loss of dynamism of exports, associated in part with some weakening of international competitiveness. Progress in other areas of structural reform has also slowed in recent years.

40|$|Chile has {{successfully}} resisted contagion from neighboring countries' difficulties. Chile's inflation targeting framework {{has successfully}} anchored inflation expectations {{and increased the}} economy's {{resilience to external shocks}} while maintaining price stability. The floating exchange rate regime {{is an essential part of}} the macroeconomic policy framework and continues to serve Chile well. The interest in recapitalizing the central bank is welcomed. Executive Directors commend Chile for the transparency of monetary and fiscal policies. Chile faces the essential task of returning to sustained economic growth and relatively low unemployment.
