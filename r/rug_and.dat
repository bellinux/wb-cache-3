5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
5|$|The voice {{once again}} speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must {{be cut off}} from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still {{questions}} her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife {{from the kitchen and}} walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool <b>rug,</b> <b>and</b> Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

25|$|The current Rocky Mountains {{were raised}} in the Laramide orogeny from between 80 and 55 Ma. For the Canadian Rockies, the {{mountain}} building is analogous to a rug being pushed on a hardwood floor: the rug bunches up and forms wrinkles (mountains). In Canada, the terranes and subduction are the foot pushing the rug, the ancestral rocks are the <b>rug,</b> <b>and</b> the Canadian Shield {{in the middle of}} the continent is the hardwood floor.|$|E

All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.|$|E

I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E

25|$|The {{family moved}} to Chicago, where Frank found {{a job as a}} {{newspaper}} reporter. By then, Maud and Frank had four sons, Robert, Harry, Kenneth, and Frank. Their Chicago home had neither running water nor a restroom. Because the family's finances were dire, Maud also had to be a breadwinner. Teaching embroidery and lace-making, Maud was so successful that by February 1897, she had over 20 students. The money from her students' tuition allowed her to purchase a new <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> furniture for the house.|$|E

25|$|After {{the priests}} depart, Concetta retires to her bedroom, where she keeps several locked boxes of {{decaying}} mementos of her past, including {{the skin of}} her father's dog Bendicò, which had been made into a <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> which is now completely moth-eaten. There, because she is the most pragmatic of the three sisters, she foresees what is about to happen—the confiscation of the relics and the painting, the re-consecration of the chapel, the inevitable spreading of stories of the Salinas' humiliation, and the equally inevitable destruction of what's left of the family's reputation and prestige. Her thoughts are interrupted by a footman announcing the arrival of Princess Angelica Falconeri.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of slight deviations {{within the same}} colour is called abrash (from Turkish abraş, literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, {{who did not have}} enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven <b>rug,</b> <b>and</b> is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.|$|E
25|$|The colours {{were then}} struck to Éveillé, upon which her {{commander}} demanded Roddam come aboard his ship. Roddam refused, answering {{that if he}} was wanted on the French ship, a boat must be sent for him, or else he would rehoist the colours and defend the ship until she sank. A lieutenant was then sent over in a boat from the French ship, and Roddam came aboard. The French commander, Captain Merville, gave Roddam the bedding of the ordinary ship's company and a dirty <b>rug,</b> <b>and</b> did not allow him to change his clothes. Greenwich was ransacked, and the crew left unfed. Roddam protested, and demanded to be taken to see Bauffremont. After Roddam had expressed his grievances, Bauffremont asked Roddam why he had refused to come to present his surrender in his own boat. Roddam replied that he would have considered it a disgrace, and that his sword would have been delivered through the body of the person demanding it, had it happened to him.|$|E

500|$|The Oak Bedroom is at {{the rear}} of the house, on the western side between King William Bedroom and the Great Room. The {{marriage}} of the first Earl Spencer and Margaret Georgiana took place in secret here on 20 December 1755, during a ball which was taking place at Althorp to celebrate John's 21st birthday. Georgiana later recalled, [...] "We both behaved very well, spoke distinctly and loudly but I trembled so much I could hardly stand". As of 1998 it was furnished with deep red wall paper, <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> chairs, with oak floors, bed and chairs. There are several portraits on the wall, one of them very large above the fireplace.

Ward himself mentions that his father used a belt on him, and Larry's homelife is described as one of being hollered at and hit. In one episode, Larry begs, [...] "Don't hit me! Don't hit me!" [...] when his mother discovers him reading his sister's diary. Punishment in the show is restricted to being grounded, spending time in one's bedroom, losing movie-going or television privileges, or pulling weeds in the yard.|$|E

2500|$|Romney wool in NZ goes mostly {{into that}} country’s vast {{shipments}} of wool for the <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> carpet factories of the European Union, Asia, the USA, Australia, and NZ itself. [...] An increasing amount recently {{has been going}} to China. New Zealand is the world’s largest producer and exporter of “strong crossbred” wool (a term for wool with average fiber diameter >35.4 microns). [...] In 2002-2003, the country exported about 138,000 tonnes of wool [...] "clean basis", about half of which was of AFD >35.4 microns, the Romney domain. [...] "Clean basis" [...] refers to the net weight anticipated after thorough washing (see [...] "clean yield" [...] above); much wool moved internationally is shipped before washing as the natural oils in the fleece make it travel better. In the same year, total wool exports returned nearly NZ$ one billion , about 3% of total merchandise exports revenues for the country.|$|E
2500|$|In 1774 the [...] "Union des Cœurs" [...] lodge {{was founded}} in Liège by chevalier Pierre de Sicard, who had already founded several lodges from which he profited (according to U. Capitaine) - in the lodge's regulations, {{the cost of a}} mallet, an apron, a lodge <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> other Masonic {{equipment}} was precisely stipulated! [...] This {{was not the first time}} that the mercantile instinct had intruded into Freemasonry, with France's Grand Lodge also struggling against it at this time. [...] This was why, Ulysse Capitaine tells us, there was a huge transfer of [...] "brothers" [...] from this lodge to the [...] "la Parfaite Intelligence" [...] ("The Perfect Intelligence") lodge, created in 1775 by the Grand Orient de France. [...] A schism quickly took place in this lodge, with the creation of the [...] "la Parfaite Egalité" [...] ("The Perfect Equality") lodge, finally recognised by the Grand Orient de France in 1776. [...] Another lodge, the [...] "Indivisible", in Spa, was created by the Grand Lodge of Holland in 1778 and rejoined the Grand Orient de France (according to Ulysse Capitaine) in 1787.|$|E
2500|$|After {{wrapping}} Paul's {{body in a}} <b>rug</b> <b>and</b> {{cleaning up}} evidence of the murder and of his own presence in the apartment, Edward hears Connie leaving a message on Paul's answering machine, saying she must end the affair. Edward erases all the messages and leaves, putting Paul's body {{in the trunk of}} his car. Edward joins his wife at Charlie's school play, and late that night while Connie is sleeping, drives to a landfill and dumps Paul's body. In the ensuing days, Paul's murder plagues Edward, who is unable to stop thinking about what he has done. When two NYPD detectives arrive at the Sumner home while Edward is at work, they explain to Connie that Paul's estranged wife had reported him missing, and that they found Connie's name and phone number on his desk. Connie claims she barely knows him and that she was interested in buying books from him. A week later, the detectives return and tell Connie and Edward that Paul's body has been discovered. When police ask Connie how she met Paul, she replies that they met at a Juilliard fundraiser. To Connie's surprise, Edward corroborates her story. The detectives ask if Connie has ever been to Paul's apartment, and Connie denies even being in the Soho neighborhood any time recently. However, the police tell her that she had in fact received a parking ticket in front of Paul's apartment just a month earlier. Connie replies that she forgot about a day that she met friends for coffee at a Soho café. Several days later, Connie finds the investigator's photos of her and Paul when she takes Edward's clothes to the drycleaner, and realizes that Edward knows about the affair. That night, during a party at their home, Connie notices that the snow globe has been returned to their collection. Connie looks over at Edward, he meets her gaze knowingly, and she realizes that Edward murdered Paul.|$|E
