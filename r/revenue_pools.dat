40|$|Current {{agricultural}} {{trade negotiations}} {{under the auspices}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) call for an elimination of export subsidies. But the current language on export subsidies in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture omits an important implicit export subsidy in the form of price discrimination with or without <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> In either case, the export subsidy can be called ‘consumer only financed’. Two recent high profile trade disputes brought before the WTO concluded that price discrimination with or without price pooling constituted an export subsidy (WTO, 1999, 2004). As a result, both Canadian dairy and EU sugar export subsidies were deemed to be above that scheduled in the Agreement on Agriculture (AOA). The WTO rulings based their decision on cross-subsidization as defined by Tangermann (1997) where price support within quotas has the effect of covering fixed costs while above-quota production can be sold even if the price received for it covers only marginal cost of production. Tangermann (1997) also includes the export subsidy effect of <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling</b> in his definition of cross-subsidization. In this paper, we develop a general theoretical framework that identifies the elements of export subsidies with or without <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> In cases were there is no <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling,</b> w...|$|R

The proposal is for an accounting system that would debit a carrier's added value and credit its transfers to universal service schemes.

40|$|Cost pooling {{has been}} the most {{distinctive}} feature of the pricing policies of Australian grain handling authorities during the past 40 years. The grain handling system is characterized by extensive cost pooling in each state, both between receival points and among users at a particular receival point. The general principle is that all growers are charged the same amount per tonne, regardless of the actual cost of handling their grain. In addition, <b>revenues</b> are <b>pooled</b> across wheat lots differentiated by quality and by time and place of delivery 1. Since growers care only about net return, the effects of cost and <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling</b> are closely intertwined. Buccola has examined distributive equity issues in <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> Similar issues arise with the pooling of costs across growers. Grain handling by statutory authorities permits the operation of a pooling system by which a uniform handling charge can be made for deliveries at any point in a given state. Several different interpretations of pooling will be examined with specific reference to its operation in the grain handling system. The recent Australian economic policy debate has seen an increasing emphasis o...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{three types}} of export subsidies: taxpayer, consumer only, and producer financed. A consumer only financed export subsidy involves price discrimination and <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> We show that consumer only financed export subsidies are more trade distorting than taxpayer financed export subsidies. Domestic price discrimination alone is a consumer tax. We describe {{the conditions under which}} price discrimination for a non-traded product like fluid milk but not for a traded product also constitutes an export subsidy. Price discrimination in world markets combined with <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling</b> in the domestic market is a production subsidy (like New Zealand Dairy Board practices). We show that producer financed export subsidies can only exist if a consumer only or a taxpayer financed export subsidy is in place first. Trade distortion with a producer tax on a taxpayer financed export subsidy differs from that of a tax on a consumer only financed export subsidy. The WTO Panel ruling on Canadian dairy pricing for three milk classes is shown to be inconsistent with the economic definition of export subsidies. We conclude that export subsidies are inadequately dealt with in the Agreement o...|$|R

40|$|Several {{alternatives}} for {{the provision of}} health care to the medically indigent of Nebraska were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. These alternatives were: expansion of County Medical Assistance Programs, state-purchased health insurance policies, Medicaid expansion, <b>revenue</b> <b>pool</b> to redistribute charity care losses, all-payer rate system, mandated employer-purchased health insurance, and charity care districts. ^ These alternatives were subjected to both cost and sensitivity analysis, then ranked on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Qualitative criteria were: maintenance of the 1985 level of health, inclusion of preventive health measures, equity in distribution of unreimbursed medical expenses, and reduced incentives for cost-shifting. Quantitative criteria were cost, and percentage of medically indigent served. Qualitative criteria were integrated using the Delphi Method, and Saaty 2 ̆ 7 s Analytical Hierarchy via Expert Choice. ^ Impact analysis for each alternative on Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s health care delivery system was also performed, including the effect on total state disposable income. The alternatives were tested further under four scenarios representing expected future changes in the health care delivery system. These scenarios are: federal matching funds reduction, charity care reductions, state funding reduction, and increase in medical indigents. In this analysis the effects of varying factors, previously held constant at 1985 levels, were assessed for all criteria. The alternatives were then reranked, with state-purchased health insurance scoring highest most consistently. ^ It is recommended that the state adopt a combination of Medicaid expansion and state-purchased health insurance. This combination would best meet all qualitative criteria at a minimum system cost per indigent served. ^ If the recommended comprehensive program cannot be undertaken, a combination of programs is suggested for further research. These include Medicaid expansion, local health department expansion, state-paid insurance continuation, <b>revenue</b> <b>pool,</b> on-site medical teams and patient-imposed care limits. Because it is cost effective, prevention is emphasized by these programs. ...|$|R

Barnett at the time led the only Liberal State Government in Australia, while all others states were led by Labor Governments.

The Rudd Government's proposal was that 30 per cent of the GST <b>revenue</b> <b>pool</b> was to be dedicated towards the Commonwealth's contribution for hospital services, which had a disproportionate impact on those States receiving a less than per capita share of the GST pool (for Western Australia, this {{would have resulted in}} an estimated 64 per cent of GST revenue being forfeit). Barnett had already been angered that Western Australia was given a decreased 7.1 percent amount of the GST revenue (lower than last year's revenue amount of 8.1 percent) while Western Australia is a state that will be heavily relied upon for the nation's economic growth due to its booming resource sector. Western Australia therefore would be heavily dependent on GST revenue to fund major resource sector projects although they would not be supported by GST revenue, thus becoming extensive expenditure for the state.|$|R
