40|$|Recombination is an {{essential}} part of meiosis; in almost all organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proper chromosome segregation and the viability of meiotic products is dependent upon normal levels of recombination. In this article we examine the kinetics of the meiotic divisions in four mutants defective in the initiation of recombination. We find that mutations in any of three Early Exchange genes (REC 104, REC 114 or REC 102) confer a phenotype in which the <b>reductional</b> <b>division</b> occurs earlier than in an isogenic wild-type diploid. We also present data confirming previous reports that strains with a mutation in the Early Exchange gene MEI 4 undergo the first division at about the same time as wild-type cells. The rec 104 mutation is epistatic to the mei 4 mutation for the timing of the first division. These observations suggest a possible relationship between the initiation of recombination and the timing of the <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> These data also allow these four Early Exchange genes examined to be distinguished in terms of their role in coordinating recombination with the <b>reductional</b> <b>division...</b>|$|E

During metaphase of both divisions, ZW 10 appears {{to move from the}} kinetochores and to spread toward the poles along what appear to be kinetochore microtubules. Redistributions of ZW 10 at metaphase require bipolar attachments of individual chromosomes or paired bivalents to the spindle. At the onset of anaphase I or anaphase II, ZW 10 rapidly relocalizes to the kinetochore regions of the separating chromosomes, In other mutant backgrounds in which chromosomes lag during anaphase, {{the presence or absence of}} ZW 10 at a particular kinetochore predicts whether or not the chromosome moves appropriately to the spindle poles.

40|$|The single {{chloroplast}} of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains {{at least}} 100 {{copies of the}} chloroplast chromosome. It is not known how the chloroplast (or cell) becomes homoplasmic for a mutation that arises {{in one of these}} copies. Under suitable selection conditions, clones with chloroplast mutations for streptomycin resistance induced by methyl methanesulfonate can be recovered with direct plating after mutagenesis. Using an adaptation of the Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test, mutagenized cultures grown on nonselective liquid medium for seven to nine doublings show negligible proliferation of cells capable of forming such mutant colonies. In contrast, cells among the same cultures with reduced nuclear mutations conferring streptomycin resistance reveal considerable clonal propagation prior to plating on selection medium. Reconstruction growth-rate experiments show no reduced growth of cells with chloroplast mutations relative to either wild-type cells or to those with nuclear mutations. We propose that newly arising chloroplast mutations and their copies are usually transmitted to only one daughter cell for several cell generations by <b>reductional</b> <b>divisions</b> of the chloroplast genome. In the absence of recombination and mixing, such a reductional partition of chloroplast alleles would readily permit the formation of homoplasmic lines without the need for selection...|$|R
40|$|Meiosis is {{the process}} by which diploid cells undergo DNA synthesis, {{homologous}} recombination and pairing, followed by the <b>reductional</b> <b>division</b> then the equational division. I present work in this PhD thesis which furthers the understanding of the coordination of the initiation of meiotic recombination and the <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> Ten genes are required to initiate recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of a subset of recombination initiation proteins creates a Recombination Initiation Signal (RIS) that delays the start of MI in wild type cells. I present experiments demonstrating the first division kinetics of the two remaining recombination initiation genes that our lab had not yet studied. Rec 107 is part of the RIS, while Ski 8 is not. The RIS is conserved in a divergent Saccharomyces strain background. rec 102 and rec 104 SK 1 strains both start the first division earlier that wildtype SK 1 strains. I present evidence that suggests that the RIS acts independently of the pathway that controls securin (PDS 1) degradation. The work in this thesis expands our knowledge of the mechanism by which the RIS delays the <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> In this thesis I present experiments showing that the DNA damage, spindle and S phase checkpoints do not transduce the RIS. I establish the meiosis-specific candidate Mek 1 as a candidate for relaying the RIS. Lastly, experiments described in these chapters show that the transcriptional activator of Middle Meiosis, NDT 80, is the target of the RIS. NDT 80 transcription and activity are both necessary and sufficient to affect an earlier <b>reductional</b> <b>division,</b> similar to the early MI seen in RIS mutants...|$|E

ETCs that resume the mitotic cell cycle have reduced ploidy and are often resistant to these treatments. In search for a mechanism for genome reduction, we previously observed that ETCs express meiotic proteins among which REC 8 (a meiotic cohesin component) is of particular interest, since it favours <b>reductional</b> cell <b>division</b> in meiosis. In the present investigation, we induced endopolyploidy in p 53 -dysfunctional human tumour cell lines (Namalwa, WI-L 2 -NS, HeLa) by gamma irradiation, and analysed the sub-cellular localisation of REC 8 in the resulting ETCs. We observed by RT-PCR and Western blot that REC 8 is constitutively expressed in these tumour cells, along with SGOL 1 and SGOL 2, and that REC 8 becomes modified after irradiation. REC 8 localised to paired sister centromeres in ETCs, the former co-segregating to opposite poles. Furthermore, REC 8 localised to the centrosome of interphase ETCs and to the astral poles in anaphase cells where it colocalised with the microtubule-associated protein NuMA. Altogether, our observations indicate that radiation-induced ETCs express features of meiotic cell divisions and that these may facilitate chromosome segregation and genome reduction...|$|R

Fusion of sister kinetochores during meiosis I may underlie sister chromatid comigration in diverse organisms, but direct evidence for such fusion has been lacking.

Meiosis I kinetochores formed stronger attachments and carried more microtubule-binding elements than kinetochores isolated from cells in mitosis or meiosis II. The meiosis I–specific monopolin complex was both necessary {{and sufficient to}} drive these modifications. Thus, kinetochore fusion directs sister chromatid comigration, a conserved feature of meiosis that is fundamental to Mendelian inheritance.

40|$|All {{living organisms}} {{including}} {{plants and animals}} are composed of millions of cells. These cells perform different functions for the organism although they possess the same chromosomes and carry the same genetic information. Thus, {{to be able to}} understand multicellular organism we need to understand the life cycle of individual cells from which the organism comprises. The cell cycle is the life cycle of a single cell in the plant or animal body. It involves series of events in which components of the cell doubles and afterwards equally segregate into daughter cells. Such process ensures growth of the organism, and specialized <b>reductional</b> cell <b>division</b> which leads to production of gamets, assures sexual reproduction. Cell cycle is divided in the G 1, S, G 2 and M phase. Two gap-phases (G 1 and G 2) separate S phase (or synthesis) and M phase which stays either for mitosis or meiosis. Essential for normal life progression and reproduction is correct chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Defects in the division program lead to aneuploidy, which in turn leads to birth defects, miscarriages or cancer. Even thou, researchers invented much about the regulation of the cell cycle, there is still long way to understand the complexity of the regulatory machineries that ensure proper segregation of chromosomes. In this paper we would like to describe techniques and materials we use for our studies on chromosome segregation in the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe...|$|R
40|$|Meiosis is {{the unique}} {{process in which}} diploid cells undergo two {{consecutive}} divisions to produce haploid daughter cells. It is indispensable for sexual reproduction in all eukaryotic organisms and maintains proper chromosome number through generations. An integral step in the meiotic program is genetic recombination; recombination is required for a successful <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, recombination is initiated by DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that are created by ten recombination initiation proteins. Similar phenotypes are observed when any of these genes is mutated. This has made the mechanism by which these proteins function to initiate recombination difficult to unravel. One hypothesis is that these proteins form a functional complex for activity, in which all (or most) of them physically interact. The work described in Chapter 2 contributes to understanding the putative DSB-producing recombination initiation complex, suggesting there is substantial flexibility among initiation protein interactions. The results are also consistent with {{the view that the}} proteins assemble on the DNA. Studies in Chapter 3 examined the recombination initiation protein interactions during DSB formation in more detail using a novel experimental approach. While the initial experiments using this approach produced unexpected results, the assay is a promising tool for the future. In addition to creating DSBs, a subset of the initiation proteins perform a second function during early meiosis; they create a recombination initiation signal (RIS) to delay the onset of the <b>reductional</b> <b>division</b> in wild-type cells. Although the signal and the downstream target are well-defined, less is known about how the RIS is transduced to the downstream target. The work in Chapter 4 contributes to defining this transduction, and therefore enhances our understanding {{of the relationship between the}} recombination initiation proteins and the <b>reductional</b> <b>division...</b>|$|E
40|$|Early {{exchange}} (EE) {{genes are}} required for the initiation of meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells with mutations in several EE genes undergo an earlier <b>reductional</b> <b>division</b> (MI), {{which suggests that the}} initiation of meiotic recombination is involved in determining proper timing of the division. The different effects of null mutations on the timing of <b>reductional</b> <b>division</b> allow EE genes to be assorted into three classes: mutations in RAD 50 or REC 102 that confer a very early reductional division; mutations in REC 104 or REC 114 that confer a division earlier than that of wild-type (WT) cells, but later than that of mutants of the first class; and mutations in MEI 4 that do not significantly alter the timing of MI. The very early mutations are epistatic to mutations in the other two classes. We propose a model that accounts for the epistatic relationships and the communication between recombination initiation and the first division. Data in this article indicate that double-strand breaks (DSBs) are not the signal for the normal delay of reductional division; these experiments also confirm that MEI 4 is required for the formation of meiotic DSBs. Finally, if a DSB is provided by the HO endonuclease, recombination can occur in the absence of MEI 4 and REC 104...|$|E

40|$|Abstractboule (bol), {{a member}} of the Deleted in Azoospermia (DAZ) gene family plays an {{important}} role in meiosis (<b>reductional</b> maturation <b>divisions)</b> in a spermatogenesis-specific manner in animals by regulating translation of the downstream cell division cycle 25 (cdc 25) phosphatase mRNA. Orthologues of bol are conserved among animals and found in the genomes of hymenopteran insects, in which the general mode of reproduction is haplodiploidy: female is diploid and male is haploid. In this mode of reproduction, haploid males produce haploid sperm through non-reductional maturation divisions. The question thus arises of whether the bol gene actually functions during spermatogenesis in these haploid males. In this study, we identified two transcriptional isoforms of bol orthologue (Ar bol and Ar bol- 2), and one cdc 25 orthologue (Ar cdc 25) in the hymenopteran sawfly, Athalia rosae. Ar bol was expressed exclusively in the testis when maturation divisions occurred, while Ar bol- 2 was expressed ubiquitously. Knockdown of all bol transcripts (both Ar bol and Ar bol- 2) resulted in a lack of mature sperm, whereas males with sole knockdown of Ar bol- 2 were able to produce a small number of mature sperm. The cell cycle was arrested before maturation divisions in the testis in which all bol transcripts were knocked down, as revealed by flow cytometry. Although no mature sperm was produced, sperm elongation was partially observed when Ar cdc 25 alone was knocked down. These results indicate that Ar bol is essential for the entry and progression of maturation divisions and sperm differentiation in haploid males...|$|R

Yet, a detailed molecular characterization of meiosis has not been carried out in {{any member of the}} lophotrochozoa, a large and diverse animal clade that includes molluscs, rotifers, annelid worms, and flatworms. I have conducted an initial characterization of homolog pairing and recombination initiation in a novel model lophotrochozan, the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. Like many species, these organisms form a telomere bouquet in early meiotic prophase. This bouquet normally persists throughout pachytene, and disruption of the telomere bouquet via depletion of the nuclear envelope protein Smed-SUN 1 both disrupts homolog pairing and results in non-homologous synapsis. This work has also revealed a telomere-proximal enrichment of double strand DNA breaks (DSBs), represented by Smed-RAD 51 foci, and shown that DSB formation is dependent on the axial element protein Smed-HOP 1. Depletion of HOP 1 also disrupts progression through meiosis, and nuclei arrest in the bouquet stage without obvious homolog pairing or synaptonemal complex polymerization. Preliminary characterization of Smed-SMC 3 suggests that partial loss of sister chromatid cohesion also disrupts homolog pairing, synapsis, and progression through meiosis. This work introduces a number of novel tools and protocols for use in S. mediterranea, demonstrates that planarian spermatogenesis is a tractable model for the study of meiosis, and also suggests the existence of intriguing mechanisms that control homolog pairing, recombination and synapsis in this animal...|$|R
40|$|During mitosis, sister kinetochores {{attach to}} microtubules that extend to {{opposite}} spindle poles (bipolar attachment) {{and pull the}} chromatids apart at anaphase (equational segregation). A multisubunit complex called cohesin, including Rad 21 /Scc 1, {{plays a crucial role}} in sister chromatid cohesion and equational segregation at mitosis. Meiosis I differs from mitosis in having a reductional pattern of chromosome segregation, in which sister kinetochores are attached to the same spindle (monopolar attachment). During meiosis, Rad 21 /Scc 1 is largely replaced by its meiotic counterpart, Rec 8. If Rec 8 is inactivated in fission yeast, meiosis I is shifted from <b>reductional</b> to equational <b>division.</b> However, the reason rec 8 Δ cells undergo equational rather than random division has not been clarified; therefore, it has been unclear whether equational segregation is due to a loss of cohesin in general or to a loss of a specific requirement for Rec 8. We report here that the equational segregation at meiosis I depends on substitutive Rad 21, which relocates to the centromeres if Rec 8 is absent. Moreover, we demonstrate that even if sufficient amounts of Rad 21 are transferred to the centromeres at meiosis I, thereby establishing cohesion at the centromeres, rec 8 Δ cells never recover monopolar attachment but instead secure bipolar attachment. Thus, Rec 8 and Rad 21 define monopolar and bipolar attachment, respectively, at meiosis I. We conclude that cohesin is a crucial determinant of the attachment manner of kinetochores to the spindle microtubules at meiosis I in fission yeast...|$|R

Once initiated, the SC extends rapidly and mostly irreversibly to chromosome ends. Quantitation of SC initiation frequencies and extension rates reveals that initiation is a rate-limiting step in homolog interactions. Eliminating the dynein-driven chromosome movements that accompany synapsis severely retards SC extension, revealing a new role for these conserved motions.

In the formation of a two-spored ascus, only one spindle pole body on each meiosis II spindle was so modified. These observations suggest that the morphogenesis of spores is regulated at meiosis II by limiting the number of SPBs gaining the outer plaque.

40|$|In meiosis, the {{segregation}} of chromosomes at the <b>reductional</b> <b>division</b> is accomplished by first linking homologs together. Genetic exchange generates the bivalents that direct regular chromosome segregation. We show that genetic exchange in mitosis also generates bivalents and that these bivalents direct mitotic chromosome segregation. After FLP-mediated homologous recombination in G 2 of the cell cycle, recombinant chromatids consistently segregate {{away from each other}} (x segregation). This pattern of segregation also applies to exchange between heterologs. Most, or all, cases of non-x segregation are the result of exchange in G 1. Cytological evidence is presented that confirms the existence of the bivalents that direct this pattern of segregation. Our results implicate sister chromatid cohesion in maintenance of the bivalent. The pattern of chromatid segregation can be altered by providing an additional FRT at a more proximal site on one chromosome. We propose that sister chromatid exchange occurs at the more proximal site, allowing the recombinant chromatids to segregate together. This also allowed the recovery of reciprocal translocations following FLP-mediated heterologous recombination. The observation that exchange can generate a bivalent in mitotic divisions provides support for a simple evolutionary relationship between mitosis and meiosis...|$|E
40|$|The MRE 4 gene was cloned by {{complementation}} of the defects of meiotic recombination and haploidization in an mre 4 - 1 mutant. Disruption of MRE 4 {{resulted in}} reduced meiotic recombination and spore inviability. The mre 4 spore lethality can be suppressed by spo 13, a mutation that causes cells {{to bypass the}} <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> Analysis of meiotic DNA extracted from the mre 4 mutant cells revealed that double-strand breaks occurred at the two sites of the HIS 4 -LEU 2 recombination hot spot, but at a frequency of about 10 - 20 % of the wild type. Northern blot analysis indicated that the MRE 4 gene produces four transcripts of 1. 63, 3. 2, 4. 0 and 6. 2 kb. All of these transcripts are absent from mitotic cells and are meiotically induced. The DNA sequence of the MRE 4 open reading frame predicts a 497 -amino acids protein with a molecular mass of 56. 8 kDa. The Mre 4 protein contains highly conserved amino acid sequences found specifically in serine-threonine protein kinases. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation is required directly or indirectly for meiotic recombination...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{connection}} between homologous chromosomes is normally required for their proper segregation to opposite poles {{at the first}} meiotic division (MI). This connection is generally provided by the combination of reciprocal recombination and sister-chromatid cohesion. In the absence of meiotic recombination, homologs are predicted to segregate randomly at MI. Here we demonstrate that in rec 12 mutants of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which are devoid of meiosis-induced recombination, homologs segregate to opposite poles at MI 63 % of the time. Residual, Rec 12 -independent recombination appears insufficient {{to account for the}} observed nonrandom homolog segregation. Dyad asci are frequently produced by rec 12 mutants. More than half of these dyad asci contain two viable homozygous-diploid spores, the products of a single <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> This set of phenotypes is shared by other S. pombe mutants that lack meiotic recombination, suggesting that nonrandom MI segregation and dyad formation are a general feature of meiosis in the absence of recombination and are not peculiar to rec 12 mutants. Rec 8, a meiosis-specific sister-chromatid cohesin, is required for the segregation phenotypes displayed by rec 12 mutants. We propose that S. pombe possesses a system independent of recombination that promotes homolog segregation and discuss possible mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Recombination and {{chromosome}} synapsis bring {{homologous chromosomes}} together, creating chiasmata that ensure accurate disjunction during <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> SPO 13 {{is a key}} gene required for meiosis I (MI) reductional segregation, but dispensable for recombination, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Absence of SPO 13 leads to single-division meiosis where reductional segregation is largely eliminated, but other meiotic events occur relatively normally. This phenotype allows haploids to produce viable meiotic products. Spo 13 p is thought to act by delaying nuclear division until sister centromeres/chromatids undergo proper cohesion for segregation to the same pole at MI. In the present study, a search for new spo 13 -like mutations that allow haploid meiosis recovered only new spo 13 alleles. Unexpectedly, an unusual reduced-expression allele (spo 13 - 23) was recovered that behaves similarly to a null mutant in haploids but to a wild-type allele in diploids, dependent {{on the presence of}} recombining homologs rather than on a diploid genome. This finding demonstrates that in addition to promoting accurate homolog disjunction, recombination can also function to partially substitute for SPO 13 in promoting sister cohesion. Analysis of various recombination-defective mutants indicates that this contribution of recombination to reductional segregation requires full levels of crossing over. The implications of these results regarding SPO 13 function are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During meiosis, two {{successive}} divisions occur {{without any}} intermediate S phase to produce haploid gametes. The first meiotic division {{is unique in}} that homologous chromosomes are segregated while the cohesion between sister chromatids is maintained, resulting in a <b>reductional</b> <b>division.</b> Moreover, {{the duration of the}} first meiotic M phase is usually prolonged when compared with mitotic M phases lasting 8 h in mouse oocytes. We investigated the spindle assembly pathway and its role in the progression of the first meiotic M phase in mouse oocytes. During the first 4 h, a bipolar spindle forms and the chromosomes congress near the equatorial plane of the spindle without stable kinetochore– microtubule end interactions. This late prometaphase spindle is then maintained for 4 h with chromosomes oscillating in the central region of the spindle. The kinetochore–microtubule end interactions are set {{up at the end of}} the first meiotic M phase (8 h after entry into M phase). This event allows the final alignment of the chromosomes and exit from metaphase. The continuous presence of the prometaphase spindle is not required for progression of the first meiotic M phase. Finally, the ability of kinetochores to interact with microtubules is acquired at the end of the first meiotic M phase and determines the timing of polar body extrusion. Key words: meiosis • microtubule • kinetochore • chromosome • spindle assembly checkpoin...|$|E
