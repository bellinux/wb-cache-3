25|$|The generic ident were {{replaced}} with ones produced by Tyne Tees, featuring a large <b>reflective</b> <b>block</b> which the viewpoint rotated around, before panning up to reveal {{it is the}} Tyne Tees logo. The music from the previous generic look was retained. Three variations were used, one with a black background, one with a multi coloured background and one with a grey background, with each version taking over from its predecessor {{after only a few}} months of use.|$|E
40|$|The device {{includes}} a <b>reflective</b> <b>block</b> (5) onto {{which at least}} two parallel output radiation field parts of a one or two dimensional array (3) of solid state or semiconductor lasers are directed. The beams are to be reflected off a surface to change the direction and orientation of the emissions. The reflector block has a stepped surface profile (6). The angle at which the block is set relative to the laser array determines the shape and form of the reflected emission pattern and the block can be moved in the XY plane. Typically each laser output is reflected off surface level and an emission pattern (8) with an angled form is produced. ADVANTAGE - Allows pattern of laser array emissions to be easily and cheaply changed...|$|E
50|$|Sch√ºfftan {{placed a}} plate of glass at a 45-degree angle between the camera and the {{miniature}} buildings. He used the camera's viewfinder to trace an outline of the area into which the actors would later be inserted onto the glass. This outline was transferred onto a mirror and all the reflective surface that fell outside the outline was removed, leaving transparent glass. When the mirror {{was placed in the}} same position as the original plate of glass, the <b>reflective</b> part <b>blocked</b> a portion of the miniature building behind it and also reflected the stage behind the camera. The actors were placed several meters away from the mirror so that when they were reflected in the mirror, they would appear at the right size.|$|R
40|$|A {{location}} sensing {{radio frequency}} identification (RFID) system has been developed employing a single directional antenna. This system enabled a mobile robot to identify, locate, and approach a stationary transponder. However, since the system determined the bearing of the transponder by scanning the environment about the azimuth axis, it faced difficulties if the transponder was not stationary. Also, even though the accuracy was within a reasonable range, it may deteriorate {{in the case of}} occlusions and cluttered environments. In this paper, we propose a dual directional antenna system to enhance RFID location sensing in dynamically changing environments. The dual directional antenna is a set of two identical directional antennas perpendicularly positioned to each other having a phase difference. A mobile robot system equipped with the proposed antenna can determine the bearing of the transponder using the ratio of the signal strength between two antennas. The proposed system, not requiring rotation of the antenna, is available to track the heading of a moving transponder and can minimize the environmental effects causing signal distortions. To verify the robustness of the proposed system to any <b>reflective</b> or signal <b>blocking</b> obstacles and moving transponders, we perform experiments under various conditions with applications to mobile robot navigation. ...|$|R
40|$|Apertures {{are usually}} placed in optical systems to reduce {{unwanted}} light, which generally comes from sources {{other than the}} intended object. However, even though geometrical rays may be blocked from the detector plane, diffraction of the unwanted radiation will produce an increase in measured irradiance. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} dissertation is to model this diffractive scatter in a system of one or two circular apertures and confirm or reject the model through comparison of theoretical and experimental results. The model is based on the Geometric Theory of Diffraction, which uses coefficients of diffraction to predict the complex amplitude of an electromagnetic field following a diffracting aperture. A near field sampling theorem is derived and applied to both one and two aperture calculations. In addition, because this theory relies on root finding techniques to determine points of diffraction, a modification is made to the one-dimensional bisection method for use as a global root-finding technique for the case of two apertures. Comparison of theoretical and experimental data confirms the validity of the model for both cases. However, because diffraction from the second aperture is so weak, results from one aperture are shown to correctly model diffraction for the two aperture case as well. Furthermore, because theoretical results for both one and two aperture cases are quite close, but agreement between theory and experiment is better for the two aperture case, the role of the second aperture is determined to be that of <b>blocking</b> <b>reflective</b> scatter from the rim of the first aperture...|$|R
