5000|$|The opened valves port high {{pressure}} hydraulic fluid to the ″Hydraulic Ram Cylinder″ in the Slide behind the tray. The <b>Ram</b> <b>Cylinder</b> {{is connected to}} the [...] "Rammer Cross Head". (The white horizontal bar behind the Spade in the picture.) The Cross Head supports the Rammer Spade as it moves in the tray. When the cylinder is pressurized, the Cross Head and Spade are driven forward in the Tray.|$|E
5000|$|As the spade moves forward, {{it pushes}} the {{projectile}} and powder case into the chamber. The spade's time of travel, {{from the rear}} of the tray to the breech, is one second. As it approaches breech, the Cross Head pushes through a spring latch that locks it there. At the same time, the Cross Head trips another lever connected to the Rammer Controller, and the Controller releases the hydraulic pressure to the <b>Ram</b> <b>Cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|A jigger {{works like}} a pulley block, but in reverse. Rather than turning an easy pull on a rope into a {{powerful}} lift, the jigger uses the powerful force of a hydraulic ram, but limited in how far it can travel, to pull a long length of chain. The chain is looped several times lengthwise around the <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder,</b> running {{over a number of}} pulleys at each end. When the cylinder moves, the pull {{on the end of the}} chain is multiplied by the number of loops. The force of the jigger's pull is reduced similarly, according to how many times the chain was looped. As the cylinder had adequate power to begin with, and could simply be made larger in diameter when needed, this was not a significant limit on the jigger's force.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{electromagnetic}} scattering from an isotropic homogeneous chirally coated conducting cylinder is analysed. The cylinder {{is assumed to}} be illuminated by either a transverse magnetic or a transverse electric wave. Mie's analysis is used to evaluate the scattering characteristics. The computed results include the evaluation of the normalized scattering width and the absorption efficiency. The results show that there is a significant reduction in the normalized scattering width as compared to a <b>RAM</b> coated <b>cylinder.</b> This reduction has been attributed to increased absorption...|$|R
40|$|A <b>ram</b> and <b>cylinder</b> {{penetrometer}} was de-signed {{to measure}} the viscosity of impres-sion materials at their time of placement. Viscosity {{had no effect on}} accuracy or sta-bility of the impression materials within the viscosity ranges studied. The accuracy of impression materials is af-fected by a number of factors that have received widespread attention. Some of these are the type of material used, the thickness of the impression material between the tooth and the impression tray, the method of at-taching the impression material to the tray, and the time of pouring (casting) the im-pression...|$|R
50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} {{can be used}} on many {{press column}} applications, especially where large thread sizes are required. Thrust collars ease assembly and disassembly on large press columns, while greatly reducing critical problems such as thread galling and seizing. Multi-jackbolt tensioners are also used on tie-rods, bearing blocks, high-pressure piping, die cushions, <b>cylinder</b> <b>ram</b> bolting, and anchor bolts.|$|R
30|$|For {{the static}} bending test, a {{universal}} testing machine of 200 -kN capacity (made by Tokyokoki Seizosho Ltd.) {{was used for the}} 100 -kN range. Third-point loading was applied with a total span of 360  cm. The total span deflection of green round timber was measured using the CDP- 100 displacement gauge with 10 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection. The targeted duration of testing was 5  min. The apparent Young’s modulus was obtained based on the total span deflection, and calculated at the middle circumference of the round timber. The bending strength was calculated at the circumference of a failure part from the ratio of the mid-length circumference to the circumference at the loading point. However, 9 of the 40 green round timbers did not show failure, even at the extension limit of the testing machine’s <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder.</b> For these specimens, load at the extension limit of the test machine’s <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder</b> was considered the maximum load. For the air-dried round timber, the total span deflection was measured using the rolled-in type DP- 500 E displacement gauge with 50 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection of air-dried round timber. All air-dried round timbers failed within the extension limit of the <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
30|$|The load {{feedback}} {{function in}} the 250  t press is less favorable during high-temperature data collection; the sample height may change because of the uniaxial nature of the opposed anvil devices, as the hydraulic ram compresses the HPXMT module along the vertical axis. This results in blurry tomography images. We have implemented a precision linear-voltage displacement transducer and added an option for feedback on {{the position of the}} hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This option keeps the sample cell vertical movement to a minimum throughout the tomography data collection.|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} propulsion and pyrotechnic {{test program}} has been in progress at the NASA White Sands Test Facility since 1995. This program created the capabilities to: accurately measure and characterize pyrovalve combustion product blow-by into propellant systems; characterize valve operation using a Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR); and evaluate hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine thermal decomposition initiated by blow-by. These capabilities were further utilized and refined this year. Low blow-by pyrovalves manufactured by Conax Florida Corporation continued to be evaluated as a potential corrective measure for blow-by induced propellant explosions. Development and testing of various advanced pyrovalves and investigation of explosion mechanisms also continued. Current and near-term testing includes: evaluation of 3 / 8 in. Conax pyrovalves and other commercially available valves; development and testing of advanced pyrovalve subcomponent technologies including a zero blow-by pyrovalve ram, composite overwrapped <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and a zero particulate generating poppet; investigation of non-destructive evaluation techniques to evaluate pyrovalve ram seals; and testing and modeling of pyrotechnically induced explosive hydrazine decomposition. Evaluation of 3 / 8 in. Conax valves will include operational margin testing to be accomplished at NASA Langley Research Center. The test program also seeks to compile and format significant amounts of data from this and other pyrovalve test programs to generate a pyrovalve applications handbook. The handbook will facilitate formation of standards that ensure safe spacecraft applications. Current data and future plans are discussed, and community interaction is encouraged...|$|E

5000|$|Clarke's machine {{would use}} a {{hydraulic}} <b>ram</b> to insert <b>cylinders</b> of ammonal explosive about 6 ft underground. After detonation, the machine would advance into the crater it had just created and repeat the process. The machine would be protected by 6 in of armoured plate at the front {{to protect it from}} its own explosions and similarly at the top and rear as a defence against enemy fire. In one record, Clarke mentions [...] "I envisaged a machine that would by hydraulic means more or less row itself through the ground." [...] The machine's trench would be about 6 by 4 ft.|$|R
25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the <b>rams</b> and their <b>cylinders,</b> buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|R
5000|$|He placed Cornara's severed {{head on a}} fence {{railing and}} planted two Jihadist flag banners {{alongside}} it. The head had a cloth thrown over it with the Shahada written on it: [...] "There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet." [...] The headless body and a knife {{were found on the}} ground nearby. Salhi attempted to blow up the factory by <b>ramming</b> several gas <b>cylinders,</b> causing an explosion. Two other people were injured in the process. Video surveillance footage showed that the perpetrator also tried to open canisters containing flammable chemicals before being subdued minutes later. He shouted [...] "Allahu Akhbar" [...] as he met and was overpowered by firefighters responding to the scene. The perpetrator had also photographed himself with the slain victim and sent the image to at least one other person via WhatsApp, a French man who later joined ISIL.|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} written {{as a result}} of a Bachelor Degree Project, {{together}} with Swepart Transmission AB. The report contains the construction of a hydraulic press for the assembly operation. The project started with a new construction of a hydraulic press for the bearings’ assembly. The goal within the thesis work was to fit the three bearings to the housing by only one press motion. This operation should be very safety because of the sensitive tolerance at the bearings and housing. Construction of the <b>cylinders,</b> <b>rams</b> and bolster were the most important parts at this project because this parts’ functions are very important for this assembly. The next step of this thesis was to calculate the hydraulic press components’ parameters and then choose the suitable components. The focus was to choose more useful and reliable components. The hydraulic press was modeled in the CAD program Solid Works and 2 D technical drawing was drawn in the Autocad. The frame material was chosen and the frame was analysised in the Solid Works...|$|R
50|$|This device {{consist of}} a metal ram with a hinged end. Attached to the <b>ram</b> are {{hydraulic}} <b>cylinders</b> that push the ram upward about 65 degrees off a base trailer with supporting outriggers, or concrete set in. Attached to {{the opposite end of}} the ram the hitch is on, is a drive motor in which a circular boom is fixed. The boom primarily consist of foldable triangular truss structures. Attached to the parameter of the boom are gondola cars with kite tops. The cars are designed to hold 3 people in a laid position. In the center most models of these rides have a triangle center ornament with lights. This ride also has a very strong light package bar set, running along the perimeter of the boom. The ride most commonly uses kites, flags and banners in its operating structure to hide its skeletal lurking beams. The rides paint usually consists of neon, or bold colors. The overall design of the ride is similar to the Star Trooper ride, also manufactured by Dartron.|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{automation}} in manufacturing industries are leading to data sets of increasing size and dimension. The challenge facing statisticians and field professionals {{is to develop}} methodology to help meet this demand. Functional data {{is one example of}} high-dimensional data characterized by observations recorded as a function of some continuous measure, such as time. An application considered in this thesis comes from the automotive industry. It involves a production process in which valve seats are force-fitted by a <b>ram</b> into <b>cylinder</b> heads of automobile engines. For each insertion, the force exerted by the ram is automatically recorded every fraction of a second for {{about two and a half}} seconds, generating a force profile. We can think of these profiles as individual functions of time summarized into collections of curves. The focus of this thesis is the analysis of functional process data such as the valve seat insertion example. A number of techniques are set forth. In the first part, two ways to model a single curve are considered: a b-spline fit via linear regression, and a nonlinear model based on differential equations. Each of these approaches is incorporated into a mixed effects model for multiple curves, and multivariate process monitoring techniques are applied to the predicted random effects in order to identify anomalous curves. In the second part, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to cluster low-dimensional summaries of the curves into meaningful groups. The belief is that the clusters correspond to distinct types of processes (e. g. various types of “good” or “faulty” assembly). New observations can be assigned to one of these by calculating the probabilities of belonging to each cluster. Mahalanobis distances are used to identify new observations not belonging to any of the existing clusters. Synthetic and real data are used to validate the results...|$|R
5000|$|In 1969 Pontiac created four {{versions}} of the Ram Air V engine: a 303 cuin L short deck version for SCCA Trans-Am racing, a 366 cuin L variant for NASCAR, a 400 cuin L version for street use in GTOs and Firebirds, {{as well as a}} 428 cuin L adaptation for drag racing. The cylinder head design is similar to the Ford FE tunnel-port head used in the GT40 and Can-Am series racing. So large are the intake ports that the pushrods run through the center of each port via pressed-in tubes, in addition to streamlined airfoils over the tubes themselves to improve port shape, and increase flow velocity. The 303 had shorter connecting rods, smaller 2.5 in journals and a solid lifter version of the Ram Air IV camshaft. It shared the 4.121 in bore of the 400, but with a 2.84 in stroke for a displacement of 303 cu in. The short deck engine weighed about 40 lb less than the other variants and had an 8000 rpm redline. Pontiac’s SCCA Trans-Am program was promising, with race-ready engines producing [...] to , however the series’ General Competition Rules required the manufacturer to produce no less than 250 vehicles with the 303. Plans were made to produce Firebirds and GTOs with advertised ratings of [...] and [...] respectively but concerns about emissions, the response of the automobile safety lobby, and the warranty implications of a high-revving street engine led to cancellation of the program [...] The total number of Ram Air V engines produced is not known and a handful of Ram Air V 303's may have made their way onto the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am assembly line. Only about 25 303 cu in engines were produced and about a dozen 428s and 366s. More 400 cu in engines were produced by Pontiac than the other versions - estimates range from 80 to 200 units. Quite a few 400s were dealer installed. Ram Air V engines are extremely rare and parts are not readily available. <b>Ram</b> Air V <b>cylinder</b> heads as used on the 400 CID version had a intake port volume of 290cc, nearly twice the size of a typical standard D-port Pontiac head- and flowed in the area of 315cfm @ [...]800" [...] valve lift; {{in the realm of the}} Nascar-dominating Chrysler 426 Hemi. With the intake port pushrod tube airfoils removed, intake port volume was 315cc.|$|R
