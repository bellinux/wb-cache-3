5|$|The {{riots in}} which Blakelock died took place within {{a wave of}} social unrest across England. Since the 1980 St. Pauls <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> Bristol, and {{particularly}} since the 1981 Brixton <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> south London, a series of incidents had sparked violent confrontations between black youths and largely white police officers.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> Chicago and the {{subsequent}} trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor {{box office}} returns, The Shawshank Redemption opened to {{generally}} positive reviews. Some reviewers compared {{the film to}} other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and <b>Riot</b> <b>in</b> Cell Block 11. Gene Siskel said that like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.|$|E
5000|$|These weren't to be {{the last}} <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> the area. In 1987 there was further <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> Chapeltown and in 2001 there was {{widespread}} <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> nearby Harehills.|$|R
50|$|The Chapeltown riot of 1975 {{occurred}} in the troubled Leeds district of Chapeltown in West Yorkshire, England. They {{were not to be}} the last <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> the area following further <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> 1981 and 1987 and further <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> nearby Harehills in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{mutual trust}} between Hindu and Muslim {{communities}} {{had reached a}} low in the 1920s, and riots were seen frequently across many cities of India. In 1923, India witnessed eleven <b>riots,</b> <b>in</b> 1924 there were eighteen <b>riots,</b> <b>in</b> 1925 there were sixteen <b>riots,</b> and <b>in</b> 1926 there were thirty five <b>riots.</b> <b>In</b> the twelve months from May 1926 to April 1926, 40 more riots occurred across various cities. They mostly occurred in Bengal, Punjab and United Provinces (UP). Lahore riots of August 1927 were the most deadly recorded <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> this series.|$|R
5|$|In 1930, Mayor William Hale Thompson, a {{flamboyant}} Republican, {{invoked the}} <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> a misleading pamphlet urging African Americans {{to vote against}} the Republican nominee, Rep Ruth Hanna McCormick, in the United States Senate race for her late husband's seat. She was the widow of Sen. Joseph Medill McCormick as well as the sister-in-law of Chicago Tribune publisher Robert Rutherford McCormick. The McCormicks were a powerful Chicago family whom Thompson opposed.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was already}} under way in January 2005, when Baron Cohen caused a near <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> what would ultimately be the rodeo scene in the final cut of the film. An interview with Baron Cohen by Rolling Stone indicated that more than 400 hours of footage had been shot for the film.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{made little}} or no {{distinction}} between Pussy Riot and Voina, incorrectly attributing past actions of Voina to Pussy <b>Riot.</b> <b>In</b> particular, a notorious performance by Voina in St. Petersburg, {{in which a woman}} stole a chicken from a supermarket by stuffing it in her vagina, is sometimes cited by detractors of Pussy Riot. However, {{there is no evidence that}} members of Moscow-based Pussy Riot participated in this action.|$|E
50|$|Around 500 {{people were}} arrested for <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> Shropshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire with around 2,000 people taking part <b>in</b> the <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> these {{counties}} with several hundred more in Birmingham.|$|R

5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrations {{and protests}} by the demobilized {{personnel}} {{eventually led to}} a <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> which three died on May 5, 1998. As a result, Taylor authorised {{the formation of a}} commission to submit recommendations on how the AFL should be reorganized. The commission, led by Blamoh Nelson, Director of the Cabinet, submitted its report on December 17, 1998, recommending a 6,000-strong armed forces (5,160 Army, 600 Navy, and 240 Air Force) but the proposal was never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have in fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> the capital city where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|The riots were characterised by the Scarman report {{into the}} 1981 <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> England as [...] "copycat riots" [...] - taking {{place after the}} Brixton <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> London, and {{around the same time}} as the Toxteth <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Liverpool and the Moss Side <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Manchester - though some have argued that this is an oversimplification. The {{immediate}} flashpoint was an attack on a locally well-known Police Superintendent who was trying to calm rumours of an impending march by the right-wing National Front. The following disturbances resulted in 121 arrests and 40 injuries to police officers, alongside widespread damage to property.|$|R
50|$|The Compton's Cafeteria <b>Riot</b> {{occurred}} <b>in</b> August 1966 in the Tenderloin {{district of}} San Francisco. This incident {{was one of}} the first recorded LGBT-related <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall <b>Riots</b> <b>in</b> New York City. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} {{the significance of}} the rally, one must consider the history of <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968, a wave of riots struck urban, black areas of the United States. Though not as devastating as the <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. and Chicago, the <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Pittsburgh damaged black areas economically and escalated tensions with the city police.|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto begin courting support from Islamic elements. He {{undertook}} a much-publicised hajj pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protégé BJ Habibie, the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> Medan.|$|E
5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to the hilt. He was the first constable to be killed in a <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E
5|$|Sectarian {{tensions}} {{have long}} been a cause of conflict at football matches in Northern Ireland, and crowd trouble occasionally marred games involving Linfield throughout the twentieth century. In 1948, Belfast Celtic withdrew from the Irish League after years of sectarian crowd problems culminated in a Boxing Day match against Linfield at Windsor Park which ended in a pitch invasion and <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> which Belfast Celtic's Protestant centre forward, Jimmy Jones, suffered a broken leg.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the third}} major {{incident}} of <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> Jos {{in the last ten}} years. Some one thousand people were killed <b>in</b> <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> 2001, and at least 700 died in subsequent violence in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Religious processions during Muharram in {{the shrine}} cities turned into {{political}} protests. After <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> 1974 {{five members of}} the Daw'a party were executed after <b>rioting</b> <b>in</b> 1974 and in 1977 eight Shia were executed after worse rioting.|$|R
50|$|St George's Fields was {{the scene}} of <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> 1768, {{agitating}} for the release of John Wilkes and, more seriously, was the starting point of the Gordon <b>Riots</b> <b>in</b> 1780 which began in the movement to repeal the act of parliament removing penalties for Catholics.|$|R
5|$|The 1990 Strangeways Prison riot was a 25-day prison riot and rooftop protest at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, England. The riot {{began on}} 1 April 1990 when prisoners {{took control of}} the prison chapel, and the riot quickly spread {{throughout}} most of the prison. The riot and rooftop protest ended on 25 April when the final five prisoners were removed from the rooftop, making it the longest prison <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> British penal history. One prisoner was killed during the riot, and 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners were injured. Much of the prison was damaged or destroyed with the cost of repairs coming to £50million.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago race riot of 1919 {{was a major}} racial {{conflict}} that began in Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1919, and ended on August 3. During the riot, thirty-eight people died (23 black and 15 white) and over five hundred were injured. It is considered {{the worst of the}} approximately 25 riots during the Red Summer, so named because of the violence and fatalities across the nation. The combination of prolonged arson, looting, and murder made it the worst race <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> the history of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Greek Town <b>Riot</b> <b>in</b> 1909 flared after {{increased}} Greek immigration, Greeks' {{working as}} strikebreakers, and {{the killing of}} an Irish policeman provoked violence among earlier immigrants such as ethnic Irish. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or {{had at least one}} parent born outside of America. Six years after the Greek Town <b>Riot,</b> <b>in</b> 1915, a Mexican immigrant named Juan Gonzalez was killed by a mob near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer was investigating a criminal operation selling goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. Afterward it was discovered that Gonzalez was unarmed, and that he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. Nobody was ever indicted for his killing. In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of blacks as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.|$|E
50|$|He {{was killed}} <b>in</b> 1561, during <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Lyon, {{in or near}} the College. He was {{suspected}} of Protestantism.|$|R
50|$|Aguirre has {{reported}} from Cuba, and has covered Hurricane Andrew and the Oklahoma City bombing. She has covered race <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Miami, and prison <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta and Louisiana. She {{has reported}} from GITMO, the prison at Guantanamo Bay and from London, England on Princess Diana.|$|R
50|$|The clearest {{consequence}} of the Caracazo was political instability. The following February, the army was called to contain similar <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Puerto La Cruz and Barcelona and again in June, when rising of transportation costs ended <b>in</b> <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Maracaibo and other cities. The reforms were modified.|$|R
5|$|The {{throwing}} {{became more}} intense as kick-off approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they had nowhere to go, they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved up against the wall, it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. At {{the other end of}} the ground, Juventus fans began to <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> retaliation for the events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E
5|$|Then, in a {{calculated}} attack, approximately 500 Arsenal fans attacked {{from the main}} road behind the Galatasaray fans. This caused a severe <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> the city square, with several restaurant facilities used by fans to fight each other, with iron bars and knives also being used. This lasted 20 minutes before the Danish police attempted {{to break up the}} melee with dogs and tear gas. The violence, which included fans from other English clubs and Turks living in Denmark, lasted for 45 minutes. There were further clashes at the airport the day after the game.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a <b>riot</b> <b>in</b> the city.|$|E
50|$|Following the Battle of Brisbane, resentment towards American troops led {{to several}} smaller <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> Townsville, Rockhampton and Mount Isa. Similar <b>riots</b> <b>in</b> other states also followed: Melbourne on 1 December 1942, Bondi on 6 February 1943, Perth in January 1944 and Fremantle in April 1944.|$|R
50|$|Social unrest {{has shaped}} the {{development}} of Trinidad and Tobago {{since the middle of}} the 19th century.

Attempts to control the celebration of Hosay by the Indian population culminated <b>in</b> the Hosay <b>Riots</b> <b>in</b> 1884.
