2500|$|Jews {{generally}} {{read it in}} late May or June, typically (though not always) on {{the first}} Shabbat after Shavuot. As this parashah includes {{the story of the}} consecration of the Tabernacle, Jews also read parts of it as Torah readings on the eight days of Hanukkah, when they commemorate the reconsecration of the Temple in Jerusalem.

2500|$|Jews {{generally}} {{read it in}} July, or {{rarely in}} late June or early August.

40|$|Is reading just reading? What do we {{mean when}} we talk about “reading ” an {{electronic}} book? Is this perhaps depending on the situation? Is it different when we are <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> leisure or <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> learning? For information gathering or emotions? Reading longer or shorter texts? What impact does the device we read on have, from books to screens to reading tablets? What is <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> learning as compared to <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> other purposes? These are major questions that I will not touch. Instead, I will be looking closely at one small issue: How can the emergence of e-books impact the university students learning process, and how can the university library help our students use this source of information in the most efficient way...|$|R

5|$|Another {{work from}} Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume {{encyclopedia}} about herbal medicine {{written in the}} middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely <b>read</b> <b>for</b> more than 1,500 years. Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī's (828–896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.|$|E
5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He {{thought it was the}} most exciting story he had <b>read</b> <b>for</b> years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E

5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and <b>read</b> <b>for</b> the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|His elder {{daughter}} Elizabeth, {{the heir}} presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, taking {{the place of}} the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found. In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the King's speech from the throne was <b>read</b> <b>for</b> him by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds. His Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.|$|E

He attended Chaplin School in Gwelo, where he was head prefect, recipient of the Victor Ludorum in athletics, captain of the school teams in cricket, rugby union and tennis, and successful academically. After graduating in 1937, he attended Rhodes University College in Grahamstown, South Africa, which was often attended by Rhodesian students, partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own. Enrolling {{at the start of}} 1938, Smith <b>read</b> <b>for</b> a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He was about halfway through his course when the Second World War broke out in September 1939.|$|E

5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do anything but <b>read</b> <b>for</b> the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore <b>read</b> <b>for</b> the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
5|$|Mischa Barton, who had met McG on Fastlane, portrayed Marissa Cooper. She {{was cast}} in February 2003. Tate Donovan, who played Jimmy Cooper, {{was cast in}} March 2003. Melinda Clarke guest-starred as Julie Cooper, but <b>read</b> <b>for</b> the role of Kirsten in her {{audition}} as there were not enough scripted lines for Julie at the time. Rachel Bilson, who was recommended to Schwartz after an unsuccessful audition for Everwood, guest-starred as Summer Roberts, whom the producers had envisaged as a tall Californian blonde. Clarke and Bilson joined as regular cast members later in the season. Chris Carmack, who played Luke Ward, was credited as a guest star for the episode; he joined the regular cast in the next episode.|$|E

Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright.

During the audition, he met and talked to Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado. He said that his main attraction to the television project was the ability to work on a show produced by Spelling. While filming the episodes in a wheelchair, Rodriquez said that he gained an increased awareness and appreciation for handicapped people.|$|E
