2500|$|Narrated Anas ibn Malik: [...] "I know (about) the Hijab (the {{order of}} veiling of women) {{more than anybody}} else. Ubay ibn Ka'b used to ask me about it. Allah's Apostle became the bridegroom of Zaynab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah's Apostle {{remained}} sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle {{got up and went}} away, and I too, followed him till he <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of 'Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." [...] , ...|$|E
