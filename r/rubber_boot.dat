In the United Kingdom, however, a galosh is an overshoe made of a weatherproof material to protect a more vulnerable shoe underneath and keep the foot warm and dry.|$|E

[...] There are reports that the smell has lessened in recent years as oxygen levels in the water have increased.|$|E

[...] They had planned to burn Rasputin's possessions and call from the train station a popular restaurant to ask if Rasputin was in. Sukhotin put on Rasputinâ€™s fur coat, his rubber boots and gloves. He left together with Dmitri and Lazovert into Purishkevich's car, suggesting Rasputin had left the palace alive. Because Purishkevich's wife refused to burn the fur coat and the boots in her small fireplace in Purishkevich's ambulance train, the conspirators went back to the palace with the mentioned items. When the body was wrapped in a curtain, the conspirators drove toward Krestovsky Island and, at about 5 a.m., threw the corpse from a bridge into the Malaya Nevka River into an ice hole. They forgot to attach weights so that the body would sink deep, dropped his fur coat over the railing with the chains, and drove back, without noticing one of Rasputin's goloshes, a <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> (size 10), was stuck between the piles of the bridge.|$|E

5000|$|Most [...] are {{constructed}} of leather, sometimes with a breathable waterproof lining, such as Gore-Tex. However, the shoes are not comparable to <b>rubber</b> <b>boots</b> {{when it comes}} to being waterproof and drying quickly, making it difficult to cross rivers while keeping the inside of the boot dry. Although there are <b>rubber</b> lace-up <b>boots</b> designed for hiking purposes, <b>rubber</b> hiking <b>boots</b> are not ideal for extensive use because the feet cannot breathe and sweat extensively, which can lead to foot problems such as blisters, fungal infections and trench foot. These drawbacks negate any advantage <b>rubber</b> <b>boots</b> have in keeping out external moisture. However non-rubber hiking boots are generally quite expensive and require more care. The largest hiking boot is 7.14m long, 2.5m wide, and 4.2m tall by Schuh Marke (Germany).|$|R

50|$|A {{common use}} of {{dielectric}} grease is in high-voltage connections associated with gasoline engine spark plugs. The grease {{is applied to}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> of the plug wire. This helps the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to seal the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot,</b> {{while at the same time}} preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally, spark plugs are located in areas of high temperature and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected. It can be applied to the actual contact as well, because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film. Doing so on such high pressure contact surfaces between different metals has the advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration from galvanic corrosion.|$|E

50|$|Rubber boot-style gas-loaded {{relief valves}} operate by using {{nitrogen}} pressure loaded {{on the outside}} diameter of a <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> that is covering the flow path through the relief valve.

As soon as the process pressure raises above the nitrogen pressure, the product in the line forces the <b>rubber</b> <b>boot</b> away from the barrier and allows product {{to pass through the}} valve. When the process pressure decreases below the nitrogen pressure, the valve goes closed again.|$|E
