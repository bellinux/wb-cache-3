40|$|From 2005 - 2007 the EU project BLUE SEED {{was carried}} out. The {{objectives}} were {{to secure a}} reliable supply of blue mussel seed and to develop techniques allowing farmers tomarket bluemussels year round. A problem blue mussel producers face is the unpredictability seed supply. The amounts of wild seed available are extremely variable fromyear to year. Areliable supply of seed from hatchery sources will allow mussel farmers to overcome this. A second problem is that recently spawned mussels cannot be sold due to insufficient meat content. Producerswill benefit greatly from a hatchery-based technique, such as triploid induction, that produces non-maturing mussels that can be marketed year round. In this project mussel farmers and sellers, a network for training and technology transfer, universities and research institutes collaborated. Attention was given to broodstock conditioning and larval <b>rearing,</b> <b>production</b> of triploid larvae and tetraploid broodstock, spat settlement and on rearing of diploid and triploid spat to seed size. In addition, the allowed costs of hatchery produced seed with conventional wild-caught seed is compared. Considering the normal 2 to 3 year production cycle for blue mussel in Europe, {{the focus of this}} 2 -year project was on spat and seed production...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{continuing}} {{development of new}} insect-derived food products, microbial research on edible insects and insect-based foods is still very limited. The goal {{of this study was}} to increase the knowledge on the microbial quality of edible insects by comparing the bacterial community composition of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) and crickets (Acheta domesticus and Gryllodes sigillatus) from several production cycles and rearing companies. Remarkable differences in the bacterial community composition were found between different mealworm rearing companies and mealworm production cycles from the same company. In comparison with mealworms, the bacterial community composition of the investigated crickets was more similar among different companies, and was highly similar between both cricket species investigated. Mealworm communities were dominated by Spiroplasma and Erwinia species, while crickets were abundantly colonised by (Para) bacteroides species. With respect to food safety, only a few operational taxonomic units could be associated with potential human pathogens such as Cronobacter or spoilage bacteria such as Pseudomonas. In summary, our results implicate that at least for cricket <b>rearing,</b> <b>production</b> cycles of constant and good quality in terms of bacterial composition can be obtained by different rearing companies. For mealworms however, more variation in terms of microbial quality occurs between companies. status: publishe...|$|E

Twelve paddy plots with size ranges from 1300 - 27000 m 2 were stocked with fish at a density of 4930 /ha for mono & mixed culture (50 + 50 %). After 50 days of <b>rearing</b> <b>production</b> rate of fish from monoculture of Puntius gonionotus (T 1), mixed culture of Puntius gonionotus 1 and Cyprinus carpio (T 2) and monculture culture of Cyprinus carpio (T 3) was found 280. 12, 330. 40 (119. 64 + 210. 76 kg) and 279. 78 kg ha - 1, respectively. No significant variation in fish production was observed between T 1 and T 3. But compare to other treatments significant higher production of fish was obtained from T 2. However, for rice production a significant lower production (3. 14 ton h - 1) was obtained for T 3 compare to other two treatments, while higher rate of rice production (3. 85 ton/h) was recorded for T 1. For control plot (T 4) the production rate of rice was 3. 40 ton h - 1. In the study, no negative correlation was found for the integration of fish with rice culture...|$|E

This diet resulted in the highest numbers of egg/female/day, spermatozoid in the spermathecae, percentages of egg hatch, the lowest mortality rate of adults and the highest average mating duration compared with the standard adult diet based on Yeast Hydrolysate Enzymatic + Sugar (1 : 3). Among eleven larval diets tested, diets based on sugarcane and sugarbeet bagases plus 7 % brewer yeast, 8 % sugar, 0. 2 % sodium benzoate, 0. 8 % of hydrochloric acid and 60 % water (adjusted), yielded the highest percentages of egg hatching, pupal recovery, pupal weight and adult emergence.

40|$|In Denmark {{surgical}} castration is a routine procedure both within conventional and organic pig production, but this procedure {{has recently been}} debated due to welfare issues. Changing the entire pig producing sector to production of entire male pigs is not straightforward, as extensive research have shown problems of boar taint in the meat of entire male pigs, but also welfare issues arising during <b>rearing.</b> <b>Production</b> of entire male pigs will be favorable from an organic perspective, as omitting castration complies well with the values of organic farming in terms of animal integrity, and as execution of the castration procedure is impractical on pigs reared outdoors. Knowledge is lacking on how the rearing period is best adapted within the organic housing system to accommodate the documented changed behavior of entires, but the organic farming system {{might be able to}} offer some improvement initiatives related to management and housing. As regards boar taint, the organic farming system offers no apparent strategies for boar taint reduction, and knowledge about the extent of the problem and how known taint reducing initiatives work within the organic system is lacking. This highlights a need for investigation in large scale studies. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate different management approaches in relation to production of entire male pigs within the organic pig production system. Studies focused on live weight of pigs at slaughter and soiling of pens and pigs in relation to occurrence of boar taint, and housing conditions such as grouping strategy and Group size in relation to animal welfare. A combination of these approaches was intended to contribute to an overall concept for production of organic entire male pigs...|$|E
40|$|This manual was {{originally}} produced in Spanish by the Ministry of Sugar Production in Cuba. With funds from CTA, the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) {{was able to}} translate it and produce it in English {{in order to help}} increase duck production as a source of protein for the Caribbean in particular, and also for other ACP countries. The domestic duck has a rapid growth rate: while fattening chickens require 23 % and 19. 7 % of total protein (TP) during the initial growing and fattening stages respectively, ducks can perform very well with 20 % and then 16 % protein up to the time of slaughter. Perhaps {{the most important aspect of}} duck-rearing for the Caribbean and other cane producing countries is their preference for liquid diets, which makes ducks particularly suitable for rearing on some by-products of sugar. Sugar by-products such as intermediate syrups A and B, syrup-off, or even sugar cane juice, can provide the required energy component of up to 65 % of dry matter, while soyabeans or soya flour, sunflowers, fish silage, earthworms or organic waste can provide the protein element of the diet. This small manual covers all aspects of duck <b>rearing,</b> <b>production,</b> reproduction, housing, hygiene and management. Sixteen pages are devoted to feeding, with tabulated sugar-based formulae for different stages of duck growth, and tables which show the use of differing amount sand types of compounds that may be utilized.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore the role women groups in the Methodist church in Kenya are playing to fight poverty. To realize the aimed goal of {{exploring}} what role women are playing in the Methodist church to fight against poverty, the questions guiding the study were (a) what are women’s experiences as far as poverty is concerned {{and how do they}} conceptualize it? (b) What activities are carried out by the women groups and ways are the women in the Methodist churches under study doing to fight poverty? (c) To what extent does the Methodist church the umbrella of the women group organizations; support the women in their fight against poverty? The study used qualitative inquiry employing a multiple case study approach. The tools used for collecting data were semi-structured interviews, observations and a field notebook. Key findings from the study indicate that: The women had suffered the effects of poverty such as inability to meet basic needs: food, decent shelter, clothes, inability to cater for maternity cost, illiteracy and lacked income; Landlessness; Single parenthood; violence against women and could not access funding from regular lending agencies. The women in the Methodist churches in the study have formed self-help groups and are carrying out projects to generate income. They are planting trees to control environmental degradation. They are learning family planning and prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. They are also being educated on; human rights, curbing child labor and school-drop outs, female genital mutilation (FGM), better methods of agriculture, such as poultry <b>rearing,</b> <b>production</b> of bio-gas, making of improved Jikos (Jikos is a Kiswahili name for stoves), learning general hygiene, cookery, weaving, basketry and knitting. They sing inspiring and educative songs, dance for entertainment and dramatize bible verses as a way of expressing their ideas, feelings and opinions. All these are done in the name of fighting against poverty. This makes the style of fighting poverty employed by the women groups look complex. The focus of the thesis is the complexity of their experiences and conceptions of poverty on one hand and the activities they take part in to fight poverty on the other. Hence the title of the study is: The role of women groups in the Methodist Church in Kenya: The Complexity of Fighting Against poverty. The church is supporting women under study to fight against poverty by offering pastoral care. It offers moral support to the women as they carry out the projects. The other members in the Methodist church in study help the women to contribute when they hold Harambee. A Kiswahili word used to mean joining hands to make any challenging task easy...|$|E
40|$|The {{gross product}} from sea culture in Japan was about USD 3. 4 billion in 2013 with kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus constituting 2 % {{of the total}} {{production}}. In recent years, annual shrimp production has reached about 1, 600 metric tons (MT) and 99 % of the species produced comprised of M. japonicus. Kuruma shrimp is highly traded at market price of USD 40 - 60 per kg. At present, 65 % of cultured kuruma shrimp are produced in Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. To increase or maintain kuruma shrimp fishery in the natural environment, 200 million fry have been annually released into the sea {{along the coast of}} Japan. In addition, whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei has also been produced in a private farm since 2007 with an annual production of approximately 40 MT. Recently, the number of farms that ventured into whiteleg shrimp culture has increased. The most serious obstacle faced by the kuruma shrimp industry in Japan in the 1990 s was the outbreaks of white spot disease (WSD) caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The seed production of kuruma shrimp has been dependent on captured wild broodstocks. However, broodstocks obtained from the wild could be carriers of WSSV that may vertically transmit the virus to fertilized eggs. To prevent the spread of WSD, measures for disinfecting WSSV-infected fertilized eggs of shrimp and detection of the causative virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed. Lately, with the application of an improved technology for broodstock <b>rearing,</b> <b>production</b> losses ascribed to WSD have significantly decreased because majority of the hatcheries have been using specific WSSV-free shrimps. In the last decade, in kuruma shrimp hatcheries and grow-out ponds, vibriosis due to Vibrio penaeicida has been frequently encountered. Fusariosis caused by Fusarium solani is also common. The first cases of vibriosis and fusariosis in Japan occurred in 1973 and 1972, respectively. Taking the case of Okinawa prefecture as example, production losses in 2005 due to vibriosis and fusariosis were 66 % and 34 %, respectively. Cleaning of the pond bottom prior to the commencement of grow-out culture has been recommended to prevent vibriosis. Some antibiotics have also been orally administered to reduce mortality of shrimps affected by vibriosis. However, farmers have been properly cautioned regarding their use as emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria could consequently arise. Because no practical treatment for fusariosis is currently available, farmers either dispose or harvest infected shrimps followed by disinfection of ponds with 10 ppm chlorine. Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has not yet been detected in Japan. As kuruma shrimp is also susceptible to the disease, the Government of Japan plans to designate AHPND as Specific Disease. Under Japanese law, enlistment of AHPND as a quarantinable disease will also be instituted to prevent the introduction of this disease into Japanese hatcheries and grow-out facilities. However, in case an AHPND outbreak inadvertently occurs, Prefectural Fisheries Experimental Stations (PES) could immediately conduct preliminary diagnosis using the AP 4 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. In addition, confirmatory diagnosis using AP 4 nested PCR method and sequencing could be conducted at the National Research Institute of Aquaculture (NRIA), a central laboratory for aquatic animal health. NRIA s task is not only to perform confirmatory diagnosis but likewise disseminate diagnostic techniques to the staff of the National Quarantine and PES...|$|E
