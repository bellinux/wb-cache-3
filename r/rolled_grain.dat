40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to determine the feeding value of whole-plant forage sorghum, grain sorghum, and corn silages, with and without 25 % <b>rolled</b> <b>grain</b> sorghum added to the ration. In general, growing cattle fed corn or grain sorghum silages out-performed those fed forage sorghum silages. Only forage sorghums with moderate grain yields supported gains approaching those from grain sorghum silages.

Adding 25 %grain to the moderate grain-yielding forage sorghum hybrid rations increased cattle gains to a level comparable to those from grain sorghum silages.

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} the feeding value of grain sorghum relative to corn and various grain processing methods for grain sorghum. It {{has been widely}} recognized that grain sorghum (milo) must be processed to be efficiently used by finishing cattle. Grain sorghum shows more improved utilization from processing than corn, wheat and barley. Dry ground or <b>rolled</b> <b>grain</b> sorghum has a relative feeding value of 85 % to 95 % (avg 90 %) of dry rolled corn. Processing grain sorghum by more sophisticated methods (early harvesting, steam-flaking, etc.) greatly enhances its feeding value. Chemical composition suggests {{that there should be}} less difference in the feeding value of grain sorghum compared with corn than what actually exists. Starch, which represents 70 % of the dry matter, and protein appear to be less digestible in grain sorghum than in other grains. The rate that starch is digested in the rumen of cattle is also much slower for grain sorghum than for other grains. Thus, processing grain sorghum increases rate and extent of starch digestion resulting in large improvements in its feeding value...|$|E

The main {{objective of this}} study was an overall understanding of deformation texture and microstructure development. Hot band CRGO had a strong alpha-fiber (RD//[110]) texture. Cold reduction strengthened the alpha and gamma (ND//[111]) fibers, but weakened theta (ND//(100)). All Taylor type deformation texture models were reasonably successful in predicting these bulk texture developments, and the Lamel model seems to be the 'best-fit' model, both in terms of a 'deviation' parameter (indicating differences between experimental and simulated values of idealized texture components) and a 'trend' parameter (indicating the relative change(s) in texture components with strain). The striking feature of the microstructure was the 'selective' appearance of grain interior strain localization's. These appeared at approximately 37 degrees with the rolling direction (RD). Though 37 degrees bands appeared only in orientations with high Taylor factor (M), the absolute value of the Taylor factor alone, was not enough for the appearance of such bands. Negative textural softening or (dM/depsilon) values, on the other hand, were always associated with the appearance of 37 degrees bands, justifying or explaining their formation {{on the basis of a}} macroscopic plastic instability theory. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Samples of some cereals (corn, barley, and oats), whole (W) or {{subjected}} to flaking (F), rolling (R) and extrusion (E) were collected from different horses feed industries. Feed samples were analyzed for their proximate composition and fibrous fractions by Van Soest procedure. The total starch content (TS) was determined directly by liquid chromatography (TS 1) and as sum of resistant and non-resistant starch using a specific enzymatic kit before the spectrophotometric reading (TS 2). In vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) by pepsin-cellulase technique was also estimated. The content of resistant starch was low in the cereals (on average 2. 0 % of the total starch), except for the whole corn samples. TS 1 values were lower than TS 2, particularly at lower starch levels. The in vitro OMD values ranged from 66. 8 % (whole white oats) to 95. 7 % (flaked corn). The effects of the physical treatments on the in vitro OMD were variable among cereals. The in vitro OMD of flaked white oats was lower with respect to whole and <b>rolled</b> <b>grain.</b> In corn and barley samples the physical treatments did not change the in vitro OMD values. Using the step-wise multiple regression method for all the chemical parameters, in vitro OMD of the cereals could be predicted by ADF content (R- 2 = 0. 986; RSD= +/- 1. 2 %). Other parameters (CP, lipids, lignin and total starch) gave little improvement in predicting in vitro OMD when included in the model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Feeding grain whole to cattle {{generally}} {{results in}} a lower digestibility than that obtained with processed grain. If this problem could be overcome, feeding with whole grain would reduce processing costs, and the slower rate of starch digestion in the rumen could improve fibre digestion with potential beneficial effects on intake and animal production. Two strategies are available to increase the digestibility of whole grain. The first, longer term strategy relies on the selection or breeding of feed grains that are efficiently digested by cattle when fed whole. The review considers the chemical and physical properties of grains likely to increase the degree of grain damage during mastication, and increase the digestibility of the seed coat fraction. Research is required to determine the feasibility of selecting feed grains with these characteristics. The second strategy is to treat whole grain with chemicals or enzymes to increase digestibility of the seed coat and consequently whole grain digestion within the rumen. Considerable {{research has been conducted}} on the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment of grain, and there is sufficient evidence from cattle experiments to indicate that digestibility, liveweight gain, and milk production on NaOH-treated whole grain can be similar to that on <b>rolled</b> <b>grain,</b> provided sufficient NaOH is applied. However, a number of practical and commercial considerations have limited the more widespread adoption of this technology on farms. Although ammonia treatment offers a more practical alternative to NaOH, digestibility and animal production responses have been highly variable, and research is required to identify effective ammoniation procedures. The increased availability of enzymes for livestock feeding has potentially provided another grain treatment option. The application of fibrolytic enzymes to whole grain prior to high-moisture storage or feeding, and their subsequent effect on grain digestibility, require research. The impact of grain characteristics, both physical and chemical, on the response to alkali or enzyme treatment also requires research...|$|E

40|$|Multi-pass {{fusion welding}} by a filler {{material}} (wire) is normally carried out to join thick steel sections used in most engineering applications. Multiple thermal cycles from a multi-pass weld resulted in a variable distribution of residual stress field across the weld and through the thickness. Presence of tensile residual stresses can be detrimental to the integrity and the service behaviour of the welded joint. In addition to a complex distribution of residual stress state, multi-pass welds also form dendritic grain structure, which are repeatedly heated, resulting in segregation of alloying elements. In this research, microstructural refinement with modification of residual stress state was attempted by applying post-weld cold rolling followed by laser processing and then cold rolling. The residual stress was determined non-destructively by using neutron diffraction. Post-weld cold rolling followed by laser processing was carried out to induce recrystallization of the cold <b>rolled</b> <b>grains.</b> Microstructural characterisation indicates a significant grain refinement near the capping pass.

40|$|Five {{finishing}} cattle trials, four with calves {{and one with}} yearlings, were conducted to evaluate sources of supplemental CP in high grain diets. One metabolism trial was conducted to measure ruminal protein degradation and rate of passage of dry rolled corn (DRC), dry <b>rolled</b> <b>grain</b> sorghum (DRGS), corn silage, blood meal (BM), feather meal (FTH), and soybean meal (SBM). In finishing Trial 1, calves supplemented with BM/FTH/urea gained more efficiently during the first 41 d than calves supplemented with urea. Over the entire trial (199 d) gain and gain/feed were not affected by source of CP. Calves fed DRC gained more efficiently than calves fed DRGS. In finishing Trial 2, calves supplemented with SBM gained faster and more efficiently than calves supplemented with urea, FTH/urea or FTH/BM/urea during the first 28 d. Over the entire trial (187 d) gain and gain/feed were not affected by source of CP. During the first 28 d, gain and gain/feed were highly correlated to essential amino acid intake. In finishing Trial 3, calves had similar gains and efficiencies when supplemented with SBM or BM/urea at any period. In finishing Trial 4, calves which grazed cornstalks 74 d before finishing exhibited compensatory growth, as they consumed more feed, gained faster, but were less efficient in the feedlot than calves finished after weaning. Response (gain and gain/feed) to additional metabolizable protein was greater for compensating calves than noncompensating calves. In finishing Trial 5, yearlings supplemented with SBM/urea gained faster and more efficiently during the first 31 d than yearlings supplemented with FTH/urea, FTH/meat and bone meal/urea, or urea alone.

40|$|The {{formability}} of Mg {{alloy sheet}} in the as-hot rolled condition {{depends on the}} microstructure developed during hot rolling. In general, the formability of Mg alloys is improved by finer grain sizes. 'Microalloying' levels of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and cerium (Ce) {{have been found to}} refine the as-cast structure, but there is no information as to whether this effect will be reflected in the as-hot worked structure and formability. Thus, in this work, the effects of microalloying levels of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and cerium (Ce) on the microstructures (from as-cast to as-hot rolled) and subsequent hot deformation behavior of AZ 31, nominally 3 % Al, 1 % Zn, and 0. 3 %Mn, were systematically investigated. To include the effect of solidification rate these alloys were cast in different moulds (preheated steel mould, Cu-mould, and water cooled Cu-mould). One-hit compression testing at temperatures between 250 °C ∼ 400 °C, strain rates of 0. 001, 0. 01, 0. 1 s- 1 and strains from 0. 2 up to 1. 0, was performed to investigate the basic hot compression behavior, while two-hit compression testing was conducted to determine the static softening behavior. Hot rolling of the microalloyed AZ 31 alloys was then carried out to study the effects of microalloying on as-hot rolled structure under two sets of rolling schedules. To investigate the formability of these microalloyed sheets, tensile tests were completed over a temperature range between ambient and 450 °C, at strain rates between 0. 1 and 0. 0003 s- 1. Results show that Ca and Sr act to refine the as cast grain size and the second phases, consistently promoting fine and uniform as-hot <b>rolled</b> <b>grain</b> structure. With regard to grain refinement, calcium has the strongest effect, whereas Ce is most effective for second phase refinement. In addition, microalloying retards grain growth during hot tensile testing. Multiple alloying presents a combined and complementary effect. A refined and uniform grain structure combined with well dispersed and thermally stable second phases significantly improves the hot formability of AZ 31 sheets by promoting dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in the matrix, resisting grain coarsening, and retarding the development of cavitation and necking. Under the superplastic condition of 450 °C and 0. 0003 s - 1, the elongation was improved by 17 % with Ca only, 26 % with Ca and Ce, 51 % with Ca and Sr, and 59 % with Ca, Sr and Ce...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of grain processing, grain sources, protein sources, and bST treatments on lactation performance, ovarian activity and nutrient digestion in early lactation dairy cows. In experiment 1, forty-eight dairy cows were divided into six groups and fed diets containing 37 to 39 % grain as either steam-flaked sorghum (SFS, 360 g/L), steam-flaked corn (SFC, 360 g/L), or steam-rolled corn (SRC, 490 g/L) with one of two protein sources, soybean meal (SBM) or Prolak® for 70 days. Main effects for grain and protein source were not different for DMI, milk yield, 3. 5 % FCM yield or feed efficiency. Although efficiency of feed conversion into FCM did not differ among treatments, cows fed Prolak® required 10 % less NEL for every Mcal of NEL converted into body weight or FCM. Milk protein yield was increased by both flaked gain and Prolak®. Feeding flaked grain increased milk production by 1. 5 kg/d compared with <b>rolled</b> <b>grain.</b> Increasing the ratio of RDS/RDP to more than 2. 4 increased milk yield by 2. 7 kg/d (39. 0 vs 36. 3 kg/d). Plasma NEFA levels did not differ among treatments and grain and protein source had variable effects on PUN. Compared with other grains, SFC increased digestibilities of DM and OM, and flaked grains increased digestibility of starch. Cows fed SFS had the lowest crude protein digestibility, but was highest in NDF. In experiment 2, thirty-two postpartum (5 DIM) Holstein cows were assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design for 90 days. Treatments were: steam-flaked sorghum diet with bST (SFS-B); steam-flaked sorghum diet without bST (SFS-N); steam-rolled corn diet with bST (SRC-B); and steam-rolled corn diet without bST (SRC-N). Cows receiving bST during the first 45 days of treatment had lower DMI and DMI as % of BW. Milk yield was increased by bST 3. 1 kg/d and 1. 8 kg/d during the 45 d and 90 d periods, respectively, resulting in greater feed efficiency for bST-treated cows. Grain processing did not affect DMI, milk yield and FCM yield. Neither composition nor yields of milk components were influenced by treatments. Compared to the SRC diet, SFS increased plasma glucose 5 % and plasma insulin 19 %. Grain processing and bST had no effect on either BHBA or hepatic triglycerides. PUN was reduced by bST, but NEFA was increased. Compared with SRC, SFS increased progesterone during the first two postpartum estrous cycles and cows receiving bST had significantly larger CL. Flaked sorghum compared with SRC increased digestibility of DM, OM, and starch, and neither grain affected digestibilities of CP, NDF or ADF.

40|$|AbstractAISI Type 304 L {{austenitic}} stainless steels are extensively used in industries, and welding is an indispensable tool used for joining these materials. In a multi-pass weld, the development of residual stress {{to a large extent}} depends on the response of the weld metal, heat affected zone and parent material to complex thermo-mechanical cycles during welding.

Quantitative evaluation of the intra-granular orientation spread in the deformed grains was attempted. Both of the GAM and SGS could represent the orientation spread but in different manner. The GAM value was higher in { 111 }//ND orientations than in other orientation groups implying steep orientation gradient within short ranges in { 111 }//ND oriented grains. This steep orientation gradient was generally originated from the existence of deformation heterogeneities. Particularly, { 111 } orientation which was the dominant component in the recrystallization texture showed the maximum values of both GAM and SGS, which was caused by the frequent development of shear bands. SGS values of { 001 }//ND oriented soft grains were unexpectedly large in spite of their small GAM values. It could be confirmed that their uniform deformation behavior led to the gentle but monotonous orientation gradient in long ranges. The lowest values of both GAM and SGS were obtained in the { 112 } orientation, probably, because of the highest orientation stability in that orientation during plain strain deformation condition. GAM was more closely related {{to the development of}} recrystallization texture and the significance of the steep orientation gradient in the recrystallization behavior should be re-addressed...|$|R
