5|$|The four F-80 {{aircraft}} {{were able}} to attack the North Koreans from a greater distance. With a minimal amount of maneuvering, the US aircraft rushed the North Korean formation and quickly shot four of them down; two by Lieutenant Robert E.

5|$|Although Minton {{was on the}} Supreme Court, he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices <b>Robert</b> <b>H.</b> Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice on dealing with Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, he urged Truman to help focus public attention {{on the economy and}} away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.|$|E

5|$|Sampson and Congressman John M. Robsion {{organized}} a formidable Republican faction {{in the eastern}} part of Kentucky. In 1927, Sampson was a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. His opponent was <b>Robert</b> <b>H.</b> Lucas, a tax collector for the Internal Revenue Service. Lucas secured the support of Kentucky senators Frederic M. Sackett and Richard P. Ernst, while Sampson was backed by longtime supporter John M. Robsion and the Jockey Club, a coalition of leaders who supported parimutuel betting on horse races. Sampson won the primary by a margin of 39,375.|$|E

5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including <b>Robert</b> <b>H.</b> Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E
5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, <b>Robert</b> <b>H.</b> Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 1972, {{the men of}} Alpha Phi {{voted to}} admit women into their chapter. They alerted National Headquarters, and National Secretary <b>Robert</b> <b>H.</b> Rubin replied telling Alpha Phi not to {{administer}} any degree of ritual until the issue could be discussed in person. When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, {{he learned that the}} first degree of ritual had been administered, which began formal probationary membership. Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of Mu Beta Psi.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{properties}} in Salta is known to date from the 16th century, and the hamlet has been continually inhabited ever since. During the Second World War, 43 evacuees from the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne area were billeted to the parish of Holme St. Cuthbert, and several ended up in Salta. Development in the 20th century saw new houses built, but mainline water and electricity arrived later than {{in other parts of}} Britain, perhaps due to the small population. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside, beyond the Moss to the southeast of Salta, were conducted in 1989–1990 by <b>Robert</b> <b>H.</b> Bewley.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{started out}} playing high school {{basketball}} at Naperville Central High School.

His outstanding performances for the Braves ensured that he became one of 15 players honored in Bradley's All-Century basketball team named in 2003. Academically, Parker also excelled. He majored in chemistry before switching to liberal arts and sciences in his senior year, and earned two Major <b>Robert</b> <b>H.</b> Lawrence Jr. Scholarships while at Bradley.|$|E
