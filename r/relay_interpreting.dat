40|$|At European conferences, in {{exclusively}} {{spoken language}} contexts outside the British Isles, recourse to <b>relay</b> <b>interpreting</b> is uncommon whenever the principal source discourse is in English, {{because it is}} relatively easy to find interpreters with English as their B or C language. Market requirements dictate that spoken-language interpreters learn at least two if not more foreign languages, actively (i. e. bidirectional use) or passively (i. e. into their native language; their A language), of which English is frequently one. This paper discusses various aspects of <b>relay</b> <b>interpreting</b> with a signed language and English...|$|E

50|$|To {{accommodate}} this, AC {{track circuits}} use alternating current signals instead of direct current (DC) but typically, the AC frequency {{is in the}} range of audio frequencies, from 91 Hz up to 10 kHz. The relays are arranged to detect the selected frequency and to ignore DC and AC traction frequency signals. Again, failsafe principles dictate that the <b>relay</b> <b>interprets</b> the presence of the signal as unoccupied track, whereas a lack of a signal indicates the presence of a train. The AC signal can be coded and locomotives equipped with inductive pickups to create a cab signalling system.|$|R
50|$|The lack {{of social}} and {{emotional}} cues over virtual communication platforms can result in increased instances of misinterpreting emotion and intentions. Kruger, Epley, Parker, and Ng (2005) found that individuals overestimate both their ability to clearly <b>relay</b> and <b>interpret</b> emotions via email. They attribute this inability to relay emotions effectively to others over CMC {{to a combination of}} egocentrism and a lack of paralinguistic cues including gestures, emphasis, and intonations.|$|R

The Šarafnāma is a {{well-known}} history of Kurdish dynasties and ruling houses, written in Persian in 1005 - 7 / 1596 - 99 by Amīr Šaraf Xān Bidlīsī (949 - 1009 / 1543 - 1600), leader of the Rōjikī tribe and prince of Bidlīs, southwest of Lake Van, in northern Kurdistan. In {{the course of my}} study of the Šarafnāma, I have worked with 36 different manuscripts of the text, covering a time period going from its composition (1005 / 1597) {{to the end of the}} 13 th/ 19 th century. In this preliminary article, I will share a few remarks on the ways in which, through three centuries of manuscript transmission, copyists have <b>relayed</b> and <b>interpreted</b> the text of the Šarafnāma according to cultural context, political necessity and/or professional choices...|$|R
40|$|Based on a 4 -year ethnographic {{study of}} conference interpreters {{working for the}} EU institutions’ {{interpreting}} services, the book describes conference interpreting as a practice, that is, the ‘lived work’ (Clancey 2006) of professionals. This approach builds {{on the idea that}} conference interpreters do not perform their job in isolation, but in a team with colleagues and in a wider social and organizational framework which shapes the conditions under which they work and the professional requirements put upon them. Its attention to the social and institutional embedding of conference interpreting also reflects recent developments in Translation Studies. These have resulted in an increased focus on interpreters as social agents and a new openness to interdisciplinary research (Pöchhacker 2009). The study was motivated by the gap that interpreter trainers and institutional recruiters observe between, on the one hand, the level of competence acquired by graduates who are successful in EU accreditation tests and, on the other hand, that which is needed to perform adequately in EU interpreting assignments. Drawing on documentary evidence, interview data and field notes resulting from observant participation of interpreters working for the interpreting services of the European Commission (DG SCIC) and the European Parliament (DG INTE), the book first describes how EU interpreters are employed by the interpreting DGs of the European Commission and the European Parliament in a highly institutionalized and complex environment. It demonstrates that, although they are divided into various subgroups along organizational (DG SCIC vs. DG INTE), administrative (ACIs/freelancers vs. officials) and linguistic (based on A-language) lines, the specific characteristics of their work context define them as a community of practice (Wenger 1998) with a joint professional mission. Both gate-keeping (accreditation tests and staff competitions) and quality standards are shown to be mainly managed by members of the community itself. Subsequently, a series of major distinctive features of EU interpreting work and their implications for the knowledge and skills required of practitioners are discussed. First, {{as a result of the}} EU’s policy of multilingualism, large language regimes are common in EU meetings. As these involve extensive recourse to retour and <b>relay</b> <b>interpreting,</b> insight in the implications of the information provided on the team sheet and proficiency in the interaction with the simultaneous interpreting equipment are indispensable for interpreters. Second, meeting types and subject fields vary across space (i. e. the working places and buildings of the various institutions served by the EU interpreting services) and time (i. e. according to institutional cycles). Under these conditions, it is essential not only to acquire familiarity with the material context, but also to develop the ability to recognize the links between the spatio-temporal situation and the characteristics of interpreting assignments. Third, within meetings, several meeting activities can be distinguished, each of them associated with specific types of interaction and discourse. For EU interpreters it is essential to be able to understand the implications of the meeting agenda, i. e. to link agenda items to various meeting activities in order to gauge the characteristics of the interpreting assignment. Fourth, both interpreting services have developed an array of dedicated ICT tools for advance consultation of meeting documents, terminology research, etc., which EU interpreters need to master. By examining the ways the EU interpreting DGs define categories of interpreter employees as ‘beginners’ and ‘newcomers’ and how the DGs regulate such employees’ eligibility for specific support measures, the study reveals how formal and informal arrangements contribute to creating or restricting individuals’ opportunities for situated learning. Drawing on interview and observational data reflecting differences in the skills and knowledge of beginning and experienced interpreters, it argues that interpreting competence is situated (i. e. bounded to a specific working context) and includes not only cognitive, but also embodied and social components. An examination of the opportunities for learning offered by participation in the practice shows that, for EU interpreters, situated learning is a necessary complement to formal conference interpreting training in that it allows them to become familiar with the shared repertoire of knowledge and skills required to cope with their task. Finally, the study demonstrates how the multidimensional concept of competence which emerges from a practice view contributes to a better understanding of the problems beginning interpreters face. A multimodal analysis of the way on-mic work is distributed among boothmates in a sample of EU meetings shows how Dutch booth interpreters draw on a complex of cognitive, social and embodied skills in order to apply shared professional and moral values in the course of an assignment. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that as many as 23, 000 in-hospital cardiac arrests in the UK could be prevented with earlier detection and intervention (Hodgetts et al., 2002). Cases of 'failure to rescue' are often linked with difficulties <b>relaying</b> and <b>interpreting</b> information across occupational and professional boundaries. Standardised communication protocols have been recommended as a means of enabling the transmission of concise, salient information, licensing and empowering the individual to overcome established hierarchies in speaking out and asking for help. This paper critically examines the current discourse around such protocols. We find that there is a paucity of evidence regarding the complex relationship between social contexts, individual applications of these protocols and short- and long-term impact on safety and 'failure to rescue' rates. The paper highlights the complexities of the underlying power dynamics that are located within gendered and occupational hierarchies and explores the role of standardised communication protocols as a potential boundary object. The paper discusses the potential for these protocols to inter-relate and act as a mediating boundary object between nursing and medical staff, enabling understanding and sharing of cultural context.
