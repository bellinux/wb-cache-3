5|$|The subte {{operations}} are <b>radio-controlled</b> and monitored remotely from the Metrovías Central Operations Post (PCO in Spanish). In it, 24 operators have been monitoring {{four of the}} six subway lines (lines C and H have separate monitoring) since 2001. As of 2015, last formations arrive at their respective terminals at approximately 11:30pm, where maintenance and cleaning operations take place until about 04:00am.|$|E
5|$|Hannover {{was brought}} back to active service in the Reichsmarine, the post-war Germany navy. She served with the fleet for ten years, from 1921 to 1931, before she was again decommissioned. The navy planned to convert the ship into a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship for aircraft, but this was never carried out. The ship was {{ultimately}} broken up for scrap between 1944 and 1946 in Bremerhaven. Her bell is preserved at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Hessen {{was one of}} the few {{obsolete}} battleships Germany {{was permitted}} to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. She served as a coastal defense ship in the 1920s and early 1930s, though she was withdrawn from front-line service in 1934. The following year, the ship was converted into a <b>radio-controlled</b> target. During World War II Hessen served in this capacity, while also working as an icebreaker in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946 after the end of the war and, renamed Tsel, served until scrapped in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Retained {{under the}} Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, both ships were modernized significantly, with torpedo bulges and oil-fired boilers {{installed}} and other improvements made, but were demilitarized under {{terms of the}} 1930 London Naval Treaty. Florida was scrapped, Utah converted into first a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship, then an anti-aircraft gunnery trainer. She served in the latter role until sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Her hull, never raised, remains {{on the bottom of}} the harbor as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{were unaware}} of this and mounted further attacks on the site {{as part of the}} United States Army Air Forces {{experimental}} Operation Aphrodite, involving <b>radio-controlled</b> B-24 Liberators packed with explosives. Two such attacks were mounted but failed; in the second such attack, on 12 August, Lt Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.– the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy– was killed when the drone aircraft exploded prematurely. By the end of the bombing campaign, over 4,100 tons of bombs had been dropped on Mimoyecques, more than on any other V-weapons site.|$|E
5|$|According to the London Naval Treaty, {{the ship}} was {{to be removed from}} front-line service. To this end, she had her main battery guns removed and she was {{converted}} into a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship. She was redesignated AG-16, and served in this capacity after 1931. In the mid-1930s, she was rebuilt again, as an anti-aircraft gunnery training ship. In 1941, additional anti-aircraft guns were installed to increase her training capacity. Later in 1941, she was transferred to the US Pacific Fleet and based in Pearl Harbor. She was present in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941; after having been hit by two torpedoes, she capsized and sank. A few years later, the hull was partially righted and towed closer to Ford Island, where the wreck remains today.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew <b>radio-controlled</b> aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E
5|$|The five ships all saw active service during World War I, {{primarily}} as coast defense {{ships in the}} IV Battle Squadron. Hessen {{was transferred to the}} II Battle Squadron in 1916 and took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916. All five ships of the class were retained by the Reichsmarine following Germany's defeat in World War I, and saw further service in a variety of roles. Hessen was eventually rebuilt as a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship, while Preussen and Lothringen were converted into minesweeper tenders. All of the ships, with the exception of Hessen, were broken up in the 1930s; Hessen survived until the end of World War II, when she was taken over by the Soviet Navy, for continued use as a target ship.|$|E
5|$|While {{the force}} {{was in the}} Strait of Bonifacio, Dornier Do 217s of the German Luftwaffes {{specialist}} wing KG 100armed with Fritz X <b>radio-controlled</b> bombssighted the force. The first attack failed, but the second dealt Italia (ex-Littorio) and Roma much damage. The hit on Roma caused water to flood two boiler rooms and the after engine room, leaving the ship to limp along with two propellers, reduced power, and arc-induced fires in {{the stern of the}} ship. Shortly thereafter, another bomb slammed into the ship which detonated within the forward engine room, causing catastrophic flooding and the explosion of the #2 main turret's magazines, throwing the turret itself into the sea. Sinking by the bow and listing to starboard, Roma capsized and broke in two, carrying 1,393 menincluding Bergaminidown with her.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro was {{completed}} on 31 March 1917 and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18, though she had no combat role in World War I. Like her sister, she patrolled {{off the coast of}} China during the war and assisted during the Great Kanto Earthquake. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to Port Arthur, China, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China. Yamashiro became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched <b>radio-controlled</b> Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} fleet, the Wittelsbach class ships were {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron, where they replaced the older Brandenburg-class ships. Like the Kaiser Friedrich III-class ships, the Wittelsbachs were withdrawn from active service after the advent of the dreadnoughts. The five ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. They {{were assigned to}} the IV Battle Squadron and deployed to the Baltic. However, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. By 1922, all of the ships had been broken up for scrap, with the exception of Zähringen. She was converted into a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship in 1926–27. RAF bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
5|$|After sea trials, Tirpitz was {{stationed}} in Kiel and performed intensive training in the Baltic. While the ship was in Kiel, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the possible break-out of the Soviet fleet based in Leningrad. Tirpitz was briefly made the flagship of the squadron, which consisted of the heavy cruiser , the light cruisers , , , and , several destroyers, and two flotillas of minesweepers. The Baltic Fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax, patrolled off the Aaland Islands from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and Tirpitz resumed training. During the training period, Tirpitz tested her primary and secondary guns on the old pre-dreadnought battleship , which had been converted into a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on Tirpitz while she {{was stationed}} in Kiel.|$|E
5|$|British {{submarines}} {{were becoming}} increasingly {{active in the}} Baltic by late 1915; several cruisers had been sunk and the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships {{could no longer be}} risked there. Therefore, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service and disarmed by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. The entire class, with the exception of Zähringen, were struck from the navy list after the end of World War I. Mecklenburg was struck on 27 January 1920, Wettin followed on 11 March 1920, and Wittelsbach and Schwaben were struck on 8 March 1921. The four ships were broken up between 1921–22. Zähringen was converted into a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship in 1926–27. Royal Air Force bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer Instinct 2, in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. At its first stage of development, Diddy Kong Racing was {{conceived}} as a real-time strategy game with a caveman/time-travel theme worked on by a team of four Rare members; Chris Stamper, Lee Musgrave, Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman. During later stages of development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to <b>radio-controlled</b> cars.|$|E
5|$|In the {{intervening}} months, the Ministry of Transport had withdrawn permission for further stunts to be filmed on the M40, forcing the production team {{to resort to}} alternative methods to complete the Tiger Moth sequences. The special effects department constructed a -scale model re-creation, located on the Century 21 outdoor backlot to reduce lighting discrepancies, with <b>radio-controlled</b> miniatures of the Tiger Moth made to replace Hughes' aircraft. Ranging from six feet (1.8m) in width to a smaller -scale for filming with the puppet characters, the replicas were unreliable and frequently crashed, but Anderson asserts that the production team successfully merged the full-sized and miniature shots {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish which aircraft is piloted by Hughes and which is remote-controlled. The scale reconstruction of the M40 bridge was aligned with a backdrop of real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as faithfully as possible. Bad weather forced the outdoor filming to run for six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Littorio was {{inactive}} for {{the first}} six months of 1943 due to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. Only enough fuel was available for Littorio, Vittorio Veneto and their recently commissioned sister , but even then the fuel was only enough for emergencies. On 19 June 1943, an American bombing raid targeted the harbor at La Spezia and hit Littorio with three bombs. She was renamed Italia on 30 July after the government of Benito Mussolini fell from power. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, Italia and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be interned for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X <b>radio-controlled</b> bombs. One Fritz X hit Italia just forward of turret no. 1; it passed through the ship and exited the hull, exploding in the water beneath and causing serious damage. Roma was meanwhile sunk in the attack.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Pro-Am is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Rare. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Nintendo for North America in March 1988, {{and then in}} Europe on April 15 of the same year. Presented in an overhead isometric perspective, a single player races a <b>radio-controlled</b> car around a series of tracks. The objective of each track is {{to qualify for the}} next race by placing in the top three racers. Players collect items to improve performance, and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks. It {{is an example of a}} racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles. Originally titled Pro Am Racing, R.C. Pro-Am was also ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992 as Championship Pro-Am, an enhanced remake with enhanced graphics and additional features. R.C. Pro-Am was followed by two sequels: Super R.C. Pro-Am in 1991, and R.C. Pro-Am II in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after her}} commissioning, Littorio was badly damaged during the British air raid on Taranto on 11 November 1940, which put {{her out of}} action until the {{following}} March. Littorio thereafter took part in several sorties to catch the British Mediterranean Fleet, most of which failed to result in any action, the notable exception being the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942, where she damaged several British warships. Littorio was renamed Italia in July 1943 {{after the fall of}} the Fascist government. On 9 September 1943, the Italian fleet was attacked by German bombers while it was on its way to internment. During this action, which saw the destruction of her sister , Italia herself was hit by a Fritz X <b>radio-controlled</b> bomb, causing significant damage to her bow. As part of the armistice agreement, Italia was interned at Malta, Alexandria, and finally in the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal, where she remained until 1947. Italia was awarded to the United States as a war prize and scrapped at La Spezia in 195254.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{reconstruction}} {{began on}} 18 December 1930 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal where her machinery was replaced, her armor was reinforced, and torpedo bulges were fitted. Yamashiros armament was also upgraded and her torpedo tubes were removed. Captain Chuichi Nagumo assumed {{command of the}} ship on 15 November 1934, her modernization was completed on 30 March 1935, and she became flagship of the Combined Fleet. Captain Masakichi Okuma relieved Nagumo on 15 November and he, in turn, was replaced by Captain Masami Kobayashi on 1 December 1936. Yamashiro began a lengthy refit on 27 June 1937 and Captain Kasuke Abe assumed command on 20 October. Her refit was completed on 31 March 1938 and Captain Kakuji Kakuta relieved Abe on 15 November. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched <b>radio-controlled</b> Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes. Captain Chozaemon Obata assumed command on 24 May 1941 and Yamashiro {{was assigned to the}} 1st Fleet's 2nd Division, consisting of the two Fusō-class and the two s.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, the Battle of the Ruhr {{was coming}} to an end and Bomber Command refocused its efforts on the port city of Hamburg in {{northern}} Germany. The codename for the attack was Operation Gomorrah; the objective was the destruction of Hamburg. The operations began on 24 July 1943 and during four major night-attacks by the RAF and two minor day-attacks by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) between 40,000 and 50,000 civilians were killed. To counter the mounting success of the German night fighter force, which was directly attributed to the introduction of the Lichtenstein radar, the RAF introduced Window (Chaff or Düppel to the Germans). Window was a radar countermeasure in which aircraft spread a cloud of small, thin pieces of aluminium which effectively made it impossible for the German radar operator to identify the genuine target. Saturation of the Himmelbett control areas by a bomber stream and the introduction of Window practically made the previous Himmelbett procedure obsolete. This was also evident to the German high command. To counter these British measures two new strategies were pursued, Wilde Sau (Wild Boar) and Zahme Sau (Tame Boar). Wilde Sau, conceived by Hans-Joachim Herrmann, was a technique by which the RAF bombers were mainly engaged by single-seat fighter planes, illuminated by searchlights, over the target area. The Zahme Sau procedure, proposed by Viktor von Loßberg, called for a night fighter to infiltrate the bomber stream. The position, altitude, and general direction was then broadcast. The information was received by other night fighters, who navigated to the bomber stream by themselves. In Zahme Sau, the German night fighters were tracked and <b>radio-controlled</b> by means of Y-Verfahren (Y-Control). Schnaufer did not make any claims during Operation Gomorrah. Their next success came when he and Freymann shot down a Lancaster on 10/11 August 1943 at 00:32. The target that night was Nuremberg and it was the first aerial victory of the entire German night fighter force achieved by Y-Control. This was also the last victory with Freymann and his last as a member of II. Gruppe.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, three Proctors were remodelled with {{inverted}} gull {{wings and}} other cosmetic alterations to represent Junkers Ju 87s {{in the film}} Battle of Britain but, in the event, <b>radio-controlled</b> models were used instead.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>radio-controlled</b> model hobbyists {{also use}} the {{airbrush}} to create works of art on the Lexan bodies. The paint jobs range from a basic one-color paint job to fine detailed works of art.|$|E
25|$|Its {{merchandising}} was commercially successful, {{being one}} of the most popular selling toy ranges in 2002. It included a mini arena, pullback, friction & ripcord toys and <b>radio-controlled</b> versions of Shunt, Matilda and Sir Killalot.|$|E
25|$|Another 209 D and F {{models were}} ordered and {{converted}} to unmanned <b>radio-controlled</b> FSAT (full scale aerial target) drone and drone directors for testing and destruction by modern air-to-air missiles used by current U.S. Air Force fighter jets.|$|E
25|$|A-4: Seventeen BT-2BRs and BT-2BGs {{converted}} in 1940 as <b>radio-controlled</b> aerial target drones. These had tricycle gear (a steerable nosewheel was added) with main gear moved aft, faired-over rear cockpit, and single controls, allowing the aircraft to be test-flown.|$|E
25|$|A <b>radio-controlled</b> {{car racing}} circuit is named {{in honour of}} Depailler at his home town. The Mini Circuit Patrick Depailler {{is one of the}} oldest tracks in France and was used to host an International Federation of Model Auto Racing (IFMAR) meeting in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Chris Green {{as chief}} {{executive}} led a drive to improve reliability and punctuality after much press criticism in 2001, and by 2006, due to improved reliability of trains and completion of major infrastructure projects, performance was better. Virgin has undertaken a number of projects to increase punctuality, including <b>radio-controlled</b> watches.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish Armistice {{agreement}} was signed onboard Agamemnon. The two ships then {{passed through the}} Dardanelles to Constantinople. Agamemnon then returned home, while Lord Nelson spent a short time in the Black Sea. After the war the pre-dreadnought battleships were no longer needed. Lord Nelson was sold for scrapping in 1920 while Agamemnon survived as a <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship until 1927.|$|E
25|$|As Coast Battleship No. 4, {{she became}} the first <b>radio-controlled</b> target ship to be used in a fleet exercise. At the Philadelphia Navy Yard, workers removed the ship's guns, sealed compartments, and {{installed}} water pumps to slow the sinking process and enable a longer target session. They also installed radio control gear, developed by the radio engineer John Hays Hammond Jr.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to professional uses where accurate time is required, <b>radio-controlled</b> clocks with both digital and analog displays using the NPL signal {{are widely used}} (similar clocks are available in other regions with standard time transmissions). As far as users are concerned they are simply clocks with the same features and settings as others, but always display the right time, and correct themselves for summer time.|$|E
25|$|The Cybermats were {{controlled}} by various means– some by wires, some by wind-up clockwork, some by radio-control, and some by simply being shoved into the shot. When the team were not filming, {{it was known}} for the people controlling the <b>radio-controlled</b> Cybermats to chase Deborah Watling around on set. The scene of the Cybermen breaking out of their tombs was filmed entirely in one take.|$|E
