5|$|The {{exterior}} and {{roof of the}} Seattle Times Building were designated a city landmark in 1996. Designed by Robert C. <b>Reamer</b> with elements of the Art Deco and Moderne styles, the reinforced concrete building was representative of early 20th century architecture in Seattle.|$|E
5|$|A {{second phase}} of {{building}} and upgrades started in 1908 {{which resulted in the}} prominent architecture visible at Fort Yellowstone in the 21st century. Built from locally quarried sandstone, these buildings defined Fort Yellowstone. The most prominent of the structures built in the later period is the Horace Albright Visitor Center which was originally the bachelor officers' quarters (Bldg 1). Each historic building in the fort and the park was assigned an official number, with the original bachelor officers' quarters being building number 1. Architects Reed and Stem and Robert <b>Reamer</b> along with the U.S. Army Office of the Chief Quartermaster, Department of Dakota participated in the design of many of the facilities. Engineer facilities and landscaping were designed by Captain Hiram M. Chittenden of the U.S. Corps of Engineers.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{effect of}} reaming on bone volume and {{surface area of}} the glenoid is not {{precisely}} known. We hypothesize that (1) convex <b>reamers</b> create a larger surface area than flat <b>reamers,</b> (2) flat <b>reamers</b> cause less bone loss than convex <b>reamers,</b> and (3) the amount of bone loss increases {{with the amount of}} version correction. Methods Reaming procedures with different types of <b>reamers</b> are performed on similar-sized uniconcave and biconcave glenoids created from Sawbones foam blocks. The loss of bone volume, the size of the remaining surface area, and the reaming depth are measured and evaluated. Results Reaming with convex <b>reamers</b> results in a significantly larger surface area than with flat <b>reamers</b> for both uniconcave and biconcave glenoids (p[*]=[*] 0. 013 and p[*]=[*] 0. 001). Convex <b>reamers</b> cause more bone loss than flat <b>reamers,</b> but the difference is only significant for uniconcave glenoids (p[*]=[*] 0. 007). Conclusions In biconcave glenoids, convex <b>reamers</b> remove a similar amount of bone as flat <b>reamers,</b> but offer a larger surface area while maximizing the correction of the retroversion. In pathological uniconcave glenoids, convex <b>reamers</b> are preferred because of the conforming shape. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the largest}} crowd to ever witness {{a game in}} Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, Alabama {{defeated}} their long-time rival, the Ole Miss Rebels, 22–3. Alabama struggled to put {{the ball in the}} end zone all afternoon with drives stalled at the Mississippi 8, 4, 4, 4, and 13. Each of those drives resulted in a field goal by Leigh Tiffin, who was 5 for 5 on the day. Other special teams contributions included a blocked punt in the second quarter and a recovered Dexter McCluster fumble on a punt return in the third quarter, both by Cory <b>Reamer.</b> McElroy struggled, completing only 15 of 34 passes for 147 yards, but Mark Ingram ran for a then career-high 172 yards and accounted for Alabama's only touchdown on a 36-yard run in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the {{transcript}} of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi <b>Reamer</b> of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Her sister {{liked the}} book and {{encouraged}} Meyer to send the manuscript to literary agencies. Of the 15 letters she wrote, five went unanswered, nine brought rejections, and the last was a positive response from Jodi <b>Reamer</b> of Writers House. Meyer had merely sent out letters to literary agents inquiring {{if they would be}} interested in a 130,000-word manuscript about teenage vampires. Luck helped. An inexperienced assistant at Writers House responded to her inquiry, not knowing that young adult books are expected to be about 40,000 to 60,000 words in length. Due to that error, <b>Reamer</b> eventually read Meyer's manuscript and signed her up as a client. During the editing process, a chapter that used to be Chapter 20 was cut out of the manuscript along with Emmett's account of his bear attack and some parts of the epilogue.|$|E

They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from reamers {{in the amount of}} material they are intended to remove. A <b>reamer</b> is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|E

40|$|The MITCH PCRTM Cup is an {{evolution}} of the anatomic, flexible Cambridge Cup. The Cambridge Cup two layer mechanical interlock design has been converted to a mono-block structure, where the bearing articulation is formed of the same material as {{the bulk of the}} cup. The cup has an outer surface that should enhance long term bony fixation. The Cambridge Cup metal on polyethylene bearing has been changed to a ceramic on polyetheretherketone bearing. Prior to seeking Ethical Committee approval for the first MITCH PCRTM Cup clinical study, validation that the acetabulum could be prepared in a manner which would allow the MITCH PCRTM Cup to be implanted safely, was undertaken. This study describes the four phases of the validation process and the modification made to the cup design in order to ensure safe acetabular preparation. The first study investigated the effect of interference fit on cup deflection. An interference fit of O. 5 mm or less was required to ensure polar contact necessary for safe tribological performance. The second study examined the variability of socket dimensions achieved in foam blocks, using <b>reamers</b> provided by five different commercial manufacturers. Excessive socket undersizing was a common finding with all but the EPM <b>reamers.</b> These <b>reamers</b> were validated for accuracy and precision. In the third study, EPM <b>reamers</b> were used to ream cadaveric bone. The socket dimensions obtained were variable with an interference fit of up to 1. 8 mm obtained. Bony protrusions were observed which could also increase cup deflection and compromise proper cup seating. As a consequence, the cup internal geometry was modified to accommodate the spectrum of findings observed. The fourth study used the modified cups and a new reaming strategy comprising both conventional and custom MITCH PCRTM finishing <b>reamers</b> to achieve safe acetabular preparation. The results showed satisfactory clearance was achieved at the cup side arms in all cases. The reaming solution was appropriate for progression to the first clinical implantation.
