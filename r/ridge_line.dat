5|$|Their {{defensive}} line, however, was incomplete, as {{the small}} village of Bréville-les-Monts, between the commandos and the 3rd Parachute Brigade, {{was held by}} the Germans.

5|$|Later in the morning, No. 6 Commando {{came under}} {{artillery}} and mortar fire from Bréville. The commandos attacked and cleared {{the village of}} Germans, capturing several prisoners, some machine-guns and four artillery pieces. Then they withdrew to their original position. The Germans reoccupied the village and formed their own defensive positions, facing the <b>ridge</b> <b>line</b> defended by the airborne division. Their positions also isolated the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was almost {{cut off from the}} rest of the division.|$|E

5|$|Also in Brooklyn, the BMT Canarsie Line {{would gain}} an eastern branch to Spring Creek, serving Starrett City (now Spring Creek Towers). The {{mainline}} {{would also be}} lengthened from its southern terminus at Rockaway Parkway to a new terminus in Midwood and Flatlands near the existing Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College IRT station. The reroute would not use the existing segment between New Lots Avenue and Rockaway Parkway. Later plans suggested extending the line as far west as McDonald Avenue near the Avenue I station of the IND Culver Line or possibly to New Utrecht Avenue to the New Utrecht Avenue/62nd Street station, creating crosstown service through central Brooklyn. It was also proposed to relocate the Canarsie Line west of its current right-of-way south of Broadway Junction, along the parallel LIRR Bay Ridge Branch (currently a freight-only branch) or in the median of the proposed Queens Interboro Expressway and Cross Brooklyn Expressway, {{which would have been}} built along both the LIRR branch and Linden Boulevard. The re-alignment would have facilitated both extensions. The current Bushwick Avenue, Broadway Junction and Atlantic Avenue stations would have been consolidated into one station on the Bay <b>Ridge</b> <b>Line,</b> new Sutter Avenue and Livonia Avenue stations would have been built, and the East 105th Street station would be replaced with a station at Rockaway Avenue on the Bay <b>Ridge</b> <b>Line.</b> Additional stations would have been built at Remsen Avenue, Ralph Avenue, Utica Avenue to connect with the Utica Avenue Line, Nostrand Avenue to connect with the Nostrand Avenue Line, Avenue H to connect with the Brighton Line, and McDonald Avenue to connect to the Culver Line before terminating at New Utrecht Avenue.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} on the front was chaotic during the day September 1.

5|$|At Homs, {{the brigade}} rested {{for two days}} and on 19 October headed for Er Rastan, with orders to repair a bridge over the River Orontes, which had been {{destroyed}} by retreating Turkish forces. The next day, assisted by No. 5 Field Squadron Royal Engineers, was spent repairing the bridge, after which the brigade advanced, reaching Hama on 21 October. The brigade had expected to rest there for several days but were ordered to continue the advance to Aleppo. The brigade was preceded by seven light armoured cars, but {{the remainder of the}} division was following a day behind. On 24 October the armoured cars' advance was stopped by Turkish defences near Khan Tuman. The Turkish held a strong defensive line on a <b>ridge</b> <b>line</b> to the south and west of Aleppo. The brigade was ordered to occupy a position on the Aleppo-Alexandretta road and to clear Turkish trenches on the ridge to the west of Aleppo, but when they reached the <b>ridge</b> <b>line</b> on 26 October, the position had been evacuated. Intelligence from locals suggested that a force of 1,000 men with two small artillery guns were heading north out of Aleppo, so the brigade set off in pursuit. At 11:00, the leading two Jodhpur Lancers squadrons and a machine-gun section reached a position overlooking Haritan to the north of Aleppo when they came under Turkish small arms fire. Harbord ordered an immediate brigade attack; the Mysore Lancers would move around to the east of the ridge and charge the village, followed by the other two Jodhpur Lancer squadrons while the remainder of the brigade machine-gun squadron would move onto the ridge to provide covering fire, with the two other Jodhpur squadrons. The armoured cars of No. 12 Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at 11:30 and were ordered along the main road to support the attack.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} lest {{he and his}} men should be engaged when they reached the Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the <b>ridge</b> <b>line</b> in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by the Canadians on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the Australians, the Canadian fire did not hit them. This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the Canadians and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} in, the rowing boats had become mixed up.

The plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first <b>ridge</b> <b>line,</b> but they were faced with a hill that came down almost to the water line, and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location, under small arms fire from the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at Anzac Cove and a second platoon in the north around the Fisherman's Hut. The third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge. They also manned the Gaba Tepe strong-point, equipped with two obsolescent multi-barrelled Nordenfelt machine-guns, and several smaller posts in the south.|$|E

The plan called for dismantling part of Furness's additions to the PSFS headquarters, which would serve as the tower's lobby. The York Row houses would have been completely demolished. The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged. P Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a new plan that would preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade. The new plan, which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space. The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored. P Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses, back to the roof <b>ridge</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|That {{night was}} quiet {{until just before}} dawn. The North Koreans then {{launched}} an attack against the 9th Infantry {{on the right of}} the marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came {{in the midst of a}} downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling North Korean force on the <b>ridge</b> <b>line.</b> He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. His sudden attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard-pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close-up North Korean positions and, in hand-to-hand fighting, he bayoneted four more North Korean soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed the crew members of a North Korean mortar. American artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the North Koreans in this night and day battle.|$|E
5|$|The Anzacs {{were confronted}} by a treacherous, {{confusing}} tangle of ravines and spurs that descended from the heights of the Sarı Baır range to the sea. The landing was only lightly opposed by scattered Turkish units until Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division and perceiving {{the threat posed by}} the landings, rushed reinforcements to the area in what became a race for the high ground. The contest for the heights was decided on the second <b>ridge</b> <b>line</b> where the Anzacs and Turks fought over a knoll called Baby 700. The position changed hands a number of times on the first day before the Turks, having the advantage of the higher ground on Battleship Hill, took final possession of it. Once the Anzac advance was checked, the Turks counter-attacked, trying to force the invaders back to the shore, but failed to dislodge them from the foothold they had gained. A trench perimeter quickly developed and a bloody stalemate ensued until August.|$|E

5|$|Late that afternoon, {{after about}} a week of dry weather, it began to rain. As a result, the track became more {{difficult}} and mobility was reduced; the tanks found the track impassable {{and as a consequence}} the advancing Australian infantry lost their direct fire support. Resupply also proved to be a problem for them. The jeeps that had been bringing up supplies could not get forward and there were not enough native porters to meet the demand. As a result, the Australians had to resort to using one of their infantry battalions, the 2/24th, to bring supplies forward from Palanko while the 2/23rd continued the advance on Kuanko. Several isolated pockets of Japanese defenders were located along the track holding and so, while their sister battalion struggled up and down the steep track under the weight of their portage, on 1 December elements of the 2/23rd, leaving their heavy stores and equipment behind, advanced up a steep, muddy slope and set about clearing these positions. The Japanese resistance was overwhelmed and by midday the Australians entered Kuanko. Exploiting beyond the village in the afternoon, the lead Australian company took fire from a <b>ridge</b> <b>line</b> to the north-west and the advance was halted for the day.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch's 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, {{on the eve}} of its {{attack against}} Hill 314 {{numbered}} 535 men, less its rear echelons. The battalion, which had been organized at Fort Benning, Georgia, from the US 30th Infantry Regiment of the US 3rd Infantry Division, had arrived in Korea at the end of August. The action of the 7th Cavalry at Hill 518, begun nine days earlier, had been its first action, and attacking Hill 314 would be its second. The battalion attack plan this time differed radically from that employed against Hill 518 and was a direct development of that failure. The key aspect of the Hill 314 attack plan was to mass as many riflemen as possible on top of the narrow <b>ridge</b> <b>line,</b> by attacking with two companies abreast along the ridge, as opposed to Hill 518, where the firepower of only a platoon, and at times of only a squad, could be brought to bear against the North Koreans. Because of the ammunition shortage there was no artillery preparation on Hill 314, but there was an air strike before Lynch's battalion, with L Company on the left and I Company on the right started its attack from the lower slopes at 11:00 on September 12.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September, the {{division}} {{returned to the}} line near Gouzeaucourt; the Germans had dug in along a <b>ridge</b> <b>line</b> from Épehy to Trescault intending to delay the British from reaching the Hindenberg Line. The Fourth Army was tasked with clearing these positions. On 18 September, the Battle of Épehy was fought. The division attacked at 05:40 with the 113th and 114th Brigades. For his role during the assault, William Allison White earned the VC. Alone, he assaulted a machine gun post that was hindering the advance, killing the defenders and capturing the gun. He then launched a second attack, accompanied by two others who were killed, to seize another German machine gun position killing a further five and again capturing the gun. In a third action, White led a small group to overwhelm a German defensive position that was also holding up the advance. He proceeded to organise the defence of the position, and fought off a German counterattack with heavy losses using captured machine guns. Both brigades were able to reach their objectives despite flanking fire, and fought off numerous counter-attacks. Despite this, the Germans were able to cling on to Gouzeaucourt. The battle cleared the German outposts {{in front of the}} Hindenburg Line, preparing the way for future operations.
