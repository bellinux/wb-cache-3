50|$|A {{proof test}} {{is a form}} of stress test to {{demonstrate}} the fitness of a load-bearing structure, or <b>rescue</b> <b>strop.</b> An individual proof test may apply only to the unit tested, or to its design in general for mass-produced items. Such a structure is often subjected to loads above that expected in actual use, demonstrating safety and design margin. Proof testing is nominally a nondestructive test, particularly if both design margins and test levels are well-chosen. However, unit failures are by definition considered to have been destroyed for their originally-intended use and load levels.|$|E
