5000|$|A <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>marker</b> is {{a safety}} device used on roads. These devices are usually made with plastic, ceramic, {{thermoplastic}} paint or occasionally metal, {{and come in}} a variety of shapes and colors. Raised reflective markers include a lens or sheeting that enhances their visibility by retroreflecting automotive headlights. Some other names for specific types of raised pavement markers include convex vibration lines, Botts' dots, delineators, cat's eyes, road studs, or road turtles. Sometimes they are simply referred to as [...] "reflectors".|$|E
50|$|Stimsonite went on {{to become}} the leading {{manufacturer}} of raised pavement markers in the United States and was acquired in the mid-1990s by Avery Dennison Corporation. For about a decade, Avery sold Stimsonite's line under its Sun Country brand. In 2006, Avery sold its <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>marker</b> division to Ennis Paint, one of the largest manufacturers worldwide of paint for pavement markings (particularly lane markings). The company (based in Ennis, Texas) changed its name to Ennis Traffic Safety Solutions and now markets the Stimsonite product line (and descendants) under the Stimsonite brand. Other manufacturers of retroreflective raised pavement markers sold in the United States under various designs include 3M, Apex Universal, Vialume, and Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5000|$|Delineators are tall pylons (similar {{to traffic}} cones or bollards) {{mounted on the}} road surface, or {{along the edge of}} a road, and are used to {{channelize}} traffic. These are a form of <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>marker</b> but unlike most such markers, delineators are not supposed to be hit except by out-of-control or drifting vehicles. Unlike their smaller cousins, delineators are tall enough to impact not only a vehicle's tires but the vehicle body itself. They usually contain one or more retroreflective strips. They can be round and open in the center or curved (45-degree sections) of plastic with a reflective strip. They are also used in low reflective markers in a [...] "T" [...] shape. They {{can also be used to}} indicate lane closures as in cases where the number of lanes is reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Caltrans {{engineers}} {{may have}} studied the concept of <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>markers</b> as early as 1936. [...] However, the department did not commence research in earnest until 1953, when the postwar economic boom resulted in an alarming {{increase in the number}} of cars and car accidents in California.

40|$|As {{the field}} service life of {{retroreflective}} <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>marker</b> (RRPM) is much shorter than expected, {{it is necessary}} to identify the causes and thus improve the RRPM structural design to mitigate the main failure modes, such as poor retention from pavements, structural damage, and loss of retroreflectivity. One strategy for extending RRPM service life is to enhance RRPM geometric characteristics to decrease critical stresses in markers. The main purpose of this thesis is to analyze the relationship between stresses, failure modes, and RRPM profiles. Based on this research, some measures are suggested in order to avoid corresponding failure modes by optimizing RRPM profiles...|$|E
40|$|A <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>marker</b> is a {{retroreflective}} lens on a substrate {{attached to}} the pavement so as to protrude slightly above the pavement surface. Raised pavement markers (RPMs) {{have been used in}} the United States for decades to improve lane delineation in low light conditions. In areas subject to winter snowfall, the retroreflective lens is protected by a cast iron body embedded into the roadway to protect the lens from snowplow blades. There is empirical evidence that raised pavement markers become dislodged from the pavement when struck by snowplows or heavy vehicles and in some cases become projectiles that present a threat to motorists, creating a source of tort liability for the state. To address this issue, Indiana is considering centerline rumble stripes (CLRS) as an alternative to RPMs to maintain lane delineation in low light conditions without jeopardizing motorists 2 ̆ 7 safety or exposing the state to tort liability. ^ Experimental test sites were set up to analyze the performance of CLRS in multiple regions throughout Indiana. The criteria for evaluation included retroreflectivity in dry and wet conditions and the cost of installation and maintenance. The study results suggest that CLRS exhibit greater retroreflectivity compared to the standard painted line while being less expensive to install and maintain than RPMs. Placing paint within the rumble strip (creating a rumble stripe) adds a visibility improvement to the already-documented ability of rumble strips to alert an inattentive driver to lane departure. Based on the quantitative and qualitative analyses of this study, the CLRS were found to be a cost-effective alternative to RPMs for Indiana. ...|$|E
5000|$|Cat's {{eyes were}} the {{earliest}} form of retroreflective <b>pavement</b> <b>markers,</b> and are in use in the United Kingdom {{and other parts of}} the world. They were invented in the United Kingdom in 1933 by Percy Shaw and patented in 1934 (UK patents 436,290 and 457,536), and the United States in 1939 (US patent 2,146,359).

50|$|The {{first known}} musical road, the Asphaltophone, {{was created in}} October 1995 in Gylling, Østjylland, Denmark, by Steen Krarup Jensen and Jakob Freud-Magnus, two Danish artists. The Asphaltophone is made {{from a series of}} <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>markers,</b> similar to Botts' dots, spaced out at {{intermittent}} intervals so that as a vehicle drives over the markers, the vibrations caused by the wheels can be heard inside the car.|$|R
50|$|The {{right-hand}} shoulder {{is separated}} by a solid white line, and the left-hand shoulder (if the road is one-way, such {{as part of a}} divided highway) is separated from the leftmost through lane by a solid yellow line. On many roads the lines are supplemented by reflective <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>markers</b> or rumble strips placed every few feet in order to provide additional visual and tactile feedback to drivers crossing the lines.|$|R
50|$|Lane markers in some {{countries}} and states are marked with cat's eyes, Botts' dots or reflective <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>markers</b> that do not fade like paint. Botts dots are not used where it is icy in the winter, because frost and snowplows can break the glue that holds them to the road, although they can be embedded in short, shallow trenches carved in the roadway, as {{is done in the}} mountainous regions of California.|$|R
50|$|The marker is {{generally}} {{held in place}} using butyl pads, epoxy glue, or bitumen. In areas with little snowfall, reflective <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>markers</b> are applied directly {{on top of the}} road surface rather than being embedded in the surface. The device's retroreflective surface enables the device to be clearly visible at long distances at night and in rainy weather. The devices come in multiple colors which vary in usage depending on local traffic marking standards.|$|R

The Iowa Department of Transportation uses de-icers and sand during the winter to control snow and ice on the pavement. The sand and the chemicals reduced the reflectivity of the reflectors. With minimum or no maintenance the visibility of the RPM is low. Although the RPM appear to present a problem during snow plowing, they are an excellent device for lane delineation at night in adverse weather...|$|R
50|$|Botts {{never lived}} to see {{the success of his}} research. He died in April 1962 and his work on the dots was filed away; it was not even {{mentioned}} in his obituary in Translab's internal newsletter. Two years later, his research was rediscovered when his division, now under the direction of Herbert Rooney, decided to conduct further research into <b>raised</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>markers.</b> At this time, Translab developed the modern pattern of interspersing plastic square reflectors between groups of four round polyester or epoxy dots. This pattern was first tested along Interstate 80 near Vacaville in 1965. To minimize the risk that dots would become coated with rubber scraped off tires, Translab switched to ceramic round markers in 1966.|$|R

The incorporation of recycled glass into the concrete mixture is one of the proposed methods that was put through further laboratory study. The aim of the laboratory testing was to identify proper mixing proportions that mitigate the potential for the alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in recycled glass aggregate concretes without producing any negative effects on the compressive strength of the concrete. The retroreflectivity of these concrete mixtures was also evaluated and is presented in this report...|$|R
