5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} sexual maturity in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age of sexual maturity in males had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability</b> after becoming sexually mature, instead increasing with age and their sexual maturity has varied to a lesser extent then the male population across the years.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability.</b> Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E

5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability</b> are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational cooperative societies that assist {{each other in the}} rearing of young, often at the cost of an individual’s life or <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability.</b> Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability</b> of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring.

25|$|Although {{one female}} {{typically}} dominates the reproduction on one colony, {{there is strong}} evidence for co-foundress behavior among P. alternata. Occasionally, the founding of new colonies occurs from the cooperation of two or females. The females stay on the nest for {{a good portion of}} the day but rarely interact. Both co-foundresses contribute to the construction of the nest and overall protection of the colony. Though the associated females share many responsibilities equally, there is evidence that female foundresses with larger ovaries spend more time off the nest, indicating some type of hierarchy based on <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability.</b> One advantage in associative nesting is increased offspring. The more foundresses present in a nest, the more cells and eggs are produced. Also, the presence of more than one female improves active defense of the nest.|$|E

500|$|The untidy nest is {{composed}} of hay, grass, wool or other material and lined with feathers, which improve the thermal insulation. A complete nest consists of three layers; base, lining and dome. The typical clutch is five or six eggs (rarely more than four in Malaysia), white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots, small blotches, or speckling; they are [...] in size and weigh , of which 7% is shell. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12–13 days before the altricial, naked chicks hatch, and a further 15–18 days elapse before they fledge. Two or three broods may be raised each year; birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs, but {{the reverse is true}} for second and third clutches. Females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time, so within-pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs' <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability.</b> There is a significant level of promiscuity; in a Hungarian study, more than 9% of chicks were sired by extra-pair males, and 20% of the broods contained at least one extra-pair young.|$|E

50|$|Apoica pallens is a caste {{species with}} {{morphological}} differentiation between females.

This special morphology contributes to the <b>reproductive</b> <b>abilities</b> of the queens. The differences between the castes of queens and workers are formed during the larval stage. Queen-destined larvae show faster growth rates in various bodily compartments than worker-destined larvae. This results in individuals with different shapes even though larvae are about the same size.|$|R

The Drosophila female reproductive circuits, in particular, are well studied {{and can be used}} as a tool to understand the role of novel genes in neuronal function in general and female reproduction in particular. In the present study, the role of Beadex, a transcription co-activator, in Drosophila female reproduction was assessed by generation of mutant and knock down studies. Null allele of Beadex was generated by transposase induced excision of P-element present within an intron of Beadex gene. The mutant showed highly compromised <b>reproductive</b> <b>abilities</b> as evaluated by reduced fecundity and fertility, abnormal oviposition and more importantly, the failure of sperm release from storage organs. However, no defect was found in the overall ovariole development. Tissue specific, targeted knock down of Beadex indicated that its function in neurons is important for efficient female reproduction, since its neuronal knock down led to compromised female <b>reproductive</b> <b>abilities,</b> similar to Beadex null females. Further, different neuronal class specific knock down studies revealed that Beadex function is required in motor neurons for normal fecundity and fertility of females. Thus, the present study attributes a novel and essential role for Beadex in female reproduction through neurons...|$|R

50|$|Having {{a limited}} number of queens in a colony {{increases}} the risks associated with queen loss. This cost is not as great when more queens can easily be produced to replace the queens lost. However, it is suggested that caste determination in P. tabidus occurs early in development. Thus, queens are typically the only females that have <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability.</b> A consequence of limited <b>reproductive</b> <b>ability</b> is that queens are not easily replaced. Another cost of cyclical oligogyny is reproductive efficiency. P. tabidus queens have three ovarioles, Compared to single-queen Vespa colonies of similar size where queens have up to twelve ovarioles. This makes brood production difficult when there is only one queen. However, this case is rare and is therefore not detrimental toward reproductive fecundity. Reduced queen number typically occurs in a new swarm. Mature swarms are large and have many queens that produce males and new swarms.|$|E

Another example of a behavioral adaptation is the increase in reproductive output as a response of a parasitic infection, {{which is consistent with}} the hypothesis of fecundity compensation.
