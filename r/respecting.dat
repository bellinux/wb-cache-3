40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the ways in}} which college students conveyed elder <b>respect.</b> Based on data from a questionnaire survey of 521 subjects, 12 forms of elder <b>respect,</b> ranging from care <b>respect</b> to celebratory <b>respect,</b> were measured. Of these forms, six—acquiescent <b>respect,</b> care <b>respect,</b> linguistic <b>respect,</b> salutatory <b>respect,</b> consulting <b>respect,</b> and presentational respect— were frequently practiced. This study provides insights as to how younger adults in American culture exhibit elder <b>respect.</b> A typology of the forms signifying elder <b>respect</b> among the young American adults is presented.

40|$|Respectfulness is {{demanded of}} doctors and predicts more {{positive}} patient health-related outcomes but research is scarce on ways to promote it. This study explores two ways to conceptualize unconditional <b>respect</b> from medical students, defined as <b>respect</b> paid {{to people on the}} basis of their humanity, in order to inform strategies to increase it. Unconditional <b>respect</b> conceptualized as an attitude suggests that unconditional <b>respect</b> and conditional <b>respect</b> are additive, whereas unconditional <b>respect</b> conceptualized as a personality trait suggests that people who are high on unconditional <b>respect</b> afford equal <b>respect</b> to all humans regardless of their merits. One-hundred and eighty one medical students completed an unconditional <b>respect</b> measure then read a description of a respect-worthy or a non-respect-worthy man and indicated their <b>respect</b> towards him. The study found a main effect for unconditional <b>respect</b> and a main effect for target respect-worthiness but no interaction between the two when <b>respect</b> paid to the target was assessed, supporting the attitude-based conceptualization. This suggests that unconditional <b>respect</b> can be increased through relevant interventions aimed at increasing the relative salience to doctors of the human worth of individuals. Interventions to increase unconditional <b>respect</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} ingroup and outgroup sources of <b>respect,</b> defined as positive social evaluations of self on group members' emotional reactions and collective self-esteem. We used both natural group memberships (Studies I and 2) and laboratory groups (Study 3). We expected that {{the positive effects of}} <b>respect</b> derived from an ingroup would not hold when derived from an outgroup source. In Study I (N = 294) <b>respect</b> was manipulated as deriving either from ingroup or outgroup. Although <b>respect</b> produced a positive emotional reaction irrespective of source, collective self-esteem was only enhanced by an ingroup source. In Study 2 (N = 248), we {{investigated the}} concurrent effects of ingroup <b>respect</b> and outgroup <b>respect.</b> As in Study 1, ingroup and outgroup <b>respect</b> both produced positive emotional reactions, but collective self-esteem was only affected by ingroup <b>respect.</b> Additionally, outgroup <b>respect</b> intensified the shame people experienced due to lack of ingroup <b>respect.</b> In Study 3 (N = 66), participants were immersed in experimental groups and ingroup and outgroup <b>respect</b> were manipulated orthogonally. Interactive effects of the two sources of <b>respect</b> indicated that high outgroup <b>respect</b> could not compensate for low ingroup <b>respect,</b> and if anything had an adverse effect.

Although <b>respect</b> and liking did not predict team success, success was associated with subsequent levels of <b>respect,</b> but not liking.
