60|$|During the {{thirteen}} {{years of his}} reign Abdullah tried nearly every device by which Oriental rulers have sought to fortify their perilous sovereignty. He shrank from nothing. Self-preservation was the guiding principle of his policy, his first object and his only excuse. Among many wicked and ingenious expedients three main methods are remarkable. First, he removed or rendered innocuous all real or potential rivals. Secondly, he pursued what Sir Alfred Milner has called 'a well-considered policy of military concentration.' Thirdly, he maintained among the desert and <b>riverain</b> people {{a balance of power}} {{on the side of his}} own tribe. All these three methods merit some attention or illustration.|$|E
60|$|The {{astonishing}} news of {{the fall}} of Berber reached General Hunter on the 2nd of September. He immediately telegraphed to Merawi. Sir Herbert Kitchener was confronted with a momentous question: should Berber be occupied or not? It may at first seem that there could be little doubt about the matter. The objective of the expedition was Omdurman. The occupation of Berber by an Egyptian garrison would settle at once the difficulties near Suakin. The town was believed to be on the clear waterway to the Dervish capital. The moral effect of its capture upon the <b>riverain</b> tribes and throughout the Soudan would be enormous. Berber was, in fact, the most important strategic point on the whole line of advance. This great prize and advantage was now to be had for the asking.|$|E

60|$|The troops bivouacked {{some ten}} miles {{south-west}} of Fashi Shoya, and then marched in bright moonlight to Nefisa, encountering only a Dervish patrol of about ten men. At Nefisa was found the evacuated camp of Ahmed Fedil, containing {{a quantity of}} grain which he had collected from the <b>riverain</b> district, and, what was of more value, a sick but intelligent Dervish who stated that the Emir had just moved to Abu Aadel, five miles further on. This information was soon confirmed by Mahmud Hussein, an Egyptian officer, who with an irregular patrol advanced boldly in reconnaissance. The infantry needed a short rest to eat a little food, and Sir Reginald Wingate ordered Colonel Mahon to press on immediately with {{the whole of the}} mounted troops and engage the enemy, so as to prevent him retreating before an action could be forced.|$|E
60|$|By {{the end of}} January a {{powerful}} force lay encamped along the river from Abu Hamed to the Atbara. Meanwhile the Dervishes made no forward movement. Their army was collected at Kerreri; supplies were plentiful; all preparations had been made. Yet they tarried. The burning question of the command had arisen. A dispute that was never settled ensued. When the whole army was regularly assembled, the Khalifa announced publicly that he would lead the faithful in person; {{but at the same}} time he arranged privately that many Emirs and notables should beg him not to expose his sacred person. After proper solicitation, therefore, he yielded to their appeals. Then he looked round for a subordinate. The Khalifa Ali-Wad-Helu presented himself. In the Soudan every advantage and honour accrues to the possessor of an army, and the rival chief saw a chance of regaining his lost power. This consideration was not, however, lost upon Abdullah. He accepted the offer with apparent delight, but he professed himself unable to spare any rifles for the army which Ali-Wad-Helu aspired to lead. 'Alas!' he cried, 'there are none. But that will make no difference to so famous a warrior.' Ali-Wad-Helu, however, considered that it would make a great deal of difference, and declined the command. Osman Sheikh-ed-Din offered to lead the army, if he might arm the <b>riverain</b> tribes and use them as auxiliaries to swell his force. This roused the disapproval of Yakub. Such a policy, he declared, was fatal. The <b>riverain</b> tribes were traitors--dogs--worthy only of being destroyed; and he enlarged upon the more refined methods by which his policy might be carried out. The squabble continued, until at last the Khalifa, despairing of any agreement, decided merely to reinforce Mahmud, and accordingly ordered the Emir Yunes to march to Metemma with about 5,000 men. But it was then discovered that Mahmud hated Yunes, and would have none of him. At this the Khalifa broke up his camp, and the Dervish army marched back for a second time, in vexation and disgust, to the city.|$|E
60|$|At {{the present}} day, and {{notwithstanding}} the extensive intermixture effected by the movements consequent on civilization and on political changes, {{there is a}} predominance of dark men in the west, and of fair men {{in the east and}} north, of Britain. At the present day, as from the earliest times, the predominant constituents of the <b>riverain</b> population of the North Sea and the eastern half of the British Channel, are fair men. The fair stock continues in force through Central Europe, until it is lost in Central Asia. Offshoots of this stock extend into Spain, Italy, and Northern India, and by way of Syria and North Africa, to the Canary Islands. They were known in very early times to the Chinese, and in still earlier to the ancient Egyptians, as frontier tribes. The Thracians were notorious for their fair hair and blue eyes many centuries before our era.|$|E

60|$|The Khalifa saw {{very clearly}} {{that he could not}} trust the <b>riverain</b> tribes. The Jaalin and Barabra were discontented. He knew that they were weary of his rule and of war. In {{proportion}} as the Egyptian army advanced, so their loyalty and the taxes they paid decreased. He therefore abandoned all idea of making a stand at Berber. The Emir Yunes--who, since he had been transferred from Dongola in 1895, had ruled the district--was directed to collect all the camels, boats, grain, and other things that might assist an invading army and send them to Metemma. The duty was most thoroughly performed. The inhabitants were soon relieved of all their property and of most of their means of livelihood, and their naturally bitter resentment at this merciless treatment explains to some extent the astonishing events which followed the capture of Abu Hamed. This last place Abdullah never regarded as more than an outpost. Its garrison was not large, and although it had now become the most northerly Dervish position, only a slender reinforcement was added to the force under the command of Mohammed-ez-Zein.|$|E
60|$|A {{theological}} {{system of}} essentially similar character, exhibiting the same fundamental conceptions respecting {{the continued existence}} and incessant interference in human affairs of disembodied spirits, prevails, or formerly prevailed, among {{the whole of the}} inhabitants of the Polynesian and Melanesian islands, and among the people of Australia, notwithstanding the wide differences in physical character and in grade of civilisation which obtain among them. And the same proposition is true of the people who inhabit the <b>riverain</b> shores of the Pacific Ocean whether Dyaks, Malays, Indo-Chinese, Chinese, Japanese, the wild tribes of America, or the highly civilised old Mexicans and Peruvians. It is no less true of the Mongolic nomads of Northern Asia, of the Asiatic Aryans and of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, and it holds good among the Dravidians of the Dekhan and the negro tribes of Africa. No tribe of savages which has yet been discovered, has been conclusively proved to have so poor a theological equipment as to be devoid of a belief in ghosts, and in the utility of some form of witchcraft, in influencing those ghosts. And there is no nation, modern or ancient, which, even at this moment, has wholly given up the belief; and in which it has not, at one time or other, played a great part in practical life.|$|E
60|$|Other {{forces were}} soon {{added to the}} work of exhaustion. The year {{following}} the end of the Abyssinian war was marked by a fearful famine. Slatin and Ohrwalder vie with each other in relating its horrors--men eating the raw entrails of donkeys; mothers devouring their babies; scores dying in the streets, all the more ghastly in the bright sunlight; hundreds of corpses floating down the Nile--these are among the hideous features, The depopulation caused by the scarcity was even greater than that produced by the fighting. The famine area extended over the whole Soudan and ran {{along the banks of the}} river as far as Lower Egypt. The effects of the famine were everywhere appalling. Entire districts between Omdurman and Berber became wholly depopulated. In the salt regions near Shendi almost all the inhabitants died of hunger. The camel-breeding tribes ate their she-camels. The <b>riverain</b> peoples devoured their seed-corn. The population of Gallabat, Gedaref, and Kassala was reduced by nine-tenths, and these once considerable towns shrank to the size of hamlets. Everywhere the deserted mud houses crumbled back into the plain. The frightful mortality, general throughout the whole country, may be gauged by the fact that Zeki Tummal's army, which before the famine numbered not fewer than 87,000, could scarcely muster 10,000 men in the spring of 1890.|$|E

60|$|During the {{progress}} of the struggle with Abyssinia the war against Egypt languished. The Mahdi, counting upon the support of the population, had always declared that he would free the Delta from 'the Turks,' and was already planning its invasion when he and his schemes were interrupted by death. His successor inherited all the quarrel, but not all the power. Much of Mohammed Ahmed's influence died with him. Alive, he might conquer the Moslem world; dead, he was only a saint. All fanatical feeling in Egypt soon subsided. Nevertheless the Khalifa persisted in the enterprise. The success of the Abyssinian war encouraged and enabled him to resume the offensive on his northern frontier, and he immediately ordered Wad-el-Nejumi, who commanded in Dongola, to march with his scanty force to the invasion of Egypt. The mad enterprise ended, as might have been foreseen, in the destruction of both Emir and army at Toski. The Khalifa received the news with apparent grief, {{but it is difficult to}} avoid suspecting him of dark schemes. He was far too clever to believe that Egypt could be conquered by five thousand men. He knew that besides the Egyptians there was a strange white tribe of men, the same that had so nearly saved Khartoum. 'But for the English,' he exclaimed on several occasions, 'I would have conquered Egypt.' Yet, knowing of the British occupation, he deliberately sent an army to its inevitable ruin. It is difficult to reconcile such conduct with the character for sagacity and intelligence which Abdullah has deserved. There is no doubt that he wanted to conquer Egypt. Possibly by some extraordinary chance Wad-el-Nejumi might succeed, even with his small force. If so, then the glory of God and the power of the Khalifa would advance together. If not--and herein lies the true reason for the venture--the <b>riverain</b> tribes would have received a crippling blow.|$|E
60|$|It is now {{necessary}} {{to look to}} the enemy. Had the Khalifa allowed the Emir Mahmud to march north immediately after the destruction of the Dervish outpost in Abu Hamed, the course of the operations would have been very different. Mahmud would certainly have defended Berber with his whole army. The advance of the Expeditionary Force must have been delayed until the Desert Railway reached the river, and probably for another year. But, as the last chapter has described, the sudden seizure of Abu Hamed, the defection of the <b>riverain</b> tribes, and the appearance of the gunboats above the Fourth Cataract persuaded Abdullah that the climax of the war approached, and {{that he was about to}} be attacked in his capital. He accordingly devoted himself to his preparations for defence, and forbade his lieutenant to advance north of Metemma or attempt any offensive operations. In consequence Berber fell, and its fall convinced the Khalifa that his belief was well founded. He worked with redoubled energy. An elaborate system of forts armed with artillery was constructed outside the great wall of Omdurman along the river-bank. The concentration of Arab and black soldiery from Gedaref, Kordofan, and Darfur continued. Large quantities of grain, of camels and other supplies, were requisitioned from the people of the Ghezira (the country lying between the Blue and White Niles) and stored or stabled in the city. The discontent to which this arbitrary taxation gave rise was cured by a more arbitrary remedy. As many of the doubtful and embittered tribesmen as could be caught were collected in Omdurman, where they were compelled to drill regularly, and found it prudent to protest their loyalty. The strength and tenacity of the ruler were surprisingly displayed. The Khalifa Sherif, who had been suspected of sympathising with the Jaalin, was made a prisoner at large. The direst penalties attended the appearance of sedition. A close cordon around the city, and especially towards the north, prevented much information from reaching the Egyptian troops; and though small revolts broke out in Kordofan in consequence of the withdrawal of Mahmud's army, the Dervish Empire as a whole remained submissive, and the Khalifa was able to muster all its remaining force to meet the expected onslaught of his enemies.|$|E

O estudo respondeu os significados das pr?ticas de sustentabilidade socioambiental do GRANAV para o modo de vida das comunidades ribeirinhas em Parintins, assim como analisou o significado das pr?ticas de sustentabilidade socioambiental do GRANAV junto a duas comunidades ribeirinhas do munic?pio de Parintins (AM). De maneira espec?fica, conheceu os modos de vidas dessas comunidades ribeirinhas; identificou as pr?ticas organizativas do Grupo, e examinou as pr?ticas pol?ticas, sociais, culturais, educacionais, ambientais e econ?micas do Grupo junto ?s comunidades de Menino Deus e Nossa Senhora do Perpetuo Socorro. A necessidade da sobreviv?ncia e de um bem viver dos ribeirinhos dessas comunidades, localizada a 35 km da sede do munic?pio de Parintins (AM), levou-os a se organizarem e formarem coletivos para conservar e preservar os recursos naturais da ?gua, da terra e da floresta de suas comunidades.

As pr?ticas socioambientais trouxeram um amplo processo de sensibiliza??o que extrapolou os limites das comunidades envolvidas, fortaleceu as lutas por pol?ticas de sa?de, educa??o de qualidade, habita??o adequada ? realidade, saneamento, cultura, regulariza??o fundi?ria, agricultura familiar e assist?ncia t?cnica. Assim como, promoveu organiza??o de coletivos em defesa da natureza viva e experi?nciou viv?ncia comunit?ria e familiar dos povos amaz?nidas como processo promissor para constru??o de uma nova sustentabilidade amaz?nica. As pr?ticas organizativas fortaleceu a manuten??o do modo de vida e resist?ncia dos ribeirinhos ao modelo capitalista, fortaleceu as lutas organizadas pelo GRANAV nas comunidades, criou uma cultura de pertencimento, de valoriza??o dos saberes local e do modo de vida pr?prio dos (as) ribeirinhos (as), como metodologia poss?vel para a promo??o de um bem viver amaz?nida. The {{environmental movement}} of <b>riverain?s</b> {{peoples of the}} Amazons starred by his survival and a good living fights by the conservation and preservation of the natural resources, through organizational practices of social and environmental sustainability in the State. An example is the Environmental Group Alive Nature (GRANAV), founded in the Island of Paran? of Parintins, in the decade of 1990. This study answered the meanings of the practices of social and environmental sustainability of the GRANAV for {{the way of life}} of the <b>riverain?s</b> communities in Parintins, as well as it analysed the meaning of the practices of social and environmental sustainability of the GRANAV beside two <b>riverain?s</b> communities of the city of Parintins (AM). Of specific way, knew the ways of lives of these <b>riverains</b> communities; it identified the organizational practices of the Group, and examined the political practices, social, cultural, educational, environmental and economic of the Group beside the communities of Boy God and Our Lady of the Perpetuate Socorro. The need of the survival and of a well live of the <b>riverains</b> of these communities, located to 35 km of the headquarters of the city of Parintins (AM), carried them to organise and form communities to conserve and preserve the natural resources of the water, of the earth and of the forest of their communities. It has been analysed their social and environmental organizational practices like collective subjects of the Amazonia that bring contributions for a new sustainability. The study has been oriented by a qualitative research, with base in the conception of historical materialist dialectic, that drove the reflections, the analyses and the discussions, as well as it did use of the triangulation of the data selected: in the theoretical frame in the investigation of field due to direct observations, interviews, photographic register and analysis of official documents and of the inference of the researcher by the accumulation and experience acquired {{in the course of this}} investigation and of the academic life. This analytical analyses aimed that the organisation, the pertaining and the conscious fight of the (the) <b>riverain?s</b> (the) made possible the access the public politics and brought contributions for the way of life and for the environmental conditions, social, educational, cultural, territorial and economic. In this study, we present contributions so much to think a new sustainability for the current civilization from the family experience and collective of the villages amaz?nidas, what to provide experiences of social and environmental organizations rooted in the culture of the pertaining to the alive nature. The social and environmental practical brought a wide process of sensitization that extrapolated the limits of the communities wrapped, strengthened the fights by politics of health, education of quality, suitable room to the reality, basic sanitation, culture, land regularization, familiar agriculture and technical assistance. As well as, it promoted organization of communities in defense of the alive nature and experi?nciou vivencia community and familiar of the villages amaz?nidas like process promisor for construction of a new Amazon sustainability. The organizational practices strengthened the maintenance of the way of life and resistance of the <b>riverain?s</b> to the capitalist model, strengthened the fights organized by the GRANAV in the communities, created a culture of pertaining, of valorization of the local knowledges and of the way of life typical of the (the) <b>riverain?s</b> (the), like possible methodology for the promotion of a good living Amazonian...|$|R
