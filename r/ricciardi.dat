40|$|Neurons {{in active}} {{networks}} {{are subject to}} a fluctuating synaptic drive comprising excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arriving at high rates relative to the integration time of the cell. The standard approach for treating stochastic synaptic currents and conductances has been to approximate them by a Gaussian whitenoise or coloured-noise {{process in which the}} amplitudes of the underlying post-synaptic potentials are considered small. Importantly, this diffusion approximation has allowed for various firing-rate properties of populations of fluctuation-driven neurons to be calculated using Johanessma’s [1] and <b>Ricciardi’s</b> [2] Fokker-Planck framework. This framework in turn {{has proven to be a}} powerful theoretical tool for deriving the emergent states of coupled neuronal networks as a function of the properties of constituent neurons. The Gaussian/diffusion model of fluctuating synaptic conductance is in widespread use theoretically, computationally and experimentally and, in many cases, is an excellent approximation to the synaptic drive experienced by neurons in active networks in vitro or in vivo...|$|R

Saran, a licensed physician in India who was awaiting licensing in the United States, was discharged later from University Hospital in Newark. The unprovoked attack left Saran in a partial coma for over a week with severe damage to his skull and brain. In September 1992, Thomas Kozak, Martin <b>Ricciardi,</b> and Mark Evangelista were brought to trial on federal civil rights charges in connection with the attack on Saran. However, the three were acquitted of the charges in two separate trials in 1993. Saran testified at both trials that he could not remember the incident.|$|E

500|$|The first {{manager of}} the Blue Jays was Roy Hartsfield. While his tenure was marked by {{conflict}} between players and last place finishes, Hartsfield was supported by general manager Pat Gillick as they worked on the same long term management strategy: developing young players around which to build a team. Following the [...] season, the Blue Jays opted not to renew his contract but offered him a position within the organization, which he declined. Bobby Mattick served as manager on subsequent one-year contracts until Bobby Cox became available. As Mattick accepted an executive position in the Blue Jays organization, Cox signed a one-year contract, which was extended until to the [...] season as he led the team out of last place for the first time, and into the playoffs in 1985. Shortly after Cox unexpectedly left the Blue Jays organization for the general manager position with the Atlanta Braves, third base coach Jimy Williams took over as manager. Following late-season collapses in [...] and , and a poor start to the [...] season, Williams was fired and hitting coach Cito Gaston took over. Gaston managed the team for nine seasons, including two World Series wins, though batting coach Gene Tenace did substitute for him for several weeks in [...] when Gaston was hospitalized with back pains. In , with the team in last place, Gaston was fired by general manager Gord Ash with 5 games remaining; pitching coach Mel Queen finished the season as manager. Ash, seeking a more aggressive management style, hired Tim Johnson for his breadth of experience and communication skills. Following an admission to lying about aspects of his military experience, a tactic he used to motivate players, he was fired during spring training in [...] and Jim Fregosi was signed to a two-year contract. When Rogers Communications acquired the Blue Jays organization, among other management changes, Fregosi was replaced with Buck Martinez. In June , as the team was struggling, new general manager J.

Another story has it that Lardiere got into a heated argument with Ralph [...] "Blackie" [...] Napoli, a caporegime in the Philadelphia crime family and his death was ordered.
