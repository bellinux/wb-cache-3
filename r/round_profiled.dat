5000|$|The El Tigre rifles {{were again}} {{chambered}} for the Winchester [...]44-40 cartridge (known in Spain as the [...]44 Largo) {{and had a}} 22 inch <b>round</b> <b>profiled</b> barrel (like the previous 1873/1876 carbines) marked with the makers name, calibre, and the trademark image of a Tiger. The stock was of Spanish walnut with a 12" [...] Length of Pull and a crescent shaped metal butt plate with a trapdoor fitted for storage of a jointed cleaning rod in the butt. A drift-adjusted blade front site was fitted, usually attached to the front barrel band in accordance with old Spanish practice. A military tangent leaf rear sight was fitted which was similar to those on the Mauser 1893 rifle and sighted to 1000 metres.|$|E
50|$|The Vindelfjällen reserve {{includes}} most {{types of}} Swedish landscapes; mountains, high plains to alpine peaks, passing through plateaus or <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> mountain ranges.|$|R
50|$|Square beaded tuckpointing {{tools are}} {{available}} in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square <b>profiles.</b> <b>Round</b> beaded tuckpointing tools {{are available in}} 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm and 12 mm ground <b>round</b> <b>profiles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{multiple}} tinsel wires are jacketed with an {{insulating layer}} to form one conductor. A cord is formed from several conductors {{in either a}} <b>round</b> <b>profile</b> or a flat cable.|$|R
25|$|The common clownfish is a {{small fish}} which grows up to 11cm (4.3 inches). Its body has a stocky {{appearance}} and oval shape. It is compressed laterally, with a <b>round</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{corporate}} logotype, named [...] "Alpha PETRONAS", {{is designed}} in uppercase exclusively for Petronas and its subsidiaries. Each alphabet is rendered with a <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> to assume fluidity and viscosity, while emphasising the oil based operation.|$|R
50|$|The G-21 had a {{tail skid}} undercarriage; like the G-15, its legs were {{attached}} {{to the end of}} the wing centre section with wheels mostly enclosed in large <b>round</b> <b>profile</b> spats. The tail skid was also faired.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the X300 {{was similar to that}} found in the XJ40, with some revisions. The seats were updated to have a more <b>rounded</b> <b>profile,</b> wood trim was updated with bevelled edges, and the steering wheel was redesigned.|$|R
50|$|A {{pre-production}} 6-car set, classified 781-900 series, {{was delivered}} in November 1978. The body {{was based on}} the JNR 485 series design, with a more <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> to prevent snow adhering, and the electrical systems were based on the earlier 711 series suburban EMU.|$|R
50|$|The {{adults of}} R. intoccabilis {{had a very}} deep, scute-covered belly. In {{conjunction}} with the high, triangular dorsal fin, the belly gives the fish a rhombus-shaped body profile, hence the generic name. The juveniles, in contrast, had a far shallower belly, having a <b>rounded</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "The leaf is {{the surface}} {{on either side}} of the came that {{overlaps}} the edges of the glass and is left exposed once the panel has been assembled. It has either a flat or <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> and its width is the measurement given when a came size is listed.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} that initiate gallop {{are not always}} clear, though it {{is thought to be}} often caused by asymmetric conductor aerodynamics due to ice build up on one side of a wire. The crescent of encrusted ice approximates an aerofoil, altering the normally <b>round</b> <b>profile</b> of the wire and increasing the tendency to oscillate.|$|R
50|$|The beams from {{multiple}} diodes {{can also be}} combined by coupling each diode into an optical fibre, which is placed precisely over the diode (but behind the micro-lens). At {{the other end of}} the fiber bundle, the fibers are fused together to form a uniform, gap-less, <b>round</b> <b>profile</b> on the crystal. This also permits the use of a remote power supply.|$|R
5000|$|A shaving horse [...] (shave horse, or shaving bench) is a {{combination}} of vice and workbench, used for green woodworking. Typical usage of the shaving horse is to create a <b>round</b> <b>profile</b> along a square piece, such as for a chair leg or to prepare a workpiece for the pole lathe. They are used in crafts such as coopering and bowyery.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} Pyramids at San Juan Teotihuacán, Mexico, [s. d. ]. The pyramid can be seen {{at center}} and is a tall structure with a slightly <b>rounded</b> <b>profile.</b> The sides of the pyramid are worn and uneven, and plants can be seen growing in several places on its surface. The ground in the foreground is covered by bushes and plants...|$|R
40|$|In {{introduction}} thesis {{deals with}} the approximation of problems of cycling wheel rims production and describes problems which come to producers. Next part analyses technological options of joining <b>rounded</b> <b>profiles</b> of rims and consider {{advantages and disadvantages of}} single usable methods. The main part aims at proposal of automatical connecting facility for rims pin joining. The component of the thesis is also mechanical drawing of arrangement of suggested facility...|$|R
50|$|Modern hybrid {{boards are}} usually 6 feet to 8 feet 6 inches (1.8-2.3 m) in length {{with a more}} <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> and tail shape. Surfed in smaller waves with any fin set up. They are more about having fun than high {{performance}} or tricks. They can be easier to ride for beginning surfers and generally perform well in surfing conditions where the more traditional long and short boards might not.|$|R
50|$|The five spans vary {{in length}} from 38 ft to 42 ft. The oldest {{part of the}} bridge uses arches which are almost circular, but the more modern parts use flatter {{segmental}} arches. On the upstream side the piers have triangular ashlar cutwaters, and <b>rounded</b> <b>profiles</b> on the downstream side. At {{the north end of}} the bridge is an arched ramp to the east that leads to Tweed Green.|$|R
50|$|The Tortricidae are {{a family}} of moths, {{commonly}} known as tortrix moths or leafroller moths, in the order Lepidoptera. This large family has over 10,350 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea., although the genus Heliocosma is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. Olethreutidae is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back, producing a rather <b>rounded</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|R
50|$|Khunyang Chhish is the twenty-first-highest {{independent}} {{mountain in}} the world. It is also notable for its rise above local terrain: for example, it rises almost 4000 m above its southern base camp on the Khunyang Glacier, and it rises 5500 m above the Hunza valley in about 33 km. It is a steep, pointed, and complex peak; it easily rivals the slightly higher Distaghil Sar to the North, which has a more <b>rounded</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... ==Design details== When {{compared}} to the Mauser 98 action, the Remington introduced several features meant to decrease production time and cost as well as increase the accuracy potential. [...] The first was a redesign of the receiver from a billet-machined structure to a <b>round</b> <b>profile.</b> The <b>round</b> receiver can be produced on a lathe rather than requiring a mill. The recoil lug was a simple plate of steel sandwiched between the barrel and receiver.|$|R
40|$|The fully {{fashioned}} master’s thesis within {{the frame of}} the master’s study at the Fakulty of mechanical engineering deals with subject woodworking tools. There are characteristics of wood and tool materials used for woodworking. There is an emphasis on milling cutter in each case of construction of selected woodworking tools. Whereas there is concrete proposal of milling cutter used for production of half <b>round</b> <b>profile</b> – half <b>round</b> concave cutter – {{at the end of the}} thesis...|$|R
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 20 mm and 31 mm. It has a <b>rounded</b> whorl <b>profile</b> and a uniform spiral sculpture.|$|R
50|$|The 1st Issue of the Model 1 was {{the first}} major {{iteration}} (and the least common), with approximately 12,000 produced over a three year period. The features that easily distinguish the 1st issue are the flared, square cornered shaped grip (also seen in the 2nd Issue), the small round side plate, the <b>round</b> <b>profile</b> of the frame between the back of the cylinder and the grip, a split articulated hammer, and the flat spring barrel latch seen in some early variants.|$|R
50|$|Tropical Hardwood Hammock {{occurs on}} limestone, sand, and shell {{substrates}} which are moist, and {{usually do not}} flood. Hammocks on limestone substrates, however, are dependent on the underlying water table to keep humidity levels high, especially in limestone sinkholes. Mesic conditions are developed {{by a combination of}} the hammock's <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> and nearly impenetrable edges, which deflect wind and limit the effects of desiccation. The dense canopy minimizes temperature fluctuations by reducing soil warming during the day and heat loss during the night.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMolecules of {{mistletoe}} lectin I (ML I) {{were investigated}} electron microscopically by negative staining with uranyl salts. An equilibrium {{was found between}} monomers and dimers at the used protein concentration. ML I monomers show a nearly triangular or <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> with dimensions of 80 × 90 Å. ML I dimers are rod-like particles composed of two triangular parts which are dislocated against each other. In another view the dimers appear thinner without a pronounced substructure. The dimensions of the dimers are 175 × 80 × 60 Å...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was almost completely destroyed, and little {{remains of the}} visible structure of the floors, except for {{a flight of stairs}} in the north and east, and corbels supporting pavement. The battlements have a <b>rounded</b> <b>profile,</b> with vestiges of a third line of walls near the stairs that access the old hall, along Rua da Costa and Rua do Castelo and within the Museum of Vilar Maior. Remains of the third wall are also visible on the stairs leading to old town hall.|$|R
5000|$|In all steel-string instruments, {{the ends}} of the top braces taper {{at the edge of the}} soundboard. In most factory built guitars the brace tops are given a <b>round</b> <b>profile,</b> but are {{otherwise}} left unshaped. This produces a stronger top and may reduce the number of warranty claims arising from damage, however, over-build tops are less responsive. Braces are usually made from Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis). Some luthiers use Adirondack Spruce, also known as [...] "Red Spruce" [...] (Picea rubens), in high end instruments.|$|R
50|$|A. sandaracinos {{is one of}} {{the smaller}} anemonefish, which grows up to 11 cm as a female and 3 to 6.5 cm as a male. Its body has a stock appearance, oval shape, {{compressed}} laterally and with a <b>round</b> <b>profile.</b> Its coloration is bright orange, with a white stripe on the dorsal ridge from the superior lip, passing between the eyes and ending at the caudal fin base. All the fins have the same coloration as the body except the dorsal fin which is partially white. Its iris is bright yellow.|$|R
50|$|Roasting can {{be applied}} {{to a wide variety of}} meat. In general, it works best for cooking whole chickens, turkey, and leaner cuts of lamb, pork, and beef. The aim is to {{highlight}} the flavor of the meat itself rather than a sauce or stew, as it is done in braising or other moist-heat methods. Many roasts are tied with string prior to roasting, often using the reef knot or the packer's knot. Tying holds them together during roasting, keeping any stuffing inside, and keeps the roast in a <b>round</b> <b>profile,</b> which promotes even cooking.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, the Melody Maker {{name was}} reused {{for a new}} Les Paul variant. This {{single-cut}} variant uses the thinner body of the Les Paul Custom Lite, with a carved maple top, and a satin nitrocellulose finish. It also incorporates a maple neck with a 50's <b>rounded</b> <b>profile,</b> a full-size Les Paul headstock with a [...] "Melody Maker" [...] truss rod cover, and two P-90S pickups. These pickups, based on the original pickups of the Gibson ES-125, use Fender-style Alnico slug magnets {{as opposed to the}} usual bar magnets.|$|R
50|$|Its body is {{compressed}} laterally with a <b>rounded</b> body <b>profile,</b> and its snout protrudes forwards {{slightly with}} a small protrusible (extendable) mouth. Its very characteristic livery leaves {{no doubt about the}} identification.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of investigations on the air gages dynamic characteristics in the measurement of the <b>round</b> <b>profiles</b> of motor cylinders. The principle of the measuring device is explained, and the analysis of the air gages dynamics is described. The results of dynamic calibration enabled to eliminate those configurations of air gages that may not meet the requirements of the measurement they were designed for. After the proper air gages were chosen, the entire system underwent the accuracy test and passed it successfully revealing the method accuracy better than 10 % compared to the reference measurement...|$|R
50|$|The base of {{the hill}} is {{circular}} and 167 m in diameter. The summit is flat-topped and 30 m in diameter. A smaller mound was constructed first, and in a later phase much enlarged. The initial structures at the {{base of the}} hill were perfectly circular: surveying reveals that the centre of the flat top and the centre of the cone that describes the hill lie within a metre of one another. There are indications that the top originally had a <b>rounded</b> <b>profile,</b> but this was flattened in the medieval period to provide a base for a building, perhaps with a defensive purpose.|$|R
50|$|Polygonal rifling {{prevents}} the forensic firearms examiner from microscopically measuring {{the width of}} land and groove impressions because the lands and grooves have a <b>rounded</b> <b>profile</b> instead of a well-defined rectangular profile. In the FBI GRC file, the land and groove widths for these firearms are listed as 0.000. However, {{it must be noted}} that forensic identification of firearms court-cases, etc. is based on microscopic examination of tooling marks on the surface of the bore, produced by the manufacturing process and modified by the drag of bullet jackets on that same surface. Thus the bore surface of individual firearms is always unique.|$|R
50|$|The tail {{surfaces}} consisted of one swept vertical surface {{and a pair}} of swept horizontal surfaces, which had zero camber. The adjustable horizontal stabilizer was attached to the sides of fuselage, at about the same height as the wing. The rudder top was made of a dielectric material, and served as a cover for the radio antenna. The airplane had a wide lower elongated fin with a <b>rounded</b> <b>profile,</b> and contained one pair of air brakes. Additional air brakes were on the lower middle part of the fuselage, at the roots of the wing leading edge.|$|R
