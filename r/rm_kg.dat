40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{established}} 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) prediction equations, however, very few prediction equations use anthropometric characteristics exclusively or in part, to estimate 1 RM strength. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to develop an original 1 RM prediction equation for bench press using anthropometric and performance characteristics in moderately trained male subjects. Sixty male subjects (21. 2 +/- 2. 4 years) completed a 1 RM bench press and were randomly assigned a load to complete as many repetitions as possible. In addition, body composition, upper-body anthropometric characteristics, and handgrip strength were assessed. Regression analysis was used to develop a performance-based 1 RM prediction equation: 1 RM = 1. 20 repetition weight + 2. 19 repetitions to fatigue - 0. 56 biacromial width (cm) + 9. 6 (R 2 = 0. 99, standard error of estimate [SEE] = 3. 5 kg). Regression analysis to develop a nonperformance-based 1 RM prediction equation yielded: 1 <b>RM</b> (<b>kg)</b> = 0. 997 cross-sectional area (CSA) (cm 2) + 0. 401 chest circumference (cm) - 0. 385 %fat - 0. 185 arm length (cm) + 36. 7 (R 2 = 0. 81, SEE = 13. 0 kg). The performance prediction equations developed in this study had high validity coefficients, minimal mean bias, and small limits of agreement. The anthropometric equations had moderately high validity coefficient but larger limits of agreement. The practical applications of this study indicate that the inclusion of anthropometric characteristics and performance variables produce a valid prediction equation for 1 RM strength. In addition, the CSA of the arm uses a simple nonperformance method of estimating the lifter's 1 RM. This information may be used to predict the starting load for a lifter performing a 1 RM prediction protocol or a 1 RM testing protocol.

40|$|Within recent years, {{strength}} training involving the modalities of heavy elastic bands and weighted chains has received widespread recognition and increased popularity. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the effects of a seven week heavy elastic band and weighted chain program on maximum muscular strength and maximum power in the bench press exercise. METHODS: Thirty six (n= 36) healthy males 18 - 30 years old from the Robert Morris University football team volunteered to participate in this study. During the first week, predicted one repetition maximum (1 RM) bench press and a five repetition (5 RM) maximum speed bench press tests were conducted. Subjects were randomly divided into three groups (n= 12) : elastic band (EB), weighted chain (WC) and control (C). Subjects were oriented to the elastic band (EB) and chain weighted (WC) bench press prior to pre testing. During weeks 2 through 8 of the study, subjects were required to follow the resistance training program designed for using the EB and WC for seven weeks. All other components of normal spring training and conditioning remained the same. Means and standard deviations of the predicted 1 RM bench press and 5 RM speed bench press were computed in the first and ninth week of the program. A two factor (method X time) analysis was applied to identify significant differences between the training groups. Statistical significance was set at α = 0. 05. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant time (*p < 0. 05), but no group effect for both predicted 1 <b>RM</b> (<b>kg)</b> and 5 RM peak power tests (watts). Although not significant, results did show greater improvements in the EB and WC groups compared to control when the two highest and greatest values were selected regarding peak power. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of EB and WC in conjunction with a general seven week off season strength and conditioning program can increase overall maximum upper body strength in a sample of Div 1 -AA football players. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The implementation of heavy elastic bands and weighted chains into a strength and conditioning regimen may result in potential gains in muscular strength and power. These types of training modalities add a unique training style and more flexibility in respect to exercise prescription for athletes and strength practitioners...|$|E

The value of 1 RM was 82. 33 ± 11. 09 kg and 59. 67 ± 5. 16 kg, in the trained and untrained groups, respectively. The indicator of the level of strength (<b>kg</b> 1 <b>RM</b> / <b>kg</b> BW) in the trained group was greater than 1, and lower in the untrained group. The average strength showed significant differences (p BW), while when this ratio is less than 1 (1 RM<BW), subjects can be categorized as “untrained” in BP.

SettingUniversity of Minnesota Recreational Centre. ParticipantsWomen 4 to 36 months after treatment {{for breast cancer}} that included axillary node dissection beyond sentinel node biopsy. Exclusion criteria included hypertension, morbid obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m 2), participation in a weight loss plan, and co-morbidities that prevented exercise training. Forty-six participants were randomised to an exercise training group (n = 23) or a control group receiving no intervention (n = 23). InterventionsExercise training consisted of upper and lower limb, chest, and back exercises for one hour, twice per week, with resistance applied via machines or free weights. Upper body resistance was increased by the smallest available increment at each session if no symptoms of lymphoedema had developed. Lower body exercise commenced at one set of ten repetitions with the maximum tolerated weight, progressing to three sets by the third week. Stretching exercises were also performed. Exercise was performed in small groups with supervision for three months, followed by unsupervised exercise in pairs for a further three months. Encouragement to continue exercise sessions was provided by telephone whenever a participant failed to attend for one week. Participants in both groups were encouraged to continue any lymphoedema management being performed at baseline, and discouraged from changing dietary or other exercise habits. OutcomesIncidence of lymphoedema on the ipsilateral side as the cancer was identified in three ways: a greater arm circumference compared to the contralateral arm by at least two centimetres; symptoms (upper-limb swelling, pain or fine motor dysfunction); and self-report of lymphoedema. Severity of lymphoedema was assessed using difference in arm circumference and symptom severity. Strength was measured as the maximum weight that could be lifted once (1 RM) by the upper limb (bench press) and lower limb (leg press). ResultsOne control group participant withdrew. None of the lymphoedema measures was significantly greater in the exercise group compared to the control group.

Thirty-nine players from the highest Swedish division classified as defenders (n= 18), midfield players (n= 12) or attackers (n= 9) participated. Their mean (± sd) age, height and body mass (bm) were 24. 4 (± 4. 7) years, 1. 80 (± 5. 9) m and 79 (± 7. 6) kg, respectively. Running economy (RE) and anaerobic threshold (AT) was determined at 10, 12, 14, and 16 km/h followed by tests of maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). Maximal strength (1 RM) and average power output (AP) was performed in squat lifting. Squat jump (SJ), counter-movement jump with free arm swing (CMJa), 45 m maximal sprint and the Wingate test was performed. Average VO 2 max for the whole population (WP) was 57. 0 mL O 2 •kg- 1 min- 1. The average AT occurred at about 84 % of VO 2 max. 1 <b>RM</b> per <b>kg</b> bm 0. 67 was 11. 9 ± 1. 3 kg.

Thus, {{the purpose of this}} review was 2 -fold: to identify strength tests that were reliable and valid correlates (predictors) of rowing performance; and, to establish the benefits gained when strength training was integrated into the physical preparation plans of rowers. The reliability of maximal strength and power tests involving leg extension (e. g. leg pressing) and arm pulling (e. g. prone bench pull) was high (intra-class correlations 0. 82 – 0. 99), revealing that elite rowers were significantly stronger than their less competitive peers. The greater strength of elite rowers was in part attributed to the correlation between strength and greater lean body mass (r = 0. 57 – 0. 63).

On 5 occasions, separated by a minimum of 48 hours, 10 healthy male subjects (mean ?

Each trial had either a 5 -, 10 -, 20 -, or 30 -minute recovery after a heavy resistance activity (5 deadlift repetitions at 85 % 1 RM) or a control trial with no PHRE in random order. Sprint cycling performance was assessed by peak power (PP), fatigue index, and mean power output over the first 5 seconds (MPO 5), 10 seconds (MPO 10), and 30 seconds (MPO 30). One-way analysis of variance with repeated measures followed by paired t-tests with a Bonferroni adjustment was used to analyze data. Peak power, MPO 5, and MPO 10 were all significantly different during the 10 -minute recovery trial to that of the control condition with values of 109, 112, and 109 % of control, respectively; no difference was found for the MPO 30 between trials.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish strength, power, and muscular endurance exercises for weight room training, which are strong determinants of success in specific performance measures used to assess elite rowers. Nineteen heavyweight elite males determined their repetition maximum (RM) loads for exercises using a Concept 2 DYNO [5, 30, 60 and 120 RM leg pressing and seated arm pulling (in Joules) ] and free weights [1 RM power clean (in kilograms) and 6 RM bench pull (in kilograms and watts) ]. Rowing performance measures included a 7 -stage blood lactate response ergometer test (aerobic condition), time trials (500, 2000, and 5000 m), a peak stroke power test, and a 60 -minute distance trial. Pearson correlation moments (r + 0. 7) and stepwise multiple linear regression calculations (R 2 + 50 %) were used to establish strong common variances between weight room exercises and rowing ergometer performance (p # 0. 05). Weight room exercises were strong predictors of 2000 -m, 500 -m time (in seconds), and peak stroke power performance measures only.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{schizophrenia}} {{frequently have}} disabling gait deficits. The net mechanical efficiency of walking (Enet) {{is an accurate}} measure often used to evaluate walking performance. Patients with gait deficits have a reduced Enet with excessive energy expenditure during sub-maximal walking. Maximal strength training (MST) improves Enet in healthy individuals and is associated with reduced risk of mortality. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether MST improves Enet in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Patients (ICD- 10 schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorders (F 20 -F 29)) were included in a non-randomized trial. Patients were assigned to one of two groups: 1) MST consisting of 4 x 4 repetitions at 85 - 90 % one repetition maximum (1 RM) performed in a leg press apparatus or 2) playing computer games (CG). Both groups carried out their activity three days per week for eight weeks. 1 RM, Enet at 60 watt walking, peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the 36 -items short form (SF- 36) were measured pre and post intervention. Results: The baseline Enet was 17. 3 ± 1. 2 % and 19. 4 ± 3. 0 % in the MST (n = 6) and CG groups (n = 7), respectively, which is categorized as mechanical inefficiency. The MST group improved 1 <b>RM</b> by 79 <b>kg</b> (p = 0. 006) and Enet by 3. 4 % (p = 0. 046) more than the CG group.
