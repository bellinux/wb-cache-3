5|$|During World War I, Curie {{recognised}} that {{wounded soldiers}} were best served if operated upon {{as soon as}} possible. She saw a need for field <b>radiological</b> centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became {{the director of the}} Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile <b>radiological</b> vehicles and another 200 <b>radiological</b> units at field hospitals {{in the first year of}} the war. Later, she began training other women as aides.|$|E
5|$|Although {{few people}} {{come in contact with}} mendelevium, the International Commission on <b>Radiological</b> Protection has set annual {{exposure}} limits for the most stable isotope. For mendelevium-258, the ingestion limit was set at 9×105 becquerels (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 6000 Bq.|$|E
5|$|Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a {{sanatorium}} in Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia {{from exposure}} to radiation {{in the course of}} her scientific research {{and in the course of}} her <b>radiological</b> work at field hospitals during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Although {{few people}} {{come in contact with}} fermium, the International Commission on <b>Radiological</b> Protection has set annual {{exposure}} limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 107 becquerels (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 105 Bq; for fermium-257, at 105 Bq and 4000 Bq respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlüter {{commissioned}} a <b>radiological</b> {{examination of the}} surviving workers. The Danish Institute for Clinical Epidemiology concluded 11 months later that cancer incidents were 40percent higher in Project Crested Ice workers than in workers who had visited the base {{before and after the}} operation. The Institute of Cancer Epidemiology found a 50percent higher cancer rate in the workers than in the general population, but could not conclude that radiation exposure was to blame.|$|E
5|$|With the Japanese {{surrender}} on 2 September, the Puget Sound repairs {{were limited}} to those necessary to ensure Pennsylvanias delivery to Bikini Atoll for atomic experiments in July 1946. The old battleship survived the tests, but was decommissioned on 29 August and used for <b>radiological</b> studies before being sunk as a target ship on 10 February 1948. Pennsylvania was struck from the Navy Vessel Register nine days later.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing <b>radiological</b> weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), {{created a}} special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing <b>radiological</b> weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and <b>radiological</b> features.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2008, Cheney {{underwent}} a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old {{man with a}} history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and <b>radiological</b> imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{the event}} {{as a serious}} <b>radiological</b> accident, the OAEP {{organized}} an emergency response team to manage the situation, {{in conjunction with the}} local public health and civil defense authorities. They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, which kept them from getting close enough to determine what the source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{earned a}} Master of Arts at the Free University in 1932. He then entered the University of Warsaw, {{and became a}} Doctor of Physics in 1938. He held the {{position}} of Research Fellow in the <b>Radiological</b> Laboratory of the Scientific Society of Warsaw, of which Wertenstein was the director, and became assistant Director of the Atomic Physics Institute of the Free University of Poland in 1938. During this period, Rotblat married a literature student, Tola Gryn, whom he had met at a student summer camp in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The <b>radiological</b> toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 an IAEA {{advisory}} group, {{formed in}} response to a request by the Government of the Marshall Islands for an independent international review of the <b>radiological</b> conditions at Bikini Atoll, recommended that Bikini Island should not be permanently resettled under the present <b>radiological</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|Nepal {{is still}} {{struggling}} to improve and manage conventional <b>radiological</b> examinations. <b>Radiological</b> Services in Nepal commenced in 1923 at Military Hospital by Dr. Rana and Dr Asta Bahadur Shrestha. The first health related training program began in 1933 at the Nepal Rajkiya Ayurved School; the Civil Medical School was later established in 1934. <b>Radiological</b> education in Nepal started in 1923 in a 64 bedded Military Hospital, Tri-ChandraElectro-Medical Institute. The post graduate (M.Sc.) program in physics at TU began in 1965 with only Nuclear Physics specialization. In 1972, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) which is affiliated with TU started the Proficiency Certificate Level (PCL) Radiography course however this has since stopped.|$|E
