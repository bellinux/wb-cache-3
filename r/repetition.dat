We start with a {{classification}} of <b>repetitions.</b> The general models for finding exact <b>repetitions</b> in one string and in a finite set of strings are introduced. It is shown that d-subsets created during determinization of nondeterministic factor automata contain all information concerning <b>repetitions</b> of factors. The principle of the analysis of d-subsets is then used for finding approximate <b>repetitions</b> using several distances for a general finite alphabet and for an ordered alphabet including the case of presence of don’t care symbols.

5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are <b>repetition</b> patterns. There {{are two types}} of <b>repetition</b> in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and {{grammatical}} reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated <b>repetition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Josquin's {{earliest}} chansons {{were probably}} composed in northern Europe, {{under the influence}} of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, however, he never adhered strictly to the conventions of the formes fixes– the rigid and complex <b>repetition</b> patterns of the rondeau, virelai, and ballade– instead he often wrote his early chansons in strict imitation, a feature they shared with many of his sacred works. He {{was one of the first}} composers of chansons to make all voices equal parts of the texture; and many of his chansons contain points of imitation, in the manner of motets. However he did use melodic <b>repetition,</b> especially where the lines of text rhymed, and many of his chansons had a lighter texture, as well as a faster tempo, than his motets.|$|E

Echolalia (<b>repetition</b> of another person's words) and palilalia (<b>repetition</b> of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease.

For this reason, the even-numbered <b>repetitions</b> had a different duration and goal and were consequently excluded from further analysis.

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a <b>repetition</b> of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious.

Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} of sequential effects of foreperiod duration in reaction time tasks suggests {{a description of}} the subjects' strategy in terms of a tendency to expect foreperiod <b>repetitions.</b> The present experiment examined what factors influence this basic tendency. Two foreperiod distributions differing in the frequency of <b>repetitions</b> (33 and 66 %) but with the same frequency of individual foreperiods were used. In both cases faster reaction times coincided with foreperiod <b>repetitions.</b> Important differences appeared nevertheless between the two foreperiod distributions; reaction times for <b>repetitions</b> were faster when <b>repetitions</b> were frequent than when they were not, and <b>repetitions</b> of the same fore-period more than once led to further reaction-time decreases only when foreperiod <b>repetitions</b> were frequent. The tendency to expect <b>repetitions</b> varied from trial to trial in a way which depended on long-term factors such as the frequency with which the expected foreperiod duration coincided with the foreperiod actually presented.
