5000|$|... 'Puncheon', a <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> strut (approx. 4 inches diameter) {{to support}} {{overburden}} {{in areas where}} coal was extracted.|$|E
50|$|A slab {{has been}} laid {{throughout}} the under-croft {{of the house}} which is used for storage. <b>Round</b> <b>timber</b> stumps support the house.|$|E
50|$|Several of the <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> posts {{supporting}} the verandah roof {{have been replaced}} due to termite damage. The original posts {{appear to have been}} replicated in style if not in size or, possibly, timber species.|$|E
30|$|The {{bending test}} results showed no {{significance}} at the 5  % significance level on average regarding the Young’s modulus {{obtained by the}} longitudinal vibration method, and the apparent Young’s modulus for green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> Meanwhile, the average bending strength showed significant differences at the 5  % significance level between green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> When considering that the average for green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> would actually increase because the green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> included those that did not show failure, {{it was difficult to}} simply conclude that there were differences between green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> The 5  % PTL of bending strength was slightly higher for air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> than green <b>round</b> <b>timbers,</b> although we should also consider the fact that the bending strength of green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> would actually increase.|$|R
30|$|The {{air-dried}} <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> were air-dried outdoors for 8 – 9  months. After being air-dried, the air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> {{were subjected}} to the test using the same method as for the green <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Sugi <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> {{injected}} with preservative {{are useful for}} outdoor playing and construction materials. To dry the Sugi <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> for preservative injection, three drying methods including microwave drying, kiln drying and air drying were compared in this study. Using microwave drying, the timbers were dried within one day, but the other two drying methods required a much longer time. During most of the microwave drying process, the wood temperature appeared to be higher in the inner layer than in the outer layer. As a result, the inner layer moisture contents were significantly reduced by microwave drying, while kiln drying produced almost no decline in the inner layer moisture contents. In addition, although significant surface checks often occurred in timbers dried by kiln drying and air drying, microwave drying caused few surface checks. In contrast, internal checks were only observed in timbers treated by microwave drying. These results suggested that the microwave drying technique can improve the effectiveness of preservative injection in Sugi <b>round</b> <b>timbers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The open, {{rectangular}} {{wagon shed}} {{stands in the}} northeast corner of the yard. The low-pitched skillion roof, supported on <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> posts with round log roof framing, shelters a bullock wagon and other equipment and objects.|$|E
50|$|Walls to {{both the}} upper and lower levels to the {{restaurant}} building are infilled with full-height glazing and blockwork. The verandah to the restaurant building has a timber-framed floor supported by <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> posts and timber lattice balustrades.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{component}} of the place is an early two room house of weatherboard timber and iron construction set on <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> stumps. Furnishings, furniture and bric-a-brac of the former owner, remain. The house is termite infested and in poor condition.|$|E

5000|$|Kodal Church (Kodal kirke) {{is located}} in Prestbøen. Its chancel dates from the 12th century. The nave from 1691 is made of <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> The altarpiece dates from 1781 and the {{painting}} Jesus and the disciples on the walk to Emmaus by Otto Valstad {{in the style of}} Dorph from 1899.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{entrance}} portals that flank entrance-ways {{on the north side}} of the park. They are both composed of two random rubble limestone pillars that differ somewhat in shape. The portals at the main entrance (Area 5a) on the northwest side of the park includes two rectangular pillars, one 10 ft high and the other 16 ft high. [...] The second pillar has two lower, flanking wings. At one time the second pillar carried a wood sign that was suspended from a <b>rounded</b> <b>timber</b> bracing. The sign is now located in front of the pillar. The northeast entrance (Area 5b) likewise has two pillars of differing heights. These pillars are 11 ft and 18 ft high. The second pillar has side wings, and it retains its suspended sign. Both entrances have two <b>rounded</b> <b>timber</b> gates that close the entrance.|$|R
50|$|The {{roundhouse}} {{is located}} at the corner of Bolsover and South streets and is a large circular shed with an internal courtyard containing a turntable. <b>Round</b> <b>timber</b> posts support a timber-framed roof. The roundhouse is clad with corrugated galvanised iron sheets.|$|E
50|$|Evidence of {{occupation}} includes {{the remains of}} a farm dating from just before the Roman invasion. It comprised two <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> buildings inside a fenced enclosure, and two cremation pits. After the conquest its survival and prosperity may have been linked to there being a Roman presence at Irchester.|$|E
5000|$|The timber framed {{church is}} clad with {{horizontal}} timber boards and is slightly elevated on <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> stumps, though these and the cavity beneath the building are concealed with a timber boarded [...] "skirt", which {{extends to the}} ground from the floor level allowing only the stump caps to be seen.|$|E
30|$|As {{well as the}} {{structural}} performance, the production efficiency should be carefully considered to develop the wooden guardrail system. Wolfe and Moseley [3] and Wolfe and Murphy [8] suggested that <b>round</b> cross-section <b>timber</b> produces less waste than rectangular cross-section timber and increases production yield. On the basis of section properties, the round shape has a two- to larger bending load capacity than rectangular shape that could be sawn from log [8]. Additionally, <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> are not susceptible to the strength-reducing effects of grain angle and knots due to the section geometry and the tree physiology [9 – 13].|$|R
5000|$|Broad axe: Used {{with the}} grain of the wood in {{precision}} splitting or [...] "hewing" [...] (i.e. the squaring-off of <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> usually for use in construction). Broad axe bits are most commonly chisel-shaped (i.e. one flat and one beveled edge) facilitating more controlled work as the flat cheek passes across the squared timber.|$|R
40|$|Spotted gum is an {{important}} commercial tree in Queensland that produces a high quality, hard, durable and attractive timber.

50|$|In {{order to}} carry out the wishes of the Government to {{construct}} railway in agricultural areas as cheaply as possible, lines were built with 45 lb rail sections which practically followed the surface of the ground, with (a) earth ballasting (b) half <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> sleepers (c) providing the bare minimum station facilities.|$|E
50|$|Both {{buildings}} have similar square parapets with cantilevered timber and iron awnings supported by deep, curved timber brackets. These awnings are propped with <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> posts. Both {{buildings have}} display windows with recessed central entrances. The {{east and west}} elevations have window hoods with timber battens and corrugated iron, and the buildings contain both casement and sash windows.|$|E
50|$|The Old Store is clad in vertically-running {{corrugated}} iron on a timber frame {{and has a}} simple gabled roof flanked by skillions. The roof {{is supported by a}} simple structure of timber rafters, purlins and collar ties resting on <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> posts with brackets. The posts are founded on bedlogs, and the floor joists rest on the ground; this contact with the earth has created a white ant problem. The store contains extensive hand-hewn shelving for the storage of flour etc. Externally, an awning runs the width of the street elevation to the south. It is supported by five substantial <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> posts. It covers a section of footpath which is paved in local unworked limestone slabs set in a bedding of antbed, now concrete pointed, and is retained with a low concrete retaining wall. The building has a double door entrance at front and rear.|$|E

An awning running {{the width of the}} gable end is supported on steel posts.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} types of flatrod: flatrods with rollers and flatrods with {{oscillating}} cranks (Schwingen). The former were laid on rollers. The rollers consisted of <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> about eight to ten inches thick, that were firmly set into the ground on their underside and fixed in place with braces. In order to minimise friction, the rod was fitted with a drag rail (Schleppschiene) {{in the area of}} the individual rollers that was made of beechwood and long enough to for the entire stroke length.|$|R
500|$|The bridge has {{undergone}} multiple alterations, but the original piers remain. They were constructed as [...] "four rounded braced wandoo piles supported from horizontal 450mm timber sills, adzed to 400mm, fixed to concrete footings", with the footings designed {{to bear on}} foundation rocks [...] beneath the surface. The bridge's original spans were made up of seven <b>rounded</b> <b>timber</b> wandoo stringers, of at least [...] diameter, bearing on jarrah corbels, supported by jarrah half caps [...] in size. The [...] span over the railway alignment was originally supported on four [...] steel beams, weighing [...] each.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the church}} retains its timber boarded floor and ceiling. The ceiling is raked, {{flattening}} out halfway, and has <b>round</b> carved <b>timber</b> ventilation panels. The scissor tie-rods {{to the roof}} structure are exposed.|$|R

50|$|The Eureka Hotel is {{a colonial}} period {{structure}} built of ironbark with a gabled roof of modern corrugated iron over the central core of three rooms. The encircling verandahs are enclosed with asbestos cement sheeting {{and covered with}} a skillion roof. The horizontal slab structure, which is raised on low, round ironbark stumps and massive half <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> bearers fixed with wooden pegs, is a rare example of bush carpentry.|$|E
50|$|In cultivation, E. robusta {{grows to}} altitudes of 1600 m, {{withstanding}} average minimum temperatures of 3 C and maxima of 35 C. The heartwood is extremely durable and resists marine borers. It {{is used as}} a <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> for construction of wharves and fencing. The wood is light reddish brown in colour and coarse-textured. The weight can vary widely between individuals and stands, averaging 38 pounds per cubic foot.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Eucalypts have {{a number}} of {{characteristics}} affecting processing and utilization that distinguish them from other woods. The major current interest in the eucalypts is as a fuel. Possible demand as a chemical feedstock, for pulpwood, panel products, lumber or <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> should be be considered in initial planning and management as a hedge against changes resulting from economic, political or environmental pressures. In general, returns to the grower will be maximized by concentration on maximum yield (cubic volume x specific gravity) for energy, chemical feedstock and pulpwood uses. Specific gravity, as an indicator of strength, is also important for sawn products, round products and some panel product...|$|R
5000|$|The bridge has {{undergone}} multiple alterations, but the original piers remain. They were constructed as [...] "four rounded braced wandoo piles supported from horizontal 450mm timber sills, adzed to 400mm, fixed to concrete footings", with the footings designed {{to bear on}} foundation rocks 1+1/2 m beneath the surface. The bridge's original spans were made up of seven <b>rounded</b> <b>timber</b> wandoo stringers, of at least 400 mm diameter, bearing on jarrah corbels, supported by jarrah half caps 600 by 150 mm in size. The 14 m span over the railway alignment was originally supported on four 610 by 190 mm steel beams, weighing 41 kg each.|$|R
5000|$|They {{wrote that}} the houses at La Junta resembled “those of the Mexicans…The natives built them square. They put up forked posts and in those they place <b>rounded</b> <b>timbers</b> the {{thickness}} of a man’s thigh. Then they add stakes and plaster them with mud. Close to the houses they have granaries built of willow ... where they keep their provisions and harvest of mesquite and other things.” This type of house is called a jacal. The floors of the houses were usually dug about 18 inches below ground level, which helped protect against temperature extremes. Built on terraces above the river, their towns were estimated to have populations of about 600.|$|R
