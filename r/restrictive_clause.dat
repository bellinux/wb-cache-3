60|$|It {{may seem}} marvellous that, {{with the world}} before her--kept by no <b>restrictive</b> <b>clause</b> of her {{condemnation}} {{within the limits of}} the Puritan settlement, so remote and so obscure--free to return to her birth-place, or to any other European land, and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior, as completely as if emerging into another state of being--and having also the passes of the dark, inscrutable forest open to her, where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned her--it may seem marvellous that this woman should still call that place her home, where, and where only, she must needs be the type of shame. But there is a fatality, a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom, which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt, ghost-like, the spot where some great and marked event has given the colour to their lifetime; and, still the more irresistibly, the darker the tinge that saddens it. Her sin, her ignominy, were the roots which she had struck into the soil. It was as if a new birth, with stronger assimilations than the first, had converted the forest-land, still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer, into Hester Prynne's wild and dreary, but life-long home. All other scenes of earth--even that village of rural England, where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother's keeping, like garments put off long ago--were foreign to her, in comparison. The chain that bound her here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost soul, but could never be broken.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, a non-restrictive {{relative}} clause (also called non-defining or supplementary) {{is one that}} contains information that is supplementary, i.e. {{does not change the}} meaning {{of the rest of the}} sentence, while a restrictive {{relative clause}} (also called defining or integrated) is, one which contains information essential to the meaning of the sentence, effectively limiting the modified noun phrase to a subset that is defined by the relative clause.An example of a <b>restrictive</b> <b>clause</b> is [...] "The dog that bit the man was brown."An example of a non-restrictive clause is [...] "The dog, which bit the man, was brown."In the former [...] "that bit the man" [...] identifies which dog the statement is about.In the latter, [...] "which bit the man" [...] provides supplementary information about a known dog.A non-restrictive relative clause is typically set off by commas, whereas a restrictive relative clause is not, but this is not a rule that is universally observed. In speech, this is also reflected in the intonation.Writers commonly use which to introduce a non-restrictive clause, and that to introduce a <b>restrictive</b> <b>clause.</b> That is rarely used to introduce a non-restrictive relative clause in prose. Which and that are both commonly used to introduce a restrictive clause; a study in 1977 reported that about 75 percent of occurrences of which were in restrictive clauses.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} error {{analysis}} on the errors made by grade 9 students of SMP Cita Hati, Surabaya, in constructing sentences by using <b>restrictive</b> adjective <b>clauses.</b> This study {{would like to know}} the types of errors the students made in constructing sentences by using <b>restrictive</b> adjective <b>clause</b> and the sources of the errors. This study was based on Larry Selinker’s theory about interlanguage. Interlanguage is a language which is produced by L 2 learners while learning L 2. Interlanguage can’t be considered as L 2 because its structures are different from L 2 grammatical structures. The subjects of this study are the grade 9 students of SMP Cita Hati, Surabaya. In order to collect the students’ errors in constructing sentences by using <b>restrictive</b> adjective <b>clauses,</b> the writer used a test that ask the students to construct sentences by using <b>restrictive</b> adjective <b>clauses</b> as the instrument of this study. The test, then, was administered to the students. From the data collected, the writer examined the data then classified the errors found into 6 types of errors. They were errors of relative pronouns (11. 78 % of total answers), errors of subjects (0. 7 % of total answers), errors of objects (3. 57 % of total answers), errors of word order (3. 1 % of total answers), errors of prepositions (1. 55 % of total answers) and miscellaneous errors of adjective clauses (12. 13 % of total answers). The total errors were 276 errors of 840 answers or 32. 83 % of total answers. After conducting error classification, the writer predicted some possible sources of errors proposed by Larry Selinker. The writer predicted the sources based on his observation toward the teacher who was teaching <b>restrictive</b> adjective <b>clauses</b> and the students.

5000|$|He questions, {{however, the}} Court's {{use of the}} {{hub-and-spoke}} conspiracy doctrine to find the element of concerted action that section 1 of the Sherman Act requires. The test that the Court relied on—"whether the licensees knew that {{they would all be}} offered the same price restrictions"—is of [...] "questionable validity" [...] for patent licensing programs because such licenses are [...] "normally standardized in all important terms." [...] He asserts that prospective licensees object to accepting that discriminate in favor of others licensees, since that would give an advantage to competitors. Therefore, license applicants frequently insist on assurances of standardization and also often request a guarantee that better terms will not be offered to other licensees—a [...] "most-favored-licensee" [...] clause—one that provides that any provisions in other licenses that are more favorable to the licensees are automatically available to the licensee demanding the clause. Gibbons says that this reasoning would make most licensing with a <b>restrictive</b> <b>clause</b> the product of conspiracy—"for restricted licensees will almost always know of similar restrictions offered to others."

5000|$|In 1882 the National Cotton Planters Association {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} a [...] "World Cotton Centennial". The organization called on New Orleans and other southern cities to bid for the honor of hosting the event. The proposal was not well received by southern cities still recovering from the aftermath of the Civil War. In order to stir up more publicity for the idea the National Cotton Planters Association in 1883 succeeded in having Senator Augustus Hill Garland of Arkansas introduce a bill in the US Senate to encourage the holding of a World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884. This bill was approved by both houses of Congress. With public sentiment improving, a committee was formed. Commissioners and alternate commissioners from several states were to be appointed by the President. A governing body of thirteen directors was provided, six of whom were named by the President on the recommendation of the association and seven by him on that of a majority of the subscribers in the city in which the event was sponsored. With the future of the event becoming more of a reality, funding within the city of New Orleans started to grow. Burke's newspaper, the Times-Democrat was the first to pledge $5,000 towards the exposition. When $325,000 in pledges had been achieved the committee directors offered Burke the position of the exposition's director-general with a salary of $25,000. Burke initially refused, stating that his duties as both a newspaper editor and state treasurer would not allow enough time. Burke finally accepted when the committee directors appealed to his southern pride by hinting that they might have to include in their search — a Northerner. He refused the salary of $25,000, but accepted a salary of only $10,000 a year, which he directed should be invested in exhibition stock, to be later presented to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Louisiana. Burke, once in command, proceeded to expand {{the idea of a}} merely local or even national exhibition into one which should embrace the entire world. With less than the needed funding, he began the erection of a building costing $325,000. While meeting much opposition to his plans, Burke, nevertheless forged ahead. Franklin C. Morehead, the perennial president of the National Cotton Planters Association and editor-publisher of its official chronicle, the Planters Journal, was appointed to travel and interest state governments, manufacturing firms and foreign countries. Burke went to Washington in May, 1884, and succeeded in having a bill in Congress passed loaning $1,000,000, to be paid from the receipts of the exposition, if there were any surplus over expenses. The sum of $100,000 was also granted to the exposition fund by the Louisiana Legislature, for Congress had tied up its loan by a <b>restrictive</b> <b>clause</b> making the fund available only when $500,000 had been raised from other sources. Finally by August, 1884, a total of one million and a half was in sight. Of this amount $5,000 was to be given to each state and territory to be expended under the direction of its governor by a commission nominated by him and appointed by the President of the United States. These state exhibits thus came to be the strongest feature of the entire exhibition. The space allotted in advance for these state exhibits was soon found to be inadequate for the elaborate displays which resulted from the momentum given to this feature by the $5,000 appropriation, and it became necessary to erect a second building as large as the first. The publicity from the exposition propelled Burke into a second term as state treasurer in the election of 1884. With great fanfare the exposition opened on December 16, 1884. Despite the generous donation from Congress, cost overruns and an aura of funding misappropriations contributed to the financial failure of the exposition. Burke, foreseeing the inevitable, resigned his directorship three weeks before the enterprise was forced to an early closing on June 2, 1885.|$|E
