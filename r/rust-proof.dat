25|$|In 1927, Bossi was a {{cofounder of}} the company Société Continentale Parker in France {{together}} with Robert Deté, Louis Paulhan and Pierre Prier. The purpose was to transfer surface treatment technologies for the spreadling aerospace industry to Europe. Using his relationships he brokered a licence from Parker <b>Rust-Proof</b> in Detroit Parkerizing and in a later step the distribution rights of Udylite Corp for specialty chemicals in Electroplating. The company later became the European market leader in surface treatment via its successor organizations Chemetall GmbH and Coventya GmbH.|$|E

50|$|The {{fountain}} {{was made}} by Andrew Handyside and Company from England, and officially unveiled on 19 May 1882. The fountain was moved to Battery Road in 1905 and later in 1925 to the Esplanade Park, while the Fullerton Building was being constructed, where it now stands. In January 1994, it was shut down for repairs that lasted seven months. As part of this S$1.12-million restoration project, the 7m-high cast-iron fountain was also <b>rust-proofed</b> and a new foundation was built. On 28 December 2010, the Tan Kim Seng Fountain was gazetted as a national monument. It now sits alongside other monuments such as the Lim Bo Seng Memorial and the Cenotaph.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the cost}} of the {{conversion}} (about GB£800) it would appear that most were carried out on the 3500 rather than on the 2000, with even fewer 2200s made. In comparison with the Triumph 2000 estate, the Rover Estoura was of limited practicality. The quality of the conversion also left a great deal to be desired, with the estate conversion being pop-riveted on to the back end of the modified vehicle, with little <b>rust-proofing</b> or paint applied. As a result, the back end of the vehicles often rusted out, and several estate [...] "pods" [...] were subsequently transferred from one car to another.|$|R
50|$|Clark W. Parker {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Coslett's and Richards' U.S. patents, and experimented in the family kitchen with these and other rust-resisting formulations. The ultimate result was that Clark W. Parker, along with his son Wyman C. Parker, working together, set up the Parker <b>Rust-Proof</b> Phosphating Company of America in 1915.|$|E
50|$|At the 1972 Motor Show {{the engine}} size {{increased}} again to 748 cc which gave a new {{top speed of}} 75 to 80 mph, but gave better acceleration.

2500|$|American Motors {{produced}} an innovative advertising {{campaign for the}} 1969 AMC Rebel that {{became one of the}} best TV commercials in one of 15 categories as selected by a team of experts. Known as a builder of [...] "Aunt Martha fuddy-duddy-type cars, but in the late 1960s, at the peak of America's love affair with the auto, AMC wanted to be jazzy." [...] It had previously taken a [...] "totally rational approach" [...] - such as describing the benefits of factory <b>rust-proofing</b> and long warranty coverage. The goal of the new advertising was to highlight AMC's differences and [...] "make an impact" [...] with the car line. Considered as [...] "one of the funniest TV commercials of all time -- not just for cars" [...] is the 1969 AMC Rebel that is torture-tested by student drivers.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} conclusions {{were made}} {{upon completion of}} the testing of crane beams: The lowest rigidity is demonstrated by welded beams exposed to temporary mobile loads; the maximal buckling caused by temporary mobile loads is equal to 12 mm, or 1 / 1, 1790 of the span; the rigidity of crane beams of an overflow dam meets the requirements set by Section E 2. 1 of Construction Rules 20. 13330. 2011 "Loads and Actions". In general, the authors state that the crane beams of the span structure of the overflow dam are in a serviceable operating condition, according to their opinion issued upon completion of examination and testing procedures. The recommendation is to regularly tighten screw nuts and to install high-strength bolts in the points of missing rivets. The authors also recommend applying a <b>rust-proofing</b> coating to all metal structures of the dam spans.

5000|$|The next version to be {{launched}} was a two-door convertible called the Spyder (or Zagato in America), also with 2+2 seating. In brochures Lancia spelt the name with a [...] "y" [...] rather than an [...] "i" [...] possibly to differentiate the car from the Alfa Romeo Spider. The Spyder used the coupé's shorter wheelbase and featured a targa top roof panel, a roll-over bar and folding rear roof. Early models {{did not have a}} cross-member supporting the roof between the tops of the A to B Pillars. Later models had fixed cross-members. It was initially powered by either the 1600 or 1800 twin-cam engine, later being replaced by the new 1.6 and 2.0. It never received the IE or VX engines. There were fuel injected engines for the US market. The Spyder was designed by Pininfarina but actually built by Zagato. The construction process was complex, with coupé bodies-in-white being delivered to Zagato for the roofless conversion, then back to Lancia for <b>rust-proofing,</b> then back to Zagato for paint, interior and trim, and then back to Lancia for a third time for engine installation and final assembly. Lancia probably lost money on every car built. Number built: 9390.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, Baker and Dingman of the Parker <b>Rust-Proof</b> Company {{filed an}} {{improved}} manganese phosphating (Parkerizing) process patent in 1928 that reduced the processing time to [...] {{of the original}} time that had been required through heating the solution to a temperature in the precisely controlled range of 500 to 550 F.

25|$|The Series III {{continued}} {{this success}} in the early 1970s, but {{from the middle of}} the decade sales declined. A large coal export deal to Japan relied on the subsequent import of Japanese cars and other goods, a combination of this increasing competition and increasingly poor quality of the components being shipped from Britain meant that Land Rover's dominance slipped. A problem specific to Australia was the always-limited supply of new Land Rovers. Leyland's factory never had the capacity to meet possible demand and the need to import almost the entire vehicle in kit form from Britain restricted the supply and manufacturing process further. This led to a long waiting list developing for the Leyland product whilst commercial operators could receive large fleets of Japanese vehicles very quickly. The other problems faced by Land Rover were the same throughout its export markets- compared to the Japanese competition, the Land Rover was underpowered, unreliable and slow with a poor ride quality, despite their superior off-road ability. Poor <b>rust-proofing</b> and low-quality steel used in comparison to the Japanese vehicles turned the buyers away in large numbers and by 1983, with the introduction of the One Ten, the Toyota Land Cruiser became the best-selling 4×4 in Australia.|$|R
50|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Auto Express magazine in August 2006 reported that 745 of the 807,000 Marinas sold in Britain {{were still on the}} road, fewer than one of every thousand sold, making it the most-scrapped car sold in Britain over the previous 30 years. The low survival rate is due to a combination of factors, chief amongst which is the Marina's poor <b>rust-proofing.</b> Like other 'ordinary' family saloon cars of the period the Marina did not gain the status of a classic car whilst large numbers were still in good enough condition to encourage preservation. The Marina also made a good 'donor car' for several other British Leyland models. The brakes and suspension from a Marina were/are often used to upgrade the Morris Minor, whilst the A- and B-Series engines were used {{in a wide variety of}} other cars. The 1275 cc A-Series, for example, made an easy performance improvement for a Midget or Sprite, whilst the twin-carb B-Series engine used in the TC versions of the Marina fitted the MGB without any modifications needed (and the TC engine carries a slightly higher power output). Factors such as these meant that elderly Marinas were more likely to be stripped for parts to upgrade more popular models than be repaired or restored.|$|R
