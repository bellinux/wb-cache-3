40|$|Thin, {{flexible}} silicon crystals {{are starting}} up {{applications such as}} light-weighted flexible solar cells, SOI, flexible IC chips, 3 D ICs imagers and 3 D CMOS imagers on the demand of high performance with low cost. Kerfless wafering technology by direct conversion of source gases into mono-crystalline wafers on reusable substrates is highly cost-effective and feedstock-effective route to cheap wafers with the thickness down to several microns. Here we show a prototype for direct conversion of silicon source gases to wafers by using the substrate with protruded seeds. A reliable and controllable method of wafer-scaled preparation of protruded seed patterns has been developed by filling liquid wax into a rod array as the mask for the selective removal of oxide layer on the <b>rod</b> <b>head.</b> Selectively epitaxial growth is performed on the protruded seeds, and the voidless film is formed by the merging of neighboring seeds through growing. And structured hollows are formed between the grown film and the substrate, which would offer the transferability of the grown film and the reusability of the protruded seeds...|$|E
40|$|The microstructures of long rod [001] {{single-crystal}} W- 5 % Ta penetrators {{grown by}} zone-melt processing (ZM), and W penetrators grown by both {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) and ZM processing were compared and examined before and after penetration into rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) steel targets. The initial Vickers microhardness average value for the CVD-W rods was 417 Vickers hardness number. (VHN) in contrast to 485 VHN for the ZM W and W- 5 % Ta rods {{as a consequence of}} an order of magnitude larger dislocation density. Examination of in-target residual cross-section rod heads and rod erosion fragments was performed utilizing scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) as well as optical metallography. Consistent with prior, related studies, rod penetration (at 1. 2 to 1. 4 km/s) was facilitated by super plastic deformation (SPD) -induced solid-state flow, cleavage cracking, shear instabilities, and overlapping adiabatic shear bands characterized by dynamic re-crystallization (DRX). ^ Peripherally along both sides of the penetrator head (high strain points), the DRX zone is followed by an adiabatic shear band or many nucleating bands which allow flow and erosion to occur between this surface zone and the <b>rod</b> <b>head</b> center. These high strain points create a flow characteristic which seems to indicate a vortex-like effect creating a hot zone characterized by large, equiaxed grains. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Research and {{development}} are made about reciprocating air-cool oilless compressors series products {{in order to}} meet maket demond. Piston pings and guiding pings are made by filled PTFE material to achieve the oilless lubrication between cylinders and pistons. Grease lubrication bearings are used and designed in structure to achieve the oilless lubrication of connecting <b>rod</b> larger <b>heads,</b> connecting <b>rod</b> smaller <b>heads</b> and main bearings. The optimal dynamic balance can achieve by a new-type dynamic balance system which are made up of inner balance weight and outer balance weight to make the compressor run stationary. The crankcase bottom are all opened, three-stage fans are used to cool the compressor, these make the compressor cool better to improve the compressor life. The radius-length ratio λ is taken as 1 / 6 to 1 / 7 to reduce side pressure greatly. The reciprocating air-cool oilless compressors series products have better properties, can run smoothly and reliably and go into mass production...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} and compared in vitro the microstructure and mineral composition of permanent and deciduous teeth`s dental enamel. Methods: Sound third molars (n = 12) and second primary molars (n = 12) were selected and {{randomly assigned to}} the following groups, according to the analysis method performed (n = 4) : Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the dental enamel were done. The microscopic findings were analyzed statistically by a nonparametric test (Kruskal-Wallis). The measurements of the prisms number and thickness were done in SEM photomicrographs. The relative amounts of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were determined by EDS investigation. Chemical phases present in both types of teeth were observed by the XRD analysis. Results: The mean thickness measurements observed in the deciduous teeth enamel was 1. 14 mm and in the permanent teeth enamel was 2. 58 mm. The mean <b>rod</b> <b>head</b> diameter in deciduous teeth was statistically {{similar to that of}} permanent teeth enamel, and a slightly decrease from the outer enamel surface to the region next to the enamel-dentine junction was assessed. The numerical density of enamel rods was higher in the deciduous teeth, mainly near EDJ, that showed statistically significant difference. The percentage of Ca and P was higher in the permanent teeth enamel. Conclusions: The primary enamel structure showed a lower level of Ca and P, thinner thickness and higher numerical density of rods. Microsc. Res. Tech. 73 : 572 - 577, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss.

Sunstreaker ignored Hot Rod's warning about Scorponok's army and stormed into {{the building}} so Hot Rod painfully wired himself to send a distress signal. When Sunstreaker's real head was later disabled by Hunter, the Headmaster clones shut down, which Hot Rod explained to Grimlock. The group was surprised by the arrival of Shockwave, but Ultra Magnus had heard Hot Rod's distress call and {{was on his way to}} Earth. After Scorponok knocked out Sludge and Grimlock tended to him, the remaining Dynobots offered Hot Rod a lift aboard the Monsterbots' ship. He refused though, and made it back into Machination HQ to take care of something [...] "personal". He eventually found Scorponok's real head. Hunter also showed up and let Hot Rod know how to disable it, but before he could do so, Scorponok grabbed him.

50|$|The {{cylinder}} heads are machined from aluminum billets. As such, they, too, lack water jackets and rely {{entirely on the}} incoming air/fuel mixture and lubricating oil for their cooling. The original Chrysler design of two large valves per cylinder is used. The intake valve is made from solid titanium and the exhaust from solid Nimonic 80A or similar. Seats are of ductile iron. Beryllium-copper has been tried but its use is limited due to it's toxicity. Valve sizes are around 2.45 in for the intake and 1.925 in for the exhaust.
