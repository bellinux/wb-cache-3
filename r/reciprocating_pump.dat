5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} this device were from {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century in the silver mining area of the Harz mountains, Germany, where they were driven by cranks connected to water wheels, although bucket hoists ("Hakenkunst") using the same method of operation had been used in Swedish iron mines since the 17th century. They appear to have evolved from an informal modification to the beam pumps, where the miners used spikes stuck into the wooden pump rods to get themselves carried up the shaft. As beam pumps were universal in deep mines, it was a then simple development to make proper platforms to carry the miners.

50|$|The {{high-density}} solids pumps {{which can}} be used in the widest range of situations is the hydraulically powered piston (or <b>reciprocating)</b> <b>pump.</b> It can be realized as single-cylinder or two-cylinder pump. In the latter case, power is transferred to the material via delivery pistons working in push-pull-mode.While one delivery piston sucks material from the feed hopper into the cylinder, the second piston simultaneously pushes the material in the other delivery cylinder and into the delivery line.|$|E
50|$|Pumps in this {{category}} range from simplex, with one cylinder, to in some cases quad (four) cylinders, or more. Many reciprocating-type pumps are duplex (two) or triplex (three) cylinder. They can be either single-acting with suction during one direction of piston motion and discharge on the other, or double-acting with suction and discharge in both directions. The pumps can be powered manually, by air or steam, or by a belt driven by an engine. This type of pump was used extensively in the 19th century—in {{the early days of}} steam propulsion—as boiler feed water <b>pumps.</b> Now <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pumps</b> typically pump highly viscous fluids like concrete and heavy oils, and serve in special applications that demand low flow rates against high resistance. <b>Reciprocating</b> hand <b>pumps</b> were widely used to pump water from wells.

50|$|A <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> is a {{class of}} positive-displacement pumps which {{includes}} the piston pump, plunger pump and diaphragm pump. When well maintained, reciprocating pumps will last for years or even decades; however, left untouched, they can undergo rigorous wear and tear. It is often used where a relatively small quantity of liquid is to be handled and where delivery pressure is quite large. In reciprocating pumps, the chamber in which the liquid is trapped, is a stationary cylinder that contains the piston or plunger.|$|E
50|$|A {{flexible}} {{impeller pump}} is a positive-displacement pump that, by deforming impeller vanes, draws the liquid into the pump housing and moves {{it to the}} discharge port with a constant flow rate. The flexibility of the vanes enables a tight seal to the internal housing, making the pump self-priming, while also permitting bi-directional operation. The output from these pumps tends to be smooth or gentle {{when compared to the}} operation of a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> (for example). In 1938, Arthur M. Briggs filed a patent for this type of pump.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the early}} 18th century, steam {{power has been}} applied to a variety of {{practical}} uses. At first it powered <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pumps,</b> but from the 1780s rotative engines (those converting reciprocating motion into rotary motion) began to appear, driving factory machinery such as spinning mules and power looms.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{use for the}} injector {{technology is}} in vacuum ejectors in continuous train braking systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. A vacuum ejector uses steam pressure to draw {{air out of the}} vacuum pipe and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam.|$|E
50|$|A syringe is {{a simple}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> {{consisting}} of a plunger (though in modern syringes it's actually a piston) that fits tightly within a cylindrical tube called a barrel.

The open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle, a nozzle or a tubing to help direct the flow {{into and out of the}} barrel. Syringes are frequently used in clinical medicine to administer injections, infuse intravenous therapy into the bloodstream, apply compounds such as glue or lubricant, and draw/measure liquids.|$|E

50|$|Bourdon tubes measure gauge pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump,</b> an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|E

In order for suction to take place, the pump must first pull the plunger in an outward motion to decrease pressure in the chamber.

40|$|For the {{traditional}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pumping</b> unit, it generally {{starts at the}} bottom dead point with full load and is accelerated when starting and decelerated when stopping, which not only requires great energy from the motor but also impact on the output torque of motor.

This novel system targets to make the motor starting with light load, which could reduce the fluctuation in motor torque, decrease the starting time. In this article, a dynamic model and an efficiency model are established to compute the polished rod load dynamometer card and efficiency of the pumping unit. It is shown that the installed springs could help to reduce {{the impact on the}} system when reversing, and significantly decrease the energy consumption. In addition, we set up the real pumping system with load test system to verify the effectiveness of the model establishment.
