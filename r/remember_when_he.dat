2500|$|Islam {{also tells}} the story of the Prophet Jonah in the Koran. [...] Similar to the Bible, the Koran states that Jonah was sent to his people to deliver a message to worship only one God (the Judeo-Christian God of Abraham) and refrain from evil behavior. However Johah became angry with his people when they refused to listen and ignores him. Jonah gave up on his people and left his {{community}} without having instruction from God. “And <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> (Jonah) went off in anger.” (Quran 21:87) ...|$|E
2500|$|Vyjayanthimala {{commented that}} [...] "his {{death is a}} big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't {{have the chance to}} work with him because he came much later. I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came to Chennai for some film shoot, the college girls went crazy {{to catch a glimpse of}} him when he was going to his studio." [...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done {{playback}} for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [...] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. [...] "We had met several times. Once I had wanted to cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was little}} Newcome, my school-fellow, whom I {{had not seen}} for six years, grown a fine tall young {{stripling}} now, with the same bright blue eyes which I <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was quite a little boy.|$|R
60|$|The return or the {{departure}} of the father was the one event which the child <b>remembered.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> came, something woke up in her, some yearning. She knew <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was out of joint or irritable or tired: then she was uneasy, she could not rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>remember,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{comes down}} to breakfast you are to take no notice {{whatever}} of his having been away--no notice at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{she replied}} slowly, [...] "that Count Sabatini is the strangest man whom I ever met. Do you <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> stood {{and looked down}} upon us? I felt--but it was so foolish!" ...|$|E
60|$|Here was an opportunity, perhaps, of {{discovering}} what the Minister {{had failed to}} <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had been speaking of this woman, and when I had {{asked if he had}} ever offended her. I was especially careful in making my inquiries.|$|E
50|$|The first {{staging of}} act 1 {{took place at}} the Neues Königliches Opernhaus in Berlin on 14 January 1899, {{conducted}} by Richard Strauss. Briséïs is highly erotic and seductively scored music, which Strauss may well have <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came to compose Salome.|$|R
60|$|How long {{he stood}} there, alone and irresolute, <b>he</b> never <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{thought of it}} in after-days. All he knew was that there came {{a time when a}} sound in the drawing-room {{attracted}} his attention. It was nothing more important than the opening of a door.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Certain sure a man forgets to <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> proper mucked up with work.

60|$|He {{had taken}} Beetle aside {{that day and}} given him much good advice, not one word of which did Beetle <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> dashed up to the study, white with excitement, and poured out the wondrous tale. It demanded a great belief.|$|E
60|$|For {{the moment}} he did not <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had seen her, and then came a vague memory of the {{stirring}} emotions of their first encounter. But the dancing web of melody about him kept the air of that great marching song from his memory.|$|E
60|$|She {{had always}} the same effect upon him, the effect of being {{suddenly}} <b>remembered.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> was away from her he was always sure {{that she was a}} beautiful woman, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw her again he was always astonished to see how little he had borne her beauty in mind. For a moment they regarded one another silently. Then she {{closed the door behind her}} and came towards him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes! I don't <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was here}} last--indeed, we haven't seen much of him lately.

6000|$|Ay, {{listen to}} our little man now, singin' an' shoutin' as tho' trouble had niver touched him. D' you <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went mad with the home-sickness?' said Mulvaney, recalling a never-to-be-forgotten season when Ortheris waded through the deep waters of affliction and behaved abominably. 'But he's talkin' bitter truth, though. Eyah! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This Mr. Hamilton Fynes," [...] he remarked, [...] "seems to {{have been}} {{what you might call}} a secretive sort of person. Nobody appears to know {{anything}} about him. I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was staying here before that he had no callers, and seemed to spend most of his time sitting in the palm court." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> did this?' she proceeded.

50|$|The Echoing Green (or Ecchoing Green) is {{a poem by}} William Blake {{published}} in Songs of Innocence in 1789.

6000|$|... "I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was plain}} George Carruthers, running about {{the streets of}} Aberdeen, and it was well with him when his shoes weren't broken at the toes and down at heel.
