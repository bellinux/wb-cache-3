5|$|Protecting both quarterbacks was {{a strong}} {{offensive}} line anchored by All-American guard Rodney Hudson, a two-time winner of the Jacobs Blocking Trophy, a four-time recipient of all-conference honors and {{a finalist for the}} Outland Trophy. Hudson and the offensive line also protected Florida State's <b>running</b> <b>backs.</b> Foremost among these was sophomore Chris Thompson, who led the team with 687rushing yards. Thompson was predicted to start the ACC Championship game because of his performance in the regular season and because fellow <b>running</b> <b>backs</b> Ty Jones and Jermaine Thomas were injured. Taken together, Florida State's offense was 52nd in total offense, accumulating 391yards per game.|$|E

5|$|On January 15, {{special teams}} {{coordinator}} Dave Toub {{announced that he}} is leaving the Bears for the Kansas City Chiefs. Two days later, {{it was announced that}} defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli would not return to the team. Eight assistants were also dismissed: quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates, <b>running</b> <b>backs</b> coach Tim Spencer, wide receivers coach Darryl Drake, tight ends coach Mike DeBord, offensive line coach Tim Holt, linebackers coach Bob Babich, defensive backs coach Gill Byrd, and offensive coordinator Mike Tice. To replace Bates and Spencer, Chicago hired Matt Cavanaugh and Skip Peete as quarterbacks and <b>running</b> <b>backs</b> coach, respectively. To take Marinelli's place, the Bears hired Jacksonville Jaguars' defensive coordinator Mel Tucker. On February 21, Trestman's staff was completed after the Bears hired Alabama coach Mike Groh as wide receivers coach.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, rushing {{attempts}} were made by <b>running</b> <b>backs</b> Da'Rel Scott (14for 174yards), Morgan Green (10 for 72yards), and Davin Meggett (10 for 35yards). Wide receiver Heyward-Bey also made a rushing attempt, but dropped the ball and recovered it for a loss of sixyards.|$|E

50|$|The zone read, or shotgun veer play, is {{now widely}} used {{throughout}} {{all levels of}} college football. A <b>running</b> <b>back</b> is lined up adjacent to the quarterback, and, at the snap, the quarterback opens up facing the <b>running</b> <b>back.</b> He reads the end {{on the same side}} as the <b>running</b> <b>back.</b> The <b>running</b> <b>back</b> is performing effectively the same motion as the dive back in a conventional veer, except he runs at the defensive end {{on the opposite side of}} the field. If the unblocked end on the <b>running</b> <b>back's</b> side (who, in a sense, is being veered) moves up the field towards the crossing <b>running</b> <b>back,</b> the quarterback pulls the ball from the <b>running</b> <b>back</b> and sprints by the end. If the veered end is waiting at his original position, the quarterback gives the ball to the <b>running</b> <b>back.</b> Many different formations are employed, and as a general rule, the option being employed is the base offense for the team, and not as a wrinkle.|$|R

In interviews, Kiffin said the coaching changes and stories surrounding him were not a distraction from his team's bowl preparation.|$|E

5|$|After the {{graduation}} of <b>running</b> <b>backs</b> Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At {{the conclusion of}} spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E
