5|$|The {{idea that}} Ciomadul {{could be a}} still active volcano was first {{proposed}} in 1780 {{on the basis of}} its young appearance and the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> While a publication in 1964 postulated that the tuffs of Ciomadul were reworked Pliocene volcanites, the late Pleistocene age was established soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E
5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E

Some <b>of</b> these <b>gases,</b> such as nitrous oxide released from peat, directly affect climate. Others, such as dimethyl sulfide released from oceans, have indirect effects.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for the repository heat source to promote buoyancy driven flow and thereby cause <b>release</b> <b>of</b> radon <b>gas</b> out <b>of</b> Yucca Mountain has been examined through a critical review of the theoretical and experimental studies of this process. The review indicates that steady-state buoyancy enhanced <b>release</b> <b>of</b> natural radon and other contaminant gases {{should not be a}} major concern at Yucca Mountain. Barometric pumping and wind pumping are identified as two processes that will have a potentially greater effect on surface <b>releases</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases...</b>|$|R

25|$|Gases {{are partly}} {{supplied}} from shallow magma; {{the volume of}} magma erupted {{is too small to}} contain all the exhalations. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> by the magma is favoured by strong temperature contrasts between incoming magma and the magma chamber. This may explain the high emission of sulfur dioxide by Lascar. The presence of argon and nitrogen in low-temperature fumaroles indicates that air is involved in their formation, although a portion of each of these two gases is non-atmospheric.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMechanism of {{aluminum}} powder corrosion in calcium hydroxide solutions was investigated via various analyses of residues after its hydrolysis reaction and pH {{change of the}} solutions to control the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen <b>gas.</b> It was revealed that the reaction with a <b>release</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen <b>gas</b> consisted <b>of</b> katoite formation and hydration {{of aluminum}}. The katoite formation, which is progressed by the reaction among calcium ion, aluminum hydroxide anion (Al(OH) 4 −), and water molecules at the first step, {{is important for the}} promotion of aluminum corrosion and moderate <b>release</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen <b>gas...</b>|$|R

50|$|For the {{alleviation}} of flatulence, an {{antifoaming agent}} such as simethicone {{may be taken}} orally.

50|$|The {{concept of}} half time {{is used in}} diving {{physiology}} where body tissues take up and release inert gases (usually nitrogen) following changes in depth. Different tissue types have different half times for a given inert gas, and modelling the uptake and <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> by the tissues is important to avoid decompression sickness.|$|R
50|$|An {{explosive}} eruption always begins with {{some form of}} blockage in the crater of a volcano that prevents the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> trapped in highly viscous andesitic or rhyolitic magma. The high viscosity of these forms of magma prevents the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> trapped <b>gases.</b> When this type of magma flows towards the surface pressure builds, eventually causing the blockage to be blasted out in an {{explosive eruption}}. The pressure from the magma and gases are released through the weakest point in the cone, usually the crater. However, {{in the case of}} the eruption of Mount St. Helens, pressure was released through the side of the volcano, rather than the crater.|$|R

50|$|Molten rock (either magma or lava) {{near the}} {{atmosphere}} releases high-temperature volcanic gas (>400 °C). In explosive volcanic eruptions, sudden <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> from magma may cause rapid {{movements of the}} molten rock. When the magma encounters water, seawater, lake water or groundwater, it can be rapidly fragmented. The rapid expansion <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> is the driving mechanism of most explosive volcanic eruptions. However, a significant portion <b>of</b> volcanic <b>gas</b> <b>release</b> occurs during quasi-continuous quiescent phases of active volcanism.|$|R
