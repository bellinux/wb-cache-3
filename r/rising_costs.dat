5|$|A {{judicial}} review of the development was launched in October 2016 by Vue Cinemas, who objected to an extra screen being approved at the site. Later that year, principal contractor ISG withdrew, citing <b>rising</b> <b>costs</b> and the {{judicial review}}, which was settled in the City of York's favour in January 2017. By May that year, construction had not yet began nor had a new contractor been found.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the {{university}} established KUHT—the first educational television {{station in the}} nation—after the four-year-long Federal Communications Commission's television licensing freeze ended. During this period, however, {{the university}} as a private institution was facing financial troubles. Tuition failed to cover <b>rising</b> <b>costs,</b> and in turn, tuition increases caused a drop in enrollment.|$|E

5|$|The Spirits Within debuted to mixed {{critical}} reception, but {{was widely}} praised for the realism of the computer-animated characters. Due to <b>rising</b> <b>costs,</b> the film greatly exceeded its original budget {{towards the end}} of production, reaching a final cost of $137 million, of which it recovered only $85 million at the box office. The film has been called a box office bomb and is blamed for the demise of Square Pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Scottish Parliament Building has generated controversy in several respects. <b>Rising</b> <b>costs</b> {{and the use of}} public money to fund the project generated most controversy. Initial estimates for constructing a new building were projected to be between £10m and £40m in 1997. By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at £430m, some ten times greater.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the Jaguar M was expensive, {{limiting}} {{the size of}} the force the French Navy could afford. In 1971, Dassault proposed the Super Étendard, claiming that it was a simpler and cheap development of the existing Étendard IV, and in 1973, the French Navy agreed to order it instead of the Jaguar, although <b>rising</b> <b>costs</b> of the Super Étendard meant that only 71 of the planned 100 aircraft were purchased. The M was cancelled by the French government in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} {{more than twenty}} steamships {{were a part of}} the fleet, {{including}} the 1112 ton Merimbula and the 693 ton Eden. Many of these vessels were purpose-built for the company's needs, and were constructed at shipyards both within Australia and abroad. The company's eventual demise came {{as a result of a}} number of factors, including increased competition from road and rail, the cost of replacing ships after World War II, waterfront disputes and <b>rising</b> <b>costs.</b> As a consequence, after almost 100 years in operation, the company was placed into voluntary receivership and was delisted from the stock exchange in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Rupert D'Oyly Carte {{refreshed}} {{the opera}} company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, {{as well as}} provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the <b>rising</b> <b>costs</b> of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became {{too much for the}} company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.|$|E
5|$|The mansion, {{abandoned}} due to <b>rising</b> <b>costs,</b> was demolished in 1972, allowing Wallingford Castle to {{be declared}} a scheduled monument {{as well as}} a Grade I listed building. The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public. An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010, aiming to better understand the historical transition from the Anglo-Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh, to the period of the Norman castle.|$|E
5|$|But {{the real}} reason was that the {{production}} had financial issues, with the acquisition of new crew members {{and the increase in}} popularity of Doctor Leonard McCoy meaning that those salaries needed {{to come out of the}} original budget. In Justman and Herb Solow's 1996 book Inside Star Trek, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney's limited appearances and the financial issues that the series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due to <b>rising</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

5|$|By Sesame Streets 40th anniversary, it {{was ranked}} the fifteenth most popular children's show on television. When the show premiered in 1969, 130 episodes a year were produced; in 2009, because of <b>rising</b> <b>costs,</b> twenty-six episodes were made. In 2000, the Children's Television Workshop, which had {{changed its name}} to the Sesame Workshop (SW) in June 2000 to better reflect its entry into non-television and {{interactive}} media, launched a website with a library of free video clips and free podcasts from throughout the show's history. The 2008–2009 recession, which led to budget cuts for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected Sesame Street; in spring 2009, the SW had to lay off 20% of its staff.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, <b>rising</b> <b>costs</b> finally forced {{an increase in the}} price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E
5|$|Control of the {{building}} project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, {{at a time of}} increasing costs. <b>Rising</b> <b>costs</b> sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of healthcare, the <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> {{for drug}} development, the patent cliff for Big pharma, shorter patent protection, {{decrease}} reimbursement, and the recession {{have made it}} more difficult for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry to develop drugs. Due to the unsustainable amount of time and money in developing a drug that will have a significant return on investment (ROI) it has become hard to sustain a robust pipeline. The industry is transforming its business model to meet these challenges. In essence a paradigm shift is occurring; the old “closed” model is giving way to a new “open” business model...|$|R
5|$|However, {{another major}} reason for <b>rising</b> <b>costs</b> was {{the need to develop}} a {{separate}} variant for the photo-reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused too great a performance penalty. The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS (as the reconnaissance version was designated) resulted in only 36Mirage IIIS fighters and 18IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen. Twelve were allocated to a reconnaissance squadron, three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons. It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the multi-role capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine. The Mirage IIIS went into service in 1967, and the IIIRS in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, <b>rising</b> <b>costs,</b> and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant death duties, coupled with the <b>rising</b> <b>costs</b> of the upkeep, made Belton too much for the Brownlow family.|$|E
