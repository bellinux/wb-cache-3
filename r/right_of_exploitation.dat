The artist promises to offer only one physical representation of the work for sale, with the clearly visible fingerprint or signature in wet paint or ink at the front.

Chapter One is an introductory chapter which provides definition of a copyrighted work and explains the content of exclusive rights of authors to their works. Chapter Two focuses on the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> It describes various forms of exploitation of copyrighted works and also deals with the regulation of a license agreement and the non-contractual use of works secured by the exceptions and limitations of copyright. The legislative changes caused by the recodification of Czech civil legislation are also reflected.

Invoking national interest, dispute over natural resources has increased in direct proportion to the increasing importance of these resources and inversely proportional to the decrease in quantity. A dull but intense battle at this point characterizes natural resources, especially of oil and mining of precious metals. Therefore, we can say that the power exerted on natural resources determines the ranking of countries of the world economic power and living standards of the population. Use of natural resources as an effective weapon in the economic consolidation became state policy and the expansion of exploration and exploitation in foreign lands required the development of complex regulations. Therefore, this study aims at presenting an analytic perspective of foreign law - specific states with relevant impact on the exploitation of natural resources - and the presentation of some features of international law...|$|E

For the term computer program, the thesis is trying to find a suitable definition that is sufficiently general, but also accurately captures it's notion. Various known forms of expression of the computer program (source code, machine code, but also a code in an intermediate language) are described and the thesis explains, why it is appropriate to protect the computer program in any form. The thesis clarifies, why the term "software" and the term "computer program" are not identical and arbitrarily exchanging them can cause problems.

Traditional approaches to state sovereignty have emphasized the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> states to exploit natural resources.

Founded upon this premise, the thesis focuses on the emergence of a 'balanced' approach to state sovereignty over natural resources and examines its effects on the role of states in managing natural resources. While addressing it as the basis of the emergence of the recognition of a duty of environmental protection, inter alia, in the form of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of biological resources, the author suggests that the balanced approach to state sovereignty has been instrumental in redefining the role of states, {{and the role of the}} sovereignty principle itself in achieving the goal of biodiversity conservation...|$|R

This also meant restricting foreign investments in public utilities. The provisions were not revised but even elaborated in subsequent revisions of the constitution. These provisions set a train of restrictive economic policies that helped to compound the mistakes of early industrialization policies. By tying the hands of future generations of Filipinos to deal with specific economic issues in their own time, the constitutional provisions provided barriers against solving economic problems with realism as called for by changing times and exigency. Judged as the most likely to succeed in the early years after independence among many East Asian economies, the Philippines became the economic laggard among a group of highly performing economies {{during the second half of}} the last century. The brand of economic nationalism that was fostered was exploitative and heavily protectionist in character. It built an economic and political framework that discouraged competition, enhanced monopolies and inefficiencies by nationals, inhibited the growth of international trade, and hence postponed by a large margin of time the growth of economic specialization based on comparative advantage. A new kind of nationalism based on principles of competition and comparative advantage is needed. This will be helped greatly by the removal of stringent constitutional provisions that affect foreign investments. An enlarged regional free trade within ASEAN and accession to the World Trade Organization are factors that will help to sustain this new ethos, which will strengthen economic and national aspirations. economics and law, economic nationalism, trade and industry, Philippines, economic development...|$|R

This is because like many island developing countries, the Maldives has a narrow resource base and its main natural resources consist of fisheries and a marine area conducive for international tourism.

In the absence <b>of</b> appropriate property <b>rights,</b> the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> a common property such as the fisheries may lead to over exploitation (and possible extinction of a species) and externalities both contemporaneous and inter-generational.
