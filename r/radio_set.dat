5|$|The T-26 mod. 1931 did {{not have}} a <b>radio</b> <b>set.</b> The tank {{commander}} communicated with the driver by speaking tube, which was replaced with a signalling lamp in 1932. The T-26 was equipped with one fire extinguisher, a kit of spare parts tools and accessories (including a tank jack), a canvas stowage, and a tow chain fixed on the rear of the hull.|$|E
5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> which they used to pass messages {{in and out of}} camp. The radio was discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, U.S. troops {{sometimes}} employed {{hand crank}} generators, GN-35 and GN-45, to power Signal Corps <b>Radio</b> <b>sets.</b> The hand cranking was laborious, but generated sufficient current for smaller <b>radio</b> <b>sets,</b> {{such as the}} SCR-131, SCR-161, SCR-171, SCR-284, and SCR-694.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with <b>radio</b> <b>set,</b> had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 Model 1933 carried 122 {{rounds of}} 45mm ammunition, firing armour-piercing 45mm rounds with a muzzle {{velocity}} of , or lower-velocity high-explosive munitions. Tanks intended for company commanders were {{equipped with a}} <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> and a hand-rail radio antenna on the turret (so called radio tanks). Later the hand-rail antenna was replaced with a buggy-whip antenna, because experience in the Spanish Civil War and Battle of Lake Khasan showed that the hand-rail antenna drew fire onto commander tanks.|$|E
5|$|The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the Führerbunker {{was below}} the water table, {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A diesel generator provided electricity, and well water was pumped {{in as the}} water supply. Communications systems included a telex, a telephone switchboard, and an army <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated {{at the end of}} the war, Hitler received much of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.|$|E
50|$|Continuous tone coded squelch system (CTCSS) {{allows a}} group of <b>radios</b> <b>set</b> with the same tone to {{converse}} on a channel without hearing other radios using that channel. CTCSS {{can be used to}} silence a radio until another radio with the same tone transmits. This allows monitoring of a channel for transmissions from <b>radios</b> <b>set</b> with the same tone without hearing other conversations that use different or even no tone.|$|R

5|$|With such a heavy {{disparity}} in armament between the smack's 3pounder and the submarine's 88mm deck gun the engagement was short lived, the submarine firing eight shots before the Nelson could get {{within range of}} her opponent. The fourth shot fired by the U-boat holed the smack, and the seventh tore off both of Crisp's legs from underneath him. Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard, Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat's four carrier pigeons: like many small ships of the era, the Nelson did not possess a <b>radio</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large Japanese {{air raid}} at 12:30 by 20 fighters and 12 bombers struck the Australian {{positions}} around Launch Jetty and the Finschhafen airstrip. About 60 bombs were dropped. There were heavy casualties. The 2/3rd Field Company lost 14 killed and 19 wounded; the 2/12th Field Regiment lost two killed and 16 wounded, {{and the air}} liaison party's headquarters was hit, knocking out its <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> and killing Captain Ferrel, its commander. Another eight men were killed and 40 wounded in air raids on 25 September. During the night of 25/26 September, Japanese barges and a submarine were spotted offshore. Windeyer had to bring a company of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion back to protect the brigade area.|$|E
5|$|Sudirman and {{his troops}} {{continued}} {{to make their way}} through the jungles and forests, eventually arriving at Sobo, near Mount Lawu, on 18February. During the journey, Sudirman used a <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> to convey orders to local TNI troops if he believed that the region was secure. Feeling weaker because of the physical hardships he had faced, including travelling through the forests and a lack of food, and believing the area to be safe, Sudirman decided that Sobo would serve as his guerrilla headquarters. The local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Wiliater Hutagalung, served as his go-between with the other TNI leaders. Aware that international opinion, which was beginning to condemn Dutch actions in Indonesia, could bring Indonesia greater recognition, Sudirman and Hutagalung discussed possible terms of action, before agreeing on a large-scale assault. Meanwhile, the Dutch began to spread propaganda claiming that they had captured Sudirman; this claim was intended to break the morale of the guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|The eight Locusts {{were loaded}} into {{separate}} Hamilcar gliders between 17–20 March, {{and on the}} morning of 24 March were towed from the airfield by Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers to join the rest of the gliders and transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions. Weather conditions for the operation were excellent, with clear visibility, and all eight gliders arrived {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone without incident. During their attempts to land, however, the small force was severely depleted; one glider broke away from the Halifax towing it and disintegrated, apparently as a result of structural failure, with the Locust inside it falling to the ground. Three more gliders came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret, rendering it useless.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur <b>radio</b> <b>set.</b> This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
5|$|All of the gliders {{successfully}} {{took off}} at 07:20 on 24 March, but seven were lost {{en route to}} the landing zones, the majority being forced to cast off and land in Allied territory due to their tugs suffering engine failures; however, one Hamilcar which carried an M22 Locust broke up in mid-air as it approached the Rhine, possibly due to structural failure, and all aboard were killed. Three more of the gliders were destroyed by German anti-aircraft fire as they approached the landing zones, as their slow speed made them easy targets. The thirty-eight that remained landed successfully between 10:46 and 11:00, although a number of them suffered damage from anti-aircraft fire. Particularly hard hit were the Hamilcars that carried the RASC personnel and supplies; eight landed successfully, but only three were sufficiently undamaged to allow the stores they carried to be recovered. Of the eight Hamilcars that transported the M22 Locusts of 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, seven reached the landing zones intact but had problems when they landed due to anti-aircraft fire and smoke obscuring the area. Four landed safely, but the other three came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret, which rendered it useless. After the operation had come to an end, a few of the undamaged Hamilcars were dismantled and their parts shipped to England to aid in the construction of further gliders.|$|E
