50|$|They {{also had}} four <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> {{at the center}} of the unit next to each other in line on the roof instead of two at each end. This {{external}} feature was the result of a major change in internal arrangement, the replacement of all mechanical and belt-drives for <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> and traction <b>motor</b> blowers with electric motors. Power for these accessories was produced by a new D14 three phase alternator built into the main DC generator, called a “companion alternator”. This device has been used in all later EMD road locomotives to the present.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of automotive cooling {{systems can be}} improved by replacing the traditional mechanically driven <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> and water pump assemblies with computer controlled components. The introduction of electric servo-motors to drive the cooling components can improve temperature tracking, which should increase fuel efficiency and decrease tailpipe emissions. However, the power requirement for these electric motors increases with greater cooling demands if the radiator surface area remains constrained. For heavy-duty applications, where engines are subjected to significant cooling loads, electric motors may become impractical due to their increased size and power requirements; in these situations, hydraulic-based components are advantageous due to their high power density. The off-road equipment industry currently uses hydraulic <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> drives for cooling applications, while the coolant pump remains mechanically driven. Therefore, an opportunity exists to integrate the <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> and coolant pump into hydraulic circuits to actively meet cooling demands...|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{comprehensive}} {{investigations have}} been made by the automobile industry and government institutions to develop new <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> of different geometry which generate lower noise and lower aerodynamic loss. These efforts have been conducted promarily in an empirical manner. More controlled and effective approaches are possible using modern computational methods to be described during this presentation. As a first step in the evolution of such modern analysis, an Aeroacoustic Singularity Method combined with an Optimization Code was developed at the Institute of Design Aerodynamics. This permitted conducting a research study supported by the AEG company, Germany, to improve conventional car <b>radiator</b> <b>fans.</b> In the case of periodic signals, the singularity method employs a lifting surface approach for both aerodynamics and acoustics.

40|$|Advanced thermal {{management}} systems for internal combustion engines can improve coolant temperature regulation and servomotor power consumption by better regulating the combustion process with multiple electro-mechanical components. The traditional thermostat valve, coolant pump and clutch-driven <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> are upgraded with servomotor actuators. When the system components function harmoniously, desired thermal conditions {{can be accomplished}} in a power efficient manner. In this paper, a comprehensive control architecture is proposed for transient temperature tracking. An experimental system has been fabricated and assembled which features a variable position smart thermostat valve, variable speed electric water pump, variable speed electric <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> engine block, and various sensors. In the configured system, the steam-based heat exchanger emulates the heat generated by the engine’s combustion process. Representative numerical and experimental results are discussed to demonstrate the functionality of the {{thermal management}} system in tracking prescribed temperature profiles...|$|R

50|$|The roof {{is a more}} {{reliable}} indication; FTs had four exhaust stacks along the centerline (flanked by boxy structures if dynamic brakes were included). The <b>radiator</b> <b>fans</b> were recessed within the carbody, and arranged in two pairs, one near {{each end of the}} locomotive. Later units have the fans grouped together, and their shrouding extended atop the roof.|$|R
50|$|Engine-driven {{fans are}} often {{regulated}} by a viscous-drive clutch from the drivebelt, which slips {{and reduces the}} fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling <b>radiator</b> <b>fans.</b> Electric fans are controlled by a thermostatic switch or the engine control unit. Electric fans also {{have the advantage of}} giving good airflow and cooling at low engine revs or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic.|$|R

The front-mounted radiator was angled forward, and the car did not come with a <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> which combined to permit an extremely low nose.

50|$|Other factors {{influence}} {{the temperature of}} the engine, including radiator size and the type of <b>radiator</b> <b>fan.</b> The size of the radiator (and thus its cooling capacity) is chosen such that it can keep the engine at the design temperature under the most extreme conditions a vehicle is likely to encounter (such as climbing a mountain whilst fully loaded on a hot day).|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} way of engine rating {{is what is}} known as the brake power, {{measured}} at the flywheel, and given in kilowatts (metric) or horsepower (Imperial/USA). This is the actual mechanical power output of the engine in a usable and complete form. The term [...] "brake" [...] comes from the use of a brake in a dynamometer test to load the engine. For accuracy, it is important to understand what is meant by usable and complete. For example, for a car engine, apart from friction and thermodynamic losses inside the engine, power is absorbed by the water pump, alternator, and <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> thus reducing the power available at the flywheel to move the car along. Power is also absorbed by the power steering pump and air conditioner (if fitted), but these are not installed for a power output test or calculation. Power output varies slightly according to the energy value of the fuel, the ambient air temperature and humidity, and the altitude. Therefore, there are agreed standards in the USA and Europe on the fuel to use when testing, and engines are rated at 25 ⁰C (Europe), and 64 ⁰F (USA) at sea level, 50% humidity. Marine engines, as supplied, usually have no <b>radiator</b> <b>fan,</b> and often no alternator. In such cases the quoted power rating does not allow for losses in the <b>radiator</b> <b>fan</b> and alternator. The SAE in USA, and the ISO in Europe publish standards on exact procedures, and how to apply corrections for deviating conditions like high altitude.|$|R
