5|$|Between August 1994 and August 1995, two {{companies}} of the regiment, initially A Company, 2/4 RAR and then B Company, 2 RAR, {{served with the}} Australian contingent of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). From 20 to 23 April 1995, a 50-member detachment, including infantrymen from 5 Platoon, B Company, 2 RAR were forced to witness the Kibeho Massacre of around 4,000 Hutu refugees at the Kibeho camp {{by members of the}} <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Army.</b> Vastly outnumbered and frustrated by a mandate that did not allow them to engage the perpetrators, the infantrymen were forced into a passive role during the massacre. Throughout the incident, however, they worked under fire attempting to assist wounded refugees. Meanwhile, 8/9 RAR was disbanded in 1997 after the discontinuation of the Ready Reserve scheme.|$|E
5|$|The post-genocide Rwandan {{government}} {{took office in}} Kigali in July 1994. It was based loosely on the Arusha Accords, but Habyarimana's party, MRND was outlawed. The positions it had been assigned were {{taken over by the}} RPF. The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Army</b> (RPA), and became the national army. Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of Vice President of Rwanda and Minister of Defence while Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs, but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and was the de facto ruler of the country.|$|E

5|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. Largely composed of former <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Army</b> (RPA) soldiers, it includes the Rwanda Land Force, Rwanda Air Force and specialised units. After the successful conquest {{of the country in}} 1994 {{in the aftermath of the}} Rwandan Genocide, the Rwandan Patriotic Front decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a military division which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of {{the national}} budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E
25|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) (in Kinyarwanda: Ingabo z'u Rwanda; in French: Forces rwandaises de défense) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda.

25|$|In April 1995, {{there was}} a serious {{outbreak}} of violence {{in one of the}} refugee camps that 2 RAR personnel were based at. Outnumbered and unable to undertake offensive operations due to the restrictions placed upon their operations by the UN Mandate governing the deployment, the Australians were unable to intervene. It has since been estimated that up to 4,000 refugees were killed by members of the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Army</b> in this incident, although this number may well have been higher if not for the efforts of the Australian medics and infantrymen who braved hostile fire on numerous occasions without the ability to return fire as they attempted to assist the wounded and dying.|$|E

25|$|The FDLR counts {{among its}} number the {{original}} {{members of the}} Interahamwe that opposed the RPFsthe 1994 Rwandan Genocide. It received extensive backing from, and cooperation from, the government of Congolese President Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who used the FDLR as a proxy force against the foreign Rwandan armies operating in the country, in particular the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Army</b> (RPF military wing) and Rwanda-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy. In July 2002, FDLR units still in Kinshasa-held territory moved into North and South Kivu. At {{this time it was}} thought to have between 15,000 and 20,000 members. Even after the official end of the Second Congo War in 2002, FDLR units continued to attack Tutsi forces both in eastern DRC and across the border into Rwanda, vastly increasing tensions in the region and raising the possibility of another Rwandan offensive into the DRC – what would be their third since 1996. In mid-2004, a number of attacks forced 25,000 Congolese to flee their homes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tension between}} Uganda and Rwanda reached a {{breaking}} point in early August as {{units of the}} Uganda People's Defense Force and the <b>Rwandan</b> <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Army</b> clashed in Kisangani.

Rwandan-supported rebel forces launched a major offensive and approached Kinshasa but were eventually repelled.|$|E
2500|$|Following their victory, the RPF {{created a}} Government of National Unity in July 1994, and invited Sendashonga, a {{politically}} moderate Hutu, {{to be the}} Minister of the Interior.

[...] After returning to Kigali, he briefed Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President/Defense Minister Paul Kagame and sought assurances that the RPA would exercise restraint. [...] Following the massacre {{of a large number of}} IDPs at Kibeho on the 22nd, the RPA refused Sendashonga entry to the area.|$|E
