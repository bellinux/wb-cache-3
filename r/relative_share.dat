25|$|Mixed member {{systems are}} {{susceptible}} to gerrymandering for the local seats that remain a part of such systems. Under parallel voting, a semi-proportional system, there is no compensation for the effects that such gerrymandering might have. Under MMP, the use of compensatory list seats makes gerrymandering less of an issue. However, its effectiveness in this regard depends upon {{the features of the}} system, including the size of the regional districts, the <b>relative</b> <b>share</b> of list seats in the total, and opportunities for collusion that might exist. A striking example of how the compensatory mechanism can be undermined {{can be seen in the}} 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election, where the leading party, Fidesz, combined gerrymandering and decoy lists, which resulted in a two-thirds parliamentary majority from a 45% vote. This illustrates how certain implementations of MMP can produce moderately proportional outcomes, similar to parallel voting.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGroups make {{decisions}} on both the production {{and the distribution of}} resources. These decisions typically involve a tension between increasing the total level of group resources (i. e. social efficiency) and distributing these resources among group members (i. e. individuals’ <b>relative</b> <b>shares).</b> This is the case because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus resulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dual-process approach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension. We conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different allocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed approach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using the Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the experimental manipulation of response times). To test for robustness, experiments were conducted in two countries: the USA and India. Despite absolute-level differences across countries, in both locations we show that: (i) time pressure and low CRT scores are associated with individuals’ concerns for their <b>relative</b> <b>shares</b> and (ii) time delay and high CRT scores are associated with individuals’ concerns for social efficiency. These findings demonstrate that deliberation favourssocial efficiency by overriding individuals’ intuitive tendency to focus on <b>relative</b> <b>shares...</b>|$|R
30|$|This gives {{evidence}} of a relation between three rankings: the most central sectors in each European country, the most central sectors in the EU regional economy, and the most intra-EU traded goods and services. In addition to finding a relation between the most important sectors and the most intra-EU traded ones, we also explored {{if there is a}} relation between our results and the sectors with the highest share in GDP in each economy and the sectors with the highest <b>relative</b> <b>shares</b> with respect to the EU. <b>Relative</b> <b>shares</b> show the share of a sector in one country with respect to the share of that sector in the entire EU, so countries with sectors that have high <b>relative</b> <b>shares</b> show an advantage in the production of the goods of that sector. 13 Own calculations of sector shares in the EU with 2005 Eurostat data showed that the sectors with the highest shares were construction, real-estate, wholesale trade, other business services, food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration and defense, and motor vehicles. The most common sectors with the highest shares in European countries were construction, real-estate, wholesale trade, other business services, food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration, motor vehicles, and machinery and equipment. Our results are in line with European Comission (a), which shows that the sectors with the highest shares in EU GDP are other business services, health and social work, construction, public administration, financial intermediation, wholesale trade, real-estate, education, retail trade, and other services. Secondly, the sectors with the highest <b>relative</b> <b>shares</b> in most countries are crude oil and natural gas, radio television and communication equipment, office machinery and computers, wearing apparel and furs, forestry and logging, electrical machinery and apparatus, metal ores, and basic metals.|$|R
