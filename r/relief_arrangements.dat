Apparently, it originally belonged to the chancel screen in the sanctuary of St Tryphon, constructed in the early 9 th century, of which only remnants of the foundation layer have been preserved. The pluteus has been analysed on several occasions, with the results published in scholarly literature, and most experts have justly dated it to the early period of pre-Romanesque sculpture in Dalmatia. Its front features a relief with geometric and vegetal ornaments. To the left, there is a panel with knotted triangles along the edge and rhombuses in the central section.

40|$|The {{government}} of Egypt recently stated that external financial assistance {{is necessary in}} the present economic situation and has expressed a strong preference for receiving it in part via debt relief. Williamson and Khan explore {{whether there is a}} case for debt relief and if so what form this relief should take. They review the cases of Egypt in an earlier era and other middle-income countries—Iraq, Argentina, and Nigeria—that benefited from debt relief, as well as the loan guarantees provided by the United States to Israel, to draw out the lessons and implications for Egypt. In terms of reducing debt service payments, debt relief was certainly successful in each of the countries reviewed. The authors conclude with recommendations for a new debt relief program for Egypt. The traditional approach to debt relief would be through a Paris Club debt rescheduling. The United States could call for the Paris Club to meet to consider Egyptian debt, use its influence to persuade the Egyptians to request a meeting, and then call on its partners to make offers similar to those that President Obama already made in his speech on May 19, 2011. A more promising approach might be for the United States to use its convening power to persuade other countries ("Friends of Egypt") to make debt <b>relief</b> <b>arrangements</b> similar to those that the United States has already offered to Egypt. Complementary to this process, the United States could also urge its partners to make loan guarantees similar to those that it itself has offered. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} public assistance for the Parisian laboring poor and the political turmoil of {{the first years of}} the French Revolution. It examines the immediate connections between the expansion and contraction of welfare benefits for the poor on the one hand and the rise and fall of insurgency on the other. ^ The work of both historians and social workers serves as a point of departure for the study. The second chapter shows the rapidly developing destitution of the able-bodied poor in 1788 and 1789, and the failure of the ancien regime authorities responsible for assisting them to respond effectively to their needs. The third chapter details the role of the Parisian poor in the rising disorder of the early days of the Revolution. At the same time, Chapter III {{describes the}} initial efforts of the new revolutionary authorities, who took over the responsibilities of the royal government and rapidly increased the number of men receiving assistance in public workshops (ateliers de charite). The fourth chapter considers the systematic expansion of public assistance which had begun only haltingly in the summer of 1789. It also explores the changing pattern of the conditions under which relief was given. Chapter V describes the unique institutional arrangements (ateliers de filature) for able-bodied women. From archival records, an in depth portrait of the recipients, the female laboring poor, emerges. Historians have rarely studied the female laboring poor, and the socio-economic data presented in this chapter offers many new insights into their origins and occupations. Similarly Chapter VI describes the men enrolled and the various aspects of their life in the ateliers de filature such as work projects, wage rates, occupation, and crime and fraud. The last chapter studies the use of the public workshops for men to restore order. It summarizes the imposition of restrictive <b>relief</b> <b>arrangements</b> when the public workshops were closed. ^ The period from 1788 through 1791 demonstrates a complete cycle of relief giving from social crisis and liberalization to the return of order and the contraction of benefits, and it amply demonstrates that changes in welfare policy have a political dimension. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{high level}} of private health {{expenditures}} - mainly out of pocket payments - are reported in Greece (about 45 % of total health expenditure) and {{have been at the}} centre of the scientific discussion throughout the health sector. This is a paradox, because of the, theoretically universal coverage of the population by the public system and the low level of cost- sharing arrangements. Study objective: The objective of this study, is to analyze the private financing flows in the health care sector. Additionally, we attempt to bring to light the kind of health needs that the public system cannot meet qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Furthermore, we examine the population attitudes about using the social insurance provisions and the tax <b>relief</b> <b>arrangements,</b> concerning out of pocket (health) payments. Methodology: The study sample covers the whole country and includes 1. 616 households. A special questionnaire was developed in order to gather (by telephone interviews) the data. The SPSS statistical program and linear and logistic regressions have been used for data processing. Main results: 1) The major percentage of households health expenditure was allocated to Outpatient Services, that means € 4. 180 mill., or 68 % of total out of pocket payments, for the year 2005. Dental care and Medical care absorb € 1. 912 mill. and € 1. 430 mill., respectively (Physicians: € 829, 4 mill., Gynecologists: € 300, 3 mill., Surgeons: € 271, 7 mill., Neurologists- psychiatrists: € 28, 6 mill). None of the social and the economic characteristics of the households are correlated with the amount of money paid to dentists. 2) Less than 8 % (€ 484 mill.) of net household health expenditure was allocated to private hospitals. Hospital charges absorb 50 % of this amount, and the rest concerns direct doctor payments (mainly cardiac surgeons). 3) Self - employed nurses (paid by patients) are found only in public hospitals. None of the social and the economic characteristics of the households are correlated with the probability of using and the amount of money paid to this category of nurses. 4) Social security reimbursement was estimated at just 6, 5 % (€ 450 mill.) of the total household health expenditures, for the year 2005. 5) The hidden economy of the health sector was estimated to € 1. 778 mill., for the year 2005, which means 12 % - 13 % of total health expenditure. Only 10 % of this amount (€ 177 mill.) concerns under the table payments, while the rest € 1. 601 mill., represents usual payments to private doctors without a receipt (not taxed). 6) Only 17, 6 % of the potentially eligible for tax exception health expenditure, is reported by households, in their tax returns. 7) State loss for reimbursing households health expenditure was estimated to € 1. 172 mill., for the year 2005 (social security reimbursement: € 450 mill., tax revenues loss due to tax evasion: € 622 mill., tax relief : € 100 mill.) ...|$|E
40|$|Throughout history {{governments have}} had to confront {{the problem of how}} to deal with the poorer parts of their population. During the medieval and early modern period this {{responsibility}} was largely borne by religious institutions, civic institutions and individual charity. By the eighteenth century, however, the rapid social and economic changes brought about by industrialisation put these systems under intolerable strain, forcing radical new solutions to be sought to address both old and new problems of health care and poor relief. This volume looks at how northern European governments of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries coped with the needs of the poor, whilst balancing any new measures against the perceived negative effects of relief upon the moral wellbeing of the poor and issues of social stability. Taken together, the essays in this volume chart the varying responses of states, social classes and political theorists towards the great social and economic issue of the age, industrialisation. Its demands and effects undermined the capacity of the old poor <b>relief</b> <b>arrangements</b> to look after those people that the fits and starts of the industrialisation cycle itself turned into paupers. The result was a response that replaced the traditional principle of 'outdoor' relief, with a generally repressive system of 'indoor' relief that lasted until the rise of organised labour forced a more benign approach to the problems of poverty. Although complete in itself, this volume also forms the third of a four-volume survey of health care and poor relief provision between 1500 and 1900, edited by Ole Peter Grell and Andrew Cunningham.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Attorney-General’s Department’s administration of the terms of the Natural Disaster <b>Relief</b> and Recovery <b>Arrangements</b> Ministerial determination. Introduction Australia is exposed to natural disasters on a recurring basis. Prime responsibility for the response to a disaster rests with state and territory governments. Nevertheless, as natural disasters often result in substantial expenditure by state governments, for many years the Commonwealth has provided financial assistance to the states for recovery and reconstruction activities, as well as to support the provision of urgent assistance to disaster affected communities. In the context of its recent inquiry into natural disaster funding arrangements, the Productivity Commission 2 has reported that, over the past decade, the Australian Government has spent around $ 8 billion on post‐ disaster relief and recovery. Another $ 5. 7 billion is expected to be spent over the forward estimates for past natural disaster events. This assistance has been principally provided through the Natural Disaster <b>Relief</b> and Recovery <b>Arrangements</b> (NDRRA). NDRRA is a Ministerial determination administered by Emergency Management Australia (EMA) within the Attorney‐General’s Department (AGD). In addition, for two states, oversight and accountability measures were introduced in early 2011 to supplement the existing NDRRA arrangements following the widespread flooding that occurred in the eastern states and Queensland tropical cyclones over the 2010 – 11 Australian spring and summer seasons. These measures were seen as prudent given preliminary estimates had indicated that the Australian Government would need to contribute $ 5. 6 billion to the rebuilding of flood‐affected regions, to be funded under NDRRA. The additional measures were reflected in separate National Partnership Agreements (NPAs) signed with the Queensland and Victorian state governments. Of note was that the NPAs enabled the establishment of the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate (the Inspectorate) to undertake reviews of reconstruction projects. The objective of the audit was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Attorney‐General’s Department’s administration of the terms of the NDRRA Ministerial determination...|$|R

The article presents a study on the actual state of the net of rural roads on loess upland terrain of Mielnica watershed. The analysis, performed on digital spatial data within GIS software, revealed considerable needs for improvements of rural roads on investigated area. Basing on the results, the map of improvement measures has been de-veloped, presenting a spatial base for a decision support system for future land improvements and allocation of economical resources for the mana-gement of rural surface communication network in rural-environmental plans.

Now {{the reader}} may {{rest assured that}} no {{principle}} of art is more absolute than this,--that a composition from which anything can be removed without doing mischief is always so far forth inferior. On this ground, therefore, if on no other, {{there can be no}} question, for a moment, which of the two schools is the greater; although there are many most noble works in the French traceried Gothic, having a sublimity of their own dependent on their extreme richness and grace of line, and for which we may be most grateful to their builders. And, indeed, the superiority of the Surface-Gothic cannot be completely felt, until we compare it with the more degraded Linear schools, as, for instance, with our own English Perpendicular. The ornaments of the Veronese niche, which we have used for our example, are by no means among the best of their school, yet they will serve our purpose for such a comparison. That of its pinnacle is composed of a single upright flowering plant, of which the stem shoots up through the centres of the leaves, and bears a pendent blossom, somewhat like that of the imperial lily. The leaves are thrown back from the stem with singular grace and freedom, and foreshortened, as if by a skilful painter, in the shallow marble <b>relief.</b> Their <b>arrangement</b> is roughly shown in the little woodcut at the side (Fig. XX.); and if the reader will simply try the experiment for himself,--first, of covering a piece of paper with crossed lines, as if for accounts, and filling all the interstices with any foliation that comes into his head, as in Figure XIX. above; and then, of trying to fill the point of a gable with a piece of leafage like that in Figure XX. above, putting the figure itself aside,--he will presently find that more thought and invention are required to design this single minute pinnacle, than to cover acres of ground with English perpendicular.|$|R

More reporters followed to cover the battle, and the term [...] "Hamburger Hill" [...] became widely used. The U.S. brigade commander ordered a coordinated two-battalion assault for May 18, [...] 1/506th attacking from the south and 3/187th attacking from the north, trying to keep the 29th NVA Regiment from concentrating on either battalion. Fighting to within [...] of the summit, Delta Company 3/187th nearly carried the hill but experienced severe casualties, including all of its officers. The battle was one of close combat, with the two sides exchanging small arms and grenade fire within [...] of one another. From a light observation helicopter, the battalion commander attempted to coordinate the movements of the other companies into a final assault, but an exceptionally intense thunderstorm reduced visibility to zero and ended the fighting. Unable to advance, 3/187 again withdrew down the mountain. The three converging companies of 1/506th struggled to take Hill 900, the southern crest of the mountain, encountering heavy opposition {{for the first time in}} the battle. Because of the heavy casualties already sustained by his units and under pressure from the unwanted attention of the press, Zais seriously considered discontinuing the attack but decided otherwise. Both the corps commander and the MACV commander, General Creighton W. Abrams, publicly supported the decision. Zais decided to commit three fresh battalions to the battle and to have one of them relieve the 3/187th in place. The 3/187th's losses had been severe, with approximately 320 killed or wounded, including more than sixty percent of the 450 experienced troops who had assaulted into the valley. Two of its four company commanders and eight of twelve platoon leaders had become casualties. The battalion commander of the 2/506th, Lt. Col. Gene Sherron, arrived at Honeycutt's CP on the afternoon of May 18 to coordinate the relief. 3/187th was flying out its latest casualties, and its commander had not yet been informed of the <b>relief.</b> Before any <b>arrangements</b> were made, Zais landed and was confronted by Honeycutt, who argued that his battalion was still combat effective. After a sharp confrontation, Zais relented, although he assigned one of Sherron's companies to Honeycutt as reinforcement for the assault.|$|R

Brojen (Deepankar De), the managing director of a tea estate and Bimal's friend, irritates everyone, especially Nirmal (Sabyasachi Chakrabarty), with his stories of his guru's miracles and his over-enthusiasm for food. Anita keeps trying to convince Shyamal (Parambrata Chatterjee), her brother-in-law and Sunita (Raima Sen), to see each other. Shyamal and Sunita grow to like each other and Anita enthusiastically declares the alliance to Bimal. Meanwhile, torrential rain makes it impossible for Ram, the servant, to get much food from the nearly closed market. That night the rain stops. Suddenly, all the inmates of the house are jolted out of their sleeps by a terrible earthquake. Power is cut off and most of the things inside the house are broken. Nirmal goes out to discover that Ram's house and orchard have been destroyed in a landslide. The next morning they discover that the wooden bridge which connected them to the world was lying broken. Soon, there is serious shortage of food. Tempers flare as Nirmal and Brojen have a wild argument. Nirmal tries to climb down the mountain to get help, slips and injures himself but saved by Shyamal. Meanwhile, Brojen starts to have optical illusions. He demands more food, which leaves Anita fasting. Nirmal is infuriated by the gesture of Brojen and insults him for being insensitive and an uninvited guest who is a burden to them in this hour of crisis. Anita becomes weak and even faints. Shyamal tries to climb down the mountain alone, but his nerves fail when he sees a dead body stuck in the rocks. He sees Anita drink the water washing a milk powder packet. Nirmal shouts at Brojen insulting him sorely. Anita and Shyamal try to control him but fail. Anita cries out in anger to reveal the truth behind their apparently happy marriage. Brojen, driven nearly insane by hunger, tries to walk out during the night. Shyamal has to knock him unconscious to bring him back to his room. Sunita feeds her share of rice to Anita who tells her not to trust anyone, Brojen on Shyamal. Bimal contemplates suicide with sleeping pills. Everyone is shocked out of their respective stupors by the sounds of gunshots. Nirmal shoots birds in the hope of roasting them.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this audit {{was to examine the}} effectiveness of the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate, supported by the National Disaster Recovery Taskforce, in providing assurance that value for money is being achieved in respect to Queensland reconstruction projects. Overall conclusion The flooding that occurred in Queensland during {{the spring and summer of}} 2010 – 11 was widespread. Reconstruction was expected to be expensive, with the latest (February 2013) data available estimating the cost of the resulting damage to be more than $ 7 billion. A significant proportion of reconstruction expenditure is expected to be paid for through the Natural Disaster <b>Relief</b> and Recovery <b>Arrangements</b> (NDRRA), which provide for the Australian Government to meet up to 75 per cent of the cost of reconstruction. Value for money review processes were an important element of the additional oversight and accountability mechanisms introduced, given the significant financial assistance that was expected to be provided to Queensland under NDRRA. In this respect, a reasonable start has been made on the Inspectorate’s planned program of 129 project reviews, with 81 projects selected for review and 70 Tier One reviews 8 completed by the Taskforce as at the end of March 2013. However, many of the completed reviews are provisional assessments based on early project estimates, and further assessment will be required once tender results and project progress reports are available and/or projects are completed. In addition, progress with the reviews has been slower than planned (as the aim had been to select the projects and complete all 129 reviews by 31 December 2012). This situation reflects some delays with the delivery of the reconstruction program by state and local government agencies, challenges that have been experienced by the Taskforce in obtaining and analysing project information, as well as some shortcomings in the Taskforce’s sampling procedures. The purpose of the value for money project assessments was to compile a representative sample that could be used to make judgements about the reconstruction program as a whole. Reporting by QRA and the Inspectorate has outlined that there has been significant reconstruction progress but the project level information obtained by the Taskforce has indicated delays across the reconstruction program. Queensland has been granted a 12 month extension to the allowable period under NDRRA in which to complete reconstruction work. There has also been little in the way of project progress reports provided to the Taskforce to enable it to monitor the delivery of the individual projects it has sampled. In these circumstances, and given the situation with the planned program of project reviews, it is too early to reliably extrapolate the findings to the reconstruction program. Notwithstanding this situation, it is evident that, for a relatively modest investment given the expected cost to the Australian Government of reconstruction activity, the establishment of the Inspectorate with the support of the Taskforce to conduct value for money reviews has been effective in providing the Australian Government with greater visibility and more timely assurance concerning reconstruction expenditure than would have occurred under NDRRA. This is because NDRRA generally operates on a reimbursement basis, with the Australian Government having little oversight of reconstruction as it occurs as there is no reporting from the states until such time as they seek reimbursement, which is commonly some years after the disasters occur. In addition, limited Australian Government oversight at the conclusion of reconstruction is afforded by the audited claims submitted by states and territories, with no project level information provided in these claims. In this context, the experience to date of the project level scrutiny provided by the Inspectorate and the Taskforce (which have identified potential reductions in NDRRA claims from Queensland totalling more than $ 100 million) is likely to be beneficial in informing the approach adopted by Emergency Management Australia in its ongoing administration of NDRRA in respect to natural disasters that occur in other states and territories. It also underlines for other Commonwealth agencies the potential benefits of closely considering arrangements for assuring information provided by the states and territories, where this information determines the amount of Commonwealth payments. In addition to providing greater insights into the nature and estimated cost of reconstruction work, the Inspectorate’s value for money reviews have identified issues concerning the eligibility of estimated expenditure in a number of the projects that have been examined. In this respect, in July 2012 a process was agreed on the actions to be taken where the Inspectorate determines that a project does not represent value for money. Specifically, the Inspectorate may recommend to the Attorney-General that the Commonwealth’s reimbursement under NDRRA reflect the likely cost of the project had value for money been achieved, rather than the actual project costs incurred. As at the time of completing the audit fieldwork, there have been no projects that the Inspectorate has determined do not represent value for money although, for a number of projects, the Inspectorate has written to QRA identifying items of estimated expenditure that it considered should not be claimed under NDRRA. In addition, in March 2013 the Inspectorate wrote to QRA, the Auditor-General of Queensland, and EMA recommending that the state not be reimbursed for profit margins in respect to reconstruction projects undertaken by RoadTek, a state government entity. To increase the benefits that are derived from the program of value for money reviews, the ANAO has made four recommendations. The first two recommendations are aimed at the Taskforce obtaining information that allows the project reviews to examine the scope and cost of works actually being delivered (rather than early estimates) and improvements to the application of the sampling approach to make it more representative of the reconstruction program. The remaining two recommendations relate, respectively, to improvements in the approach taken by the Taskforce to: scrutinising the cost of delivering reconstruction projects; and stronger oversight of the timeliness of the delivery of reconstruction work...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate, supported by the National Disaster Recovery Taskforce, in providing assurance that value for money is being achieved in flood recovery and reconstruction expenditure in Victoria. Key findings:The flooding that occurred in Victoria over the 2010 – 11 summer was widespread. Reconstruction was expected to be expensive, with the latest (December 2012) data available from Victoria estimating the cost to the state of the resulting damage to be in the vicinity of $ 1 billion. A significant proportion of reconstruction expenditure is expected to be met by the Australian Government through the Natural Disaster <b>Relief</b> and Recovery <b>Arrangements</b> (NDRRA). With the stated intention of ensuring recovery and rebuilding could start as soon as possible, a significant advance payment was made in 2010 – 11 to Victoria ($ 500 million). The advance payment also assisted the Australian Government to secure the agreement of Victoria to the additional oversight and accountability measures announced by the Prime Minister in early February 2012, which were then included in the NPA. The conduct of value for money project reviews by the Inspectorate was expected to provide a greater level of oversight and assurance concerning reconstruction expenditure than would have occurred relying solely on NDRRA, which provides for the Australian Government to meet up to 75 per cent of the cost of reconstruction. This is because NDRRA generally operates on a reimbursement basis, with the Australian Government having little oversight of reconstruction as it occurs as there is no reporting from the states until such time as they seek reimbursement, which is commonly some years after the disasters occur. In addition, limited Australian Government oversight at the conclusion of reconstruction is afforded by audited claims submitted by states and territories, with no project level information provided in these claims. NDRRA also does not include value for money assurance arrangements. Monthly reports from Victoria to the Taskforce indicate that recovery and reconstruction in flood-affected areas is well underway. However, to date, the creation of the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate has not provided the Australian Government with the expected assurance that value for money is being achieved through Victorian reconstruction projects. This is because, as at December 2012, no value for money reviews have been completed in respect to any Victorian projects, and a review of one project had only recently commenced. In this context, in November 2012, the Inspectorate wrote to Victoria stating that: The Inspectorate is also troubled that, more than 18 months after the disaster events, it has been unable to complete a value for money assessment on any Victorian project. In comparison, the National Disaster Recovery Taskforce, on behalf of the Inspectorate, has completed 61 value for money reviews of Queensland reconstruction projects. 8 In addition, in January 2013 the Taskforce advised the ANAO that this issue {{has been the subject of}} discussion between the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C), in the context of Victoria’s request for an extension of the timeframe for NDRRA funding. In this respect, in December 2012 the Chair of the Inspectorate wrote to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government raising this issue and recommending that any extension to funding arrangements in Victoria be contingent upon the Inspectorate being provided with sufficient projects to be able to provide the required level of assurance. The Minister responded in February 2013, advising that he: shared the Inspectorate’s concerns about its ability to assess value for money in circumstances where only one project had been identified for review; strongly supported the Inspectorate’s recommendation that an extension to the allowable period for reconstruction be contingent upon Victoria’s agreement to increase oversight; and had written to the Attorney-General recommending this approach as responsibility for the extension request rests with Emergency Management Australia. ANAO analysis is that the lack of value for money reviews of Victoria reconstruction projects at the time the ANAO’s audit work was completed reflects that: the Taskforce initially focused its work on developing a review methodology and project sampling processes for Queensland, given this is where the majority of expenditure will occur. There was relatively little attention given at that time, or subsequently, to developing a robust methodology for identifying projects to review in Victoria (proportionate to the level of expenditure expected in that state); and the parties to the NPA intended that the Inspectorate would only examine reconstruction projects with a value more than $ 5  million. Even allowing for this threshold, the Taskforce has not been active in seeking to ensure that projects with a value greater than $ 5  million are identified for value for money review. One project has been identified for review, but it is not representative of the reconstruction program and there is also some evidence that a number of other projects with a value above $ 5  million have proceeded, without being referred to the Taskforce for a value for money review. At the time of preparing this ANAO report, no formal requests had been made to Victoria concerning Inspectorate reviews of these other projects. The audit highlights the importance of greater attention being given to oversighting reconstruction activity in Victoria. The Taskforce is currently funded to continue operating until the end of 2013 (and this date may be extended), thereby providing time for some value for money project reviews to be undertaken in Victoria. However, as reflected in the protocol with Victoria, in order to obtain the maximum benefit, it was intended that the Inspectorate’s review of a project for value for money would be conducted at the development phase of projects, although they can also be undertaken on completion of the project. Notwithstanding advice from both the Taskforce and PM&C that it was intended that the NPA place restrictions on the Inspectorate’s ability to examine projects with a value below $ 5 million, there were opportunities for the Taskforce to have obtained greater insight into reconstruction projects being undertaken in Victoria. In particular: the Taskforce was the lead Australian Government agency in terms of developing the work plans with Queensland and Victoria but, as discussed in the related audit of the development of the work plans with these two states, in many instances the work plan for Victoria identifies broad categories of work rather than specific reconstruction projects; and the operating protocol with Victoria was negotiated by the Taskforce, but this did not require the state to provide and regularly update information on all reconstruction projects (which is the approach taken in Queensland). This would have enabled the Taskforce to identify those projects costing over $ 5 million that the Inspectorate wishes to review. The ANAO recognises that the majority of the expected expenditure under the two NPAs relates to Queensland. Nevertheless, reconstruction activity in Victoria was significant in absolute terms and relative to the amount of natural disaster assistance expenditure typically experienced. Further, additional oversight and assurance through Inspectorate reviews of individual reconstruction projects was anticipated in the agreement reached between the Australian and Victorian Governments. In this context, there was considerable scope for the Taskforce to have more actively supported the work of the Inspectorate. In addition, whereas the Inspectorate has endorsed the value for money strategy applied by the Queensland Reconstruction Authority (QRA) to projects in that state prior to a project being reviewed by the Taskforce, similar work has not been undertaken in respect to Victoria. These different circumstances place added importance on value for money project reviews being undertaken by the Taskforce of Victorian reconstruction projects in the remaining lifetime of the Inspectorate. Accordingly, the ANAO has recommended improved arrangements for conducting value for money reviews of Victorian reconstruction projects...|$|R
