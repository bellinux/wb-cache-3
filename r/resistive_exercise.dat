40|$|Introduction: Some losses {{resulting}} from aging can be minimized with {{the practice of}} <b>resistive</b> <b>exercises.</b> Objective: To analyze the effects of <b>resistive</b> <b>exercises</b> on flexibility, mobility, muscle strength and balance in the elderly. Method: Twenty elderly individuals were divided between an activity group (AG, n= 10; 66. 1 ± 6. 35 years) and a control group (CG, n= 10; 65. 4 ± 7. 54 years). Mobility, flexibility, muscle strength and balance were evaluated. The AG participated in the training for 13 weeks (one-hour sessions, twice a week). The Wilcoxon non-parametric test (intra-group analysis) was {{used to analyze the}} data. A significance level of 5 % (p< 0. 05) was adopted.

Before and after 25 and 52 days of strict horizontal bed rest, arterial diameter, blood flow, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation were measured by echo Doppler ultrasound. In the BR-Ctrl group, the diameter of the common femoral artery decreased by 13 +/- 3 % after 25 and 17 +/- 1 % after 52 days of bed rest (P < 0. 001). In the BR-RVE group this decrease in diameter was significantly attenuated (5 +/- 2 % after 25 days and 6 +/- 2 % after 52 days, P < 0. 01 vs. BR-Ctrl). Baseline blood flow did not change after bed rest in either group. After 52 days of bed rest, FMD and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation of the superficial femoral artery were increased in both groups, possibly by increased nitric oxide sensitivity.
