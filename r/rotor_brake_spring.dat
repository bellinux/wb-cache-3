500|$|The CH-47Fs have {{generally}} similar performance to the CH-47Ds. However, the F variant {{was designed to}} be easier to maintain and deploy. Its fuselage comprises a small number of machined components, rather than the large number of fabricated sections of sheet metal used in the D variant, which reduces vibration and structural cracking. The F variant also includes more advanced avionics as well as design features which enable the helicopters to be more quickly prepared to be transported within a cargo aircraft. The first seven Australian CH-47Fs are fitted with <b>rotor</b> <b>brakes</b> and other equipment to better enable them to operate from the Royal Australian Navy's Canberra class landing helicopter dock vessels, but are otherwise identical to those operated by the US Army. The second tranche of three CH-47Fs are not fitted with <b>rotor</b> <b>brakes</b> as they were taken directly from the production line of helicopters for the US Army. As of 2017, it was planned to fit these helicopters with <b>rotor</b> <b>brakes</b> by 2020.|$|R

Although the engineer gives priority for safety measure, but most consumers still have inadequate of knowledge in safety system. Thus safety is the first important thing we must focus. This paper is presented with “Thermal analysis of Disc <b>Brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> with slot shape optimization ” which studies about on disc <b>brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> by analysis of different shapes of slots of different vehicle’s Disc <b>Brake</b> <b>Rotor.</b> Therefore, we can optimize number of shapes of slots to estimate the good thermal conductivity of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>Rotor.</b> In this paper, Thermal analysis done on real model of Disc <b>Brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> of Bajaj Pulsar 220 and Thermal analysis of disc <b>brake</b> <b>Rotor</b> of different shapes of slots of different vehicle’s in one Disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Different shapes of slots are because of to reduce the weight of disc rotor and for good thermal conductivity.

50|$|A conical <b>rotor</b> <b>brake</b> motor {{incorporates}} the brake {{as an integral}} part of the conical sliding rotor. When the motor is at rest, a spring acts on the sliding rotor and forces the brake ring against the brake cap in the motor, holding the rotor stationary. When the motor is energized, its magnetic field generates both an axial and a radial component. The axial component overcomes the spring force, releasing the brake; while the radial component causes the rotor to turn. There is no additional brake control required.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} automotive ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Disc <b>brakes</b> operate {{on the principle of}} friction by converting kinetic energy into heat energy. The main objective of a disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> is to store this heat energy and dissipate it as soon as possible. This work is carried out in a area where there is very limited understanding. Commercial CFD code FLUENT was used for carrying out the simulations with the rotor rotating in still air. Only one passage and blade were simulated as all the rotor passages were identical. Uniform temperatures were used on the rotor to simulate the braking condition. Sixteen different blade angle sets were simulated and the range of blade angles having the best aero-thermal performance were identified using mass flow rate, rate of heat dissipation and temperature uniformity as performance metrics. The effect of rotational speed and rotor temperature (corresponding to various braking conditions) on the aero-thermal performance was evaluated. The rotor speed and temperature were observed to have significant effect on the rotor performance. The number of blades in the ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> was also varied and was observed {{to have an impact on}} the aero-thermal performance of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Detailed design changes like inlet chamfer, blade leading edge rounding, and variable thickness blade and passage aspect ratio were incorporated. All these changes did have an effect on the aero-thermal performance of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> The inlet chamfer and the leading edge rounding improved both the rate of heat transfer and the temperature uniformity. The variable thickness blade and the lower aspect ratio passage improved the temperature uniformity of the rotor...|$|R
